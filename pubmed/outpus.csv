MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network) is an integral part of a project against chronic diseases which it is focused on active and healthy aging and is supported by the European Union. It forms the third phase of ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) in which, through a mobile app on a smart device, the purpose is to guide patients in the control of their multimorbidity, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or asthma. The ""Allergy Diary"" app by MACVIA-ARIA is free and it is available for Android and iOS; on it, patients indicate how unpleasant the symptoms are on a daily basis through five screens with an analogous visual scale; two more screens were recently added (sleep affectation). With the app, it is also possible to download the information of the ""Allergy Diary"" on the physician's computer through a QR code at the moment of the medical consultation. In this article, we review the first year of experience in Spain, Mexico and Argentina, where the Spanish version is used. Aunque existen guías clínicas de alta calidad sobre rinitis alérgica, numerosos pacientes reciben tratamiento deficiente, en parte debido al alto grado de automedicación.

The predominant feature is vomit from one to four hours after consuming the causal food. An 8-month-old boy, with no family history of allergy, with a personal pathological history of allergy to cow's milk protein. At 7 months of age, he had acute gastroenteritis with mixed shock and, at 8 months of age, he had acute gastroenteritis and moderate dehydration. In both episodes, he had eaten rice before the symptoms started. When infectious etiology and other causes of vomit and dehydration were ruled out, the diagnosis of FPIES, which is secondary to rice protein, was made and confirmed with a patch test. FPIES should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent gastroenteritis, especially in severe cases without an identified infectious cause.

El síntoma principal son los vómitos una a cuatro horas después del consumo del alimento causal. Caso clínico: Varón de ocho meses, sin antecedentes heredofamiliares de alergia, con antecedentes personales patológicos de alergia a la proteína de la leche de vaca. A los siete meses había presentado gastroenteritis aguda con choque mixto y a los ocho meses, gastroenteritis aguda y deshidratación moderada; en ambos eventos hubo consumo de arroz previo al inicio de los síntomas. Al descartar etiología infecciosa y otras causas de vómitos y deshidratación, se formuló el diagnóstico de síndrome de enterocolitis inducida por proteínas de los alimentos, secundario a proteína de arroz, que se corroboró con prueba de parche.

The prevalence of AR was 9.0% (95% CI = 7.8% - 10.4%); the frequency was higher in women (6.7% versus 11.1%, p = 0.001). The symptoms of rhinitis plus conjunctivitis predominated in women (16.0% versus 23.1%, p < 0.0001). The prevalence of AD was 5.2% (95% CI = 4.3% - 6.2%) and, once again, it was more frequent in women (7.7% versus 2.4%, p < 0.0001). The main factors associated with AR and AD were the female gender and a history of family atopic allergic diseases (p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of AR and AD according to gender in late adolescents; women were most affected. In addition, a history of family atopic allergic diseases was another risk factor that was linked to both diseases. Antecedentes: En México son escasos los estudios encaminados a establecer la prevalencia de la rinitis alérgica y la dermatitis atópica en adolescentes tardíos. Objetivo: Determinar la prevalencia de rinitis alérgica y dermatitis atópica en adolescentes tardíos y compararla conforme el sexo. Métodos: Estudio transversal de 1992 adolescentes de 15 a 18 años, reclutados mediante muestreo probabilístico por conglomerados, estratificado y aleatorizado. Las prevalencias de rinitis alérgica y dermatitis atópica se identificaron con el cuestionario propuesto en The Internacional Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Resultados: Se incluyeron 1056 mujeres (53 %) y 936 hombres (47 %). La prevalencia de rinitis alérgica fue de 9.0 % (IC 95 % = 7.8-10.4); la frecuencia fue mayor en las mujeres (6.7 % versus 11.1 %, p = 0.001). Los síntomas de rinitis más conjuntivitis predominaron en las mujeres (16.0 % versus 23.1 %, p < 0.0001). La prevalencia de dermatitis atópica fue de 5.2 % (IC 95 % = 4.3-6.2); fue más frecuente en las mujeres (7.7 % versus 2.4 %, p < 0.0001). Los principales factores asociados con rinitis alérgica y dermatitis atópica fueron sexo femenino y atopia familiar (p < 0.001). Conclusiones: Se registró diferencia significativa en la prevalencia de rinitis alérgica y dermatitis atópica conforme el sexo en los adolescentes tardíos; las mujeres fueron las más afectadas. La atopia familiar fue otro factor asociado. "

Yet concepts of positive health include attributes beyond the absence of disease, such as participation, resilience, and happiness. To study positive health outcomes - an endeavor that has much merit in light of the developmental plasticity children possess - we should use measures that explicitly and more fully encompass the many facets of well-being. Otherwise, we risk simply rebranding negative disease as positive health by providing it a new name. "

FVR acted as one substrate as well as an acidifier by the acids contained in FVR. It was found that the organic acids in FVR could efficiently enhance the hydrolysis of lignocellulose in CS. The biomethane production from co-digestion of FVR and CS pretreated reached 140.48 L/kg VS, which was 35.7% higher than that of unpretreated mixture substrates. The highest biomethane production was obtained when pretreatment was conducted at 150 °C. The increase of biomethane production was contributed to the improved hydrolysis of CS due to the acidic pretreatment. Pretreatment and co-digestion could improve the asynchronism and generate synergistic effect. The study provides one novel method for efficient biomethane conversion from FVR and CS. "

However, these patients should also be assessed during more demanding tasks in order to appreciate their true functionality. The forward lunge (FL) is a motor task commonly used in clinics to evaluate functional recovery after knee replacement surgery. Unfortunately, clear evidence comparing FL kinematics between patients with UKA and TKA is still missing. The purpose of this study was to compare hip and knee joint kinematics during the FL between patients with UKA, TKA and controls. Twenty subjects (8 TKA, 6 UKA, 6 controls) underwent 3D motion analysis during a FL. Differences in hip and knee kinematics between groups were identified using statistical parametric mapping. We concluded that patients with TKA demonstrated reduced knee and hip flexion angles during the loaded phase of the FL, which could have been an attempt to unload the knee joint. This is in contrast to patients with UKA, who showed similar knee and hip joint kinematics compared to controls throughout the entire FL. It seems that retaining the cruciate ligaments is beneficial for the execution of a complex motor task such as the FL. "

We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov state-transition model over a time horizon of 60 months in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients with active malignancy and first acute symptomatic CAT who were eligible to receive either rivaroxaban/edoxaban or dalteparin. We obtained transition probability, relative risk, cost, and utility inputs from the literature. We estimated the differential impact on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient and performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results. Using the base-case analysis over 60 months, DOAC versus dalteparin was associated with an incremental cost reduction of $24,129 with an incremental QALY reduction of 0.04. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the cost of dalteparin contributed the most to the incremental cost difference; relative risk of death related to underlying cancer contributed the most of the incremental QALY difference. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case analysis, with a large reduction in cost but small reduction in QALYs. Rivaroxaban or edoxaban as compared to dalteparin is cost saving from a payer's perspective for the treatment of CAT. Professional organizations and healthcare systems may want to consider this analysis in future practice recommendations. "

However, its pathogenic role in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the expression and clinical significance of IL-25 in patients with SLE as well as its pathogenic role in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice. The results showed that IL-25 mRNA and serum levels were increased in patients with SLE compared with those in healthy controls. Higher IL-25 mRNA and serum levels were found in patients with an active disease. IL-25 levels were positively associated with SLEDAI, anti-dsDNA, and IgG but negatively associated with C3 and C4. Ex vivo assay showed that IL-25 could inhibit the production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-17, IL-6, and IFN-γ as well as TNF-α in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients with SLE. In vivo studies revealed that treatment with IL-25 significantly ameliorated lupus symptoms in lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice by suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-17A, and IFN-β. Cumulatively, our results suggest that IL-25 levels are increased in patients with SLE and associated with disease activity; IL-25 plays a potent immunosuppressive role in the pathogenesis of SLE by suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines.

Whole aneurysms were taken from seventeen patients undergoing elective surgery and cut into a couple of specimens per quadrant and direction. The specimens were subjected to delamination- and tensile-testing, from which average peel tension (=delamination strength) and failure stress (=tensile strength) were assessed. Histology revealed no differences with region and direction in the roughness of the delaminated surfaces of the inner (intima with most of media) and outer layers (leftover media with adventitia). Compared to the right, the left lateral region exhibited significantly higher thickness and peel tension in both directions, but lower failure stress of the inner and outer layers longitudinally. Failure stress of the inner layers mostly but also of the outer layers was significantly higher circumferentially than longitudinally, with significantly higher values for the outer compared to the inner layers. Differing heterogeneity was evidenced in the delamination and tensile strength of aneurysmal tissue, with important implications for dissection propagation. Particularly, the increased resistance to propagation in the left lateral region helps address the question why part of the circumference, characteristically the right lateral wall, is involved by the dissection and the other part of the aortic wall remains intact. The deterioration of delamination strength with aging suggests the greater potential of aged individuals for dissection propagation. "

One possible direction to overcome this issue is the development of a cell-embedded 'event recorder' system, whereby molecular and phenotypic information of a cell(s) can be obtained at the time of observation with their past event information stored in 'heritable polymers' of the same cell. This concept has been demonstrated by many synthetic cellular circuits that monitor and transmit a certain set of environmental and intracellular signals into DNA, and have now been further accelerated by recent CRISPR-related technologies. Notably, the discovery of the RT-Cas1-Cas2 system, which acquires sequences of cellular transcripts into a specific host genomic region, has enabled recording of a broader range of molecular profile histories in the DNA tapes of cells, to understand the dynamics of complex biological processes that cannot be addressed by current technologies.

No changes (P > .05) were observed for the moisture retention, diameter reduction, and cooking loss of the treatments, with a significant increase in the lipid retention (P < .05). Hardness increased (P < .05) with increasing the lipid replacement level, and a significant color difference (ΔE) was detected between the treatments and the control. In addition to reducing animal fat, a healthier fatty acid profile was reached after the lipid reformulation of the burgers, thus allowing the burgers to be labeled with health claims. The sensory tests (acceptance and Check-All-That-Apply) indicated that it is possible to replace up to 60% of pork back fat by HE. "

Those treaties are the UN drugs conventions. Following cannabis legalisation, then, can Canada remain in compliance with the CRC while breaching treaties to which Article 33 expressly refers? This article investigates this question with reference to the drafting of the CRC and the drugs conventions, how the relationship between the two systems has been approached, and the practice of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from 1993-2015. While the CRC could offer an alternative framework through which to critically assess drug laws and policies, by and large it has operated so as to reinforce the drug control system. An interpretation of Article 33 in the light of Canada's cannabis reforms is proposed. Based on the text of the provision, the pacta tertiis rule, and the object and purpose of the provision, it decouples the CRC from the normative requirements of the drugs conventions. "

Six policy documents from Canada and Scotland produced in the years 2000 and 2001 were systematically sampled from 42 known documents. A poststructural content analysis adapted from the work of Maarten Hajer and mapped onto an analytic frame derived from Nikolas Rose's Governing the Soul: The Shaping of the Private Self is conducted. Within the years considered, drug policy texts from Scotland signaled a more punitive approach to drug use and a less socially inclusive approach to people who used drugs than drug policy texts from Canada. The differences in policy directions identified were in keeping with a priori interpretations of each country's broad approach to illicit drug use and to the social inclusion of the illicit drug user, if not to social inclusion itself. Methodologically, combining the approaches of Hajer and Rose proved complimentary and useful as well as promising for future application to the content analysis of public discourse. "

The Swedish Quality Register of Gynaecologic Cancer was used for identification. To ensure quality and conformity of data and to disclose patients not yet registered, hospital registries were reviewed and validated. Cox and propensity score regression analysis and univariable and multivariable regression analysis were performed in regard to OS and DFS. There were 864 women (236 open and 628 robotic) included in the study. The 5-year OS was 92% and 94% and DFS was 84% and 88% for the open and robotic cohorts, respectively. The recurrence pattern was similar in both groups. Using propensity score analysis and matched cohorts of 232 women in each surgical group, no significant differences were seen in survival: 5-year OS of 92% in both groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-2.01) and DFS of 85% vs 84% in the open and robotic cohort, respectively (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.66-1.78). In univariable and multivariable analysis with OS as the end-point, no significant factors were found, and in regard to DFS, tumour size (p < 0.001) and grade 3 (p = 0.02) were found as independent significant risk factors.

Between September 2011 and January 2018, pretherapy plasma samples were collected from 155 patients treated with second- or third-line cabazitaxel at standard or reduced dose in different biomarker protocols. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction was used to identify plasma AR gain and normal samples. The primary objective was to evaluate associations of plasma AR status with treatment outcome. In an exploratory analysis, a comparison between plasma AR and treatment type was investigated by incorporating updated data from our prior study of 85 post-docetaxel patients receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide. We observed a shorter median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in AR-gained compared to AR-normal patients (OS 10.5 versus 14.1 months, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-2.13, P = 0.064 and PFS 4.0 versus 5.0 months, HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.05-2.07, P = 0.024).

However, the relevance of plasma AR status in the context of cabazitaxel therapy is unknown. Between September 2011 and January 2018, pretherapy plasma samples were collected from 155 patients treated with second- or third-line cabazitaxel at standard or reduced dose in different biomarker protocols. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction was used to identify plasma AR gain and normal samples. The primary objective was to evaluate associations of plasma AR status with treatment outcome. In an exploratory analysis, a comparison between plasma AR and treatment type was investigated by incorporating updated data from our prior study of 85 post-docetaxel patients receiving abiraterone or enzalutamide. We observed a shorter median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in AR-gained compared to AR-normal patients (OS 10.5 versus 14.1 months, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-2.13, P = 0.064 and PFS 4.0 versus 5.0 months, HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.05-2.07, P = 0.024). In patients with mCRPC receiving second-line therapies, a significant treatment interaction was observed between plasma AR and cabazitaxel versus AR-directed therapies for OS (P = 0.041) but not PFS (P = 0.244). In an exploratory analysis, AR-gained patients treated with initial reduced dose of cabazitaxel had a significantly shorter median OS (7.3 versus 11.5 months, HR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.13-3.38, P = 0.016) and PFS (2.7 versus 5.0 months, HR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.39-3.71, P = 0.001).

Patients (n = 1019) were randomised 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 weeks (total of 18 doses, ∼1 year). At 1.25-year median follow-up, pembrolizumab prolonged relapse-free survival (RFS) in the total population (1-year RFS rate: 75.4% vs 61.0%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; logrank P < 0.0001) and consistently in the AJCC-7 subgroups.

Because some mutations are restricted to specific ethnic-geographic groups, we studied the prevalence and spectrum of GJB2/GJB6 mutations in deaf patients originating from two different Algerian regions, Kabylie and Sahara. Among 91 reportedly unrelated Algerian patients affected by prelingual deafness, 80 patients (41 from Kabylie and 39 from Sahara) were diagnosed with isolated deafness. All had profound deafness, except one patient with mild deafness. They were screened for the presence of GJB2 mutations by direct sequencing of the single coding exon of GJB2. Patients without mutations were then screened for the presence of the most frequent two deletions of GJB6: del(GJB6-D13S1854) and del(GJB6-D13S1830). Causative mutations were found in 13 and 8 patients from Kabylie and Sahara, respectively, accounting for more than a quarter of the cohort. The c.35delG, p.Gly12Valfs*2 mutation remains the most important mutation both in Kabylie (10 patients) and Sahara (7 patients). All detected patients were homozygous for this mutation. In addition, two other mutations (c.139G > T, p.Glu47* and c.167delT, p.Leu56Argfs*26) were found homozygous in one family each, and two patients were compound heterozygotes for (c.35delG p.Gly12Valfs*2/c.139G > T, p.Glu47*). No deletion of GJB6 was detected. We confirm that mutations in GJB2, mainly c.35delG, are one of the most prevalent causes of nonsyndromic congenital deafness in Algeria, whereas the del (GJB6-D13S1854) and del (GJB6-D13S1830) deletions of GJB6 contribute little, if any. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of deafness in other patients without diagnostic. "

However, the precise mechanisms of this elevation are unknown. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is one of the transcription factors inducing the expression of APPs and is activated by several cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6). The aim of this study was to determine whether AsA deficiency stimulates hepatic STAT3 activation and increases intestinal production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Male ODS rats (6 weeks old) were fed either a basal diet containing 300 mg AsA/kg (control group) or an AsA-free diet (AsA-deficient group) for 18 days. AsA deficiency gradually and simultaneously elevated both mRNA levels of APPs (haptoglobin, α1-acid glycoprotein, C-reactive protein and α2-macroglobulin) and nuclear level of phosphorylated STAT3 (activated STAT3) in the liver. These results showed that the AsA-deficiency-induced expression of hepatic APPs is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines activating STAT3. On day 14, AsA deficiency significantly elevated IL-6 mRNA level in the ileum and the concentration of IL-6 in portal blood. Furthermore, the portal concentration of IL-6 positively correlated with hepatic mRNA levels of STAT3-regulated genes. These findings suggest that IL-6, produced in the intestine as a result of AsA deficiency, is recruited to the liver via the portal vein and contributes to hepatic STAT3 activation and the elevated expression of APPs.

Indirect calorimetry showed that ginger administration significantly increased the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) and heat production in both diet models. Furthermore, ginger administration corrected the HFD-induced changes in concentrations of intermediates in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Moreover, ginger enhanced brown adipose tissue function and activated white adipose tissue browning by altering the gene expression and protein levels of some brown and beige adipocyte-selective markers. Additionally, stimulation of the browning program by ginger may be partly regulated by the sirtuin-1 (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) pathway. Taken together, these results indicate that dietary ginger prevents body weight gain by remodeling whole-body energy metabolism and inducing browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Thus, ginger is an edible plant that plays a role in the therapeutic treatment of obesity and related disorders. "

Regardless of the numerous environmental impacts that these pesticides generate during their production, their dosage as pest control agents in vineyards causes an important toxic effect that must be monitored. Copper-based inorganic pesticides are the most widely used agents to control fungal diseases in humid wine-growing regions. It is, however, significant that the environmental analysis of their use through the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology does not provide detailed information on the potential toxicity of this type of pesticides. Hence, most studies report average values for copper characterization factors (CFs), excluding local soil characteristics. The objective of the study was the spatial characterization of the ecotoxicity factors of copper soil emissions as a function of the chemical characteristics of vineyard soils located in Portugal and Galicia (NW Spain). A multiple linear regression model was applied to calculate the comparative toxic potential. Subsequently, CFs for copper were calculated based on spatial differentiation considering the variable properties of the soil within each wine appellation.

Research on seepage has been extensive, but few comprehensive treatments evaluating all aspects relevant to the phenomenon are available. In this work, the current information relevant for understanding the state of seepage from tailings ponds was reviewed. The information suggests the infiltration of OSPW into groundwater occurs near some ponds. OSPW may also be present in sediments beneath the Athabasca River adjacent to one pond, but there are no clear observations of OSPW in the river water. Similarly, most water samples from tributaries also show no evidence of OSPW, but these observations are limited by the lack of systematic, systemic, and repeated surveys, missing baseline data, standard analytical approaches, and reference materials. Waters naturally influenced by bitumen, discharge of saline groundwaters, and dilution also potentially affect the consolidation of information and certainty of any conclusions. Despite these challenges, some data suggest OSPW may be present in two tributaries of the Athabasca River adjacent to tailings ponds: McLean Creek and Lower Beaver River. Irrespective of the possible source(s), constituents of OSPW often affect organisms exposed in laboratories, but research in all but one study suggests the concentrations of organics in the surface water bodies assessed are below the standard toxicological effect thresholds for these compounds. In contrast, many samples of groundwater, irrespective of source, likely affect biota. Biomonitoring of surface waters suggests generic responses to stressors, but the influence of natural phenomena and occasionally nutrient enrichment are often suggested by data. In summary, valuable research has been done on seepage. The data suggest infiltration into groundwater is common, seepage into surface waters is not, and anthropogenic biological impacts are not likely. "

About half of the CCRs that are generated annually in the U.S. are stored in coal ash impoundments and landfills, in most cases adjacent to coal plants and waterways. Leaking of coal ash ponds and CCR spills are major environmental concerns. One factor which may impact the safety of CCRs stored in impoundments and landfills is the storage area's predisposition to flooding. The southeastern U.S., in particular, has a large number of coal ash impoundments located in areas that are vulnerable to flooding. In order to test for the possible presence of CCR solids in lake sediments following Hurricane Florence, we analyzed the magnetic susceptibility, microscopic screening, trace element composition, and strontium isotope ratios of bottom sediments collected in 2015 and in 2018 from Sutton Lake in eastern North Carolina and compared them to a reference lake. The results suggest multiple, apparently previously unmonitored, CCR spills into Sutton Lake from adjacent CCR storage sites. The enrichment of metals in Sutton Lake sediments, particularly those with known ecological impact such as As, Se, Cu, Sb, Ni, Cd, V, and Tl, was similar to or even higher than those in stream sediments impacted by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in Kingston, Tennessee, and the Dan River, North Carolina coal ash spills, and exceeded ecological screening standards for sediments. High levels of contaminants were also found in leachates extracted from Sutton Lake sediments and co-occurring pore water, reflecting their mobilization to the ambient environment. These findings highlight the risks of large-scale unmonitored spills of coal ash solids from storage facilities following major storm events and contamination of nearby water resources throughout the southeastern U.S. "

Therefore, quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were used to quantify H8 and H12 marker genes at the sample level. Specificity values for the H8 and H12 qPCR assays were 96 and 93%, respectively, while both marker genes showed 100% sensitivity.

Individuals who are obese have higher risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and dementia than non-obese. Conversely, patients with neuropsychiatric conditions may exhibit some features that contribute to obesity development such as unhealthy behaviors and treatment with drugs that increase appetite. This review addresses the multiple pathways implicated in the relationship between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders, mainly mood disorders, schizophrenia, and major neurocognitive disorder or dementia. Both obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by a low-grade systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation. Obesity is frequently accompanied by neuroendocrine changes, particularly involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Indeed, activation of the stress system is commonly seen as a trigger for mood episodes, psychosis exacerbation, and cognitive decline. Growing evidence suggests the role of gut microbiota in obesity and brain functioning through the modulation of the inflammatory response and HPA axis. Owing to the intricate relationship between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders, tackling one of them may affect the other. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathways underlying the link between obesity and neuropsychiatric disorders can contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

Parathyroid hormone is approved therapy for the treatment of osteoporosis. The intermittent therapy of parathyroid hormone requires accurate administration. Meta-analysis is conducted to draw a clear picture of the impact of intermittent therapy and dose rates relative to time, on the osteoporotic patients. A novel mathematical model is presented in this article synchronised with the parametric values, depicted from meta-analysis. Results obtained from the mathematical model are in close agreement with the results obtained from the clinical trials. The model can be used to forecast the drug potency and dosage rates, to control the vicious cycle of osteoporosis. The intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone, rather than the continuous administration, is more effective, furthermore it is also concluded that a mathematical model, linked with the extensive literature of clinical trials, using meta-analysis can help in drug administration and future clinical studies of drug development.

The necessity of stabilizing such fractures by surgical procedures is a controversial matter among surgeons. Validating a personalized FE analysis by ex-vivo experiments of humeri and mimicking such fractures by experiments is the first step along the path to determine the necessity of such surgeries. Four fresh frozen human humeri were loaded using a new simple experimental setting, so to fracture the humeri at the anatomical neck. Strains on humeri's surfaces predicted by the high order FE analyses (as in Dahan et al., 2016) were compared to the experimental observations to further enhance the validity of the FE analyses. A simplified yield criterion based on a linear elastic analysis and principal strains was used to predict the anatomical neck fracture as observed in the experiment. An excellent correlation between experimental measured and FE predicted strains was obtained (slope of 0.99 and R High-order FE analyses reliably predict strains and yield loads in the humeri. Fractures induced by the experimental setting correspond to anatomical neck fractures noticed in practice and classified as AO C1.1-C1.3. Surgical neck fractures, which are most common in clinical practice, could not be realized in the proposed experiments, and a different experimental setting should be sought to obtain them ex-vivo.

Although corrective surgery produces high level of patient satisfaction, it is still unclear how it affects muscle and hip contact forces during level walking. The purpose was to compare the muscle force contributions and hip contact forces in patients before and after surgical correction for cam FAIS with healthy control (CTRL) individuals during level walking. Eleven male patients with symptomatic cam-type morphology, who underwent hip osteochondroplasty, had their level walking recorded pre- and at 2-year postoperatively. The patients were sex-, age-, BMI-matched to 11 CTRL individuals. Sagittal and frontal hip kinematics and kinetics were computed and, subsequently, muscle and hip contact forces were estimated using musculoskeletal modelling and static optimization. Patient-reported outcomes improved postoperatively. The pre- and postoperative FAIS walked slower and with shorter steps than the CTRL. Postoperative biceps femoris (CTRL: 0.35 ± 0.13 N/BW; pre-op: 0.28 ± 0.11 N/BW; post-op: 0.20 ± 0.07 N/BW) and semimembranosus forces (CTRL: 0.77 ± 0.24 N/BW; pre-op: 0.66 ± 0.24 N/BW; post-op: 0.41 ± 0.14 N/BW) were lower at ipsilateral foot-strike. Postoperative rectus femoris force (CTRL: 1.73 ± 0.35 N/BW; pre-op: 1.44 ± 0.24 N/BW; post-op: 1.18 ± 0.23 N/BW) was lower than the other two groups, and the pre- and postoperative FAIS had lower iliacus (CTRL: 1.17 ± 0.18 N/BW; pre-op: 0.93 ± 0.16 N/BW; post-op: 0.94 ± 0.21 N/BW) and psoas (CTRL: 1.55 ± 0.24 N/BW; pre-op: 1.14 ± 0.38 N/BW; post-op: 1.10 ± 0.46 N/BW) muscle forces at contralateral foot-strike compared with the CTRL. Pre- and postoperative FAIS demonstrated lower peak hip contact loading resultant than the CTRL. The altered gait parameters observed in the preoperative FAIS was not restored after surgery, and was still away from the CTRL. It is possible that the reduced dynamic muscle forces of the biceps femoris, semimembranosus and rectus femoris postoperatively were associated with the protected mechanism that involved the iliopsoas preoperatively. This is an indication that the gait adaptations affected by the FAIS do not restore to normal after surgical correction at the 2-years follow-up. "

The inconsistencies between studies could be reduced if we knew which task separates patients best from healthy controls. Identify which functional task, between gait, forward step down (FSD), lateral step down (LSD), stair ascent and descent and propulsion and landing phase of the single leg hop test (SLHT), differentiates the three-dimensional kinematics of women with patellofemoral pain from asymptomatic women. This cross-sectional study evaluated thirty-five PFP and thirty-five asymptomatic women during the execution of the following tasks: gait, FSD, LSD, stair ascent and descent and the propulsion and landing phase of single leg hop test. Frontal, sagittal and transverse plane angles of the trunk, pelvis and hip, frontal and sagittal plane angles of the knee, ankle dorsiflexion, foot progression angle and hindfoot eversion were analyzed through the Movement Deviation Profile (MDP). To compare the groups, the multivariate analysis with Bonferroni post hoc test were used, with a significance level of p < 0.01. To identify which task presented the most difference between the groups, the Z-score of the mean MDP was calculated. For all tasks, the groups presented significant differences. According to the Z-score, the groups got farther apart considering the MDP for each task in the following order: LSD (7.97), FSD (7.62), landing phase of SLHT (3.43), gait (2.85), propulsion phase of SLHT (1.64), descending stairs (1.63) and ascending stairs (1.00). We suggest that step down tests should be included in the assessment of PFP patients, since these tests most differentiate the kinematics of women with and without PFP. Identifying the tasks with the highest sensitivity to detect the kinematic differences is expected to improve clinical decision-making. "

An original semi-supervised learning procedure, which makes efficient use of a large amount of non-segmented images and a small amount of images segmented manually by experts, is developed to generate pixel-wise apparent flow between two time points of a 2D+t cine MRI image sequence. Combining the apparent flow maps and cardiac segmentation masks, we obtain a local apparent flow corresponding to the 2D motion of myocardium and ventricular cavities. This leads to the generation of time series of the radius and thickness of myocardial segments to represent cardiac motion. These time series of motion features are reliable and explainable characteristics of pathological cardiac motion. Furthermore, they are combined with shape-related features to classify cardiac pathologies. Using only nine feature values as input, we propose an explainable, simple and flexible model for pathology classification. On ACDC training set and testing set, the model achieves 95% and 94% respectively as classification accuracy. Its performance is hence comparable to that of the state-of-the-art. Comparison with various other models is performed to outline some advantages of our model. "

However, the CW has limited capacity to degrade atrazine, a frequently detected herbicide in runoff. Bioaugmentation provides a feasible enhanced alternative; nevertheless, incorporating bioaugmentation into CW is likely to perpetuate the environmental consequences and incur complex trade-offs between environmental improvement and burdens. Since few efforts were made to improve above situation, the present work proposed the application of bioaugmentation, and tested the feasibility from both efficiency and sustainability dimensions. Results showed that bioaugmentation markedly enhanced atrazine degradation from 5 mg/L to below the threshold value within 43 day by increasing functional atrazine-degrading bacteria. Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter significantly proliferated among atrazine-degrading bacterial genera, indicating high adaptability and atrazine-degrading contribution. With life cycle assessment, enhancing 1 kg of atrazine degradation could decrease environmental burdens with 27.60 kg 1,4-DCB-Eq of freshwater-ecotoxicity reduction, and achieve shorter payback period compared to non-bioaugmented CW.

Mechanism investigations had shown that AR accelerated the disintegration of food waste to release soluble carbohydrates and proteins. The model experiment of synthetic wastewater revealed that AR improved both hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies but inhibited the methanogenesis process, thereby accumulating SCFA. 454 high-throughput sequencing showed that AR increased the relative abundance of Clostridium and Sporanaerobacter, which benefited anaerobic hydrolysis of food waste.

Search results were filtered to only include those related to adolescents and young adults. E-cigarette use among youth is common, with rates of use increasing from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018. Pod mod devices such as JUUL have gained favor among youth for their sleek design, user-friendly function, desirable flavors, and ability to be used discreetly in places where smoking is forbidden. Adolescents are often uninformed about the constituents of e-cigarettes, and little is known about the long-term effects of e-cigarettes. Studies have suggested a ""gateway"" effect for combustible cigarettes and cannabis use. E-cigarette use is becoming increasingly common among youth, leading to a myriad of questions and concerns from providers, educators, and family members.

Data on 126,463 adults (including 8241 LGB adults) were from the 2015-2017 National Survey of Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression was used to estimate lesbian/gay (L/G) and bisexual disparities (relative to same-gender heterosexuals) for: lifetime prescription pain reliever misuse, heroin use and injection heroin use; past-year opioid misuse and opioid use disorder (OUD); and perceived risk of and access to heroin. All LGB subgroups had elevated lifetime pain reliever misuse rates relative to same-gender heterosexuals. Lifetime heroin use was elevated among LGB women and bisexual men; bisexual women had 4 times the odds of injection heroin use. LGB women and gay men had 1.4-2.4 times the odds of past-year opioid misuse; bisexual women had 2.5 times the odds of OUD. LGB women reported both lower perceived risk of trying heroin and greater perceived heroin access. Lifetime and past-year opioid misuse is elevated among LGB adults. Bisexual women are particularly at-risk, uniquely exhibiting disparities on high-risk injection use and OUD. Lower perceived risk of and greater access to heroin among LGB women may play a role in the onset or continuation of opioid misuse. Opioid misuse disparities among LGB adults are of substantial concern given the resultant elevated risk for fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose. "

The optimal tracking approach depends on the criteria for each specific application. Considerations include the requisite assay readout, throughput, droplet library size, reagent tracking and more. In this review, we summarize different strategies for droplet micro-reaction tracking and comment on promising future approaches in droplet barcoding. Topics range from indexing droplets by sequence or in an array, labeling droplets with barcodes, and reagent barcoding to track the input conditions in parametric screens. "

Here, we introduce a two-dimensional implementation of the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM), which merges the finite element method (FEM) and the discrete element method (DEM), to explicitly simulate the crack induced nonlinear elasticity in solids with both horizontal and inclined cracks. In the FDEM model, the solid is discretized into finite elements to capture the wave propagation in the bulk material, and the finite elements along the two sides of the crack also behave as discrete elements to track the normal and tangential interactions between crack surfaces. The simulation results show that for cracked models, nonlinear elasticity is generated only when the excitation amplitude is large enough to trigger the contact between crack surfaces, and the nonlinear behavior is very sensitive to the crack surface contact. The simulations reveal the influence of normal and tangential contact on the nonlinear elasticity generation. Moreover, the results demonstrate the capabilities of FDEM for decoding the causality of nonlinear elasticity in cracked solid and its potential to assist in Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). "

Leaves and/or photosynthetic shoots of individual species and soils were sampled and analyzed for 20 elements in plant samples and 5 major elements plus % gypsum content, pH, and EC in soil samples. Eu-halophytes and leaf- and stem-succulent and salt-recreting plants showed high concentrations of Na, S, and Mg and low concentrations of Ca and K. In contrast, pseudo-halophytes, facultative-halophytes and eury-hygro-halophytes, which often lack succulent shoots, showed low Na, S, and Mg and high Ca and K concentrations in their leaves. Clear patterns were identified among taxonomic families, with Chenopodiaceae and Plumbaginaceae having high Na and Mg and low Ca and K concentrations, Caryophyllaceae having high K, Poaceae having low Na, and Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, and Brassicaceae showing high foliar Ca concentrations.

However, these disparities in wellbeing are not captured in conventional QOL instruments, as they often do not include dimensions that are likely to be relevant to Indigenous people. The objective of this comprehensive literature review was to identify these wellbeing domains for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia (hereafter, respectfully referred to collectively as Indigenous Australians). We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Econlit, CINAHL, and Embase (from inception to June 2017, and updated in March 2019), and grey literature sources using keywords relating to adult Indigenous Australians' QOL and wellbeing. From 278 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 95 were included in a thematic analysis. This synthesis revealed nine broad interconnected wellbeing dimensions: autonomy, empowerment and recognition; family and community; culture, spirituality and identity; Country; basic needs; work, roles and responsibilities; education; physical health; and mental health. The findings suggest domains of wellbeing relevant to and valued by Indigenous Australians that may not be included in existing QOL and wellbeing instruments, domains that may be shared with Indigenous populations globally. This indicates the need for a tailored wellbeing instrument that includes factors relevant to Indigenous Australians. Developing such an instrument will ensure meaningful, culturally-relevant measurement of Indigenous Australians' wellbeing. "

The results of successful application of SERS and micro-SERS for art pigments identification in the canvas paintings and icons have been demonstrated. The techniques allowed us to clearly identify the composition of blue and green paint layers as well as grounds in the nine artworks. This lead to determination of the lower time limit of work creation, to dating of the restoration interventions, to distinguish red ochers from two different deposit sources of raw mineral.

In order to deal with the accompanied massive databases, large numbers of Raman spectra require to be handled and identified in an effective and automatic manner. This paper proposes an algorithm of material auto-identification, which makes use of machine learning methods to analyze Raman spectra. Firstly, a universal method of spectral feature extraction is designed to automatically process Raman spectra after the background subtraction. Secondly, the extracted feature vectors are used to classify and identify target materials by Adaptive Hypergraph (AH), an efficient classifier in the field of machine learning, in a manner of automation with an accuracy rate of ~99%. Compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), two typical methods of classification, the AH classifier provides better performance free of tuning any parameter facing different targets. Thirdly, Cubic Spline Interpolation is introduced to enhance the universal of the proposed algorithm between different databases from different Raman spectrometers with variant vendors. The identification accuracy rate is up to 98% using the high frequency sampling spectra as the learning and the low frequency sampling ones as the testing, respectively. "

Therefore, understanding how carbon nanomaterials and their derivatives work on organisms is becoming important. In recent years, more and more researchers have explored the damage of carbon nanomaterials to organisms at the molecular level. This review pays special emphasis on how proteins response to the main carbon nanomaterials (fullerene, carbon nanotubes, graphene and their derivatives). In addition, how to use the interaction between carbon nanomaterials and proteins to do some beneficial things for human and the development of safe nanomaterials is simply discussed. Finally, some suggestions have been made to lay a theoretical foundation for future research. "

Efforts were made to examine links between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and sexual aggression after controlling variance associated with other forms of abuse. This sample was comprised of men (n = 489) who completed a national survey regarding their history of possible abuse and/or sexual aggression. Maltreatment indices included CSA, parental and sibling physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence, peer bullying, and family emotional abuse. Self-report indicators of sexual frotteurism, coercion and rape were provided by the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Perpetration. CSA links with the criterion indicators were relatively stronger (r = 0.36, d = 0.65, p <  .001) than those found for non-sexual forms of abuse. CSA accounted for unshared variance in sexual aggression with these effects magnified by the addition of parental physical abuse (d = 2.1) or exposure to domestic violence (d = 2.2). The relative risks of prior acts of rape were elevated by CSA (RR = 4.39, p <  .001), parental physical abuse (RR = 3.85, p < 0.001), exposure to domestic violence (RR = 3.81, p <  .001), or sibling physical abuse (RR = 2.56, p = 0.007). These risks of completed rape were higher as well among respondents polyvictimized by two (RR = 4.92, p <  .001) or more (RR = 8.94, p < 0.001) forms of abuse. Multiple forms of child maltreatment, particularly CSA, were strongly associated with adult sexual aggression in this sample of men from the general population. "

Knives, scissors, and screwdrivers, as studied in this research, are among the most commonly encountered weapons involving stabbing events. When any of these implements are used in a stabbing, there is potential for the garment(s) worn by the victim to be damaged. In such an instance, there is an opportunity for fibres to be transferred to the weapon used, thus providing forensic evidence of proof of transfer from the victim's clothing to the weapon. This can offer valuable information in establishing what weapon was used to harm the victim through linking fibres from the victim's garment(s) to a weapon recovered from a suspect. This research simulates vertical stabbings - performed by a human participant - in to a polystyrene block supporting the clothing (essentially acting as the victim's torso), to reflect an authentic scenario. The aforementioned weapons were used along with 3 varieties of garments (cotton, polyester and a linen/viscose mix) offering different characteristics of shedability and structure for the simulated stabbings. Low power microscopy was utilised to view the transferred fibres. The amount of fibres transferred on to the implement were recorded for each repeat. 2279 individual fibres were found over 10 repeats from the knife in relation to the linen/viscose garment. This was the highest amount of transference found with the lowest number attributed to the screwdriver-polyester relationship, providing 320 recorded fibres over 10 repeats. The findings of this study suggest that the number of fibres transferred is not only related to the shedability of the garment but also the surface area characteristics of the receiving weapon and the ability for the garment to tear.

In this study, we found that miR-874-3p levels significantly decreased in rat I/R brain induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and SH-SY5Y cells following oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) treatment. Upregulation of miR-874-3p reduced infarct volumes and cell apoptosis in the in vivo I/R stroke model using TTC and TUNEL staining, as well as increased proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in OGD/R induced SH-SY5Y cells by CCK-8, Edu staining and flow cytometry analysis. Mechanistically, bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay confirmed BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF) and Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-rambo (BCL2L13) were the direct targets of miR-874-3p. Furthermore, BMF or BCL2L13 knockdown also provided significant protection against OGD/R induced injury, while their overexpression reversed the protective effects of miR-874-3p on SH-SY5Y cells following OGD/R. In summary, our results suggest that miR-874-3p attenuated ischemic injury by negatively regulating BMF and BCL2L13, highlighting a novel therapeutic target for ischemic stroke. "

Experiments were performed using 100 μs pulses at different electric field intensities and the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Additionally, electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements were used as a different method to study in real time the changes produced on cells with pulse number during trains of consecutive pulses. Our results show that the relation between pulse number and the observed outcome is complex and difficult to fully characterize. This relation can display a highly linear behaviour up to a certain number of pulses and/or field intensity applied. However, the relation between the number of pulses and the observed outcome always evolves to a saturation or at least a reduction in the electric field effects that is displayed when either electric field intensity or pulse number are increased. An exponential model was found to best describe this relation within the range of experimental conditions considered. Electrical impedance measurements confirmed the results and gave a more precise quantification of this dependence. The study highlights the importance that pulse number has in the electrochemotherapy protocols and establishes some limits in the use of this parameter. "

Traditional plant identification often relies on the experience of botanists. The infrageneric identification of plants is easily mistaken due to similarities in organ features. In this work, we propose an electrochemical method to obtain fingerprints of plant petal tissue. Fourteen species of Lycoris were used as a model for validating this methodology. Pattern and color recognition were established for visualization of electrochemical fingerprints recorded after various solvent extractions. In addition, the infrageneric relationships of these Lycoris species were deduced from the electrochemical fingerprints since the type and content of electroactive compounds in plants are controlled by genes. The results indicate that the electrochemical fingerprints of Lycoris petals are correlated with the infrageneric relationships of native Lycoris species. "

This hypothesis was tested by histological-based assessment of gills and liver of pelagic (Tilapia zilli) and benthic (Clarias gariepinus and Neochanna diversus) fish species of River Owan. The fish species were sampled monthly across seasons from river sites where they were observed to be most abundant. The pathologies were examined from light micrographs, and severity was evaluated by semi-quantitative analyses. Gill pathology of Tilapiazilli showed a moderate occurrence of shortened secondary lamellae, compared with Clarias gariepinus and Neochanna diversus which showed a high incidence of very distinct structural disruptions including epithelial lifting, collapsed secondary lamella structure due to pilaster disruption. Although hepatocellular damage, fibrotic biliary disruptions and parasite incidence were the most evident pathological features in liver of all species, parasite variety and lesion severity differed across species. Principal component analysis (PCA) associated benthic species with more severe gills and liver pathologies, indicating that, benthic species in the Owan riverscape were more at risks compared to pelagic species. As such, we successfully demonstrate that relative ecological risks and potential adverse health effects on fish species could be dependent on ecological behavior and preferences. Conservation efforts particularly for endangered species could be better developed if relative risks and vulnerability of species are understood. "

Here, we sought to determine whether visual motion signals from that incorporated rubber hand would provide relevant cues for sensing movement (i.e. kinesthesia). After 180 s of visuo-tactile synchronous or asynchronous stroking, the fake hand was moved along the lateral or the sagittal axis. After synchronous stroking, movement of the rubber hand induced illusory movement of the static (real) hand in the same direction; the illusion was slightly more frequent and more intense when the fake hand was moved along the sagittal axis. We therefore conclude that visual signals of motion originating from the rubber hand are integrated for kinesthesia by the central nervous system just as visual signals from the real hand are. "

Using 28 EEG recordings of preterm and term neonate infants the complex features of the EEG signals were constructed in the form of a Chow-Liu tree. The trees were embedded into a 3 dimensional Euclidean space. Clustering of specific EEG patterns was done by complete linkage algorithm. Our analytic tool was able to build clusters of patients with pathological EEG findings. In particular, we were able to make a visual proof on a 3d multidimensional scaling coordinate system with a good performance. The distances (graph edit distance) between Chow-Liu trees of different infants were proportional to the clinical findings of corresponding infants. Our method may provide a basis for the future development of a diagnostic/prognostic non-invasive brain monitoring tool which will be able to differentiate between a variety of complex clinical findings. This model addresses relevant issues in neonatology and neuropediatrics in terms of identification of possible clinical factors which interfere with normal brain development and will allow fast unbiased recognition of infants with specific pathological EEG findings.

We retrospectively analysed school children's ERPs at preschool age for discrimination of vowel length (phoneme processing), discrimination of stress pattern (word-level prosody), and processing of prosodic boundaries (phrase-level prosody). We found differences between pre-schoolers with and without later literacy difficulties for phoneme and stress pattern discrimination, but not for prosodic boundary perception. Our findings complement the picture of phonological processing in dyslexia by confirming difficulties in segmental phonology and showing that prosodic processing is affected for the smaller word level, but not the larger phrase level.

We extended previous research by examining associations between perfectionistic self-presentation and breast size dissatisfaction, and also examined whether motherhood status moderated this association. A total of 484 Italian women (age M = 40.39, SD = 13.73; mothers n = 53.9%) completed measures of perfectionistic self-presentation (perfectionistic self-promotion, nondisplay of imperfection, and nondisclosure of imperfection) and breast size dissatisfaction. Preliminary analyses indicated that a majority of the sample (69.2%) reported breast size dissatisfaction, with 44.4% and 24.4% desiring larger and smaller breasts, respectively, than they currently had. Only perfectionistic self-promotion and nondisplay of imperfection were significantly correlated with breast size dissatisfaction. Both associations were additionally moderated by motherhood status, with associations being significant in non-mothers but not in mothers. Our findings suggest that motherhood may help decouple the link between perfectionistic self-presentation and breast size dissatisfaction. Future studies should assess whether this effect is due to an enhanced maternal view of breasts that emphasises nurturing and biological functions or a result of weaker investment in sociocultural norms on physical appearance.

Existing approaches for preparing superhydrophobic PVDF membrane often involve separate manipulation of surface roughness and surface chemistry. Here we report a one-step approach to simultaneously manipulate both the surface roughness and surface chemistry of PVDF nanofibrous membranes for enhanced direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) performances. The manipulation was realized in a unique solvent-thermal treatment process, during which a treatment solution containing alcohols was involved. We demonstrate that by using different chain-length alcohols in the treatment solvent, surface roughness can be promoted by creating nanofin structures on the PVDF nanofibers using an alcohol which has moderate affinity with PVDF. Meanwhile, surface chemistry can be tuned by adjusting the fraction distribution of crystal phases (nonpolar α phase and polar β phase) in the membrane using different alcohols. PVDF membranes with different surface wettabilities were used to evaluate the effects of surface roughness and surface energy on the DCMD performances. Combining both low surface energy and multi-scale surface roughness, pentanol-treated PVDF membrane achieved best anti-water property (water contact angle of 164.1° and sliding angle of 8.1°), and exhibited superior water flux and enhanced anti-wetting ability to low-surface-tension feed in the DCMD application.

The product (DCC-RGD) self-assembled into a more elongated nanofibrillar structure through lateral and end-to-end association. When added into poly(ethylene imine) (PEI)/pDNA polyplex solution, nanocelluloses interacted electrostatically with positively charged polyplexes without affecting their integrity. The constructs were tested for their potentials as non-viral transfection reagents. Cell viability and transfection efficiency of fibroblast NIH3T3 cells were monitored as a function of CNC concentration where, in general, viability increased as the CNC concentration increased, and transfection efficiency could be optimized. Using wild-type MDCK and αV-knockout MDCK cells, the construct was able to provide targeted uptake of polyplexes. The findings have potential applications, for example, cell-selective in vitro or ex vivo transfection of autologous mesenchymal stem cells for cell therapy, or bottom-up design of future innovative biomaterials.

The MKT successfully accounts for the temperature-dependence of the dynamic contact angle, yielding rational values for key parameters including the activation free energy of wetting. Arrhenius-like behavior is also demonstrated. These results would appear to confirm that, at the molecular-scale, dynamic wetting is a thermally-activated rate process and that the influence of temperature is not restricted simply to its effect on surface tension and viscosity. The data show a discontinuity at dynamic contact angles between 60° and 90° that implies a velocity-dependent change in the wetting mechanism. We attribute this to the chemical heterogeneity of the PET surface, which contains both polar and non-polar groups. The parameters obtained by applying the MKT suggest that the interactions of DBP with these groups determine, respectively, the dynamics observed below and above the transition. The sum of the activation free energies of wetting on either side of the transition is close to the total thermodynamic work of adhesion of DBP to PET. "

Part D, Genomics & proteomics",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200228,"This study aimed at investigating the effects of dietary protein levels on the growth and liver transcriptome in juvenile Ancherythroculter nigrocauda. Six semi-purified diets were formulated containing 25 (control), 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50% protein. Each diet was fed to three groups of 35 fish (mean initial weight: 5.86 ± 0.10 g) for 56 days. The rate of weight gain and specific growth rate increased with dietary protein levels from 25% to 40%, but remained unchanged when fed with 45 or 50% dietary protein. The feed conversion ratio was significantly influenced by the dietary protein levels, being the lowest in fish fed 40% protein. Illumina RNA-seq analysis was performed to investigate liver gene expression changes under different dietary protein treatments. A total of 367.78 million clean reads were obtained from the six libraries. Compared with 25% protein treatment library, there were 734, 1946, 1755, 2726, and 1523 upregulated genes, and 407, 1882, 1865, 2216 and 1624 downregulated genes in the 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50% protein treatment libraries, respectively. Trend analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified six statistically significant trends. A series of DEGs that related to protein metabolism, growth and development, lipid metabolism and immune and stress response were identified. Moreover, gene ontology enrichment analysis of the DEGs demonstrated that cellular process, single-organism process, metabolic process and biological regulation were the most highly overrepresented biological processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, PPAR signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, and cytochrome P450 (CYP450s) were significantly enriched in the dietary protein treatment groups. Furthermore, qPCR results showed excellent agreement on those of RNA-seq for both up- and down-regulated genes (including fasn, accα, SCD, CPT-I, igf1, ST, AST, trdmt1, hsp70, cyp450, MHC-II, C4, tgfβ, ube4b, apoE and abcb7). Thus, our results provide the baseline information for the feed formulation and nutritional research for A. nigrocauda. "

This study evaluated the interaction between seven soil LMWOAs and peanut shell biochar (BC) as well as its effect on the electron shuttling of biochar for Cr(VI) reduction. Both redox reactions and sorption process occurred during the interaction of biochar and LMWOAs, which altered the contents of Cr(VI) reduction-relevant groups (i.e., CO and CO) on the surface of biochar. The redox reactions were more important to the electron transfer between biochar produced at 400℃ (BC400) and LMWOAs due to the repeated cycle of reduction-oxidation of surface functional groups.

We conducted a large online survey among hospital nurses from 31 provinces, municipal cities, and autonomous regions in China from October 2016 to February 2017. The survey covered a wide range of questions, including geographical location, years of experience, insulin injection practice, number of insulin injection-related needlestick injuries in the past 12 months, interventions for needlestick injuries, and treatment costs. We developed a cost estimate model and categorized costs into two major components: infection prevention and treatment of infections. We received a total of 10,447 questionnaires, of which 9873 were complete and validated. 39.1% of the nurses reported at least one needlestick injury while administering diabetic injections at some point in the past. The incidence of needlestick injuries involving injection pens was 139.5 per 1000 nurses per year and, with adjustment for exposure, 10.2 needlestick injuries per 100,000 injections. Among the respondents, 3.2% reported of having hepatitis B virus infection and 0.9% having hepatitis C virus infection as a result of needlestick injuries. The total costs of one insulin injection-related needlestick injury was estimated to range from ¥1,884 - ¥2,389. Insulin injection-related needlestick injuries were common in nurses working in hospitals in China and imposed a significant economic burden. More resources should be allocated for preventive efforts for needlestick injuries, including adoption of injection devices with advanced safety features. "

Three parameters were assigned for each primer pair: specificity, efficacy and taxonomic efficacy. These parameters were evaluated using a novel bioinformatic tool, UniPriVal, developed for this study. UniPriVal was used to validate each primer pair against various databases, including the Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance Reference Gene Database (BARRGDB) and those of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Primer pairs specific for each antibiotic resistance gene were ranked based on their model success metric value. To validate the utility and correctness of the information collected in the LCPDb-ARG, selected primer pairs were tested in bioinformatic and experimental PCR surveys. To our knowledge, this is the first database designed to facilitate PCR monitoring of the occurrence and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental and clinical samples.

Thus, antibiotics including the known macrolide Erythromycin (ERY) are active against bacteria. However, at present, some bacteria show resistance to drugs, which requires the development of new powerful antibacterial agents. One possible way is to use the ERY structure, but change its side chains, while the size of the lactone ring can remain unchanged or change. In this work we consider Cethromycin (CET) and Solithromycin (SOL), which are ketolides with quinolylallyl group at C6 and aminophenyl at C11, respectively (both of them have the same lactone ring as ERY). Experiments have shown that these ketolides have improved efficacy against pathogens, but their binding affinity to the E. coli's ribosome is almost identical. To clarify this issue, we have studied in detail the binding mechanisms of ERY, CET and SOL using the docking and molecular dynamic simulations. In agreement with the experiments, we showed that these compounds have similar binding affinities. Desosamine and lactone ring groups play a critical role in the binding of ERY to the ribosome. In CET and SOL, the contribution of keto and alkylaryl groups is balanced by cyclic carbamate. We have demonstrated that increased fluctuations in the ribosomal residues at the binding site led to an increase in the entropic term in the free binding energy of ERY compared to SOL and CET. The alkyl-aryl arm of both ketolides strongly interacts with A752 and U2609. In addition, the presence of macrolides in the exit tunnel can alter the conformation of U2585, which is located in the peptidyl transferase center, through non-bonded interaction. Therefore, the side chain of ketolides affects not only the binding site but also other residues possibly leading to a strong effect on the protein synthesis process. We predict that to combat bacterial mutations, it is necessary either to design a bulk and charged group as a cladinose, or to use several groups with different signs of charges. This prediction can be used for the development of new efficient antibiotics. "

However, pathology literature, mainly from Asian populations, reports ciliated columnar epithelium in up to 40% of tissue samples from the upper GI tract. This was inconsistent with our pathology practice experience, so we initiated a local review of cases at our Canadian centre. 1048 consecutive tissue samples from the esophagus and GE junction were reviewed retrospectively and no ciliated epithelium was identified. This review included 1000× oil immersion microscopy of 22 cases with ""multilayered epithelium"". In 971 cases verified in prospective surgical pathology practice following identification of the index case, 3 additional cases of ciliated columnar epithelium were identified. The index case had ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, resembling respiratory epithelium, and had strong, diffuse expression of TTF-1 by immunohistochemistry. In the other 3 cases, the cilia were located on the surface of a pseudostratified columnar epithelium, a multilayered epithelium, or a low columnar epithelium, all TTF-1 negative. Over a year later, the index case proved to have arisen from a bronchial-esophageal fistula. The other cases were not associated with a fistula. Our conclusion is that ciliated columnar epithelium is rare in Canadian adults (<0.5% of patients). Ciliated epithelium due to a bronchial-esophageal fistula is exceptional, but something to consider if there is a suspicious clinical picture and TTF-1 expression. Other cases might represent a rare metaplastic phenomenon or remnant from fetal development. "

We present a case of a single metastatic liver tumor from gastric cancer with invasion of the interlobular bile duct for which we achieved margin-free resection with good clinical outcomes. An 80-year-old patient presented with a tumor in segment V of the liver, with invasion of Glisson's pedicle confirmed on preoperative magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography imaging. On the basis of the preoperative assessment, we proceeded with partial hepatectomy, with transection of one of the roots of Glisson's pedicle performed under echography guidance. Pathological examination confirmed gastric cancer as the primary source of the metastatic tumor. R0 resection was achieved, with no evidence of cancer recurrence at one year after surgery. Our experience supports partial hepatectomy with R0 margin tumor resection as an oncologically feasible treatment for metastatic liver tumor arising from primary gastric cancer (in the absence of other metastatic lesions) and shows that a good prognosis can be achieved. Of note, intraoperative echography did not detect tumor invasion of Glisson's pedicle, which was evident only on preoperative imaging. This case suggests that magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography imaging findings are important for surgical planning of hepatectomy. Further follow-up data and more cases are needed to completely define the clinical significance of tumor invasion of Glisson's pedicle. "

A 79-year-old male presents two days after a motor boating incident in profound hemorrhagic shock. Subsequent CT imaging revealed moderate hemoperitoneum, two pseudoaneurysms of the left gastric artery measuring 6 mm and 9 mm, as well as attenuation of the artery in keeping with a focal dissection and intramural thrombus, and no active extravasation. After stabilization with blood product resuscitation, he was managed conservatively with administration of ASA and close monitoring. Abdominal visceral artery vascular injuries in blunt trauma can be managed safely with close monitoring, antithrombotic agent, and medical co-morbidity optimization.

A core model prediction is that identical evidence samples can lead to different patterns of inductive inference depending on the censoring mechanisms that cause some instances to be excluded. This prediction was confirmed in four experiments examining property induction following exposure to identical samples that were subject to different sampling frames. Each experiment found narrower generalization of a novel property when the sample instances were selected because they shared a common property (property sampling) than when they were selected because they belonged to the same category (category sampling). In line with model predictions, sampling frame effects were moderated by the addition of explicit negative evidence (Experiment 1), sample size (Experiment 2) and category base rates (Experiments 3-4). These data show that reasoners are sensitive to constraints on the sampling process when making property inferences; they consider both the observed evidence and the reasons why certain types of evidence has not been observed.

Infants watched teaching events in which a cover was lowered over an object and released, with outcomes that violated object principles. The object became fully hidden under a cover that was much shorter, and it remained partly visible under a cover that was much taller. Next, infants watched two test events identical to the teaching events except that one of the events was modified to present a plausible outcome and thus deviated from teaching. Infants at 3.5 months readily detected the regularity in the teaching events and noticed the change in the modified test event, whereas 6.5-month-olds did not. The pattern of response was reversed (1) when 3.5-month-olds were primed to notice the violation of object principles in the teaching events, which interfered with EBL and led infants to miss the change in the modified test event; and (2) when 6.5-month-olds were provided ways to remove the violation from the teaching events, which enabled EBL and led infants to notice the change in the modified test event. Together, the results shed light on young infants' approach to learning about physical events-one that integrates SL for pattern detection and EBL for causal coherence of the rule being learned. "

However, simpler explanations are not always normatively superior because they often do not account for the data as well as complex explanations. How do people negotiate this trade-off between prior probability (favoring simple explanations) and goodness-of-fit (favoring complex explanations)? Here, we argue that people use opponent heuristics to simplify this problem-that people use simplicity as a cue to prior probability but complexity as a cue to goodness-of-fit. Study 1 finds direct evidence for this claim. In subsequent studies, we examine factors that lead one or the other heuristic to predominate in a given context. Studies 2 and 3 find that people have a stronger simplicity preference in deterministic rather than stochastic contexts, while Studies 4 and 5 find that people have a stronger simplicity preference for physical rather than social causal systems, suggesting that people use abstract expectations about causal texture to modulate their explanatory inferences. Together, we argue that these cues and contextual moderators act as powerful constraints that can help to specify the otherwise ill-defined problem of what distributions to use in Bayesian hypothesis comparison.

Five metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) were identified as key contaminants, based on their enrichment factors (EFs) in the whole soft tissue of X. securis at 24 sampling sites, relative to baseline values from near-pristine reference sites in the adjacent Hawkesbury Estuary. Inverse relationships established between mussel size (dry tissue weight) and tissue concentrations of each metal were used to reduce variance (by 4-fold) among individuals; gender and reproductive status had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on tissue metal concentrations in X. securis. Metal concentrations in three environmental matrices - filtered (<0.2 μm) surface water (operationally defined as the dissolved/colloidal phase), suspended particulate matter (SPM; >0.2 μm) and surface sediment (<2 mm particle size), which are most relevant to a suspension-feeding estuarine bivalve, were also determined at each sampling site. For each of the five metals, highly significant (p < 0.01) positive linear regressions were established between metal EFs for mussel tissue and each environmental matrix. Metals in surface sediment and SPM explained 80-91% and 81-90%, respectively, of the variability in metal concentrations in mussel tissue, with filtered surface water explaining 74-86%. Cumulative mussel tissue EFs of all five metals, when regressed against each environmental matrix, showed that surface sediment concentrations explained 93% of their variability between sites, SPM 94% and filtered surface water 87-90%. Hence, X. securis very closely reflects the metal concentrations in its aquatic environment. The study provides a quality-assured benchmark of key metal contamination in the Sydney Estuary, and an appropriate methodology that may be used to discern any changes in metal contaminant status using X. securis.

The root concentration factor (RCF) of 6:2 FTSA was 2.6-24.2 times as high as those of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) of the same or much shorter carbon chain length, demonstrating much higher bioaccumulative ability of 6:2 FTSA in pumpkin roots. The translocation capability of 6:2 FTSA from root to shoot depended on its hydrophobicity. Six terminal perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) metabolites, including perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were found in pumpkin roots and shoots. PFHpA was the primary metabolite in roots, while PFBA was the major product in shoots. 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), a cytochromes P450 (CYPs) suicide inhibitor, could decrease the concentrations of PFCA products with dose-dependent relationships in pumpkin tissues, implying the role of CYP enzymes involved in plant biotransformation of 6:2 FTSA.

In a shallow lake, wind-induced disturbance is considered as the key factor of affecting the cycling of contaminants. To address this issue, the TBBPA distribution and elimination processes were simulated for three typical wind speeds by using an annular flume. Four forms of TBBPA were studied in these systems, including water, suspended solids (SS), vegetation and sediment. The results showed that the mass distributions of TBBPA in water, SS and vegetation increased remarkably while enhancing the wind-induced disturbances, which resulted from the release of TBBPA from the sediment through resuspension and adsorption-desorption processes. However, most of the TBBPA (up to 94%) still accumulated in the sediment. Wind-induced disturbances and vegetation both increased the TBBPA elimination rate in the water-vegetation-sediment systems.

Generally, greater concentrations of DB373 (≤3850 ng/g) and DV93 (≤1190 ng/g) were observed in indoor dust from daycares highlighting children as a susceptible population to potential health risk from exposure to BADs. These data are important because, to date, targeted analysis of brominated compounds in indoor environments has focused mainly on BFRs and appears to underestimate the total amount of brominated compounds.

However, the effectiveness of the bioremediation process could not be evaluated only by analytical monitoring, which is complex mainly due to the characteristics of the matrix, producing non-quantitative analyte recoveries, or interferences in the detection stage and quantification. However, the effectiveness of the bioremediation process cannot be evaluated only through analytical monitoring, which is complex due mainly to the characteristics of the matrix, to the recoveries of non-quantitative analytes or to interferences in the detection and quantification stage. For this reason, it is essential to have tools of ecological relevance to assess the biological impact of pollutants on the environment. In this context, the objective of this work was to establish the appropriate bioassays to evaluate the effectiveness of a bioremediation process of co-contaminated soils. For this, five model species were studied: four plant species (Lactuca sativa, Raphanus sativus, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays) and one animal species (Eisenia fetida). On plant species, the biomarkers evaluated were inhibition of germination (IG) and the length of hypocotyls/steam and radicles/roots of the seedling. While on E. fetida, mortality (M), weight lost, coelomocyte concentration and cell viability were tested. These bioindicators and the battery of biomarkers quantified in them showed a different level of sensitivity, from maximum to minimum: E. fetida > L. esculentum > L. sativa > R. sativus ≫>Z. mays. Therefore, E. fetida and L. esculentum and their respective biomarkers were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the bioremediation process due to the capability of assessing the effect on the flora and the fauna of the soil, respectively. The joint application of these bioindicators in a field scale bioremediation process is a feasible tool to demonstrate the recovery of the quality and health of the soil. "

So usually farmers resort to the use of low-quality water, such as agricultural drainage water, which could pose a threat to the quality of crops and then human health. Two field experiments were carried out during two consecutive summer seasons of 2014 and 2015 aimed at delivering more information about the pros and cons of alternative irrigation for tomato using fresh and agricultural drainage water with or without applying of magnetic field. The twelve surface irrigations, which tomato needs during its whole growing season, were applied alternatively between fresh and agricultural drainage water, respectively, at the following percentages (100 + 0), (75 + 25), (50 + 50), (25 + 75) and (0 + 100).

To better elucidate the EM phenotypes of these disorders, we systematically reviewed the literature on non-autobiographical explicit EM biases in individuals with MDD and BD compared to healthy controls. The following databases were searched: Cochrane, Embase, HAPI, LILACs, Medline, PsycInfo and Web of Science. Grey literature and hand searches were also performed. Fourteen studies met full eligibility criteria. Eleven studies included data from an MDD sample (10 during acute depression, 1 during euthymia) and 3 studies included data from a BD sample (2 during acute mood episodes, 1 during euthymia). Only 3 of the studies in acute depression revealed a negative explicit EM bias. One study in MDD during euthymia revealed an EM deficit for negative stimuli. One of the two studies in BD (type I; BD-I) during an acute mood episode revealed a positive explicit EM bias, while the other showed no bias. One study in BD during euthymia showed an EM deficit for negative stimuli. Overall, this review concludes that current empirical evidence does not readily support the existence of an explicit EM bias in MDD during acute depression. The identification and implications of potential moderating factors on explicit EM performance in MDD and BD during both illness stages are discussed. "

ASPD has been criticized for capturing a heterogeneous population whilst missing the essence of the diagnosis by neglecting interpersonal/affective deficits which measures of psychopathy include. This heterogeneity in operationalizations has led to diverse findings without clear understanding of what characterizes this broader population. This study sought to clarify the neuropsychological profiles of ASPD and psychopathy. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Assessment Battery was administered to 85 adult male offenders in a personality disorder secure service and to 20 healthy controls. Of patients with ASPD, 46% met criteria for psychopathy. Of those with psychopathy, 89% met criteria for ASPD. There were two sets of comparisons: ASPD versus other personality disorders versus controls and psychopathy versus other personality disorders versus controls. ASPD showed deficits across executive functions, visual short-term and working memory, and attention (compared with controls). Psychopathy showed deficits limited to attention, complex planning, inhibitory control, and response reversal. Response reversal and visual search deficits appeared specific to ASPD and psychopathy versus other personality disorders and may underpin antisocial traits. Additional deficits in inhibitory control and working memory appeared to distinguish ASPD from other personality disorders. "

However, the results of genetic research on schizophrenia have not yielded results consistent with that estimate of heritability. In particular, extensive genetic studies have not led to new methods for diagnosis and treatment. An examination of the twin studies on which heritability is based shows why such studies exaggerate the genetic component of schizophrenia. In addition, the effects of infectious agents such as Toxoplasma gondii and the composition of the microbiome can produce a clinical picture that would also appear to be largely genetic due to familial aggregation and a role for a partial genetic contribution to the immune system. It is concluded that the genetic component of schizophrenia may have been overestimated and an increased focus on gene-environmental interactions is likely to accelerate research progress on this disease.

For this purpose, a total of 32 marine sediment samples were collected from 12 coastal areas of the Egyptian Red Sea and analyzed using instrumental neutron activation (INAA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analytical techniques. The analyses investigated 14 REEs, Th, and U. The results revealed that the contents of REE, light REE (LREE), and heavy REE (HREE) are 47.6, 38.7, and 8.3 mg/kg, respectively, whereas the concentration of Th and U is determined as 2.15 and 2.23 mg/kg, respectively. Indicator ratios were calculated, and inter-correlation elements with Th and U were constructed. Multivariate statistics were implemented on the data and GIS technology to construct the distribution patterns of REE, Th, and U along the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea. The obtained results were compared with the corresponding values published in literature to show a good matching. There is a significant enrichment of LREE relative to HREE, a reduced ratio of Th/U, a weak positive anomaly of Eu/Eu*, and a slight positive Ce anomaly is noticed. Among the 12 studied areas, one area, Sharm El-Bahari, located in the middle of the coast, shows peak values of REE, Th, and U relative to the other areas.

However, a quantitative analysis on how different factors affect China's national and regional mercury emissions has been lacking, which hinders the design and implementation of mercury control strategies. To fill the knowledge gap, this study applies a temporal and spatial logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model to reveal the important determinants of mercury emissions across China from 2007 to 2015. The results show a descendant trend generally in energy-related mercury emissions at both national and regional level. Economic scale is the main driving factor while its effect is largely offset by the decreasing mercury emission and energy intensities. However, Jiangsu and Shanxi in 2012-2015 are exceptions with emission growth because of their rebounded emission factors and energy intensities. Moreover, a decoupling effect between energy-related mercury emissions and GDP growth is found, reflecting that there is ongoing green energy transition in China. The spatial decomposition verifies that effects of economic scale and energy intensity are the mainly determinants for mercury emission differences between national average and provincial emissions. Other factors' effects are prominent in several provinces such as Xinjiang, Chongqing and Heilongjiang, where the emission gap is primarily resulted by the differences between national and local mercury intensities. By identifying the determinants of emission changes as well as the differences between the national average and provincial emissions, this study provides insights for formulating more targeted mercury mitigation strategies.

We present findings on plant pest prioritization for 63 established invader species of natural and grazing ecosystems of Queensland, Australia. We used an expert elicitation approach to assess risk (species occurrence, spread, and impact) and feasibility of control for each IAS. We elicit semi-quantitative responses from diverse expert stakeholders to score IAS on three management approaches (biocontrol, chemical and mechanical) in relation to cost, effectiveness and practicality, and incorporate uncertainty in expert inputs and model outputs. In the process, we look for promising management opportunities as well as seek general trends across species' ecological groups and management methods. Stakeholders were cautiously optimistic about the feasibility of managing IAS. Taking into consideration all factors, the overall feasibility of control was uncorrelated with the stakeholders' level of confidence. However, within individual management criterion, positive trend was observed for the same bivariate traits for chemical control, and negative trends for biocontrol and mechanical controls. Utility and confidence in IAS management options were in the order: chemical > biocontrol = mechanical, with practicality and effectiveness being the main driver components. Management feasibility differed significantly between IAS life forms but not between habitats invaded. Lastly, we combined IAS risk assessment and management feasibility scores to create a risk matrix to guide policy goals (i.e. eradication, spread containment, protection of sensitive sites, targeted control, site management, monitoring, and limited action). The matrix identifies promising species to target for each of these policy outcomes. Overall, our general approach illustrates (i) the importance of understanding the feasibility of IAS control actions and the factors that drive it, and (ii) demonstrates how quantifying management feasibility can be used to enhance traditional risk assessment rankings to improve policy outcomes.

However, because of the high computational cost, calibration and validation of physically-based models is still challenging. In this context, this study aims to develop a new meta-model based framework for efficient calibration and sensitivity analysis of complex and computationally intensive physically-based models. The proposed approach is applied to the FullSWOF-HR model. According to the average rainfall intensity, 21 rainfall events are categorized into three groups, such as 9 light rains, 6 moderate rains and 6 heavy rains. After upscaling the original high-resolution model, 77 parameter nodes are selected by using the adaptive stochastic collocation method with sparse grids algorithm on the lower-resolution surrogate. 77 simulation runs are then performed with the original model for three representative rainfall events, respectively. The interpolating polynomials of the original models are hence generated. Once the meta-model is constructed, we performed the sensitivity analysis with the variance-based Sobol's method, the results of which are consistent with our previous studies. Calibration process of the meta-model is based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The optimized parameters are verified with the original model and then validated for different rainfall events. These promising results show that the proposed meta-model based approach can efficiently perform sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization for complex physical stormwater quality models, and hence will be very helpful for spreading the detailed water quantity and quality modelling for urban water management issues.

As the growing population requires more fresh water and better ways for wastewater disposal, the demand for wastewater reclamation has increased drastically in recent years. Wastewater, either raw or treated, is being widely used for agricultural irrigation in developing countries, which cause a serious threat to human health mainly because of its pathogenic content. One of the alternative methods to treat wastewater and make it reusable for agricultural irrigation is to implement constructed wetland (CW); a sustainable and cost-effective technology that is applicable for the elimination of both pollutants and pathogens from wastewater. Despite its wide application, the role of macrophytes that form an integral part of CW and specific mechanisms involved in pathogen removal by them is still barely understood due to complexities involved and influencing factors. This has, therefore, attracted various scientific studies to reveal further functional mechanisms involved in vegetated CW to increase its proficiencies. This review paper illustrates the comparative studies of different CW and their pathogen removal efficiencies with major emphasis on macrophytes involved and factors influencing related mechanism. Further, the paper also covers detailed information on the enteric pathogens present in wastewater and the associated health risks involved in its reuse. The ultimate objective is to further clarify the role of CW in enteric pathogen removal and its efficiency for wastewater purification in perspective with safe reuse in agriculture. "

Here, according to the order and degree of leaf chlorosis, a whole leaf blade of trifoliate orange [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] rootstock was divided into two segments-leaf tip and leaf center, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to obtain more detailed information on the cell ultrastructure and component architecture of the two leaf segments under B toxicity. Results revealed that B toxicity led to alterations in pectin network crosslinking structure of leaf tip and destruction of cell wall integrity. Moreover, B toxicity altered protein structure and decreased protein content, while increased carbohydrate content in the two leaf segments, especially in leaf tip. Excess B supply reduced the cellulose content in leaf tip but increased in leaf center. TEM micrographs exhibited chloroplast disintegration and plastoglobulus accumulation in cells of two different leaf sections of B-toxicity plants, with less pronounced changes in leaf center. Furthermore, B toxicity only induced accumulation of starch grains in cells of leaf center. Overall results indicated that the B-toxic-induced biochemical changes of the cell ultrastructure and component architecture greatly differed in leaf tip and center. This study facilitates a better understanding of structural changes in different leaf portions of P. trifoliata under B toxicity stress and provides new ideas for further research on other elements in different plant leaf portions.

The current study involves the optimization of Iron oxide Permeated Mesoporous rice-husk nanobiochars (IPMN) for As removal, which were synthesized through a chemically amended pyrolytic approach. The IPMN variants were screened based on preliminary OVAT (one-variable-at-a-time) studies for As removal. Chemometric investigations employing a central composite design matrix of Response surface methodology was further used to understand the influence of the process parameters on the adsorption of As on the most efficient IPMN variant. A Multi-Layered-Perceptron based artificial neural network was further used to confirm the veracity of the experimental and predictive conditions, to derive the optimal condition for the best adsorption efficiency. In addition, the dynamics of As adsorption by the optimal IPMN variant was modelled using pseudo-first-order (Lagergren) and pseudo-second-order (Ho) rate kinetic equations followed by isotherm studies using non-linear regression of Langmuir, Freundlich and Sips adsorption isotherms. The IPMNs have an appreciably higher uptake capacity (>90%) for dissolved As, as compared to the native milled rice husk (∼20%), alongside a substantial recyclability, thereby establishing their potential as a highly efficient, economical and sustainable nanobiochar for As removal.

Go/Nogo tasks, in which subjects are instructed to respond to a certain type of stimuli (Go) and withhold responses to other types of predefined stimuli (Nogo), have been extensively employed to study the age-related alterations of cognitive inhibition. However, it remains inconclusive whether the N2 and P3 electrophysiological responses to successful inhibition to Nogo stimuli are affected by aging processes. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of Go/Nogo studies to investigate the age effect on Nogo-N2 and Nogo-P3 activities as well as behavioral performance of commission errors. The potential moderators regarding different probabilities of Nogo trials and levels of task difficulty on the effect sizes were also assessed. There were no significant age-related differences in commission errors. However, compared to the younger group, the elderly demonstrated reduced Nogo-N2 amplitudes, particularly in the condition where Nogo probability was less than 50%. Furthermore, age-related reduction of Nogo-P3 amplitudes and prolongation of Nogo-P3 latencies were observed in the condition where Nogo probability was less than 50%. In conclusion, our data suggest that despite similar behavioral performance in the younger and older adults, neural processing of response inhibition becomes inefficient with advancing age. "

Beech seeds are very difficult to store and lose their viability quickly even in optimum storage conditions. To date, it has not been possible to determine factors indicative of the aging process and the loss of viability of beech seeds during storage. To address this important economic challenge and interesting scientific problem, we analyzed the adjustment of the redox state during the development and storage of seeds. Many metabolic processes are based on reduction and oxidation reactions. Thiol proteins control and react to the redox state in the cells. The level of thiol proteins increased during seed maturation and decreased during storage. Gel-based redox proteomics identified 17 proteins in beech seeds during development. The proteins could be assigned to processes like metabolism and antioxidant functions. During storage, the number of proteins decreased to only six, i.e., oxidoreductases, peptidases, hydrolases and isomerases. The occurrence of peroxiredoxins (PRX) as thiol peroxidases and redox regulators indicates an important role of cytosolic 1CysPRX and PRXIIC, mitochondrial PRXIIF, and plastidic PRXIIE, 2CysPRX, and PRXQ in beech seeds during development and storage. Particularly, 2CysPRX was present in beech seeds during development and storage and may perform an important function in regulation of the redox state during both seed development and storage. The role of thiol proteins in the regulation of the redox state during the development and storage of beech seeds is discussed. "

Inclusion criteria were studies that reported working age adult HD prevalence rates and had sample sizes of at least 1009 participants. Eleven studies met criteria (n = 53,378), had low risk of bias and were originally based in developed countries. A random effects meta-analysis was then conducted, with subgroup moderator analysis and meta-regression. The pooled estimated prevalence for HD was 2.5% (CI 1.7-3.6%) and subgroup analyses revealed that prevalence rates were similar for both males and females.

This study aimed to test our prediction that caregiver self-efficacy and social support were two chaining mediator variables on the paths for patient factors affecting caregiver burden, caregiver anxiety, and depression. We enrolled patients with PD and their caregivers from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shanxi Medical University in China between July and December 2017. Patients completed scales evaluating their cognition, motor function, and depression. Caregivers completed scales evaluating social support, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, and caregiver burden. We applied Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the mediating effects. Caregiver self-efficacy was a partial mediator on the path of patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (Variance Accounted For, VAF = 0.741), caregiver anxiety (VAF = 0.498) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.471). Social support for caregivers was a partial mediator on the path for patient motor function effects on caregiver self-efficacy (VAF = 0.247). Caregiver social support and self-efficacy were two chaining mediator variables on the pathway for patient motor function effects on caregiver burden (VAF = 0.768) and caregiver depression (VAF = 0.510). Our sample only met the minimum sample size requirement for the PLS-SEM and we only focused on a part of variables we collected. Our prediction has been validated in this study. And this work supports the decision-making of health authorities and policymakers in managing caregiver social support and caregiver self-efficacy with the aim of reducing caregiver burden in PD. "

Frameworks analyzing individual symptoms and their interrelationships such as network analysis represent an emerging alternative. We aimed to assess frequencies and interrelationships of 9 DSM-5 symptom criteria of major depression reported in the PHQ-9 questionnaire by 4020 patients with cancer and 4020 controls from the general population. We estimated unregularized Gaussian graphical models for both samples and compared network structures as well as predictability and centrality of individual symptoms. Depressive symptoms were more frequent, but less strongly intercorrelated in patients with cancer than in the general population. The overall network structure differed significantly between samples (correlation of adjacency matrices: rho=0.73, largest between-group difference in any edge weight: 0.20, p < 0.0001). Post-hoc tests showed significant differences in interrelationships for four symptom pairs. The mean variance of symptoms explained by all other symptoms in the same network was lower among cancer patients than in the general population (29% vs. 43%). Cross-sectional data do not allow for temporal or causal inferences about the directions of associations and results from population-based samples may not apply to clinical psychiatric populations. In patients with cancer, both somatic and cognitive/affective depression symptoms are less likely to be explained by other depressive symptoms than in the general population. Rather than assuming a consistent depression construct, future research should study individual depressive symptom patterns and their potential causes in patients with cancer. "

Investigations on the influence of hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis reactivation and the correlated elevated sex hormones on brain maturation have not unraveled these interactions to date. Here, we aimed to explore the impact of the reactivated HPG axis on spontaneous brain activity changes, by analyzing the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in developing girls aged 8-11 years old. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test was used to determine the HPG axis status and categorize subjects into two groups (HPG+ or HPG- group). Intelligence quotient (IQ) and the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were used to evaluate cognitive and behavioral performance. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare intergroup differences, the relations between brain areas' activities, age and hormonal levels were conducted by Pearson or Spearman correlation analyses. Compared with the HPG- group, the HPG+ group showed decreased ALFF values in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) but increased ALFF values in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG). In addition, in the HPG+ group, prolactin (PRL) levels were positively correlated with ALFF values in the right SFG, and there was significant negative correlation between ALFF values in the left STG and CBCL activities scores. Due to the cross-sectional design of the present study, further study is needed to determine the relationships between age, reawakening of the HPG axis and related sex hormones and spontaneous brain activity change. These findings suggested that the reactivated HPG axis and elevated PRL level could affect changes in brain activity and this effect may be the neuroendocrine basis of mood, cognition, and social behavior changes in early pubertal girls.

Grey matter volume (GMV) was assessed with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 113 adults ≥60 years with MDD using the following regions of interest: amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and temporal cortex. After controlling for demographic (age, sex, education) and clinical variables (antidepressant use, anxiolytic use, duration of illness, medical comorbidity, cognitive functioning), greater severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with lower GMV bilaterally in the insula, F(1,102) = 6.63, p = 0.01, and OFC, F(1,102) = 8.35, p = 0.005. By contrast, depressive symptom severity was significantly associated with lower bilateral insula volumes, F(1,102) = 6.43, p = 0.01, but not OFC volumes, F(1,102) = 5.37, p = 0.02. Limitations include (1) the relatively mild nature of anxiety symptoms in our sample; (2) the cross-sectional research design, which prohibits inferences of directionality; (3) the relatively homogenous demographic of the sample, and (4) the exclusion of participants with significant psychiatric comorbidity, suicidality, or cognitive impairment. Decreased OFC volumes may serve as a unique biomarker of anxiety symptoms in LLD. Future longitudinal and clinical studies with long-term follow up and more diverse samples will help further elucidate the biological, psychological, and social factors affecting associations between anxiety and brain morphology in LLD.

Undergraduates have been recognized as one of the populations with the highest incidence of self-injury. A substantial body of literature has documented the important influence of impulsivity on self-injury. However, few studies have focused on the mediating mechanisms underlying this relationship. Based on the stress generation hypothesis and the affect-regulation model of self-injury, this study constructed a chain mediating model to examine whether stressful life events and negative affect mediated the relationship between impulsivity and self-injury among Chinese undergraduates. A total of 2270 undergraduates (69.8% female, mean age = 19 years) were recruited to participate in this study and completed self-report measures of impulsivity, self-injury, stressful life events and negative affect. (1) There were significant positive correlations among impulsivity, stressful life events, negative affect and self-injury. (2) After controlling for the effect of gender, impulsivity still had a significant positive effect on self-injury. (3) Undergraduates' self-injury was affected by impulsivity partly through 3 different pathways: the mediating role of stressful life events, the mediating role of negative affect, and the chain mediating role of both stressful life events and negative affect. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the risk factors for self-injury. Impulsivity, stressful life events, and negative affect might increase the occurrence of self-injury. In addition, the chain mediating effect of stressful life events and negative affect plays an important role in the occurrence of self-injury. "

However, previous findings from P300 studies were inconsistent due to the heterogeneity of research methods, which make it difficult to understand the neurobiological significance of them. The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis on P300 in patients with BD. A literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify studies that compared P300 event-related potential between patients with BD and healthy controls (HCs). We analyzed P300 indices such as amplitude and latency of P3a and P3b in auditory or visual paradigms. Further, moderator analyses were conducted to investigate the influence of patient characteristics (i.e. history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories [BD-I/BD-II], and phase of illness [euthymic, manic, or depressive]) on P300 indices. Out of 124 initial records, we included 30 articles (BD: N = 1331; HCs: N = 1818). Patients with BD showed reduced P3a and P3b amplitude in both paradigms and delayed P3b latency in auditory paradigms compared to HCs. There was no influence on the history of psychosis, diagnostic subcategories, or phase of illness on P300 indices. The difference in medication use was difficult to control and it may affect the results. This meta-analysis provides evidence for P300 abnormalities in patients with BD compared to HCs. Our results suggest that P300 may be trait markers rather than state markers in this illness. "

We compared affective go/no-go performance in 100 depressed individuals with both current suicidal ideation and a prior history of attempted suicide, 100 depressed individuals with current suicidal ideation, but no history of attempted suicide, 100 suicide attempters without current depression or suicidal ideation, and 100 healthy controls. Suicide ideators with a history of attempted suicide committed more commission errors during negative word trials than any other group. Additionally, suicide ideators with no attempt history made more commission errors than did controls and previous attempters. An interaction for group status and emotional word valence revealed that suicide ideators with a history of attempted suicide responded fastest to negative words and slowest to positive words. Suicide ideators without an attempt history displayed a similar, but less pronounced pattern. Whereas, controls and previous attempters responded more quickly to positively valenced words. The use of cross-sectional self-report data and inclusion of only female participants limits generalizability. Cognitive dysfunctions were apparent in all suicide vulnerable subjects, but significantly greater in suicide ideators with a history of attempted suicide. Suicidal ideation may be associated with a processing bias and inhibitory deficit for negative, mood-congruent information. These findings increase our knowledge of cognitive impairment in suicidality and may potentially help improve intervention strategies. "

Some longer chain PFASs bioaccumulate and many compounds persist in the environment for long time periods. Recent studies have established their ability to pass through placenta, yet data on the transplacental transfer efficiency and partitioning of short and long chain PFASs in blood matrices are limited. To assess predictors of the partitioning of 17 PFAS compounds detected in the maternal serum, umbilical cord serum and whole cord blood samples from matched mother-newborn pairs from two Faroe Islands cohorts. We examined 151 mother-newborn pairs from two successive Faroese birth cohorts. Cord:maternal serum (transplacental transfer) and serum:whole cord blood (blood partitioning) ratios were estimated for 17 PFAS compounds. We also examined the relationships of these ratios with maternal, newborns', and physico-chemical properties using multivariable regression analyses. Moderate to high correlations were observed between maternal and cord serum PFAS concentrations (ρ: 0.41 to 0.95), indicating significant transfer of these compounds from the mother to the fetus. Median transplacental transfer ratios were generally below 1, except for perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), and ranged between 0.36 for perfluorodecanoate (PFDA) and perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA) and 1.21 for FOSA. Most PFASs exhibited a preference to the serum component of the blood, except FOSA and perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), with blood partitioning ratios ranging from 0.36 for FOSA to 2.75 for PFUnDA. Both the functional groups and carbon chain length of different PFASs were important predictors of transplacental transfer and blood partitioning. We observed a U-shaped relationship between transplacental transfer ratios and carbon chain length for perfluorocarboxylates and perfluorosulfonates. Importantly, gestational diabetes was also a strong predictor of transplacental transfer ratios, with significantly higher transfer in mothers with gestational diabetes. Our findings provide a better understanding of the transplacental transfer and blood partitioning of a large number of PFAS compounds. Results elucidate the importance of chemical structure for future risk assessments and choice of appropriate blood matrices for measurement of PFAS compounds. "

We previously reported findings from two cross-sectional studies on children, showing that higher concentrations of manganese in drinking water were associated with deficits in IQ scores. Despite the common occurrence of this neurotoxic metal, its concentration in drinking water is rarely regulated. We aimed to apply a benchmark concentration analysis to estimate water manganese levels associated with pre-defined levels of cognitive impairment in children, i.e. drop of 1%, 2% and 5% in Performance IQ scores. Data from two studies conducted in Canada were pooled resulting in a sample of 630 children (ages 5.9-13.7 years) with data on tap water manganese concentration and cognition, as well as confounders. We used the Bayesian Benchmark Dose Analysis System to compute weight-averaged median estimates for the benchmark concentration (BMC) of manganese in water and the lower bound of the credible interval (BMCL), based on seven different exposure-response models. The BMC for manganese in drinking water associated with a decrease of 1% Performance IQ score was 133 μg/L (BMCL, 78 μg/L); for a decrease of 2%, this concentration was 266 μg/L (BMCL, 156 μg/L) and for a decrease of 5% it was 676 μg/L (BMCL, 406 μg/L). In sex-stratified analyses, the manganese concentrations associated with a decrease of 1%, 2% and 5% Performance IQ in boys were 185, 375 and 935 μg/L (BMCLs, 75, 153 and 386 μg/L) and 78, 95, 192 μg/L (BMCLs, 9, 21 and 74 μg/L) for girls. Studies suggest that a maximum acceptable concentration for manganese in drinking water should be set to protect children, the most vulnerable population, from manganese neurotoxicity. The present risk analysis can guide decision-makers responsible for developing these standards. "

It infiltrates into homes from soil, water, and construction materials. Its decay products are radionuclides, which attach to ambient particles. Residential radon is one of the leading risk factors for lung cancer. The scarce evidence for associations with other mortality causes originates mostly from occupational studies. In a cohort study with 14 years of follow-up (2000-2013), we evaluated the association between chronic radon exposure and all-cause mortality, and explored whether there are subpopulations who are more vulnerable to radon effects. We included 87,296,195 person-years of follow-up from all Medicare beneficiaries in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. states. We examined the association between the logarithm of county-averaged radon (ln(Rn)) and mortality and assessed effect modification by chronic conditions. An interquartile range increase in the ln(Rn) was associated with a 2·62% increase (95% CI 2·52%; 2·73%) in mortality, independent of PM We found an increased risk for all-cause mortality associated with increased radon exposure. The risk was enhanced among susceptible individuals with chronic conditions. We believe this is the first cohort study to identify populations at higher risk for non-malignant health consequences of radon exposure. Due to the limitations in exposure assessment and availability of individual confounders, these findings should be interpreted with caution. "

Clinical,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200151,"White matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden is a critically important cerebrovascular phenotype linked to prediction of diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, current approaches to its quantification on clinical MRI often rely on time intensive manual delineation of the disease on T2 fluid attenuated inverse recovery (FLAIR), which hinders high-throughput analyses such as genetic discovery. In this work, we present a fully automated pipeline for quantification of WMH in clinical large-scale studies of AIS. The pipeline incorporates automated brain extraction, intensity normalization and WMH segmentation using spatial priors. We first propose a brain extraction algorithm based on a fully convolutional deep learning architecture, specifically designed for clinical FLAIR images. We demonstrate that our method for brain extraction outperforms two commonly used and publicly available methods on clinical quality images in a set of 144 subject scans across 12 acquisition centers, based on dice coefficient (median 0.95; inter-quartile range 0.94-0.95; p < 0.01) and Pearson correlation of total brain volume (r = 0.90). Subsequently, we apply it to the large-scale clinical multi-site MRI-GENIE study (N = 2783) and identify a decrease in total brain volume of -2.4 cc/year. Additionally, we show that the resulting total brain volumes can successfully be used for quality control of image preprocessing. Finally, we obtain WMH volumes by building on an existing automatic WMH segmentation algorithm that delineates and distinguishes between different cerebrovascular pathologies. The learning method mimics expert knowledge of the spatial distribution of the WMH burden using a convolutional auto-encoder. This enables successful computation of WMH volumes of 2533 clinical AIS patients. We utilize these results to demonstrate the increase of WMH burden with age (0.950 cc/year) and show that single site estimates can be biased by the number of subjects recruited. "

Clinical,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200150,"Age-related degenerative changes in the lumbar spine frequently result in nerve root compression causing severe pain and disability. Given the increasing incidence of lumbar spinal disorders in the aging population and the discrepancies between the use of current diagnostic imaging tools and clinical symptoms, novel methods of nerve root assessment are needed. We investigated elderly patients with stenosis at L4-L5 or L5-S1 levels. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to quantify microstructure in compressed L5 nerve roots and investigate relationships to clinical symptoms and motor neurophysiology. DTI metrics (i.e. FA, MD, AD and RD) were measured at proximal, mid and distal segments along compressed (i.e. L5) and intact (i.e. L4 or S1) nerve roots. FA was significantly reduced in compressed nerve roots and MD, AD and RD were significantly elevated in the most proximal segment of the nerve root studied. FA was significantly correlated with electrophysiological measures of root function: minimum F-wave latency and peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT). In addition, FA along the compressed root also correlated with leg pain and depression score. There was also a relationship between RD and anxiety, leg pain and disability score and AD correlated with depression score. Taken together, these data show that DTI metrics are sensitive to nerve root compression in patients with stenosis as a result of age-related lumbar degeneration. Critically, they show that the changes in microstructural integrity along compressed L5 nerve roots are closely related to a number of clinical symptoms associated with the development of chronic pain as well as neurophysiological assessments of motor function. These inherent relationships between nerve root damage and phenotype suggest that the use DTI is a promising method as a way to stratify treatment selection and predict outcomes. "

Here we intend to describe clinical characteristics, rates of response, survival and second neoplasms in HCL patients treated in a reference center in Brazil. All patients diagnosed with HCL between July/1987 and Jun/2018 were included in this analysis. Fifty-four patients were included in this analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 55 years (range, 26-88), with 37% being above 60 years-old. Most patients were treated with cladribine in our cohort (n = 36; 68%), administered through intravenous continuous infusion. Remaining patients were firstly managed with splenectomy (n = 7; 13%), IFN (n = 6; 11%) and rituximab (n = 2; 4%). In a univariate analysis, platelet count and B2M level at diagnosis were statistically associated with CR achievement (p = 0.004 and p = 0.024, respectively). A median follow-up time of 9 years was calculated. Estimated 10-year overall survival was 91.1% (95% confidence interval, 77-97). In this cohort, 10 patients had any second neoplasm, diagnosed before or after HCL. Regarding the sites of cancer, 69% were of skin - 8/16 carcinoma-type and 3/16 melanoma-type. Our response and survival data are similar to those reported by literature, which reaffirms the role of purine analogs in current HCL management. With a very long follow-up we also have observed a high incidence of second neoplasm. "

Therefore, targeting the stemness of CRC forms a basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. However, the pain and systemic side effect from long-term of venipuncture injection remain great challenges to neoplastic treatment. Here, we introduce an oral drug delivery system for sustained release of BMI-1 inhibitor (PTC209) that reverses the stemness of CRC to overcome these obstacles. In this system, nanoparticles modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) showed high-affinity to CD44/CD168 overexpressed-CRC cells, and efficiently targeted to tumor site in a metastatic orthotropic colon cancer mouse model by oral administration. Significantly, the observed tumor growth inhibition is accompanied by decreased expression of stemness markers in the tumor tissues. Furthermore, HA-NPs-PTC209 also significantly prevented metastasis to the gastrointestinal system, while failing to exhibit acute side effects.

However, it is not clear whether transplantation of adult organoids or spheroids alone is sufficient to initiate a fetal-like program of branching morphogenesis in which coordinated branching of multiple cell types including nerves, mesenchyme and blood vessels occurs. Yet this is an essential concept for the regeneration of branching organs such as lung, pancreas, and lacrimal and salivary glands. Here, we used factors identified from fetal organogenesis to maintain and expand adult murine and human epithelial salivary gland progenitors in non-adherent spheroid cultures, called salispheres. These factors stimulated critical developmental pathways, and increased expression of epithelial progenitor markers such as Keratin5, Keratin14, FGFR2b and KIT. Moreover, physical recombination of adult salispheres in a laminin-111 extracellular matrix with fetal salivary mesenchyme, containing endothelial and neuronal cells, only induced branching morphogenesis when neurturin, a neurotrophic factor, was added to the matrix. Neurturin was essential to improve neuronal survival, axon outgrowth, innervation of the salispheres, and resulted in the formation of branching structures with a proximal-distal axis that mimicked fetal branching morphogenesis, thus recapitulating organogenesis. Epithelial progenitors were also maintained, and developmental differentiation programs were initiated, showing that the fetal microenvironment provides a template for adult epithelial progenitors to initiate branching and differentiation. Further delineation of secreted and physical cues from the fetal niche will be useful to develop novel regenerative therapies that instruct adult salispheres to resume a developmental-like program in vitro and to regenerate branching organs in vivo.

Key experimental parameters such as adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial oil concentration and pH were evaluated for Optipore L493, Amberlite IRA 958, Amberlite XAD 7 and Lewatit AF 5. Oil removal rates upwards of 98% were achieved using AF 5, XAD 7 and L493. IRA 958 recorded very modest removal rates of less than 25%. Isotherm data were further investigated and fitted using Langmuir, Freundlich, Toth, Flory Huggins and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. The results show that the adsorption onto XAD 7 and L 493 is a multilayer adsorption process over a heterogeneous surface that is best illustrated by the Freundlich and Toth models respectively. The Dubinin-Radushkevich best described the removal using AF 5 resin that assumes that the adsorption process occurs on a heterogenous surface with a gaussian energy distribution. Kinetic studies assessing the rate of removal for each resin were conducted. Experimental results were best fitted using pseudo second order kinetics. It is concluded that XAD 7 had the highest kinetics among all tested resins. Also, AF 5 exhibited the highest adsorption capacity. Overall, the study confirmed the applicability of the resins for the removal of oil from produced water. "

However, molecular response triggered by Cu have remained largely unknown in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. In the present study, we performed transcriptomic analysis to characterize molecular mechanisms of copper immunotoxicity in gills from M. rosenbergii. A large number of potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci in the transcriptome were identified. 19,417 and 8989 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained at 3 h and 48 h after exposure, respectively. Most of these DEGs were down-regulated implying that gene expressions were largely inhibited by Cu, which might lead to impairments of biological functions. Functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs revealed that immune, detoxification and apoptosis were the differentially regulated processes by Cu stress. 12 DGEs involved in immune response and heavy metal detoxification were discovered and validated by qRT-PCR. The results indicated that the M. rosenbergii might counteract the toxicity of Cu at the transcriptomic level by increasing expressions of immune- and heavy metal detoxification-related genes, and these selected genes could be used as molecular indicators for Cu stress. Our study firstly reported the stress response at transcriptional level in M. rosenbergii during Cu exposure. The genes and pathways identified here not only give us new insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Cu toxicity effects in prawn, but facilitate biomarker identification and stress-resistant breeding studies.

These substances are known as nootropic drugs, smart drugs or cognitive enhancers, as they increase memory, attention and concentration of healthy individuals. Since they are easily available illicitly, their consumption is observed to be growing. Currently, these pharmaceuticals started gaining researchers' attention, especially since they have been recently detected in wastewater, surface water and even drinking water. This review summarises the current state of knowledge on nootropic drugs in terms of their population use trends and ethics, occurrence in the environment and detection techniques, toxicity and removal methods, in example of methylphenidate, modafinil and piracetam - three most popular nootropics. It points out that the main sources of knowledge on cognitive enhancers illicit use are often inconsistent questionnaires, which are not supported by wastewater analysis to become more veracious. Simultaneously, the studies concerning toxicity and removal methods of nootropic drugs are still limited and in many cases environmentally irrelevant. Although the prescription rules has been subjected to more strict control in developed countries, regulatory frameworks with regard to their ecosystem occurrence are still lacking and should be introduced. Moreover, the use of environmentally relevant concentrations in toxicity studies should be a standard, leading to proper ecotoxicity risk assessment. Based on this review, it is recommended to routinely monitor nootropics and their metabolites in waste- and surface waters. "

The use of specific medical devices, such as continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), was associated with an increase in urinary concentrations for several PFR metabolites, despite the lack of information on the presence of these plasticizer chemicals in such medical devices. Further research into the possibly toxic effects of these chemicals released from medical devices is urgently needed. "

The current study examines linear and nonlinear changes in affective reactivity in a longitudinal sample of 82 adolescents who underwent three fMRI sessions between the ages of 9 and 18 years. Changes in response to affective facial stimuli were related to age, pubertal stage, and testosterone levels. Using multilevel modeling, we highlight extensive nonlinear development of socio-emotional responsivity across the brain. Results include mid-pubertal peaks in amygdala and hippocampus response to fearful expressions, as well as sex differences in regions subserving social and self-evaluative processes. However, testosterone levels exhibited inverse patterns of association with neural response compared to pubertal stage in females (e.g., U-shaped relationship with the amygdala and hippocampus).

Sensorimotor activity, as indexed by μ rhythm suppression, was measured using electroencephalography in 14-month-old infants who listened to hand- and foot-produced action sounds (i.e., footsteps and clapping) and to mechanical sounds (i.e., blender). Footstep sounds elicited activation at midline electrodes over the foot area (Cz), and not in correspondence of lateralized clusters over the hand areas (C3 and C4). Greater activation in response to clapping compared to blender and footstep sounds was recorded at electrodes in the left central cluster, over the hand sensorimotor cortex (i.e., C3), but extended to some extent over the midline electrode cluster. Furthermore, our results underscore the role of natural locomotor experience in shaping sensorimotor activation, since infants who gained more walking experience exhibited stronger sensorimotor activation for footstep sounds over left central electrodes. Taken together, current results provide the first evidence that action sounds produced by another person are capable to elicit sensorimotor activation during infancy. "

We previously identified serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) as an oncodriver in glioma via splicing control. However, its splicing-independent roles and mechanisms are poorly defined in glioma. In this study, by integrating the data mining of SRSF1-co-expressed genes, SRSF1-affected genes and experimental studies, we demonstrated that SRSF1 was the most highly expressed SRSF in the 9 tumor types tested, and it was a crucial cell cycle regulator in glioma. Importantly, we identified nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript1 (NEAT1), an upregulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in glioma, as a target of SRSF1. Endogenous NEAT1 inhibition resembled the effect of SRSF1 knockdown on glioma cell proliferation by retarding cell cycle. Mechanistically, we proved that SRSF1 bound to NEAT1 and facilitated its RNA stability. The positive correlation between SRSF1 and NEAT1 levels in cancers further supported the positive regulation of NEAT1 by SRSF1. Collectively, our results provide novel insights on the splicing-independent mechanisms of SRSF1 in glioma, and confirm that NEAT1, whose stability maintained by SRSF1, implicates gliomagenesis by regulating cell cycle. Both SRSF1 and NEAT1 may serve as promising targets for antineoplastic therapies. "

For these efforts, finding the relevant and comprehensive set of articles from the ever growing scientific literature is a challenge. We have designed and developed Article Retrieval for Precision Medicine (ARtPM), an end-to-end article retrieval system that employs multi-stage architecture to retrieve and rank relevant articles for a given medical case summary (genetic variants, disease, demographic, and other medical conditions). We compared ARtPM with five baselines, including PubMed Best Match, the improved search functionality recently introduced by PubMed. The differences in the performance of ARtPM and five baselines were statistically significant for four metrics that quantify different aspects of search effectiveness (P-values for P@10, R-prec, infNDCG, Recall@1000 were <.001, <.001, .003, .009, respectively). Pairwise systems' comparisons show that ARtPM is comparable or better than the best performing baseline on three metrics (R-prec: 0.324 vs 0.299, P-value=.06; infNDCG: 0.556 vs 0.465, P-value=.08; R@1000: 0.665 vs 0.572, P-value=.007), but performance in P@10 (0.603 vs 0.630, P-value:.64) needs to improve. The recall-focused phase of the ARtPM is effective at retrieving more relevant articles. The precision-focused ranking phase performs well at deeper ranks but needs further work on early ranks (e.g., richer feature set). Overall, the ARtPM system effectively facilitates evidence-based precision medicine practice, and provides a robust search framework for further work in this direction. "

These riders are allowed to ride 25 km/h and do not have to wear a helmet (Dutch regulation). Due to several trends such as traffic congestion and the introduction of the scooter model, light mopeds have become more popular, both among older and younger people. This has led to an increased traffic density on bicycle paths as well as concerns about the safety of cyclists. In response to these concerns, several Dutch cities would like to ban light moped riders (LMRs) from the bicycle path and let them ride on the carriageway. However, it is uncertain what the consequences would be for the safety of light moped riders. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the shared use of bicycle paths leads to serious crashes between cyclists and LMRs. Therefore, an in-depth crash investigation study was carried out to gain more insight into the factors and circumstances that influence the occurrence and consequences of light moped crashes on bicycle paths. A dedicated team for in-depth road crash investigation collected and analyzed detailed information on 36 light moped crashes that occurred on an urban bicycle path. This resulted in a description of the course of events for every crash that was analyzed, including a list of factors that contributed to the occurrence of the crash and possible injuries. Crashes with a similar course of events and a comparable combination of contributory factors were grouped into (sub)types of light moped crashes. Six types of crashes were identified. Based on the contributory crash factors of the identified crash types, remedial measures can be developed to prevent similar crashes from occurring in the future. Moving the LMR to the carriageway is only advisable on 30 km/h roads. Alternative measures to improve the safety of both cyclists and light moped riders include: 1) removing obstacles such as poles from the bicycle path, 2) following guidelines on the minimum width of bicycle paths given traffic volumes, 3) improving sight distances at intersections, 4) traffic light control without conflicts between traffic flows, and 5) introducing a helmet law for light moped riders and their passengers.

Although fungal development contributes to the desired sensory characteristics, some moulds, such as Penicillium nordicum are able to produce ochratoxin A (OTA) on meat products. Therefore, strategies to prevent OTA contamination in ripened meat products are required. Microorganisms isolated from these meat products can be adequate as biocontrol agents, given that no negative sensory impact is expected. The PgAFP antifungal protein-producer Penicillium chrysogenum (Pc) and Debaryomyces hansenii (Dh) have been shown to successfully inhibit toxigenic moulds. However, scarce information about the mechanism of action of these biocontrol agents on toxigenic mould inhibition is available. Comparative proteomic analysis is a powerful tool to investigate the physiological response of microorganisms to stimuli. Proteomic analysis was carried out on P. nordicum co-cultured with Pc, Dh, PgAFP, and their combinations on a dry-cured ham-based medium. Additionally, OTA production by P. nordicum in the different cultures was measured. The individual inoculation of Pc or Dh repressed OTA production by P. nordicum by 5 and 3.15 fold, respectively. A total of 2844 unique P. nordicum proteins were identified by proteomic analysis. The impact of the biocontrol agents on the proteome of P. nordicum was higher for Pc-containing cultures, followed by Dh-containing treatments. PgAFP alone had minimal impact on the proteome of P. nordicum. Proteomic analyses indicated Pc repressed P. nordicum OTA production through nutrient competition, potentially reducing glucose availability. Data also suggest that Dh and Pc inhibited P. nordicum through cell wall integrity impairment. Both Pc and Dh seem to hamper P. nordicum secondary metabolism (SM) as indicated by lower levels of MAP kinases and SM-associated proteins found in the co-inoculated P. nordicum. This work paves the way to use antifungal agents in the most efficient way to prevent OTA formation in meat products. "

Although fungal development contributes to the desired sensory characteristics, some moulds, such as Penicillium nordicum are able to produce ochratoxin A (OTA) on meat products. Therefore, strategies to prevent OTA contamination in ripened meat products are required. Microorganisms isolated from these meat products can be adequate as biocontrol agents, given that no negative sensory impact is expected. The PgAFP antifungal protein-producer Penicillium chrysogenum (Pc) and Debaryomyces hansenii (Dh) have been shown to successfully inhibit toxigenic moulds. However, scarce information about the mechanism of action of these biocontrol agents on toxigenic mould inhibition is available. Comparative proteomic analysis is a powerful tool to investigate the physiological response of microorganisms to stimuli. Proteomic analysis was carried out on P. nordicum co-cultured with Pc, Dh, PgAFP, and their combinations on a dry-cured ham-based medium. Additionally, OTA production by P. nordicum in the different cultures was measured. The individual inoculation of Pc or Dh repressed OTA production by P. nordicum by 5 and 3.15 fold, respectively. A total of 2844 unique P. nordicum proteins were identified by proteomic analysis. The impact of the biocontrol agents on the proteome of P. nordicum was higher for Pc-containing cultures, followed by Dh-containing treatments. PgAFP alone had minimal impact on the proteome of P. nordicum. Proteomic analyses indicated Pc repressed P. nordicum OTA production through nutrient competition, potentially reducing glucose availability. Data also suggest that Dh and Pc inhibited P. nordicum through cell wall integrity impairment. Both Pc and Dh seem to hamper P. nordicum secondary metabolism (SM) as indicated by lower levels of MAP kinases and SM-associated proteins found in the co-inoculated P. nordicum. This work paves the way to use antifungal agents in the most efficient way to prevent OTA formation in meat products. "

It not only provides mechanical strength to tissues, but also performs specific biological functions as a multifaceted signaling molecule. Animal-derived collagen is therefore widely used as a biocompatible material in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we developed a novel peptide-based material that mimicked both the polymeric properties and a selected biological function of native collagen. This material was prepared by end-to-end multiple disulfide cross-linking of chemically synthesized triple-helical peptides. The peptide polymer showed a gel-forming property, and receptor-specific cell binding was observed in vitro by incorporating a peptide harboring an integrin α2β1-binding sequence. Furthermore, cell signaling activity and biodegradability were tunable according to the polymer contents. The results demonstrated the potential of this material as a designer collagen. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Collagen is a useful biomaterial with the gel-forming property. It also exhibits various biological activities through the interaction of specific amino acid sequences displayed on the triple helix with functional biomacromolecules. Here we report a novel synthetic material, artificial collagen, by end-to-end cross-linking of chemically synthesized collagen-like triple-helical peptides. The material allows independent regulation of polymer properties, i.e. gel stiffness, and sequence-specific bioactivities by altering peptide compositions. This material can also be variously shaped, for example, thin films with high transparency. In addition, it has low inflamatogenic properties and tunable biodegradability in vivo. "

However, the islet isolation procedure itself contributes to islet death due to the destruction of intra- and peri-islet extracellular matrices (ECMs) during digestion. We investigated whether an RGD-containing elastin-like polypeptide (REP) could function as a self-assembling matrix to replenish ECMs and protects islets from cell death. Immediately following isolation, islets were coated with REP coacervate particles via isothermal adsorption of an REP solution followed by thermal gelation. REP-coated islets displayed increased viability and insulin secretory capacity pretransplant culture compared to untreated islets. Co-transplantation of REP-treated islets and REP beneath the renal sub-capsule in streptozoticin-induced diabetic mice restored normoglycemia and serum insulin levels. Mice that received co-transplants maintained normoglycemia for a longer period of time than those receiving untreated islets without REP. Moreover, co-transplantation sites exhibited enhanced β-cell proliferation and vascularization. Thus, the REP-based coacervation strategy improve the survival, function and therapeutic potential of transplanted islets. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 1). An artificial matrix polypeptide comprised of thermoresponsive elastin-like peptides and integrin-stimulatory RGD ligands (REP) to reconstitute damaged or lost matrices. 2). Through body temperature-induced coacervation, REP reconstitutes intra-islet environment and enhances islet viability and insulin secretion by activating the pro-survival and insulin signaling pathways. 3). REP-coated islets were transplanted together with the matrix polypeptide under the kidney sub-capsule of mice, it develops a new peri-insular environment, which protects the islet grafts from immune rejection thus extending islet longevity. 4). Our data suggest that in situ self-assembly of biomimetic islet environments become a new platform allowing for improved islet transplantation at extrahepatic sites. "

Using this approach, we developed a small-diameter tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) composed of poly-ε-caprolactone-co-L-lactic acid (PCLA) fibers and longitudinally assessed its performance within both the venous and arterial circulations of immunodeficient (SCID/bg) mice. Based on in vitro analysis demonstrating complete loss of graft strength by 12 weeks, we evaluated neovessel formation in vivo over 6-, 12- and 24-week periods. Mid-term observations indicated excellent physiologic graft function, characterized by 100% patency and excellent luminal matching with adjoining native vessel in both the venous and arterial circulations. An active and robust remodeling process was characterized by a confluent endothelial cell monolayer, macrophage infiltrate, and extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling. Long-term follow-up of venous TEVGs at 24 weeks revealed viable neovessel formation beyond graft degradation when implanted in this high flow, low-pressure environment. Arterial TEVGs experienced catastrophic graft failure due to aneurysmal dilatation and rupture after 14 weeks. Scaffold parameters such as porosity, fiber diameter, and degradation rate informed a previously described computational model of vascular growth and remodeling, and simulations predicted the gross differential performance of the venous and arterial TEVGs over the 24-week time course. Taken together, these results highlight the requirement for in vivo implantation studies to extend past the critical time period of polymer degradation, the importance of differential neotissue deposition relative to the mechanical (pressure) environment, and further support the utility of predictive modeling in the design, use, and evaluation of TEVGs in vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Herein, we apply a biodegradable electrospun vascular graft to the arterial and venous circulations of the mouse and follow recipients beyond the point of polymer degradation. While venous implants formed viable neovessels, arterial grafts experienced catastrophic rupture due to aneurysmal dilation. We then inform a previously developed computational model of tissue engineered vascular graft growth and remodeling with parameters specific to the electrospun scaffolds utilized in this study. Remarkably, model simulations predict the differential performance of the venous and arterial constructs over 24 weeks. We conclude that computational simulations should inform the rational selection of scaffold parameters to fabricate tissue engineered vascular grafts that must be followed in vivo over time courses extending beyond polymer degradation.

Electronic cigarettes (ECs) are popular nicotine delivery devices, often targeted to youth and pregnant mothers. However, little is known about how chemicals in ECs might affect neural stem cells, and in particular their mitochondria, organelles that maintain cell functionality and health. Here we show that the mechanism underlying EC-induced stem cell toxicity is stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (SIMH), a transient survival response accompanied by increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. We identify SIMH as a survival response to nicotine, now widely available in EC refill fluids and in pure form for do-it-yourself EC products. These observed mitochondrial alterations combined with autophagy dysfunction to clear damaged mitochondria could lead to faulty stem cell populations, accelerate cellular aging, and lead to acquired mitochondriopathies. Any nicotine-containing product may likewise stress stem cells with long-term repercussions for users and passively exposed individuals. VIDEO ABSTRACT. "

During the follow-up period, participants who developed HCE were identified. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the HCE incidence rate between the two groups studied. - Diabetic patients with schizophrenia were associated with an increased risk of HCE compared with unaffected controls after adjusted for baseline demographics and duration of antipsychotic use (4.73 versus 2.43 per 1,000 person-years, HR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.85-2.51). Also, in diabetic patients with schizophrenia, a longer duration of antipsychotic use was associated with a lower risk of HCE after adjustment for the above-mentioned variables, suggesting a protective effect of antipsychotics against HCE during prolonged use. - This study highlights the need to pay more attention to the risk of HCE in diabetic patients with schizophrenia and the importance of proper use of antipsychotics may reduce the risk of HCE.

Twenty-three interviews were conducted. Women were of various ages and socio-economic classes. Three themes were identified, the menarche experience, the representation and experience of menstrual blood, and the representation and experience of amenorrhea induced by contraception. Menarche has been a negative experience for most of them, and menarche is known to influence menstrual self-representation. About menstrual bleeding, two profiles of women could be described. Those with a positive self-representation of menstrual blood considered it necessary for the purification of their bodies as well as for procreation and were reluctant to the idea of ​​amenorrhea induced by their contraception. Those with a negative representation of menstrual blood considered it as a source of physical and mental suffering and accepted the idea of ​​having amenorrhea induced by their contraception, amenorrhea being considered as a treatment or a release. - The choice of a contraception with or without a induced-amenorrhea seems to be specific to every woman and depends on their self-psychic representations of blood, independently from their socio-economic class. The results of this study highlighted the effect of women's psychic representations and experience of menstrual blood on their contraceptive choice. "

A systematic review of literature was performed using the MEDLINE and COCHRANE LIBRARY databases, in order to identify articles concerning maternal and neonatal outcomes after a manual rotation, through January 2019. Informations on study characteristics (review, author, year of publication), population, objectives and main neonatal and maternal outcomes were extracted. A total of 51 articles were identified and 12 articles were selected for the systematic review. The rate of successful manual rotation were about 47 to 90%.

Linguistic theorizing and much behavioral evidence suggest tight integration between lexico-semantic and syntactic representations and processing. However, most current proposals of the neural architecture of language continue to postulate a distinction between the two. One of the earlier and most cited pieces of neuroimaging evidence in favor of this dissociation comes from a paper by Dapretto & Bookheimer (1999). Using a sentence-meaning judgment task, Dapretto & Bookheimer observed two distinct peaks within the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG): one more active during a lexico-semantic manipulation, and the other - during a syntactic manipulation. Although the paper is highly cited, no attempt has been made, to our knowledge, to replicate the original finding. We report an fMRI study that attempts to do so. Using a combination of whole-brain, group-level ROI, and participant-specific functional ROI approaches, we fail to replicate the original dissociation. In particular, whereas parts of LIFG respond reliably more strongly during lexico-semantic than syntactic processing, no part of LIFG (including in the region defined around the peak reported by Dapretto & Bookheimer) shows the opposite pattern. We speculate that the original result was a false positive, possibly driven by a small subset of participants or items that biased a fixed-effects analysis with low power. "

The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes a single miR-137 ortholog called mir-234, the function of which is unknown. Here we show that mir-234 is expressed in a subset of sensory, motor and interneurons in C. elegans. Using a mir-234 deletion strain, we systematically examined the development and function of these neurons in addition to global C. elegans behaviors. We were however unable to detect phenotypes associated with loss of mir-234, possibly due to genetic redundancy. To circumvent this issue, we overexpressed mir-234 in mir-234-expressing neurons to uncover possible phenotypes. We found that mir-234-overexpression endows resistance to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb, suggesting modification of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function. Further analysis revealed that mir-234 controls neuropeptide levels, therefore positing a cause of NMJ dysfunction. Together, our data suggest that mir-234 functions to control the expression of target genes that are important for neuropeptide maturation and/or transport in C. elegans. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The miR-137 family of miRNAs is linked to the control of brain function in humans. Defective regulation of miR-137 is associated with psychiatric disorders that include schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Previous studies have revealed that miR-137 is required for the development of dendrites and for controlling the release of fast-acting neurotransmitters. Here, we analyzed the function a miR-137 family member (called mir-234) in the nematode animal model using anatomical, behavioral, electrophysiological and neuropeptide analysis. We reveal for the first time that mir-234/miR-137 is required for the release of slow-acting neuropeptides, which may also be of relevance for controlling human brain function. "

The OT is part of the dopamine reward system that shares characteristics with the striatum. Together with the nucleus accumbens, the OT has been referred to as the ""ventral striatum"". However, despite its functional importance little is known about the embryonic development of the OT and the phenotypic properties of the OT cells. Here, using thymidine analogs, we establish that mouse OT neurogenesis occurs predominantly between E11-E15 in a lateral-to-medial gradient. Then, using a piggyBac multicolor technique we characterized the migratory route of OT neuroblasts from their embryonic point of origin. Following neurogenesis in the ventral lateral ganglionic eminence (vLGE), neuroblasts destined for the OT followed a dorsal-ventral pathway we named ""ventral migratory course"" (VMC). Upon reaching the nascent OT, neurons established a prototypical laminar distribution that was determined, in part, by the progenitor cell of origin. A phenotypic analysis of OT neuroblasts using a single-color piggyBac technique, showed that OT shared the molecular specification of striatal neurons. In addition to primary afferent input from the OB, the OT also receives a robust dopaminergic input from ventral tegmentum (Ikemoto, 2007). We used tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression as a proxy for dopaminergic innervation and showed that TH onset occurs at E13 and progressively increased until postnatal stages following an 'inside-out' pattern. Postnatally, we established the myelination in the OT occurring between P7 and P14, as shown with CNPase staining, and we characterized the cellular phenotypes populating the OT by immunohistochemistry. Collectively, this work provides the first detailed analysis of the developmental and maturation processes occurring in mouse OT, and demonstrates the striatal nature of the OT as part of the ventral striatum (vST).

However, many obstacles must be overcome to realize this immense potential. This review first discusses how 3D hydrogels can serve as powerful tools for engineering neural tissue, especially when combined with different types of cells. These tools enable us to gain a better understanding of neural tissue development and its associated disease states. Next, we define 3D bioprinting and detail the necessary tools for using this technique to produce neural tissue, along with reviewing relevant recent work in the area. We also compare with other approaches to generating 3D neural tissues while identifying key areas for future developments in the field of bioprinting. "

Patients undergoing extraction of leads from His bundle location for standard indications were studied. The primary outcomes were removal success rates, need for extraction tools and feasibility of re-implantation in the His bundle region. Thirty patients (Male 23, Age 73.3±14years) with permanent HBP leads of at least 6-month duration were included. Indication for removal of the HBP leads were infection 3, lead failure 22, nonfunctional lead 3 and upgrade to ICD 2. Mean duration of the implanted leads was 25±18 months (range 6-72 months). Removal of HBP leads was successful in 8 of 8 patients with ≤12 months duration and 21 of 22 (95%) patients with >12 months duration. Extraction tools were used in 4 patients, while manual traction was successful in the remaining patients. Re-implantation in the His-Purkinje conduction system was successful in 19 of 22 (86%) patients.

Considering a tag single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found through analysis of an intronic haplotype in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene, we investigated the effect of oxytocin on risky decision-making via the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Young healthy males received intranasal oxytocin or placebo, and the IGT was performed where raw scores, net scores and total time were recorded, and ratio of advantageous to disadvantageous choices was calculated. Using PCR-pyrosequencing, a 761 bp target sequence in the OXTR gene was amplified and sequenced after the extraction of whole blood DNA. Employing Haploview, haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern among all 14 SNPs in the intronic region were determined based on D' and LOD values, and rs2254295 with the highest LD was indicated as the tag SNP. GTT was shown to have the highest frequency among the found haplotypes. Oxytocin group and participants with the TT genotype demonstrated a significantly increased raw score, net score and advantageous choices, whereas the total time was not influenced remarkably. This means that oxytocin significantly reduced the risk taking in decision-making, and participants with the TT genotype had less premature or risky decisions than those with the CT and CC genotypes. rs2254295 may modulate the function or expression of the OXTR gene, implying that T allele may increase the expression of the OXTR gene compared to C allele. We suggest that oxytocin may remarkably moderate the risk attitude and its consequences during uncertain decision-making. "

This phenomenon is referred to as conditioned odor aversion (COA). Several studies have shown that COA depends on the functional integrity of the amygdala, with most studies focusing on the basolateral nucleus. On the other hand, the role of the central amygdala (CeA) which is known to be involved in the consolidation of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) remains to be established. To address this issue, we evaluated the effect of inhibiting NMDA receptor activity in this structure on COA memory formation. Intra-CeA infusions of non-competitive NMDA receptor inhibitor MK-801 prevented memory formation both when administered before and up to 15 minutes after COA conditioning, while no effect of this drug was observed when given before long-term memory test. We next evaluated the role of one of the main downstream effectors of brain NMDA receptor signaling, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), known to play a key role in a wide variety learning tasks including some types of olfactory conditioning. Similar results were obtained with inhibition of either NOS or neuron-specific NOS; which proved to be required both during and after COA training, though for a shorter time span than NMDA receptors. Also, neither isoform showed to be required to memory retrieval. These results suggest that the US signaling during acquisition and the initial consolidation step of COA depends on glutamate-NO system activation in the CeA. "

The gut microbiota composition of 10 patients with sporadic PD and over 65 age and 10 matched controls was analyzed in this study. Microbiota communities in the feces were investigated using high-throughput Illumina Miseq sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The structure and richness of the fecal microbiota differed between PD patients and healthy controls. We had observed that the overall composition of gut microbiota in North-eastern Han Chinese healthy and PD patients was slightly different. The abundance of the family of Bacteroides and Prevotellaceae were significantly increased in heathy controls while the abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Porphyromondaceae, Hydrogenoanaerobacterium and Lachnospiraceae NK4A were significantly enriched in North-eastern Han Chinese patients with PD.

Integrins and extra cellular matrix (ECM) collaborate to regulate gene expression by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Integrins as regulators, have critical role in ECM remodeling. Fibrosis is the hallmark of obesity and insulin resistance originated by aberrant ECM remodeling. Therefore deciphering integrins' expression profile in cells at different conditions is worthy. The aim of this study is evaluation of integrins' gene expression profile changes in mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, adipocytes, insulin resistant and hypertrophic adipocytes. For this purpose, we differentiated mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes, insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes and assayed integrins' gene expression in four conditions by real time-PCR. Also the proteins expression changes of ERK and collagen VI assayed by Western blotting. Data analysis has shown that integrins' gene expression changes throughout adipocyte differentiation and pathological processes. The expressions of many integrins genes were significantly up- or down-regulated by >1.5-fold during differentiation, insulin resistant, and hypertrophic adipocytes. In addition to changes in the type of integrin, the integrins expression levels were different. Integrins, on the whole were more expressed in pathological processes relative to normal adipocytes. Also, phosphorylation of ERK 1,2 was increased >1.5-fold in differentiated, insulin resistant and hypertrophied adipocytes versus preadipocytes. Collagen VI only increased 2-fold in hypertrophied adipocytes. Examination of the total integrin gene family expression during adipocyte differentiation and pathological processes, leads to the identification of differential integrin gene expression. These results suggest that the type of integrin may not only play a role in adipocyte differentiation but also in pathological processes which may associate to increased ERK pathway activity in these conditions.

Using de novo assembly 55,268 unigenes were identified from 207.58 Gb of clean data. Amongst these, 36,265 were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms and metabolic pathways. The sequencing results showed that genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) under drought stress were enriched in pathways such as carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, many functional genes were up-regulated under severe drought stress to enhance tolerance. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that there were key hub genes related to drought stress. Hundreds of candidate genes were identified under severe drought stress, including transcriptional factors such as MYB, G2-like, ERF, C2H2, NAC, NF-X1, GRF, HD-ZIP, HB-other, HSF, C3H, GRAS, WRKY, bHLH and Trihelix.

In this study, a trypanothione synthetase gene from Trypanosoma cruzi, TcTryS, was chemically synthesized and its roles in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses were functionally characterized by generating transgenic rice overexpressing TcTryS. Overexpression of TcTryS in rice endows transgenic plants with hypersensitivity to ABA, hyposensitivity to NaCl- and mannitol-induced osmotic stress at the seed germination stage. TcTryS overexpression results in enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, cadmium, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol stresses in transgenic rice, simultaneously supported by improved physiological traits. The TcTryS-overexpression plants also accumulated greater amounts of proline, less malondialdehyde and more transcripts of stress-related genes than wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, TcTryS might play a positive role in maintaining chlorophyll content under 2,4,6-trichlorophenol stress. Histochemical staining assay showed that TcTryS renders transgenic plants better ROS-scavenging capability.

In this study, a trypanothione synthetase gene from Trypanosoma cruzi, TcTryS, was chemically synthesized and its roles in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses were functionally characterized by generating transgenic rice overexpressing TcTryS. Overexpression of TcTryS in rice endows transgenic plants with hypersensitivity to ABA, hyposensitivity to NaCl- and mannitol-induced osmotic stress at the seed germination stage. TcTryS overexpression results in enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, cadmium, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol stresses in transgenic rice, simultaneously supported by improved physiological traits. The TcTryS-overexpression plants also accumulated greater amounts of proline, less malondialdehyde and more transcripts of stress-related genes than wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, TcTryS might play a positive role in maintaining chlorophyll content under 2,4,6-trichlorophenol stress. Histochemical staining assay showed that TcTryS renders transgenic plants better ROS-scavenging capability. All of these results suggest that TcTryS could function as a key regulator in modulation of abiotic stress tolerance in plant, and may have applications in the engineering of economically important crops.

The neuropathologic hallmark of the disease is deposits of antibodies and complement, loss of astrocytes, secondary degeneration of oligodendrocytes and neurons, and necrotic lesions with infiltration of neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes. It can rarely be associated with hydrocephalus, but the cause and mechanisms that result in hydrocephalus are not clear. A 35-year-old woman with a history of NMO presented with a five-day history of progressively worsening lethargy, fatigue, somnolence, and headaches. Imaging demonstrated new hydrocephalus without evidence of obstruction, and extensive periventricular enhancement concerning for active demyelination. She underwent placement of a ventriculostomy, and subsequently underwent endoscopic biopsy and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Pathology confirmed demyelination secondary to NMO. This case provides evidence of the rapid development of hydrocephalus in association with periventricular inflammation, without aqueductal stenosis. In a state of aquaporin-4 dysfunction such as in NMO, altered cerebrospinal fluid resorption could lead to acute hydrocephalus by a nonobstructive mechanism. "

The primary aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the impact of VSN in 3 aspects: 1) activities of daily living (ADL), 2) participation, and 3) caregiver burden. The second aim was to investigate the differences in studies focusing on populations with mean age < 65 versus ≥ 65 years. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare, PsychINFO, Academic Search Premier and CENTRAL were searched systematically. Quality was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of the 115 included studies,104 provided outcomes on ADL, 15 on participation (4 studies with mean age ≥65), and 2 on caregiver burden (1 study with mean age ≥65). Quality assessment yielded scores ranging from 0 to 100%. VSN had a negative impact on ADL (i.e., independence during ADL and performance in self-care, household tasks, reading, writing, walking, wheelchair navigation) and participation (i.e., driving, community mobility, orientation, work). The impact of VSN on fulfilling social roles was unclear. VSN had a negative effect on caregiver burden. We found no clear age-related differences. VSN has a negative impact not only on patients' independence but particularly on the performance of ADL. Despite the far fewer studies of VSN as compared with ADL, VSN also seems to hamper participation and increase caregiver burden, but further research is needed. Because of the large impact, VSN during rehabilitation should be systematically and carefully assessed. A considerable number of different instruments were used to diagnose VSN. Diagnosing VSN at more than one level (function [i.e., pen-and-paper test], activities, and participation) is strongly recommended. Consensus is needed on how to assess VSN and its negative impact for research and rehabilitation practice. Systematic review Registration No.: PROSPERPO Registration No. CRD42018087483. "

However, the prevalence of vertebral fractures and hyperkyphosis is not studied well. This is relevant, because in the general population, both vertebral fractures and hyperkyphosis are associated with poor outcome. Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of vertebral fractures and hyperkyphosis in the ESKD population. The secondary aim was to assess if patients with vertebral fractures and/or hyperkyphosis more often have poor outcome after starting dialysis, such as accidental falling, functional decline and mortality compared to the patients without vertebral fractures and/or hyperkyphosis. This study included patients ≥65 years with ESKD who were enrolled in the Geriatric assessment in Older patients starting Dialysis (GOLD) study of whom a lateral chest radiograph was available. Chest radiographs were scored independently by two observers for vertebral fractures (Genant ≥1) and hyperkyphosis (≥50 degrees). The relation between vertebral fractures and hyperkyphosis with clinical outcomes (falls, decline in ADL and iADL, mortality) was studied using the Chi-square test. Of the 196 enrolled patients, chest radiographs were available for 160 patients. Mean age was 75.0 (SD ±6.9), and 35% were female. The prevalence of vertebral fractures was 43% and of hyperkyphosis 22%. Patients with hyperkyphosis had a higher one-year mortality compared to patients without hyperkyphosis (20% vs. 8%, p = 0.04). No differences were observed between patients with and without hyperkyphosis, vertebral fractures and the remaining outcomes after six months of follow-up. In patients ≥65 years old with ESKD starting dialysis, vertebral fractures are highly prevalent. In contrast to the general population, patients with vertebral fractures did experience poor outcome as often as patients without vertebral fractures. Remarkably, patients with hyperkyphosis did have a higher one-year mortality. However, these patients did not experience more functional decline or accidental falls. "

However, the immunomodulatory activity of NKL in fishes is rarely investigated. In this study, we characterized a cDNA sequence encoding an NK-lysin homolog (BpNKL) from the fish, mudskipper (Boleophthalmus pectinirostris). Sequence analysis revealed that BpNKL is most closely related to tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes) NKL. BpNKL transcript was detected in all the tested tissues, with the highest level in the gill, followed by the spleen and kidney. Upon Edwardsiella tarda infection, the mRNA expression of BpNKL in the mudskipper was significantly upregulated in the spleen, kidney, and gill. A shortened peptide derived from BpNKL, BpNKLP40, was then chemically synthesized and its biological functions were investigated. BpNKLP40 exhibited a direct antibacterial activity against some gram-negative bacteria, including E. tarda, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio harveyi, and induced hydrolysis of E. tarda genomic DNA. Intraperitoneal injection of 1.0 μg/g BpNKLP40 significantly improved the survival of mudskipper following E. tarda infection and reduced the bacterial burden in tissues and blood. Moreover, 1.0 μg/ml BpNKLP40 treatment had an enhanced effect on the intracellular killing of E. tarda by monocytes/macrophages (MO/MФ) as well as on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in MO/MФ. In conclusion, our study reveals that BpNKL plays a role against E. tarda infection in the mudskipper by not only directly killing bacteria but also through an immunomodulatory activity on MO/MФ. "

However, expression of Dscam in immune-primed arthropods after a second challenge has apparently not been confirmed. Herein, working with Dscam of Australian freshwater crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus, i.e. CqDscam), we further investigated whether immune priming is mediated by ""clouds"" of appropriate (or ""correct"") CqDscam isoforms. In crayfish that survived a first WSSV challenge (immune priming), long-lasting CqDscam expression remained higher after a second WSSV challenge. Selective CqDscam isoforms were also induced after both challenges. Based on pathogen binding assays, these WSSV-induced CqDscam isoforms had a higher WSSV binding ability, perhaps mainly mediated by Ig3-spliced variants. We therefore hypothesized that in these crayfish survivors, an unknown selection process was generating a ""correct cloud"" of CqDscam against a previously encountered pathogen. "

The phytochemical study revealed an important level of total phenolic (TPC), flavonoid (TFC) and tannin (CTC) contents in CmNano100, which correlated with a strong antioxidant capacity. CmNano100 or 170 were safe or not cytotoxic for head-kidney (HKL) and peripheral blood (PBL) leukocytes. The in vitro study demonstrated that CmNano increased the percentage of phagocytic cells, stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, and modulated antioxidant ability by increasing superoxide dismutase activity in leukocytes with respect to the control group. In addition, CmNano100 also increased the transcription of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β and down-regulated MyD88 and TNF-α mRNA transcription.

Protein deimination causes generation of neo-epitopes, affects gene regulation and also allows for protein moonlighting. Extracellular vesicles are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material. In this study, post-translationally deiminated proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are described for the first time in shark plasma. We report a poly-dispersed population of shark plasma EVs, positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers and characterised by TEM. In plasma, 6 deiminated proteins, including complement and immunoglobulin, were identified, whereof 3 proteins were found to be exported in plasma-derived EVs. A PAD homologue was identified in shark plasma by Western blotting and detected at expected 70 kDa size. Deiminated histone H3, a marker of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, was also detected in nurse shark plasma.

During neurofeedback, target brain activity is monitored in real time and fed back to the subject in a chosen format (e.g. visual stimulus). To date, we do not know how success and failure feedback are processed during neurofeedback learning. Here we analysed the event related potentials (ERPs) in response to success and failure feedback during a single neurofeedback session in two experiments. Participants in experiment 1 (n = 127) took part in one of the three neurofeedback conditions: RLA: trained to increase alpha power on the right frontal in relation to the left; LRA: the reverse of the RLA; FPA: trained to increase alpha power on the mid-frontal in relation to the mid-parietal region. In experiment 2 (n = 45), participants took part in a similar session but one group received random feedback whereas the other received valid feedback to increase right frontal alpha power. We analysed the feedback related negativity (FRN), correct positivity (CP), and P3a and P3b in response to success and failure feedback. We observed stronger FRN and CP in response to success compared to failure feedback. Additionally, the P3a in response to success feedback was higher in epochs preceded by subsequent good adjustments. Our findings indicate that people respond more strongly to success than failure feedback and that the P3a might mediate the encoding of the reinforced patterns in the brain. "

Numerous studies have examined the neural correlates of language control and shown a close relationship between language control and domain-general cognitive control. However, it remains unknown how these brain regions coordinate with each other when bilinguals exert cognitive control over linguistic and nonlinguistic representations. We addressed this gap using an extended unified structural equation modeling (euSEM) approach. Sixty-five Chinese-English bilinguals performed language switching and nonverbal switching tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The results showed that language control was served by a cooperative brain network, including the frontal lobe, the parietal cortex, subcortical areas, and the cerebellum. More importantly, we found that language control recruited more subcortical areas and connections from frontal to subcortical areas compared with domain-general cognitive control, demonstrating a reconfigurable brain network. In addition, the reconfiguration efficiency of the brain network was mainly determined by general cognitive ability but was also mediated by second language (L2) proficiency. These findings provide the first data-driven connectivity model that specifies the brain network for language control in bilinguals and also shed light on the relationship between language control and domain-general cognitive control.

This study reviews and reports our single-centre experience with hybrid aortic arch repair over the span of a decade. A total of 43 patients who underwent hybrid arch repair from 2005 to 2015 were identified. Key endpoints included the presenting pathology, perioperative details and post-operative outcomes. The mean age was 64.9 years at the commencement of surgery, (61.4% males (n=27), 38.6% females (n=16)). Presenting pathologies included: aneurysms (77%), dissections (16%), pseudoaneurysms (5%) and transections (2%). While the majority of procedures were multi-staged, single-stage interventions were completed for 16.3% (n=7) of patients. Emergent surgeries were done in 23.3% of cases; the remaining 76.7% of cases were elective. The proximal extents of endovascular repair were Zone 0 (n=4), Zone 1 (n=12), Zone 2 (n=20) and Zone 3 (n=1). The remaining 6 patients had had aberrant or anomalous distal origins of a great vessel that required debranching. Technical success rates of surgical revascularizations and subsequent endovascular stenting were both 100%. The 30-day perioperative event rates for mortality, stroke and cardiac events were 7.0% (n=3), 4.7% (n=2) and 9.3% (n=4) respectively. At the end of 2 years follow-up, total mortality and stroke rates were 11.6% (n=5) and 7.0% (n=3) respectively. The 2-year primary patency of the revascularizations was 97.8% and the associated primary-assisted patency was 100%. Secondary interventions were necessary for 32% (n=12) of the patients, 67% of which (n=8) were warranted due to endoleaks. The remaining secondary interventions were required to resolve device migration (n=1), stent graft stenosis (n=1) and disease progression (n=2). Hybrid approaches are viable alternatives to entirely open surgical treatments of acute and chronic aortic arch pathology and may be particularly attractive for high risk patients.

In this study, drug-free BVS and BMS were used in eight porcine models. We compared the angiographic and histomorphometric findings in the two groups at 4 weeks. In each pig, BVS and BMS of adequate sizes were implanted in the small branch (<3 mm) of the femoral artery. Angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and histomorphometric analysis were performed at 4 weeks. In the 4-week follow-up angiography and IVUS examination, the minimal luminal diameter was smaller and diameter stenosis was more severe in the BVS group, Histomorphometric findings indicated that the lumen area in the BVS group was smaller(0.34±0.28 mm Compared with BMS, drug-free BVS was not feasible for small-sized peripheral arteries based on the angiographic, IVUS, and histomorphometric results primarily due to insufficient mechanical support.

Our aim was to investigate the effect of sheath size on post-procedural complications after infrainguinal PVI. The Vascular Quality Initiative (2010-2017) was queried for patients undergoing infrainguinal PVI via retrograde common femoral artery access. Univariable and multivariable methods were performed to compare the effects of sheath size on access site complications, length of stay (LOS), and 30-day mortality. Of the 36,901 infrainguinal PVI procedures in the dataset, the mean age was 69 years and 59.1% of patients were male. Indications for intervention were claudication (41.6%), rest pain (13.2%), and tissue loss (45.2%). The femoral-popliteal and tibial arteries were treated in 84.7% and 35.4% of cases, respectively. Interventions included stenting (39.2%) and atherectomy (21.3%). Sheath sizes of 7 Fr, 6 Fr, 5 Fr, and 4 Fr were used in 5225 (14.1%), 24541 (66.5%), 6221 (16.9%), and 914 (2.5%) of cases, respectively. Differences among sheath sizes were observed based on ambulatory status; presence of diabetes, end-stage renal disease, previously stented ipsilateral extremities, anemia, pre-procedural anticoagulation; and procedural details, including indications, location of intervention, and intervention type (P<.001 for all). On univariable analysis, sheath size (7 Fr vs 6 Fr vs 5 Fr vs 4 Fr) was associated with differences in access site hematoma (3.5% vs 2.7% vs 2.5% vs 1.2%, P <.001), post-procedural LOS > 1 day (18.1% vs 25.3% vs 31.1% vs 27.9%, P<.001), and 30-day mortality (.9% vs 1.4% vs 1.5% vs 1.5%, P=.007). There was no difference in hematoma requiring intervention or access site stenosis/occlusion based on sheath size. Multivariable analysis revealed that a larger sheath size was independently associated with access site hematoma (7 Fr: OR 4.24, 95% CI 2.28-7.89, P<.001; 6 Fr: OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.69-5.7, P<.001; 5 Fr: OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.46-5.05, P=.002) and post-procedural LOS > 1 day (7 Fr: OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.39-2.05, P<.001; 6 Fr: OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.26-1.78, P <.001; 5 Fr: OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.26-1.8, P<.001). Access site hematoma requiring intervention and 30-day mortality were not independently associated with sheath size. In infrainguinal PVI, larger sheaths increased the risk of minor access site hematomas, but not major morbidity or mortality. Larger sheaths were associated with longer post-procedural LOS, possibly due to conservative management of hematomas. "

The aim of this study was to report outcomes of the different treatment modalities proposed for persistent and late-occurring T1aEL after EVAR. A systematic review of the literature (database searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library) was undertaken until August 2018. Studies about treatment of T1aEL following EVAR (excluding intra-operative treatments during the first EVAR) presenting a series of 5 or more patients with extractable outcome data (at least intraoperative and/or early results) were included. Meta-analyses of proportions were performed with random effects model. A total of 39 non-randomized studies were included (714 patients; 88.1% males, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 84.5-91.7; weighted mean age 75.76 years, 95% CI 74.11-77.4). Overall estimated technical success (TS) and clinical success (CS) rates were 93.2% (95% CI 90.5-95.8) and 88.2% (95% CI 84.5-91.9), respectively. Two hundred and eighteen patients underwent proximal extension (98.1% TS, 95% CI 96.3-99.8), 131 chimney-EVAR (93.9% TS, 95% CI 89.9-97.9), 97 fenestrated-EVAR (86.2% TS, 95% CI 77.3-95.1), 90 open conversion (96.5% TS, 95% CI 93-100), 71 embolization (95.2% TS, 95% CI 90.4-100), 35 endostapling (57.2% TS, 95% CI 14.1-100), and 72 conservative treatment (75.4% CS, 95% CI 56.4-94.5). Estimated overall 30-day mortality was 3.2% (95% CI 1.7-4.7), and it was higher for patients undergoing open surgery (6.6%, 95% CI 1.7-11.5). Overall, endoleak resolution during the mean follow-up of 19.4 months (95% CI 15.45-23.36) was maintained in 91% of the patients (95% CI 87.7-94.3). T1aEL repair appeared generally feasible, with good early to mid-term outcomes. Different treatments are available, and the choice should be based on endoleak characteristics, aortic anatomy and patient's surgical risk. Conservative treatment and endoleak embolization should be considered only in selected cases, such as low-flow endoleaks and unfit patients. "

From a single center retrospective data analysis, we identified and characterized subjects (age: 18-60) that presented with NAV between January 2000 and December 2015. Of the 1416 charts reviewed, 118 met inclusion criteria. Average age was 47.0 ± 9.9 years, mostly affecting women (64%). Primary diagnoses included: fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) (25.4%), isolated aneurysms (24.6%) and median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) (15.3%). Less common diagnoses were localized vasculitis of the gastrointestinal tract (LVGT) (7.6%), isolated dissection (5.1%), microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (5.1%), trauma (4.2%), segmental arterial mediolysis (4.2%), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (2.5%), Takayasu's arteritis (2.5%), polyarteritis nodosa (1.7%), idiopathic abdominal aortitis (.8%), and Loeys Dietz syndrome (.8%). Females constituted 90% of patients with FMD, 77.8% with MALS, 77.8% with isolated aneurysms, 66.7% with Takayasu arteritis and 55.6% with LVGT. Prevalent comorbidities included tobacco use (43.6%) and hypertension (52.1%). Coil embolization was used in 14.4%, anticoagulation in 11.9%, angioplasty/stenting in 11.9%, open resection/surgical revascularization in 10.2%, and prednisone in 10.2% of the cases. Conservative management was pursued in 33.1% of patients. A high degree of symptom relief was shown in 91.7%. NAV are rare and can be caused by different etiologies that primarily affect females. Hypertension and tobacco use were prevalent. Various imaging strategies revealed aneurysms, stenosis, dissection and or thrombosis affecting renal and celiac arteries. Most patients improved with conservative, medical, endovascular and or surgical approach. More research is needed to standardize management approach to patients with NAV. "

Purpose of this study is to introduce a tool for the diagnosis of abdominal aorta aneurysms (AAA) avoiding the use of CM. With and without CM CTs of patients with AAA were evaluated. A mathematical algorithm was implemented to allow visualization of the inner aortic lumen in the series without CM. First step of the algorithm consisted in manually highlighting a squared ROI (Region Of Interest) close to the target aortic area. The rest of the algorithm is completely automated and performs the following flow of operations: the ""Kantorovich"" algorithm is applied to the ROI for image enhancement. Then, a wavelet decomposition method is applied to identify the different frequency components of the image. Exploiting the wavelet decomposition, the system selects the low frequency components of the image, corresponding to the major structures. Thresholding method, based on the analysis of the gray-level histogram, is then perfomed to extract the contours of the vessel. At this point the extraction of the pervious area is completed. Final images were compared to the contrast enhanced scans, valued as gold standard. To validate the algorithm an analysis of the results has been made considering the following types of error: En= #m / #ROI ΔA=|1-(#CM /#CEX)| (# The algorithm was applied to 233 CT images. Extracted images were compared to the ones with CM. Mean values of the numerical errors ranged from 0.12 to 0.17 for E The developed mathematical algorithm allows to detect the position of the vessel lumen and to extract with a good accuracy its contours. Our experience shows encouraging results and suggests a possible future clinical application to reduce CT contrast medium use. "

A fish-mouth incision is fashioned below the tibial tuberosity into the popliteal crease, resulting in an anterior soft tissue flap and smaller posterior soft tissue flap. Thus the incision line will be on the posterior thigh, instead of the end of the stump. The patellar tendon is detached from the anterior tibial tuberosity, then the dissection is carried proximally behind the patellar tendon, and the adjoining tendons of the vastus medalis and vastus lateralis until the patella can be flipped over to expose the posterior patellar surface and joint capsule. The patellar's posterior surface is shaved down flat to medulla bone, with an electric small-toothed bone saw and large bur. The femur is then cleared circumferentially at its base. The foot is then placed at 90 degrees, creating a 45-degree angle between the femur and the tibia, and the femur is then transected with a gigli saw near the base or just above the base, depending on the size of the patellar surface area. This creates a 45-degree angle to the femur posteriorly, which allows it to be secured to the end of the femur with less chance of shifting. The fascia is then circumferentially closed around the patella and femur, then the remnant patellar tendon is sutured to the tendons of the posterior compartment. The dermis and skin are then closed in the standard tension free manner using 2-0 interrupted vicryl sutures followed by interrupted 2-0 nylon vertical mattress sutures (Figure 1). The dressing consisted of a single layer of Adaptic Non-Adhering Dressing to allow drainage, gauze fluffs, 6-inch kerlix and finally a 6-inch ACE wrap was applied. The dressings are left intact for 2-3 days and then replaced daily. A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients who had undergone a Gritti-Stokes amputation from January 2016 to September 2017 by a single surgeon. Estimated blood loss, operative time, perioperative and postoperative complications were assessed. A total of 16 Gritti-Stokes amputations (GSA) were performed on 15 patients by a single surgeon between 1/7/2016 to 9/19/2017. In our series intraoperative outcomes were notable for an average estimated blood loss (EBL) of 114 mL, lower than the traditional above knee amputation (average EBL 300-500 mL) A reevaluation of the Gritti - Stokes amputation is warranted in the United States as an alternative to the traditional above knee amputation whenever possible. Our experience with a small series of Gritti-Stokes amputations has yielded promising advantages including potential for decreased blood loss, and fewer complications in the postoperative period when compared to the standard above knee amputation (AKA). Retained muscle attachments facilitate increased limb function, and allows use of slide joint prosthetics, which are gaining popularity for ambulatory patients. The thickened skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the patella, and the posterior incision, have the potential benefit of protection against trauma and osteomyelitis seen with traditional AKA were the open ended medullary bone is deep to the incision. We believe that for these same reasons the GSA should be considered in the non-ambulatory patient as well. "

Early cannulation arteriovenous grafts (ECAVGs) help decrease the use of central venous catheters (CVCs), thus potentially decreasing the cost of care. However, a formal financial analysis has not been completed that also includes the cost of CVC-related complications and secondary interventions. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the overall financial costs associated with ECAVGs on ESRD patients during a one-year period. Access modality, complications, secondary interventions, hospital outcomes, and cost of care were determined for 397 sequential patients who underwent access creation between July 2014 and October 2018. A detailed financial analysis was completed, including an evaluation of implant, supplies, medications, labs, labor, and other direct costs. All variables were measured at the time of the index procedure, 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, 270 days, and one year. There were 131 patients who underwent AVF and 266 who underwent ECAVG for dialysis access. The average cost of care was $17,523 for AVF and $5,894 for ECAVG at one year (P<0.01). Fewer central venous catheter (CVC)-related complications and secondary interventions associated with ECAVGs saved $11,630 per ESRD patient, primarily in the form of supply costs. Fewer CVCs in the ECAVG patients led to an additional $1,083 decrease in cost associated with sepsis reduction at one year. A subsequent decrease in length of stay and ICU utilization led to an additional $2.0M decrease in annual cost of care for ESRD patients. The use of ECAVGs has significant cost savings over using an AVF and CVC for urgent start dialysis in ESRD patients. This cost savings is secondary to decreased CVC-related complications and fewer secondary interventions. Significant national savings are possible with appropriate use of ECAVGs in ESRD patients. "

However, advances in endovascular technologies and treatment by multidisciplinary limb preservation teams have shown improved outcomes. The aim of our study was to compare perioperative and long-term outcomes following open vs. PVI procedures in diabetic patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) treated in a multidisciplinary setting. All patients presenting to our multidisciplinary diabetic limb preservation service from 6/2012-07/2018 were enrolled in a prospective database. Patients who underwent either open lower extremity bypass (LEB) or PVI for CLTI were included in the analysis. Perioperative (30-day) complications and 4-year patency and limb salvage rates were compared for PVI vs. LEB using chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier curve analyses, and stepwise multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. A total of 195 lower extremity revascularization procedures were performed in 120 patients (mean age 65.0±1.0 years, 61.7% male, 63.3% black), including 53 (27.2%) open and 142 (72.8%) PVI. Nearly two-thirds of procedures (65.6%) treated multilevel disease, while 27.2% treated isolated tibial disease and 7.2% treated isolated femoro-popliteal disease. More than half of procedures (53.3%) were performed for WIfI stage 4 limbs, 25.1% for stage 3, and 21.6% for stage 1/2. In the LEB group, 67.9% of targets were infrapopliteal. In the PVI group, 63.4% of procedures were isolated tibial interventions or were multilevel interventions including the tibial segment. Perioperative complications occurred in 52.8% of LEB vs. 12.0% of PVI (P<.001). At 4 years postoperatively, there was no significant difference in crude (unadjusted) primary patency for PVI vs. LEB (34.5±6.6% vs. 49.6±8.1, P=0.89). Secondary patency was better for the LEB group (50.3±7.4% vs. 55.4±7.5%; P=0.04), but amputation-free survival was similar (65.1±6.7% vs. 60.9±9.7%; P=0.79). After adjusting for baseline differences between groups, primary patency [HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.34-1.10)] and amputation-free survival [HR 1.51 (95% CI 0.71-2.34)] remained similar for PVI vs. LEB, but secondary patency was persistently lower for PVI [HR 0.35 (95% CI 0.14-0.90)]. In this cohort of diabetic patients with CLTI undergoing predominantly tibial interventions, open revascularization was associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications than PVI. While secondary patency rates were better following LEB, our data suggest that an endovascular-first approach results in equivalent long-term amputation-free survival for diabetic patients treated in a multidisciplinary setting.

Previous studies have shown that femoral arteries were more prone to calcify and to develop osteoid metaplasia (OM). So far the impact of OM on local and systemic cardiovascular events remains unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of OM in histological analysis of femoral plaque for the occurrence of mid- and long-term adverse cardiovascular events. Local inflammation has also been investigated. Between 2008 and 2015, 86 femoral atheromatous samples were harvested during femoral endarterectomy (81 patients, 86 limbs) and processed for histomorphological analyses of calcifications and inflammation (monocytes/macrophages and B cells). Histological findings were compared with the long-term patients' follow-up, including major adverse cardiac event (MACE), major adverse limb event (MALE), mortality, Rutherford classification and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Frequencies were presented as percentage, continuous data as mean and standard deviation. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. Median follow-up was 42.4 months [26.9 - 58.8]. Clinically, 23 (28%) patients underwent a MACE, and a MALE occurred in 18 (21%) limbs. The survival rate was 87.2% at 36 months. Histopathological analysis revealed osteoid metaplasia in 41 (51%) of the samples, without any significant impact on the occurrence of MACE, MALE or mortality. Sheet-like and nodule types seem to influence MACE but it was barely significant (.07 and .05, respectively), and a lack of nodule type was associated with MALE event (P=.01). The inflammatory analysis revealed among patients who presented a MACE, a significantly higher rate on pre-operative white blood cell formulae of monocytes (P=.04) and neutrophils (P=.04), correlated with higher B cells counts in plaque sample. Similarly, MALE were significantly associated with a higher rate of neutrophils in preoperative blood samples (P=.0008) and a higher number of B cells CD20+ in the samples. Osteoid metaplasia is part of femoral calcifications in almost 50% of the cases but does not seem to be an independent predictive variable for MACE or MALE. However, a higher rate of B cells infiltration of the plaque and pre-operative neutrophils blood count may be predictive of adverse events during follow up, as well as nodule calcification's type. "

Our study will investigate the role of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) as a potential neuroprotective mechanism. RIPC is a well-tolerated stimulus that, through neuronal and humoral pathways, generates a systemic environment of greater resistance to subsequent ischemic insults. Patients undergoing RIPC before CEA will have improved postoperative neurocognitive scores compared to patients undergoing standard care. Patients undergoing CEA will be randomized 1:1 to RIPC or standard clinical care. Those randomized to RIPC will undergo a standard protocol of 4 cycles of RIPC. Each RIPC cycle will involve 5 minutes of forearm ischemia with 5 minutes of reperfusion. Forearm ischemia will be induced by a blood pressure cuff inflated to 200mmHg or at least 15mmHg higher than the systolic pressure if systolic > 185mmHg. This will occur after anesthesia induction and during incision/dissection but before manipulation or clamping of the carotid; thus, patients will be blinded to their assignment. Before carotid endarterectomy, all patients will undergo baseline neurocognitive testing in the form of a Montreal-Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox. MoCA testing only will be conducted on postoperative day 1 in the hospital. The full neurocognitive testing battery will again be conducted at 1-month follow up in the office. Changes from baseline will be compared between arms at the follow-up time points.

The primary endpoint, change in MoCA scores, will be analyzed using a random effects model and secondary outcomes will be analyzed using either linear or logistic regression where appropriate. RIPC, if shown to be effective in protecting patients from neurocognitive decline following CEA, represents a safe, inexpensive, and easily implementable method of neuroprotection. "

With regard to two splenic artery aneurysms, the proximal aneurysm was treated surgically, whereas the peripheral aneurysm that was located deeply in the abdomen was treated with coil embolization. The celiac artery aneurysm located at the bifurcation of the common hepatic artery and splenic artery, an intracranial aneurysm clip was used. The left and right renal aneurysms were resected and renal arteries were reconstructed surgically. The postoperative course was uneventful. The pathological diagnosis of all aneurysms was segmental arterial mediolysis. The reconstructed vessels were patent without stenosis or recurrence at 1 year after the operation. Hybrid treatment involving surgical resection, endovascular coil emblization, and obliteration with clips was useful in the treatment of multiple visceral artery aneurysms. "

We investigated the role of mentoring relationships of integrated Vascular Surgery residents, while in medical school. We hypothesized that mentoring relationships between medical students and vascular surgeons would have a positive effect on match outcome in the integrated vascular surgery residency match. We utilized an online survey that respondents completed on a smartphone, tablet, or computer. This was created with Qualtrics Software. The survey was circulated to all North American Integrated Vascular Surgery residents, with the support of the APDVS Recruitment Committee and the SVS Resident/Student Outreach Committee. Questions were posed either as Likert Scale and as multiple choice. Data were analyzed in Stata. Response rate (67 total responses out of 241 polled residents) was 28%. Earlier PGY year residents were more likely to have had vascular surgeon mentors (p=0.033). There was no association between having a mentor and match rank; however, those with vascular surgeon mentors matched higher on their rank list (p=0.022). 50% of respondents indicated that mentoring was influential in the choice of integrated residency. Respondents with non-vascular surgeon mentors were more likely to answer negatively regarding their mentor's knowledge about other integrated (p<0.0001) and traditional programs (p<0.0001). Residents with a vascular surgeon mentor were more likely to respond positively to this question (p< 0.0001). Regarding the effectiveness of mentorship, 81% indicated their mentor was accessible, 92% responded that their mentor demonstrated professional integrity, and 76% responded that their mentor prioritized their success. Integrated vascular surgery residents were generally positive about their medical school mentors. Our data indicate that surgical mentorship in medical school is effective, both in influencing medical students to choose the vascular surgery specialty, and in improving match rank - vascular surgeons were more knowledgeable and mentees with vascular surgeon mentors tended to be more successful in the match.

It is hypothesized that RAAs are associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms (IcAs). The objective of this study was to better define the association of IcAs in women with RAAs. Women aged 20 to 60 years-old having RAAs encountered at the University of Michigan from 2001-2016 were identified for study. Their clinical status and radiologic images were retrospectively reviewed. with particular attention directed to the prevalence of IcAs. Phenotypic characteristics predictive of associated cerebrovascular lesions were assessed using various statistical analyses, including binomial logistic regression. Among 83 women with RAAs, the average age at time of RAA detection was 45.3 ± 9.9 years (range, 20-60 years). Hypertension affected 67.5% (n56) and poorly controlled hypertension prompted imaging for suspected renal arterial disease in 14.5% (n12) patients. Multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia occurred in 14.8% (n12) of patients, and unifocal stenosis affected 8.4% (n7). Imaging of the intracranial vasculature (n31) documented 12 aneurysms in nine women; the cavernous internal carotid artery being most commonly affected. Among the study's patients, 24.1% (n20) had an 'at-risk disorder for IcA formation', although the frequency of relevant 'at-risk disorders' in those with and without IcAs was not statistically different (p=0.21). Rupture risk defined by PHASES score was less than 1% for 10 IcAs, but two IcAs carried a 2.4% and 7.2% respective rupture risk over a 5 year time period, respectively. Surgical management was pursued in 50% (n6) of the study's IcAs. Coexisting RAAs and IcAs may reflect a systemic arteriopathy. IcAs appear to occur with greater frequency in women with RAAs than the general population. This observation warrants prospective investigation as to the clinical appropriateness and relevance of cerebrovascular imaging in women having RAAs. Furthermore, this study's findings prompt further investigation of the underlying pathogenesis of what appears to be a broader and more complex arterial disease than previously recognized. "

Primary and assisted primary patency rates did not differ according to the crossing of the elbow. The primary patency rate of AVGs using deep veins for outflow was inferior compared to AVGs using superficial veins. But the assisted primary patency rate showed no difference. The use of a deep vein for outflow in the forearm loop AVG is a safe strategy for patients with exhausted superficial veins. "

Data from patients hospitalized and treated for BCS accompanied with inferior vena cava thrombosis between January 1997 and December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-two patients received traditional open operation (open group). Fifty-six patients received pre-opening and staged percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the inferior vena cava (PTA group). Baseline and clinical data were compared between groups. The patients were followed for up to 60 months. Postoperative recurrence rates and restenosis degree were recorded. Eighty-eight patients were included (47 males and 41 females), aged 41.82±10.12 years (range: 29-65 years). In the open group, no pulmonary arterial embolism was found during and after the operation, and the technique success rate was 100%. One patient died of intrathoracic bleeding. In the PTA group, two patients had shifting of thrombus in the inferior vena cava that blocked the blood flow restored by the pre-opening, one resulted in treatment failure, while the other had blood flow restored by dilation with a 12 mm balloon; the success rate was 55/56 (98.21%). The median follow-up time was 32 months (range: 3-60 months). Two patients in the open group developed restenosis 2 years after operation (recurrence rate: 6.25%), and were successfully treated by balloon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Seven patients in the PTA group had severe restenosis 18-42 months after operation (recurrence rate: 12.96%). No thrombosis was found in these seven patients, normal blood flow was restored in the inferior vena cava after balloon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Pre-opening and staged percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the inferior vena cava is a safe and simple method for the treatment of BCS accompanied with inferior vena cava thrombosis, with satisfactory treatment effectiveness that could be applied in clinical practice.

To compare standard TVS technique and a developed puncture technique for implanting TVS and evaluate the utility and feasibility of this protocol after arterial lesions, in pigs. Vascular injuries were inflicted in both hind limbs of 30 pigs, and vascular interventions were performed, using standard and puncture TVS. Since each pig was implanted with both types of TVSs it was possible to simultaneously monitor, analyze and compare parameters such as, the mean arterial pressure (MAP in mmHg), blood flow (ml/min) and insertion times, in the same animal. It was observed that the MAP in the limbs recovered and approached systemic MAP, in 100% of the experiments, in both groups. Analysis of the blood flow data showed that this parameter was significantly reduced in the puncture TVS group (110.36 ± 9.99 ml/min vs 153.20 ± 18.57 ml/min, p=0.001). On the other hand, the insertion time for the standard TVS was significantly greater than that of the puncture shunt (15.32 ± 3.08 min vs.10.37 ± 1.7 min, p=0.001). Furthermore, it was found that the primary and secondary patency and complication rates were similar for both TVS types. Thus, given the adequate MAP recovery and reduction in implantation time observed in this experimental and in an animal model study, the use of the puncture TVS technique is effective and feasible.

Retrospective analysis (January 1995 to January 2014) of the Registry of vascular and valvular allografts transplant in the autonomous community of Catalonia, Spain (ReVAC) was performed for identifying patients with CLI who required infra-inguinal bypass with cryopreserved arterial allografts. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Ver. 20 for Mac (Chicago, USA). A total of 149 patients with CLI (mean age of 70.1 years) were analyzed. 102 patients (68.5%) had a grade IV lesion (Fontaine classification). In the overall follow-up, 24.8% of patients required a reintervention. Overall graft occlusion, infection and dilation rate were 52.3%, 6% and 5.4% respectively. Overall 30-days mortality was 0.7%. 5-year primary patency rate and limb salvage rate were 38.6% and 50.2% respectively. Survival rate at 5 years was 54.2%. Major Adverse Limb Event (MALE)-free rate was 21.5% at 5 years. Revascularization to a distal target vessel was an independent positive predictive risk factor for a lower limb salvage rate and lower primary patency rate. Dyslipemia was related to a lower limb salvage rate and represents a risk factor involved in major adverse limb events. Arterial allografts seem to represent a suboptimal alternative although some selected patients could beneficiate of them. 5-year results are disappointing and more studies are required to know other predictor factors for a better selection of patients.

Predictors of freedom from graft occlusion after balloon angioplasty by a multivariate analysis were a single treated lesion (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.17 - 0.85; p=0.0189), balloon angioplasty within 90 days after bypass surgery (HR 3.59; 95% CI 1.56 - 8.07; p=0.0033) and using a cutting balloon (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.17 - 0.97; p=0.0426). The freedom from graft occlusion rate after balloon angioplasty remained relatively high. Furthermore, better results can be expected in single treated lesions and cases of balloon angioplasty after 90 days following bypass surgery or in which a cutting balloon was used. Balloon angioplasty for lower-limb bypass graft stenosis was shown to be a useful treatment. "

Some studies have shown the benefit of preventive inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) embolization, but its efficacy and cost-effectiveness continue to be controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of this procedure on the increase in aneurysmal sac diameter during follow-up. All consecutive patients who underwent the embolization of the IMA prior to EVAR in our center, between January 2014 and July 2016, were included. We retrospectively compared the diameter of the aortic aneurysm sac, the rate of endoleak and reinterventions, and the theoretical cost of management between these patients (group 2) and a historical cohort of patients treated for EVAR before January 2014 who did not undergo prior IMA embolization (group 1). Two hundred and twenty four patients were retrospectively analysed. After exclusion, we compared a group of 37 embolized patients with a control group of 46 patients. The rate of enlargement in the aneurysmal sac diameter was significantly higher in the control group at 2 years (27.9% vs 4.3%, p=0.025). The type II endoleak rate at 2 years was significantly higher in the control group (53.1% vs 18.2%, P=0.012) as was the aneurysm-related re-intervention rate (31.1% vs 8.1%, p=0.013). Multivariate analysis confirmed these results. At 2 years of follow-up, there was no difference in the overall cost of patient management between 2 groups. Preventive IMA embolization is an effective, reliable and cost-effective technique that seems to reduce the rate of the aneurysmal sac diameter enlargement, type II endoleak and reinterventions after EVAR.

Recent evidence suggests that the mRNA levels of the RNASEK gene possess biomarker attributes in patients with prostate cancer. In the present study, we used 3' RACE and next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect and identify novel RNASEK transcripts. Computational analysis of the NGS data revealed new alternative splicing events that support the existence of novel RNASEK alternative transcripts. As a result, eight RNASEK splice variants were discovered and their expression profile was analyzed with the use of nested PCR in a wide panel of human cell lines, originating from several cancerous and/or normal human tissues. Based on in silico analysis, six of the eight novel RNASEK transcripts are predicted to encode new protein isoforms, while the remaining two splice variants could be considered as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) candidates.

The generalizability, computational efficiency and open-source availability of deep learning algorithms and related software, particularly those utilizing convolutional neural networks, have produced paradigm shifts within the field. This impact is evident from topical prevalance in the literature, conference and workshop themes and winning methodologies in relevant competitions. In this work, we review the various state-of-the-art approaches to learning and prediction and/or optimizing image transformations using convolutional neural networks. Although of primary importance within the quantitative imaging domain, image registration algorithmic development, in the context of these deep learning strategies, has received comparatively less attention than its counterparts (e.g., image segmentation). Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in this particular subfield which has been presented in various research venues. We contextualize these contributions within the broader scope of deep learning advancements and, in so doing, attempt to facilitate the leveraging and further development of such techniques within the medical imaging research community.

However, traditional sequences are time-consuming and require breath-holding. Our aim was to evaluate the image quality of LV functional assessment with a novel, accelerated, free-breathing cine sequence and to compare LV functional parameters between it and a traditional sequence. This was a prospective cohort study of 31 patients with cardiomyopathy. All studies were performed on a 1.5 Tesla scanner. LV function was first determined using contiguous short axis slices covering the left ventricle from the base to the apex acquired with the standard cine sequence. Next, the accelerated sequence was acquired for each patient. The Wilcoxon Matched-Pair Sign Rank Test was used to compare image quality between the accelerated and traditional cine imaging sequences. Standard and accelerated left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction were compared using linear regression. Bland-Altman plots were then constructed to evaluate agreement, interobserver and intraobserver variability for left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Mean acquisition time was 29 s for the accelerated sequence vs. 410 s for the traditional sequence. Qualitative assessment of image quality was similar for both sequences (p = 0.23). There were no significant differences in terms of LVEDV, LVESV, LVSV, LV mass and LVEF when calculated from either sequence with very good agreement between the standard and accelerated sequences. The mean differences with 95% limits of agreement were as follows: LV mass (-0.6, -22.9 g, 21.6 g), LVEDV (5.1 mL, -18.4 mL, 28.9 mL), LVEF (-0.3, -5.4, 4.7), LVESV (4.0 mL, -12.0 mL, 20.0 mL), LVSV (1.1 mL, -13.3 mL, 15.5 mL). Interobserver variability ranged from 0.1 to 6.3% while intraobserver variability ranged from 0.1 to 1.8%. The accelerated free-breathing cine sequence performed similarly to standard of care multi breath-hold cine imaging and was acquired in a fraction of the time without the need for breath-holding. If applied to clinical practice, this sequence can significantly reduce scanning time and facilitate CMR scanning in those patients who are unable to breath-hold. "

This paper discusses a thorough literature review of recent methods of brain tumor segmentation from brain MRI images. It includes the performance and quantitative analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Different methods of image segmentation are briefly explained with the recent contribution of various researchers. Here, an effort is made to open new dimensions for readers to explore the concerned area of research. Through the entire review process, it has been observed that the combination of Conditional Random Field (CRF) with Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) and CRF with DeepMedic or Ensemble are more effective for the segmentation of tumor from the brain MRI images.

In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method and checkerboard method were used to investigate potential synergies between CFZ and moxifloxacin (MOX) or capreomycin (CAP). 30 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were collected, including 13 MDR strains, 2 extensive drug- resistant (XDR) strains, 3 pan-sensitive strains and 12 strains resistant to other drugs. When the minimum fractional inhibitory concentration indexes (FICIs) were calculated, synergy was found in 21 (70.00%) M. tuberculosis strains against the CFZ/CAP combination and 29 (96.67%) against the CFZ/MOX combination. When the maximum FICIs were calculated, 10 out of 15 MDR/XDR strains and 2 out of 15 other drug-resistant or pan-sensitive strains showed antagonism against the CFZ/CAP combination, whilst 8 out of 15 MDR/XDR strains and 1 out of 15 other drug-resistant or pan-sensitive strains showed antagonism against the CFZ/MOX combination, respectively. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the combination of CFZ and MOX shows better synergism than the combination of CFZ and CAP. The MDR/XDR isolates are more likely to show antagonism than the other drug-resistant or pan-sensitive strains in both CFZ/MOX and CFZ/CAP combinations. Taken together, we suggest that CFZ, in combination with MOX, may be a promising drug regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB, especially for the susceptible M. tuberculosis infectious. "

Nitrofurantoin (NIT), with high therapeutic concentrations in urine, is recommended as first-line drug for both empiric treatment and chemoprophylaxis of UTIs. Although NIT resistance in K. pneumoniae is relatively high, the resistance mechanism is less understood. Here, we collected a NIT-resistant K. pneumoniae (NRKP, MIC=128 mg/L) and investigated the resistance mechanism. Addition of efflux pump inhibitors increased the susceptibility of NRKP to NIT (MIC, decreased from 128 to 32 mg/L), implying the important role of efflux pumps in NIT resistance. qRT-PCR analysis showed that NRKP had > 100-fold increased expression of ramA, which was further demonstrated to be caused by ramR mutation. Deletion of ramA lead to a 4-fold decrease in the MIC of NIT, and the expression levels of efflux pumps acrB and oqxB were downregulated by 4-7 folds. Complementation of ramA restored both of the MIC value and the expression level of acrB and oqxB in ramA mutant strain. In order to confirm the role of acrB and oqxB in NIT resistance, gene knockout strains were constructed. Deletion of acrB or oqxB alone lead to a 4-fold decrease in the MIC of NIT, and deletion of acrB and oqxB simultaneously lead to a 16-fold decrease in the MIC of NIT. These results demonstrated that AcrAB and OqxAB contributed to NIT resistance in K. pneumoniae. "

These proteins operate within a coordinated pathway to completely saccharify homogalacturonan (HG). Polysaccharide lyase family 2 (PL2) is divided into two major subfamilies that are broadly-associated with contrasting 'endolytic' (PL2A) or 'exolytic' (PL2B) activities on HG. In the Y. enterocolitica genome, the PL2A gene is adjacent to an independent carbohydrate binding module from family 32 (YeCBM32) known to specifically bind HG and possess a N-terminal secretion tag. Independent CBMs are rare in nature and, most commonly, are fused to enzymes in order to potentiate catalysis. The unconventional gene architecture of YePL2A and YeCBM32, therefore, may represent an ancestral relic of a fission event that decoupled PL2A from its cognate CBM. To provide further insight into the evolution of this pectinolytic locus and the molecular basis of HG depolymerisation within Y. enterocolitica, we have resurrected a YePL2A-YeCBM32 chimera and demonstrated that the extant PL2A digests HG more efficiently. In addition, we have engineered a tryptophan from the active site of the exolytic YePL2B into YePL2A (YePL2A-K291W) and demonstrated, using X-ray crystallography of substrate complexes, that it is a structural determinant of exo-activity within the PL2 family. In this manner, surrogate structural platforms may assist in the study of phylogenetic relationships informed by the extant and resurrected sequences, and can be used to overcome challenging structural problems within carbohydrate active enzyme families.

During sample preparation, macromolecules interact with the air-water interface, which often leads to detrimental effects such as denaturation or adoption of preferred orientations, ultimately hindering structure determination. Randomly biotinylating the protein of interest (for example, at its primary amines) and then tethering it to a cryo-EM grid coated with two-dimensional crystals of streptavidin (acting as an affinity surface) can prevent the protein from interacting with the air-water interface. Recently, this approach was successfully used to solve a high-resolution structure of a test sample, a bacterial ribosome. However, whether this method can be used for samples where interaction with the air-water interface has been shown to be problematic remains to be determined. Here we report a 3.1Å structure of an RNA polymerase II elongation complex stalled at a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion (Pol II EC(CPD)) solved using streptavidin grids. Our previous attempt to solve this structure using conventional sample preparation methods resulted in a poor quality cryo-EM map due to Pol II EC(CPD)'s adopting a strong preferred orientation. Imaging the same sample on streptavidin grids improved the angular distribution of its view, resulting in a high-resolution structure. This work shows that streptavidin affinity grids can be used to address known challenges posed by the interaction with the air-water interface. "

The α-galactosidase gene (GLA) c.337T>C/p.Phe113Leu variant was originally described in patients with late-onset cardiac forms of Fabry disease (FD), who had residual α-galactosidase activity. It has since emerged as the most commonly reported GLA variant in Portuguese subjects diagnosed with FD but is also prevalent in the Italian population, where two boys carrying the GLA Leu113 allele were identified in a large-scale newborn screening program, the variant allele segregating in both cases with the same surrounding haplotype. To further delineate the genotype-phenotype correlations of this GLA variant, we have reviewed the natural history and clinical phenotypes of 11 symptomatic Portuguese males, from 10 unrelated families originating from several different areas in mainland Portugal and Madeira Island, who were diagnosed with FD associated with the GLA Leu113 allele in a diversity of clinical and screening settings. Nine of the patients were the probands of their respective families. To test whether the GLA Leu113 allele inherited by the 10 Portuguese and the two Italian families resulted from independent mutational events, we have additionally performed a haplotype analysis with 5 highly polymorphic, closely linked microsatellite markers surrounding the GLA gene. Hemizygosity for the GLA Leu113 variant allele is associated with a late-onset form of FD, invariably presenting with severe cardiac involvement. Clinically relevant cerebrovascular and kidney involvement may also occur in some patients but the pathogenic relationship between the incomplete α-galactosidase deficiency and the risks of stroke and of chronic kidney disease is not straightforward. The observation that the Leu113 allele segregated within the same GLA microsatellite haplotype in both the Portuguese and Italian families suggests its inheritance from a common ancestor. "

The primary goal of the study was to describe patients' characteristics, procedures and perioperative anaesthetic management in France and compare them to the results of the European APRICOT trial. Secondary outcomes were the description of major perioperative complications and the determination of human resources organisation possibly associated with these perioperative complications. Overall 3535 procedures collected in 20 facilities (17 teaching hospitals, one community hospital and two private institutions) were analysed. Comparison between the French and European APRICOT cohorts found differences related to the more specialised French centres participating to the study. Overall complications (respiratory complications, haemodynamic instability, cardiac arrest, drug errors, and anaphylactic reactions) were observed in 6.4 % [95% CI: 5.6; 6.3] of cases. Multivariate analysis identified the anaesthesiologist's experience of < 15 years and the absence of an anaesthetic nurse as human factors independently associated with an increased risk for perioperative complications. The current study identified some important differences between the French and the whole APRICOT cohort in terms of preoperative evaluation, surgical specialties involved, and monitoring of neuromuscular blockade. It confirms that, in France, the presence of an anaesthetic nurse and of an experienced anaesthesiologist prevents anaesthetic complications. "

The omics approach takes a look en masse at the different genes, proteins, metabolomes, and the microbiome of the ticks that could be differentiated during pathogen infection. Data from this approach revealed that oxidative stress-related molecules in ticks are differentiated and possibly being exploited by the pathogens to evade the tick's immune response.

Shrimp were cold shocked at 13 °C for 3 min, then exposed to air at 15 °C for 12 h, and finally revived in water at 25 °C. Hemocyte structure remained intact with only slight distortions of some organelles and nuclear membrane under the stress. Phenoloxidase (PO), lysozyme (Lys) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities, glutamine (Gln) content and relative mRNA expressions of prophenoloxidase (proPO), β-1,3-glucan binding protein (LGBP), ferrin (Fer) and glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP 78) increased and reached peak levels after 3 h-9 h of air exposure, and then decreased to relatively stable levels in the prolonged period of air exposure. The total hemocyte count (THC) and gene expressions of proPO, Fer and LGBP at the end of waterless storage were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those in fresh shrimp while no significant difference (p ≥ 0.05) was found between revived and fresh shrimp in PO, Lys, GGT activities, Gln content and gene expression level of GRP 78. Of all the hemocytes, the percentage of semi granular cells (SGC) and granular cells (GC) significantly decreased after 6-9 h of storage, while hyaline cells (HC) dramatically increased after 9 h of storage to compensate the loss of SGC and GC. Results suggested that the low temperature and air exposure caused significant immunological response to the shrimp, but the damages to the immune system were partly reparable. "

In conventional meta-analyses, the risks of random errors are insufficiently evaluated. Many meta-analyses which appear conclusive might in fact be inconclusive due to risks of random errors. We hypothesize that for interventions in critical care, false positive and negative findings frequently become apparent when accounting for the risks of random error. We aim to investigate to which extent apparently conclusive conventional meta-analyses remain conclusive when adjusting statistical significance levels and confidence intervals considering sparse data and repeated testing through Trial Sequential Analysis (TSA). We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for reviews of interventions in critical care. We used TSA with the relative risk reduction from the estimated meta-analysed intervention effects adjusted for heterogeneity based on the observed diversity. We report proportions of meta-analyses and potential inconclusive findings of positive, neutral, and negative conclusions based on conventional naïve meta-analyses which use an alpha of 5% and 95% confidence intervals. In TSA-controlled meta-analyses showing a beneficial or harmful intervention effect, we assessed the risk of bias by six Cochrane domains. A total of 464 reviews containing 1080 meta-analyses of (co-)primary outcomes were analysed. From the 266 conventional meta-analyses suggesting a beneficial effect, 133 (50%) were true positive and 133 (50%) potentially false positive according to TSA. From the 755 conventional meta-analyses suggesting a neutral effect, there were 214 (28%) true neutral and 541 (72%) potentially false neutral according to TSA. From the 59 conventional meta-analyses suggesting a harmful effect, 17 (29%) were true negative and 42 (71%) were potentially false negative according to TSA. When the true beneficial and true harmful meta-analyses according to TSA were evaluated for risk of bias, new TSAs conducted on only trials with overall low risk of bias showed only firm evidence of a beneficial effect on one outcome and a harmful effect on one outcome. Out of all meta-analyses in critical care, a large proportion may reach false conclusions due to unknown risks of random type I or type II errors. Future critical care meta-analyses, should aim for establishing an effect of interventions accounting for risks of bias and random errors. "

Recently, it was found that lncRNA long non-coding RNA tumor suppressor candidate 7 (TUSC7) could play tumor suppressive roles in several cancers. However, the function and underlying regulatory mechanism of lncRNA TUSC7 in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains largely unclear. The expression levels of TUSC7 and microRNAs-616 (miR-616) were analyzed by real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. Cell cycle and cell metastasis associated protein expressions were determined by western blotting. Cell proliferation, cycle and metastasis were determined by CCK-8 cell viability, colony formation, flow cytometer, wound scratch and transwell assays respectively in vitro. RNA pull-down, luciferase and western blotting assays were used to examine the target relationship between TUSC7 and miR-616 or that between miR-616 and suppressors of cytokine signaling 4 (5) (SOCS4 (SOCS5)). The functional effects of TUSC7 through sponging miR-616 were further examined using a xenograft tumor mouse model in vivo. TUSC7 was downexpressed in EC tissues and cell lines, and TUSC7 upregulation could remarkably inhibit cell proliferation, cycle progression and metastasis in EC cells. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that TUSC7 can interact with miR-616 and decrease its expression, thereby upregulating the expression of miR-616's targets SOCS4 (SOCS5). Additionally, in vivo experiments using a xenograft tumor mouse model revealed that TUSC7 can serve as a tumor suppressor through sponging miR-616, and upregulating SOCS4 (SOCS5) in EC. In this study, a newly identified regulatory mechanism of lncRNA TUSC7/miR-616/ SOCS4 (SOCS5) axis was systematically studied, which may hold promise as a promising target for EC treatment. "

The stromal interactive molecule 2 (STIM2) is a calcium sensor protein that regulates the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Whereas, whether STIM2 is associated with I/R injury remains largely unclear. We report here that STIM2, but not its homologue STIM1, is upregulated in cultured H9c2 cells, a cell model for cardiomyocytes, following I/R injury. In addition, the knockdown of STIM2, but not STIM1, reduces H9c2 cell apoptosis following I/R injury, and similar results were obtained in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes. This anti-apoptotic effect could be attributed to the inhibited activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Moreover, STIM2 knockdown reduces ER calcium release and simultaneously alleviates mitochondrial calcium overload in H9c2 cells following I/R injury. Furthermore, STIM2 knockdown decreases mitochondrial injury and preserves mitochondrial function following I/R injury. Collectively, these results suggest that the protective role of STIM2 knockdown against I/R injury in cardiomyocytes is associated with the reduced mitochondrial calcium overload and preserved mitochondrial function. Hence, our study may provide a novel insight into the regulation of mitochondrial-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis following I/R injury. "

Molecular basis of disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199999,"In this study, we examined the association of PRMT1 with ER stress and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), two critical pathogenic mechanisms leading to DN development, in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). The level of PRMT1 was compared between the serum from DN patients and healthy individuals by ELISA, and between renal tissues of DN mice and normal mice using RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Using high-glucose-treated PTEC cell line, HK2 cells as the model system, the significance of PRMT1 in ER stress and EMT was assessed by shRNA targeting PRMT1 (sh-PRMT1) and/or by overexpressing PRMT1. Mechanistic studies focused on three major pathways controlling ER stress: protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring-1α (IRE1α), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). PRMT1 was up-regulated in the serum of DN patients and renal tissues of DN mice. High glucose administration induced elevation of PRMT1 expression in HK2 cells in vitro, accompanied with ER stress and EMT activation. PRMT1 knockdown attenuated high glucose-induced ER stress and apoptosis by inactivating PERK and ATF6, but not IRE1α. PRMT1 activated ATF6 by recruiting H4R3me2as to the promoter. Furthermore, PRMT1-induced ER stress was concomitant with the activation of an EMT-like state. Specifically, inhibition of ATF6, but not PERK blocked PRMT1-induced EMT in high-glucose-treatment HK2 cells. By activating ER stress, PRMT1 essentially regulates the apoptosis and EMT of PTECs in response to diabetic milieu. Thus, targeting PRMT1 may alleviate both tissue injury and renal fibrosis, and thus benefit the treatment of DN. "

Approximately 6 million Americans ≥20 years of age carry a diagnosis of heart failure. Worldwide, about 40 million adults are affected. The treatment of HF depends on the etiology. If left untreated it rapidly progresses and compromises quality of life. One of the newer technologies still in its infancy is stem cell therapy for heart failure. This review attempts to highlight the clinical studies done in ischemic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. A combined approach of simultaneous revascularization and stem cell therapy appears to produce maximum benefit in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy with stem cells also holds promise but needs more definition with regards to timing, route of cell delivery and type of cell used to achieve reproducible results. The variability noted in response to stem cell therapy in patients could also be secondary to their co-morbidities. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and diabetes in particular impair stem cell and angiogenic cell mobilization. This opens up a whole new area of investigation into exploring the biochemical microenvironment which could influence the efficacy of stem cell therapy.

Furthermore, triton WR-1339 administration induced alteration in the status of pro-inflammatory markers (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, IFN-γ and Nitric oxide production).

There is a great deal of diversity in current regulatory standards around the world in terms of the identities of regulated toxicants, and the number of replicate analyses stipulated for their measurement. Furthermore, analytical methods developed collaboratively by several organisations and intended for regulatory analysis generally differ in their recommended replicate numbers to those stipulated by regulators. In view of these inconsistencies, we undertook an exercise to examine the most appropriate numbers of replicates required for regulatory analysis of cigarette smoke toxicants. A one-point-in-time sampling exercise was undertaken of the German cigarette market, with 161 brands sampled and analysed in a single laboratory using Canadian Intense smoking conditions. Seven replicate measurements were made for each analyte and product, other than nicotine, CO and nicotine-free dry particulate matter for which eight replicate measurements were made. After confirming the absence of order of analysis effects, a variety of statistical tests (such as group assessment, paired comparisons, linear regression models and ratio analysis) were conducted examining mean values, SDs and CVs to identify the role of numbers of analytical replicates on data quality. The statistical analysis showed no difference in mean values for any of the 18 toxicants irrespective of replicate numbers (between 3 and 7-8). The large majority of analytes showed no difference in data variability with replicate number; but some very small differences (much lower than within product variability) were observed for a minority of compounds. Similarly, paired analysis showed no significant differences between mean values obtained using different replicate numbers in most cases, apart from very low differences (<5%) for a small number. Linear regression analysis showed correlations around 96-98% (other than crotonaldehyde at 91%) between values obtained with 3 vs 7 replicates. Similarly, per product mean value ratio analysis showed 95% consistency between values obtained with 3 and 7 replicates. We therefore conclude that three replicates is sufficient for precise determination of cigarette mainstream smoke toxicant emissions, and that use of 7 replicates as stipulated in some regulator jurisdictions does not offer any greater accuracy or precision.

Therefore, several delivery systems have emerged to overcome these limitations and to successfully deliver siRNA to the tumor site. This review is focused on polymer-based siRNA nanovectors which exploit the negative charge of siRNA, representing a major challenge for siRNA delivery, to their advantage by loading siRNA via electrostatic assembly. These nanovectors are easy to prepare and to adapt for an optimal gene silencing efficiency. The ability of electrostatically assembled polymeric siRNA nanovectors (EPSN) to improve the half-life of siRNA, to favor the specificity of the delivery and the accumulation in tumor and to enhance the cellular uptake and endosomal escape for an efficient siRNA delivery will be discussed. Finally, the influence of the versatility of the structure of these nanovectors on the protein down-regulation will be evaluated. "

Between 2010 and 2017, 184 men were enrolled on a trial of 70Gy in 28 fractions of HFPT for low to intermediate-risk PC. Acute and late toxicity was evaluated using CTCAEv4.0. Patient reported outcomes were measured by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) Questionnaire, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) scores. Median follow-up was 49.2 months. Enrolled patients had low-risk [LR] (n = 18), favorable intermediate-risk [FIR] (n = 78), and unfavorable intermediate-risk [UIR] (n = 88) PC. Four-year rates of BCF free survival were 93.5% (95% C.I. 89-98%), 94.4% (89-100%), 92.5% (86-100%), and 93.8% (88-100%) in the overall group and the LR, FIR, and UIR cohorts, respectively (logrank p>0.4). The incidence of acute grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal (GI) and urologic toxicities were 3.8% and 12.5%, respectively. The 4-year incidence of late grade 2 or higher urologic and GI toxicity was 7.6% (4-13%) and 13.6% (9-20%), respectively. One late grade 3 GI toxicity was reported. All late toxicities were transient. Patient reported IPSS, IIEF, and EPIC scores had no significant long term changes following completion of HFPT. HFPT is associated with low rates of toxicity and does not appear to negatively impact 4-year patient reported urinary and bowel health. Further comparative analyses are warranted to better understand differences between proton and photon HFRT. "

There is limited information, however, on the effects of ivermectin in non-neural cell, such as adipocytes. The present work aimed to investigate the role of ivermectin in adipogenesis using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Ivermectin inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. In particular, the treatment of ivermectin at the middle to late adipogenic differentiation period (day 2-8) was correlated with the inhibition of fat accumulation. Ivermectin treatment also significantly modulated the mRNA expression of key markers in adipogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, uptake, and oxidation, and enhanced the gene expression of two subunits of the glycine receptor (GlyR). Specifically, the protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) were reduced. Interestingly, the suppression of TG accumulation by ivermectin was partially abolished by rosiglitazone, a specific PPARγ agonist, but Z-guggulsterone, a selective FXR antagonist, failed to rescue the ivermectin-induced effect on adipogenesis. Lastly, ivermectin prevented adipogenesis induced by permethrin and fipronil. In conclusion, ivermectin inhibits adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes partially via PPARγ & GlyR-dependent, but not FXR-dependent, pathway. "

The activation of macrophages is known to be important for host defenses against T. marneffei, and these macrophages are known to be activated in two ways (polarization), known as M1 and M2. We investigated the plasticity of these polarizations, in order to understand if cross-conversion of macrophages may be possible even after they have been programmed. We conducted in vitro experiments using a murine macrophage cell line to investigate the ability of T. marneffei to activate these polarizations. The pre-polarized (M0) macrophage subsets were challenged with LPS as a control, and the sets of M1 markers (iNOS and CD86) and M2 markers (Arg-1 and CD206) were assessed for a possible cross-conversion among M1, M2 and M0 (unstimulated) populations. We found that either conidia or yeast forms of T. marneffei initiate the repression of Arg-1 in M2 cells with no change in the M1 subtype marker molecule iNOS. However, an additional IFN-γ stimulus caused the three macrophage groups to fully exhibit an LPS-induced M2 suppression and a shift to M1 from M0 and M2. We conclude that the conversion of macrophages is required for maintenance of sufficient iNOS production against this organism in the host. The cytokine environment is the key factor that manipulates the plasticity changes among macrophage subtypes. Furthermore, IFN-γ is a crucial host defense factor against pathogenic T. marneffei that has significant therapeutic potential to promote an M1 polarization phenotype. "

Autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (aHCT) as consolidation therapy confers a significant survival advantage but is accompanied by significant morbidity. Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is a life-threatening complication caused by endothelial injury that often leads to hemolytic anemia, microthrombotic platelet consumption, and renal injury. Here we investigated the incidence, potential risk-factors, and sequelae of TA-TMA in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients (n=141) with neuroblastoma in our institutions who underwent aHCT from 2000-2017. Ten patients (7%) developed TA-TMA. The patients in the TA-TMA group were similar to the rest of the subjects in demographics, disease burden, prior therapies, renal function, and timing of transplant. The type of conditioning regimen was the only statistically significant pre-transplant variable (p<0.001). Six of the 15 (40%) patients intended to receive tandem transplants (cyclophosphamide/thiotepa, then carboplatin/etoposide/melphalan (CEM)), four of the 68 (6%) patients who received conditioning with single CEM, and none of the 56 who received busulfan/melphalan were diagnosed with TA-TMA. Patients with TA-TMA were more likely to require ICU transfer, have a longer length of stay in the hospital, and experience a delay or change in their subsequent therapy. In our cohort overall, patients with a delay in therapy following transplant appeared to have a worse overall survival, although the difference was not statistically significant. Due to this high incidence and significant morbidity, we have implemented standardized screening for TA-TMA during and after transplant. We anticipate that screening will lead to earlier intervention and decreased severity of disease. "

The purpose of this study is to explore the connection between amorphous phase separation in the hydrated ASD and its resulting release rate. Poorly soluble model compounds - indomethacin (IND) and ritonavir (RTV) - were formulated as ASDs using PVP as carrier. Rotating disk dissolution studies with varying drug loading levels of IND-PVP and RTV-PVP showed that the drug release was fastest at an intermediate drug loading level. This was in part due to faster erosion of the ASD at lower drug loading levels. More interestingly, at low drug loading levels, PVP and the drug co-eroded, while at high drug loading levels, PVP was released preferentially. In the case of RTV-PVP, the loading level corresponding to this transition was correlated with the change in phase separation morphology as probed by confocal fluorescence imaging studies. At low drug loading levels, the hydrophobic domains were discrete domains while at high drug loading levels, hydrophobic domains were continuous. Our results suggest that at low drug loadings, release is mediated by erosion of the polymer along with embedded drug rich droplets, whereas at high drug loadings, formation of a drug-rich domain continuous morphology leads to preferential release of the polymer-rich domains. The transition from hydrophobic discrete to hydrophobic continuous morphology occurs at the percolation threshold. We discuss the two mechanisms of phase separation and its impact on the drug release from ASDs in the context of the ternary phase diagram. "

The whole mitogenome is circular with 15,395 bp long, and is highly biased toward A + T nucleotides (80.6%) in nucleotide composition. Comparative analyses show that gene content and arrangement of macroheteroceran mitogenomes are generally conservative and are typical of Lepidoptera but exceptions exist. In newly sequenced mitogenome, the motif ""ATACTAA"" is putatively located at the end of gene nad1, rather than in intergenic sequences between trnS2 and nad1 genes routinely observed in Lepidoptera. Interestingly, multiple phylogenetic analyses recover the six macroheteroceran superfamilies as Mimallonoidea + (Drepanoidea + ((Bombycoidea + Lasiocampoidea) + (Noctuoidea + Geometroidea))), providing supports for a large-scale transcriptomic study rather than various mitogenome- and multiple-gene-based investigations.

HA was conjugated to CUR through a disulfide bond, which could form micelles independently in aqueous solution. And we further increased the drug loading by loading free CUR. Brain penetration was achieved with Tween 80, whereas glioma-targeting was inclined by CD44-mediated endocytosis. Compared to the disulfide-free group, the redox-sensitive micelles exhibited rapid in vitro drug release under high glutathione conditions, significantly enhanced cell apoptosis and cellular uptake in G422 glioma cells. Redox-sensitive micelles displayed about 4.70-fold higher area under the curve in rats after intravenous injection in comparison to the free CUR and effectively accumulated in the brain. These findings suggest that redox-sensitive micelles could be a promising candidate to achieve brain targeted CUR delivery. "

To better understand the citrus-A. alternata interaction and to identify putative resistance proteins, as well as the receptor of the ACT toxin, citrus plants susceptible ('Minneola' mandarin) and resistant ('Clemenules' tangor) to A. alternata, infected or not (control) with the pathogen were analyzed by proteomics. Protein changes were observed between citrus genotypes after infection, and 150 candidate proteins were obtained. A general scheme of the metabolic processes involved in susceptible and resistant citrus-A. alternata interactions was designed. Susceptible plants presented a high level of proteins involved in stress response at the final stages of the infection, whereas resistant plants presented high level of ROS proteins, metabolic proteins, and proteins involved in the immune system process. Proteins like ferredoxin and cyclophilin are specific to the susceptible variety and may be good candidates as fungal effector-interacting proteins. This is the first citrus-A. alternata proteomics analysis, which has allowed a better understanding of the molecular bases of the citrus response to ABS disease. "

Tripolyphosphate (TPP) is widely used for such purpose especially in drug delivery applications. TPP is a small ion with a triple negative charge throughout the physiologically acceptable pH range. However, the stability of size and surface charge of the particles still challenging. In the current work, the utilization of Hexametaphosphate (HMP) instead of Tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking agent is being investigated. HMP is hexavalent molecule in the neutral and slightly basic medium which offers more binding sites readily available for interaction with chitosan. It is thought that increasing the availability of the binding sites in the HMP molecule would result in stronger ionic complexation with chitosan cationic charges. Consequently, such stronger binding improves particles' stability and lead to average size reduction. A comparative study between chitosan/TPP and chitosan/HMP nanoparticles under different complexation conditions was conducted to investigate the effect of HMP on nanoparticles formation. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was applied as a protein model drug to explore the drug loading efficiency, 96.3%, is higher than its TPP, 91.87%, counterparts. However, TPP cross-linked particles showed superior stability upon storage. "

Previous studies have reported that CTXs affect the activity of some serine proteases, namely, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, trypsin, and acetylcholinesterase. To elucidate the mode of action of CTXs, the interaction of CTXs with chymotrypsin was thus investigated. It was found that Naja atra CTX isotoxins concentration-dependently enhanced chymotrypsin activity. The capability of CTX1 and CTX5 in increasing chymotrypsin activity was higher than that of CTX2, CTX3, and CTX4. Removal of the molecular beacon-bound CTXs by chymotrypsin, circular dichroism measurement, and acrylamide quenching of Trp fluorescence indicated that CTXs bound to chymotrypsin. Chemical modification of Lys, Arg, or Met residues of CTX1 attenuated its capability to enhance chymotrypsin activity without impairing their bond with chymotrypsin. Catalytically inactive chymotrypsin retained the binding affinity for native and modified CTX1. CTX1 and chemically modified CTX1 differently altered the global conformation of chymotrypsin and inactivated chymotrypsin. Moreover, CTX1 did not reduce the interaction of 2-(p-toluidino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) with chymotrypsin and inactivated chymotrypsin. Together with previous results revealing that TNS can bind at the hydrophobic region of active site in chymotrypsin, our data suggest that CTXs can enhance chymotrypsin activity by binding to the region outside the enzyme's active site.

An opinion sampling method was used based on the inclusion criteria for the study and the accessibility of the sample. Participants' ages ranged from 14 to 30, and 44.2% (N=854) were male and 55.8% (N=1078) female. The psychometric guarantees of AUDIT have been confirmed, highlighting the value of Alpha Cronbach (.804) of the scale, and the validity of its internal structure through a confirmatory factor analysis which showed the validity of the model of the three factors (Risky use, Dependence symptoms and Harmful alcohol use). The results confirm a pattern of non-daily use, and concentrated, excess use on a single occasion. The existence of significant differences has also been confirmed in terms of the legal drinking age in some of the indicators used, and the risk of alcohol consumption increases with age. The appropriate psychometric properties of AUDIT have been confirmed in the Mexican youth population.

Continuous muscular degeneration and late stage complications, including cardiomyopathy and respiratory insufficiency, dominate the clinical phenotype. Gene expression and regulation of the dystrophin gene outside of muscular tissue is far more complex. Multiple tissue-specific dystrophin gene products are widely expressed throughout the body, including the central nervous system and eye, predisposing affected patients to secondary complications in non-muscular tissues. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the full-length dystrophin gene product, Dp427, on retinal homeostasis and angiogenesis. Based on the clinical case of a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patient who developed severe fibrovascular changes in the retina in response to hypoxic stress, we hypothesized that defects in Dp427 make the retina more susceptible to stresses such as ageing and ischemia. To further study this, a mouse strain lacking Dp427 expression (Mdx) was studied during retinal development, ageing and in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model. While retinal vascular morphology was normal during development and ageing, retinal function measured by electroretinography (ERG) was slightly reduced in young adult Mdx mice and deteriorated with age. Mdx mice also had increased retinal neovascularization in response to OIR and more pronounced long-term deterioration in retinal function following OIR. Based on these results, we suggest that DMD patients with a mutation in Dp427 may experience disturbed retinal homeostasis with increasing age and therefore be prone to develop excessive retinal neovascular changes in response to hypoxic stress. DMD patients in late disease stages should, thus, be regularly examined to detect asymptomatic retinal abnormalities and prevent visual impairment. "

Reduced spatiotemporal resolution in the regulation of these proteins activity will impede the ability to understand the proteins normal functions as longer modification of their activity in non-normal locations could lead to effects different from their natural functions. To control intracellular signaling proteins at the highest temporal resolution recent innovative optogenetic approaches were developed to allow the control of photoactivable signaling proteins activity by light. These photoactivatable proteins can be activated in selected cell population in brain and in specific subcellular compartments. Minimal-invasive tools are being developed to photoactivate these proteins for study and therapy. Together these techniques afford an unprecedented spatiotemporal control of signaling proteins activity to unveil the function of brain proteins with high accuracy in behaving animals. As dysfunctional signaling proteins are involved in brain diseases, the optogenetic technique has also the potential to be used as a tool to treat brain diseases. "

Using GPR83/eGFP mice, we show high GPR83 expression on cholinergic interneurons in the nucleus accumbens and moderate expression on ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. In GPR83 knockout mice, baseline dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is enhanced which disrupts the ratio of tonic vs phasic release. Additionally, GPR83 knockout leads to changes in the expression of dopamine-related genes. Using the morphine conditioned place preference model, we identify sex differences in morphine reward-learning, show that GPR83 is upregulated in the nucleus accumbens following morphine conditioned place preference, and show that shRNA-mediated knockdown of GPR83 in the nucleus accumbens leads to attenuation morphine reward.

PGM was in the phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase subclass and UGPase was predicted to be a UDP-Glucose pyrophosphatase in a tetrameric structure. Both enzymes were expressed in soluble form, purified to near homogeneity with high activity at 1159 and 796 U/mg, exhibited folding with reasonable secondary structures, and existed as monomer and tetramer, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature of PGM were 9.0 and 50 °C, respectively, and this protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 40 to 50 °C. The optimal pH and temperature of UGPase were 9.0 and 45 °C, respectively, and the protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 30 to 55 °C. A small-scale one-pot biosynthesis of UDP-glucose by combining PGM and UGPase using glucose-6-phosphate and UTP as substrates was also performed, and formation of UDP-glucose was observed by HPLC detection, which confirmed the biosynthetic pathway of UDP-glucose in vitro.

WG, two enzymes phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) were bioinformatically analysed, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and characterized. PGM was in the phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase subclass and UGPase was predicted to be a UDP-Glucose pyrophosphatase in a tetrameric structure. Both enzymes were expressed in soluble form, purified to near homogeneity with high activity at 1159 and 796 U/mg, exhibited folding with reasonable secondary structures, and existed as monomer and tetramer, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature of PGM were 9.0 and 50 °C, respectively, and this protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 40 to 50 °C. The optimal pH and temperature of UGPase were 9.0 and 45 °C, respectively, and the protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 30 to 55 °C. A small-scale one-pot biosynthesis of UDP-glucose by combining PGM and UGPase using glucose-6-phosphate and UTP as substrates was also performed, and formation of UDP-glucose was observed by HPLC detection, which confirmed the biosynthetic pathway of UDP-glucose in vitro. PGM and UGPase will be ideal targets for the metabolic engineering to improve WL gum yields in industrial production. "

The neural dynamics of sensory binding by action.,11/Jun/2019,Neuropsychologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199954,"The contribution of the motor system to perception has been highlighted in research investigating the effect of performing an action on the conscious processing of information received from the sensory systems. For example, the perceptual temporal asynchrony observed when passively reporting changes in visual object attributes (e.g., colour and position) was found to disappear virtually when the changes resulted from a voluntary motor action. Although the spatio-temporal constraints of sensory binding by action have been broadly investigated, the underlying neural correlates are still largely unknown. In the present study, participants performed temporal order judgments of changes in the colour and position of a visual stimulus, while adapting to a 750 ms delay between a sound (perceptual condition) or the end of a manual reaching action (motor condition), and the visual changes. Behavioural observations indicated that temporal asynchrony (-30.2 ms) decreased in the motor condition (2.7 ms), as a result of sensorimotor adaptation, but not in the perceptual condition (-29.6 ms). EEG-evoked potentials on posterior visual regions showed that early components were altered by sensorimotor adaptation, with in particular a broad reduction in the amplitude of the early P1 component. Furthermore, time-frequency analysis of EEG signals during the 350 ms period preceding the visual changes revealed an increase of the 15-25 Hz frequency band amplitude in the central region and a decrease of the 8-12 Hz frequency band amplitude in the posterior region. Overall the results suggest that sensory binding by action depends on an early top-down modulation of the visual regions by the motor system - in agreement with the pre-activation theory of action-perception coupling - associated with an increase of attentional resources.

A healthy lifestyle is important for individuals with CKD to reduce risk for CKD progression and adverse heath events. Adults with CKD also have high rates of psychological distress, which may be associated with unhealthy behaviors. Using the 2013-2017 public use data files of the US National Health Interview Survey, we compared health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity [PA]) and psychological distress (assessed with the Kessler-6 scale) between adults with a CKD diagnosis in the preceding year and a matched sample of adults without a CKD diagnosis. We then examined the association between psychological distress and health behaviors among adults with CKD (n = 3923) using multinomial logistic regression models. Compared to those without CKD, those with CKD had lower rates of smoking, heavy alcohol use, and engagement in any type of PA 3+ times a week and higher rates of psychological distress. In addition to the health concerns posed by the high smoking rate (17%) and low physical activity rate (34%) among those with CKD, smoking and lack of PA were associated with greater risk of mild-moderate and/or serious psychological distress. Compared to no unhealthy behaviors, 2-3 unhealthy behaviors were associated with 4.72 (95% CI = 2.97-7.48) times greater risk of serious psychological distress. Adults with CKD and unhealthy behaviors need help with lifestyle modifications and assessment and treatment of psychological distress to reduce CKD progression and prevent other health complications.

The most putative hypothesis in pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is Amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation which interrupt proper function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and are associated with anxiety. Here, we assessed the potential anxiolytic effect of Apelin-13 in a rodent cognitive impairment model induced by intrahippocampal Aβ25-35 administration. We evaluated the memory impairment and anxiogenic behavior using shuttle box and Elevated plus maze apparatuses. We also measured the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) expression as important markers showing the proper feedback mechanism within the HPA axis. Our findings showed that Aβ25-35 administration induced memory impairment and anxiety behaviors. Apelin-13 exerted the anxiolytic effects and provided protection against Aβ25-35-induced passive avoidance memory impairment. Moreover, Apelin-13 caused an increase in GR and a decrease in FKBP5 expression levels in Aβ25-35 treated animals. Taken together, these findings showed the anxiolytic effect of Apelin-13. This effect at least in part, may be mediated through the regulation of GR and FKBP5 expression levels which have a pivotal role in the appropriate negative feedback mechanism within the HPA axis. These data suggest that Apelin-13 might be considered as a potential neuropeptide defense that reduces anxiety along with neuroprotective effect against the Aβ25-35-induced injury. "

We assessed the relation between resting HRV and neural activation when observing and imitating emotional faces. We focused on brain regions implicated in sensorimotor resonance, salience detection and arousal. We used electrocardiogram data to compute resting HRV. Resting HRV measures were negatively correlated with activation in a portion of the inferior frontal gyrus showing mirror neuron properties, the insula and the amygdala in response to observation, but not imitation, of emotional faces. Thus, resting HRV appears to be linked to sensitivity to others' emotional cues, both in terms of the tendency to map others' emotional facial expressions onto one's own motor system and to rapidly detect and mark others' emotions as salient events. Resting HRV may reflect, in part, a threshold for increased processing of others' emotional cues. "

Interestingly, we observed a group of mutations that expanded during remission, which we named ""remission clone"". To investigate the nature of the remission clone, we performed flow cytometry-based cell sorting followed by ultra-deep sequencing. The remission clone repeatedly expanded after chemotherapeutic cycles and was suppressed during relapse in the myeloid lineage (multipotent hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and myeloid cells). On the other hand, the remission clone was consistently observed in lymphoid lineages (B- and T-cells) regardless of the disease state. When transfected to HEK-293 cell line, NR2C2(A93V) mutant showed a growth advantage (all p < 0.05). The results indicate that the remission clone seems to be another form of clonal hematopoiesis, but without a clear association with leukemia. As the remission clone is present in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, it likely originates from ancestral hematopoietic cell lineages. More importantly, the remission clone is distinct from the leukemic clone therefore, mutations expanded during remission requires special interpretation when performing next generation sequencing-based measurable residual disease assessment.

Studies were included if the exposure was SES of the OHCA victim or the OHCA location and the outcome was either OHCA incidence, CPR provision and/or survival rate after OHCA. Study selection and quality assessment were conducted by two reviewers independently. Descriptive data and measures of association were extracted, both in the total study population and in subgroups stratified by age and/or sex. This review was carried out following the PRISMA guidelines. Overall 32 studies were included. Twelve studies reported on OHCA incidence, thirteen on bystander CPR provision and fourteen on survival. Some evidence for SES differences was found in each identified stage. In all the studies on incidence, SES was measured over the area of the OHCA victims' residence and was consistently associated with OHCA. In studies on bystander CPR, SES of the area in which the OHCA occurred was associated with bystander CPR, while evidence on individual SES was lacking. In studies on OHCA survival, SES of the victim measured at the individual level and SES of the area in which the OHCA occurred were associated, while SES of the victim, measured at the area of residence was not. Studies reporting age and sex differences in the SES trends were scarce. SES disparities in OHCA mortality likely manifest in OHCA incidence, bystander CPR provision and survival rate after OHCA. However, there is a distinct lack of data on SES measured at the individual level and on differences within subgroups, e.g. by sex and age. "

Herein, regulation and function of Erk-5 in oxLDL-induced EC death, inflammation and dysfunction has been investigated. Primary Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (pHUVECs) were stimulated with oxLDL. MTT and Trypan blue exclusion assays to assess cell viability, RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays to determine expression of endothelial and inflammatory markers and ED mediators at mRNA and protein levels, respectively were performed. Monocyte adhesion assay was performed to examine monocytes adherence to oxLDL-stimulated pHUVECs. The exposure of oxLDL induced a dose- and time-dependent decrease in pHUVECs viability, which concurred with decreased Erk-5 expression. Further, oxLDL (100 μg/ml) decreased the expression of endothelial markers eNOS and vWF, and increased the expression of ICAM-1, at both mRNA and protein levels. SiRNA-mediated silencing of Erk-5 or its inhibition showed that changes in eNOS, vWF and ICAM-1 expression could be mediated through Erk-5. Furthermore, oxLDL decreased the levels of Erk-5's upstream regulator MEK5 and downstream regulators Mef2c and KLF2, which were similar to their expressions in Erk-5 silenced cells. Fisetin, a phytochemical and bioflavonoid, could reduce the effect of oxLDL in ECs by upregulating the expression of endothelial markers including Erk-5, and downregulating the expression of inflammation markers. These results suggest that Erk-5 could be a critical regulator of oxLDL-induced EC death, inflammation and dysfunction via downregulation of Erk-5/Mef2c-KLF2 signaling pathway, which can be ameliorated by a bioflavonoid, fisetin.

To address this gap in the research, open-ended interviews were conducted with 9 incarcerated women in Denmark. The inquiry focused on their experiences with prison food and eating, including questions about hygge-related practices. Hygge is a cherished part of Danish culture that encourages people to create cozy environments by sharing food and fellowship. While this warm and comforting practice may seem incongruent with prison, contemporary theory about carceral geography suggests a wide range of emotional spaces within prisons and identifies the central role of incarcerated people and external norms on constructing these spaces. The participants' narratives describe and explain the role of hygge in Danish prisons. Participants report using food and other props to construct hygge in their cells, in common areas, and with visitors, in order to build safety and manage the harshness of prison life. While these experiences are fleeting, findings suggest that the ability of these women to engage in hygge practices has a deeply positive impact on their lived experience of incarceration. The findings expand understanding about the role of food in prison and inform the practices of correctional facilities. "

We analyzed 393,568 unique food product reviews from Amazon customers with a total of 256,043 reviewers rating 67,553 products. Taste-associated words were mentioned more than words associated with price, food texture, customer service, nutrition, smell, or those referring to the trigeminal senses, e.g., ""spicy"". We computed the overall number of reviews that mentioned taste qualities: the word taste was mentioned in over 30% of the reviews (N = 142,768), followed by sweet (10.7%, N = 42,315), bitter (2.9%, N = 11,424), sour (2.1%, N = 8252) and salty (1.4%, N = 5688). We identified 38 phrases used to describe the evaluation of sweetness, finding that 'too sweet' was used in nearly 0.8% of the reviews and oversweetness was mentioned over 25 times more often than under-sweetness. We then focused on 'polarizing' products, those that elicited a wide difference of opinion (as measured by the ranges of the product ratings). Using the products that had more than 50 reviews, we identified the top 10 most polarizing foods, those with the largest standard deviation in ratings, and provide representative comments about the polarized taste experience of consumers. Overall, these results support the primacy of taste in real-world food ratings and individualized taste experience, such as whether a product is 'too sweet'. Analysis of consumer review data sets can provide information about purchasing decisions and customer sensory responses to particular commercially available products and represents a promising methodology for the emerging field of sensory nutrition.

These insults can affect the neural stem cells and the subsequent neurogenic cascade in the hippocampus, resulting in the induction of aberrant neurogenesis, which is thought to compromise hippocampal network function, thereby hampering hippocampus-dependent behavior. We here summarize recent preclinical literature on hippocampal insult-induced changes in neurogenesis and based on that, we propose that normalizing aberrant neurogenesis post-insult may help to prevent or rescue behavioral deficits which could help develop novel therapeutic strategies.

A previous study from our research group demonstrated cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol. Although these findings suggest a common mechanism of action between these two drugs, little is known about the molecular or cellular aspects of this commonality. The AMPK pathway functions as an intracellular energy sensor and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Thus, the present study examined AMPK signaling following reciprocal cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol in the rat prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were repeatedly treated with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, 5 times) or ethanol (0.5 g/kg, 15 times) and then challenged reciprocally with the other drug. When sensitized to either cocaine or ethanol, the phosphorylation in response to additional challenges with the same drug was enhanced, indicating the development of sensitization. However, responses to the cocaine challenge were enhanced in the ethanol-sensitized state, whereas the responses to the ethanol challenge were not apparently enhanced in the cocaine-sensitized state. This was likely due to the ceiling effect of cocaine sensitization, which suggested that cocaine had more robust effects than ethanol. Although the same changes were found for two upstream kinases of AMPK (LKB1 and CaMK4), TAK1 responded differently and was not affected by acute challenges from either cocaine or ethanol. In the prefrontal cortex, there was an increase in activity, whereas there was a decrease in activity in the dorsal striatum. This difference might be due to dopamine D "

Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNA-302b-3p (miR-302b-3p) plays an important role in regulating apoptosis and oxidative stress in various cells. However, whether miR-302b-3p is involved in regulating cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury-induced neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the potential function and molecular mechanism of miR-302b-3p in oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal injury, using an in vitro model of cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury. We found that miR-302b-3p expression was up-regulated by OGD/R treatment in neurons. The inhibition of miR-302b-3p improved cell viability, and reduced apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species, showing a protective effect against OGD/R-induced injury. Interestingly, miR-302b-3p was shown to target and modulate murine fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15). Moreover, our results showed that miR-302b-3p down-regulation contributed to the promotion of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated antioxidant signaling associated with the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β. However, the knockdown of FGF15 significantly reversed the miR-302b-3p inhibition-mediated protective effect in OGD/R-treated neurons. Overall, these results demonstrated that miR-302b-3p inhibition confers a neuroprotective effect in OGD/R-treated neurons by up-regulating Nrf2/ARE antioxidant signaling via targeting FGF15, providing a novel target for neuroprotection in cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury.

Using a non-invasive water-borne hormone assay, we measured the release rates of two glucocorticoid hormones, corticosterone and cortisol, in Rio Grande Leopard frog, Rana berlandieri, tadpoles. We validated this method pharmacologically and biologically using an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, exposure to exogenous corticosterone, and an agitation test. We calculated the repeatability of hormone release rates, the recovery time from an acute stressor, and explored rearing methods for tadpoles. Tadpole corticosterone release rates increased following an ACTH challenge, exposure to exogenous corticosterone, and agitation, validating the use of water-borne hormone methods in this species. After exposure to an acute stressor via agitation, corticosterone release rates began to decline after 2h and were lowest after 6h, suggesting a relatively rapid recovery from an acute stressor. Tadpoles reared in groups had higher corticosterone release rates than tadpoles reared individually, and lost mass by Day 7, while tadpoles reared individually did not show a stress response, therefore either rearing method is viable, but have differing physiological costs for tadpoles. Repeatability of corticosterone release rates was moderate to high in R. berlandieri tadpoles, indicating that this species can show a response to selection and potentially respond to rapid environmental change. Our results show that the water-borne hormone assay is a viable way to measure glucocorticoids in this species and is useful in the field of conservation physiology for rare and endangered species.

In this study, we explored associations among different steroidogenic pathways and seasonal differences in blubber hormone profiles of free-ranging common bottlenose dolphins along the coast of South Carolina, USA. Male dolphins experience a peak in testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the spring, likely related to an upregulation of the androgen steroidogenic pathway during mating season. We also observed increased cortisol concentrations during summer compared to winter. Among females, there was an increase in androstenedione with elevated progesterone concentrations indicative of pregnancy, highlighting another potential endocrine marker for pregnancy in free-ranging dolphins. This work emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate season for studies on endocrine status to effectively uncover physiological variation or disruption in free-ranging cetaceans. "

However, the detailed process of progression from sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) to dysplasia and carcinoma has not been elucidated. To further characterize mechanisms involved in the dysplastic progression of SSA, we investigated differential expressions of mRNAs between areas with and without dysplasia within same SSA polyps. Significantly dysregulated genes in paired samples were applied for functional annotation and biological significance using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrity Discovery (DAVID). The same lysates from a subset of matched samples were subjected for miRNA expression profiling. Differentially expressed miRNAs were determined, and their targeted mRNAs were compared in parallel to the list of differentially expressed mRNAs from RNA sequencing study. Fourteen common mRNA targets were identified, which include AXIN2, a known indicator of WNT/B-catenin pathway activation. Together, in this study, different genes/pathways/biological processes involved in the initiation and progression of dysplasia in the serrated pathway are documented. One of the most significant findings is the involvement of WNT/B-catenin pathway in the dysplastic progression of SSAs with different genes being targeted in early versus advanced dysplasia. "

A discovery mass-spectrometry (MS) and reverse-phase protein array (RPPA)-based proteomics dual approach was used to identify novel mTORC2 phosphoprotein targets in actively invading cancer cells. mTORC2 targets included focal adhesion kinase, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src, and caveolin-1 (Cav-1), among others. Functional testing shows that mTORC2 regulates Cav-1 localization and dynamic phosphorylation of Cav-1 on Y14. Regulation of Cav-1 activity by mTORC2 also alters the abundance of caveolae, which are specialized lipid raft invaginations of the plasma membrane associated with cell signaling and membrane compartmentalization.

Autophagy plays a homeostatic role in the liver but can be compromised by alcohol, high fat diet, or viral infection, which in turn affect the disease process caused by these etiologies. To understand the full impact of autophagy modulation on alcohol-induced liver injury, several genetic models of autophagy deficiency, which have different levels of functional alterations, were examined following acute binge or chronic-plus-binge treatment. Alcohol given in either mode to the liver-specific inducible Atg7-deficient mice shortly after the induction of Atg7 deletion had an elevated liver injury, indicating the protective role of autophagy. Constitutive hepatic Atg7 deficient mice, in which Atg7 was deleted in embryos, were more susceptible to chronic-plus-binge but not to acute alcohol treatment. Constitutive hepatic Atg5 deficient mice, in which Atg5 was deleted in embryos, were more prone to acute alcohol treatment, but liver injury were surprisingly improved in the chronic-plus-binge regime. A prolonged autophagy deficiency may complicate the hepatic response to alcohol treatment, likely in part due to endogenous liver injury. The complexity of the relationship between autophagy deficiency and alcohol-induced liver injury can thus be affected by the timing of autophagy dysfunction, the exact autophagy gene being affected, and the alcohol treatment regime.

Accelerating clinical diagnosis from pathology images and automating image analysis efficiently and accurately remain significant challenges. Recently, deep learning algorithms have shown great promise in pathology image analysis, such as in tumor region identification, metastasis detection and patient prognosis. Many machine learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks, have been proposed to automatically segment pathology images. Among these algorithms, segmentation deep learning algorithms such as fully-convolutional networks stand out for their accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability. Thus, deep learning-based pathology image segmentation has become an important tool in WSI analysis. In this review, we describe the pathology image segmentation process using deep learning algorithms in detail. The goals are to provide quick guidance for implementing deep learning into pathology image analysis, and to provide some potential ways of further improving segmentation performance. Although there have been previous reviews on using machine learning methods in digital pathology image analysis, to our knowledge, this is the first in-depth review of the applications of deep learning algorithms for segmentation in WSI analysis.

Participants were required to switch between different levels according to the color of the stimuli. Behavioral result showed a longer response time in the upward switch (from the lower level to the middle level) than in the downward switch (from the higher level to the middle level). The event related potential results showed that (1) a larger N2 was elicited by the upward switch, which reflects the response inhibition process; and (2) the sustained potential component was most negative for the upward switch and least negative for the repeat condition, thereby reflecting the different degrees of reconfiguration of task set.

Chronic exposure to cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) agonists has been reported to induce downregulation of the CB1R in brain and behavioral tolerance. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subchronic/chronic cannabinoid administration on CB1R downregulation in normal rat retina, its downstream prosurvival signaling and subsequent effect on retinal neuroprotection against AMPA excitotoxicity. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered intraperitoneally with vehicle (Control), the endogenous N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (AEA), and the synthetic cannabinoids R-(+)-Methanandamide (MethAEA) and HU-210 daily (25, 50,100 μg/kg) for four or fourteen days (4d/14d, subchronic/chronic administration, respectively). HU210 was also administered acutely as follows, vehicle injection for 13 days and a single dose of HU-210 on the 14th day. Immunohistochemistry studies and Western blot analysis were employed to assess CB1R expression in control and AMPA treated retinas and cannabinoid induced changes in Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (ph). Real time PCR was employed to examine the effect of MethAEA (50 mg/kg,4d) on CB1R mRNA expression. AEA, MethAEA and HU-210 attenuated CB1R expression in a dose-dependent manner (25,50,100 μg/kg), after subchronic and chronic administration. No effect was observed at the lower dose of 25 μg/kg. MethAEA (50 mg/kg,4d) attenuated CB1R mRNA expression. AM251 (CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist, 0.5 mg/kg, 4d), administered prior to HU-210 (50 μg/kg, 4d) inhibited CB1R downregulation. Chronic/subchronic treatments (50 μg/kg) of HU-210 and MethAEA reduced levels of ph-Akt and ph-Akt/ph-ERK1/2, respectively. AEA had no effect on ph-Akt nor ph-ERK1/2. All three cannabinoids (50 μg/kg,4d) failed to protect brain nitric oxide synthetase (bNOS) expressing amacrine cells against AMPA excitotoxicity, in agreement with the downregulation of CB1 receptor. At the lower doses of 12.5 and 25 μg/kg, HU-210 protected bNOS-expressing amacrine cells. This study provides novel information regarding agonist-induced CB1R downregulation in rat retina after subchronic/chronic cannabinoid treatment, and its effect on downstream prosurvival signaling and neuroprotection.

Although it is well-demonstrated that auditory and olfactory sensitivity can change with reproductive state, fewer studies have tested for plasticity in the visual system, a surprising detail since courtship and mate choice behaviors in many species are largely dependent on visual signals. Here, we tested for reproductive state-dependent plasticity in the eye of the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni using behavioral, gene expression, neural activation, and electrophysiology techniques. Males court ovulated females more intensely than gravid females, and ovulated females were more responsive to male courtship behaviors than gravid females. Using electroretinography to measure visual sensitivity in dark-adapted fish, we revealed that gravid, reproductively-ready females have increased visual sensitivity at wavelengths associated with male courtship coloration compared to non-gravid females. After ovulation was hormonally induced, female's spectral sensitivity further increased compared to pre-injection measurements. This increased sensitivity after hormone injection was absent in non-gravid females and in males, suggesting an ovulation-triggered increase in visual sensitivity. Ovulated females had higher mRNA expression levels of reproductive neuromodulatory receptors (sex-steroids; gonadotropins) in the eye than nonovulated females, whereas males had similar expression levels independent of reproductive/social state. In addition, female mate choice-like behaviors positively correlated with expression of gonadotropin system receptors in the eye. Collectively, these data provide crucial evidence linking endocrine modulation of visual plasticity to mate choice behaviors in females. "

The PM facilitates the food digestion process and plays important roles in insect-microbe interactions as a barrier against microbial pathogens. The soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and its proteinaceous toxins are widely used for insect control. To understand the protective role of PM in insects against Bt toxins, the effect of PM on larval susceptibility to Bt toxin Cry1Ac was examined in Cry1Ac-susceptible and -resistant strains of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni. The PM in T. ni was disrupted, using a baculovirus enhancin (TnGV enhancin) to degrade the major PM mucin protein IIM and a chitin binding chemical, Calcofluor, to inhibit the binding of PM proteins to chitin. Bioassays of the susceptibility of T. ni larvae to Cry1Ac with treatment of TnGV enhancin showed significantly increased larval mortality in both the Cry1Ac susceptible and resistant strains, confirming that the PM is a protective barrier to the passage of Cry1Ac and plays a protective role against the toxin. However, treatment of T. ni larvae with Calcofluor significantly reduced the larval susceptibility to Cry1Ac. The level of mortality reduction by treatment with Calcofluor was more significant in the resistant T. ni strains than in the susceptible strain. The mechanism for the decrease of susceptibility to Cry1Ac in T. ni treated with Calcofluor needs to be understood. It may result from binding of the toxin to the over expressed PM proteins, preventing the Cry1Ac from reaching the midgut receptor for the toxin or from potential binding of Calcofluor to the midgut receptor for Cry1Ac, leading to inhibition of the toxicity of Cry1Ac in larvae.

We find that in early development, the transcription factor foxc1b is expressed in mesenchymal cells that associate with the vascular endothelium. Using timelapse imaging, we observe that foxc1b expressing mesenchymal cells differentiate into acta2 expressing vascular mural cells. We show that in zebrafish, while foxc1b is co-expressed in acta2 positive smooth muscle cells that associate with large diameter vessels, it is not co-expressed in capillaries where pdgfrβ positive pericytes are located. In addition to being an early marker of the lineage, foxc1 is essential for vSMC differentiation; we find that foxc1 loss of function mutants have defective vSMC differentiation and that early genetic ablation of foxc1b or acta2 expressing populations blocks vSMC differentiation. Furthermore, foxc1 is expressed upstream of acta2 and is required for acta2 expression in vSMCs. Using RNA-Seq we determine an enriched intersectional gene expression profile using dual expression of foxc1b and acta2 to identify novel vSMC markers. Taken together, our data suggests that foxc1 is a marker of vSMCs and plays a critical functional role in promoting their differentiation. "

Therefore, we investigated the relationship between outcomes after cardiac surgery and both RDW and MCV simultaneously. From 1/2010-1/2014, 16,097 patients underwent cardiac surgery at Cleveland Clinic and had complete blood count findings available for analysis. Outcomes included RBC transfusion, postoperative complications, and intensive care unit (ICU) and postoperative hospital lengths of stay. Risk-adjusted associations of RDW and MCV with outcomes and their relative importance in predicting outcome were identified by random forest machine learning. High RDW was associated with more RBC transfusions. Except for postoperative atrial fibrillation, risks of complications and ICU and postoperative lengths of stay were at their minimum when RDW was normal, 13%-14%. The relationship of MCV to complications was U-shaped: high (macrocytosis) and low (microcytosis) values were associated with higher risk. RDW was an important risk factor for most postoperative outcomes and lengths of stay; MCV less so, but it provided prognostic value in addition to RDW alone, particularly when there was macrocytosis. Abnormal RDW and MCV is associated with higher risk of transfusion and postoperative outcomes after cardiac surgery. RDW is one of the most important variables in predicting outcomes, but MCV provides additional prognostic value. Both should be taken into consideration when estimating the perioperative risk of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. "

The surface pressure at the interface was measured concurrently for up to 8 h. After an induction period, the spectra from the lipid diminished and those of surfactin gradually appeared whilst at the same time the surface pressure increased. However, eventually the surfactin signals disappeared and those of the lipid reappeared. Although the SFG spectra of the lipid disappeared at intermediate times, the IRRAS spectra of the lipid were always present at the interface. Variation in the temporal SFG behaviour was investigated as the pH of the sub-phase, the initial surface pressure of the lipid, and the surfactin concentration were changed. Samples of the surface film were transferred onto mica substrates at selected times along the temporal profile and imaged by Atomic Force Microscopy - nano Infrared Spectroscopy (nano-IR).

Retrospective observational case series. 12 patients identified to have handheld laser retinal injuries were included at two academic centers. Patients underwent ophthalmic assessment and retinal imaging including fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), conventional blue autofluorescence (B-AF) and NIR-AF imaging. In all cases, lesions consistent with retinal laser injury were detected by NIR-AF imaging. The lesions showed a characteristic appearance with central hyperfluorescence and surrounding hypofluorescence although the number and extent of lesions varied between patients. Findings using other imaging modalities were variable: on color fundus photography these included localized pigmentary changes and on OCT imaging an ellipsoid zone interruption or outer nuclear layer changes. Only subtle changes were evident on B-AF imaging. Other macular conditions, such as poppers retinopathy or solar maculopathy, which may have similar findings on OCT imaging as laser damage, can be differentiated using NIR-AF imaging. An increased incidence of retinal injuries secondary to handheld lasers has been reported in recent years. We show that the diagnosis and full extent of retinal laser injuries is best demonstrated by NIR-AF, as other modalities give variable results.

While most middle and high school athletes require pre-participation screening, many predisposing conditions go undiagnosed until they occur. The frequency of sudden cardiac death is often under reported because there is no mandatory system for reporting sports-related death in high school sports. Additionally, there is debate regarding the cost-effectiveness of more advanced screening tests such as electrocardiogram (ECG) due to high false positive rates. It is, however, accepted that participants with a family history of sudden cardiac death should undergo more in depth screening. If sudden cardiac arrest occurs, it is important for the patient to undergo immediate defibrillation. Community outreach to ensure that automated external defibrillators (AED) are present at athletic events, as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for coaches could potentially save lives. Ultimately, prevention of sudden cardiac death depends on physician awareness of how to properly screen and identify those at risk, and how to best be prepared if sudden cardiac arrest occurs. "

The authors hypothesized that the readability of their institution's current recall lay letter may contribute to the misinterpretation of intended time for patient return. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the comprehension of the current recall lay letter statement. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level was used to assess readability of the lay letter currently used at the authors' institution. A revised statement was formulated. A single paper-based survey presented both current and revised statements and asked questions to probe patients' understanding of expected time to return. Surveys were provided to screening mammography patients at four outpatient imaging centers. The Flesch-Kincaid grade levels of the current and revised statements were 12th and 4th grades, respectively. Five hundred ninety-nine surveys were analyzed. Survey data demonstrated that only 49.6% of all patients understood that the current statement requests return within 1 month specifically with the breast center, compared with 95.2% of patients with the revised statement (P < .001). Of the patients who misunderstood when to follow up with the breast center, about 80% had achieved less than a college degree (P < .001).

There are no effective treatments for ACDMPV other than lung transplant, and new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. While ACDMPV is linked to mutations in the FOXF1 gene, molecular mechanisms through which FOXF1 mutations cause ACDMPV are unknown. Identify molecular mechanisms by which S52F FOXF1 mutations cause ACDMPV. We generated a clinically relevant mouse model of ACDMPV by introducing the S52F FOXF1 mutation into the mouse Foxf1 gene locus using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Immunohistochemistry, whole lung imaging and biochemical methods were used to examine vasculature in Foxf1WT/S52F lungs and identify molecular mechanisms regulated by FOXF1. FOXF1 mutations were identified in 28 subjects with ACDMPV. Foxf1WT/S52F knock-in mice recapitulated histopathological findings in ACDMPV infants. The S52F FOXF1 mutation disrupted STAT3-FOXF1 protein-protein interactions and inhibited transcription of Stat3, a critical transcriptional regulator of angiogenesis. STAT3 signaling and endothelial proliferation were reduced in Foxf1WT/S52F mice and human ACDMPV lungs. S52F FOXF1 mutant protein did not bind chromatin and was transcriptionally inactive. Furthermore, we have developed a novel formulation of highly-efficient nanoparticles and demonstrated that nanoparticle delivery of STAT3 cDNA into the neonatal circulation restored endothelial proliferation and stimulated lung angiogenesis in Foxf1WT/S52F mice. FOXF1 acts through STAT3 to stimulate neonatal lung angiogenesis. Nanoparticle delivery of STAT3 is a promising strategy to treat ACDMPV associated with decreased STAT3 signaling. "

A full understanding of the pathogenesis of this enigmatic condition is essential if we are to develop new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Central to our understanding of the pathogenesis of early-onset preeclampsia is absolute utero-placental ischaemia, which is lack of placental vascular transformation in early pregnancy. By contrast, relative utero-placental ischaemia, due to a mismatch between utero-placental blood flow and increased demand for nutrients occurring later in pregnancy, may be central to the development of late-onset pre-eclampsia. These pathogenic mechanisms have advanced our understanding of this condition, leading to better prediction, screening and intervention modalities. Screening for pre-eclampsia in the first and second trimesters by investigating the maternoplacental circulation and placental hormones could identify a high-risk subgroup. The advantage of screening in the first trimester is that a prophylactic intervention is available in the form of low-dose aspirin, if started before 16 weeks' gestation in the high-risk group, resulting in a substantial reduction in severe early-onset pre-eclampsia, while identification of a high-risk group in the second trimester will lead to focused management in this group. Using a combination of cardiac Doppler, multi-vessel Doppler assessment of the foetal circulation and biomarkers in established pre-eclampsia in the third trimester could predict adverse outcomes and guide clinicians to timeous delivery. Hopefully, advances in our understanding of this enigmatic disease will lead to further prophylactic and new therapeutic interventions. "

A total of 328 participants were systematically sampled. A researcher-administered questionnaire collected information on: socio-demography, presence of diabetes, family history of hypercholesterolaemia, family history of fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, and engagement in physical activities. Other measurements included: blood pressure (BP), weight, height, abdominal circumference and electrocardiography (ECG). Data analysis included descriptive statistics, chi-squared test and regression analysis. Main outcome measures included the proportions of participants with each CV risk and their significant sociodemographic determinants. Participants' mean age was 57.7 years. Most participants were black (86.0%), female (79%) and pensioners (43.6%). The mean BP was 139/84 mmHg, and 60.7% had their BP controlled to targets. There was an average of 3.7 CV risk factors per participant and the prevalence of CV risk factors was: abdominal obesity (80.8%), physical inactivity (73.2%), diabetes (30.2%), alcohol use (28.0%), hypercholesterolaemia (26.5%), smoking (11.9%), past family history of fatal CV event (14.9%), and left ventricular hypertrophy (5.2%). Sociodemographic factors significantly associated with each CV risk factor were: obesity and being female (p = 0.00); alcohol use and young age (p = 0.00); smoking, being male and race other than black (p = 0.00 and p = 0.00, respectively); physical inactivity, being a pensioner and male (p = 0.02 and p = 0.02, respectively); diabetes and being male (p = 0.03); hypercholesterolaemia and race other than black (p = 0.03); family history of hypercholesterolaemia and race other than black (p = 0.00); and family history of fatal CV event and race other than black (p = 0.00). There is a high burden of CV risk factors among patients with hypertension in South African primary care, signifying a substantial risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this setting. Interventions aimed at CVD risk reduction need to take cognisance of the sociodemographic correlates of CV risk factors. "

For particles where counts are limited and are of identical isotopic signatures, we provide an option for aggregating individual measurements of single particles to reduce measurement uncertainty, as if the measurement had been performed on one larger particle. The methodology is validated on a range of certified reference materials and 'real-world' samples, ranging in age from 15 to 60 years, and on individual particles ranging in equivalent size from 0.6 to 6.8 micrometers. Additionally, we provide model age calculations for particles ranging in size from 1.0 to 3.0 micrometers across enrichments ranging from natural uranium to highly-enriched uranium and on ages ranging from 0 to 60 years. Experimental results compare well with the predicted model ages, providing realistic guidance for expectations of single micrometer-sized uranium particle age-dating measurements. The age-dating capabilities described herein are directly relevant to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its mission to safeguard nuclear materials and monitor member state nuclear programs.

Recently, the application of upconversion (UC) nanocrystals (NCs) has shown great potential for nanothermometry due to high spatial resolution, superior accuracy, and its non-invasive nature. In addition to spectral changes upon heating, anomalous thermal enhancement of UC emission has been reported for UC NCs, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report on NaY(WO4)2 doped with the Er3+-Yb3+ UC couple in NCs and the bulk material, and investigate the temperature-dependent luminescence in both air and dry nitrogen. For UC NCs in air, strong thermal enhancement of UC emission is observed with good reversibility and accompanied by a lengthening of the decay time for the Er3+ UC emission and Yb3+ IR emission. In contrast, the measurements carried out on NCs in dry nitrogen demonstrate a transition from thermal enhancement in the first cycle to thermal quenching in the subsequent cycles. The thermal quenching is similar to that in bulk materials. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements reveal the presence of water coupled on the NC surface that evaporates upon heating up to ∼470 K but is readsorbed upon cooling. Based on these observations, we explain the anomalous thermal enhancement of UC NCs in air by quenching of the Yb3+ and Er3+ emissions via surface adsorbed water molecules. The present study highlights the importance of careful characterization of surface adsorbed molecules which is crucial for understanding the luminescence properties of NCs, and enables the exploration of UC NCs with higher quantum efficiencies.

Fluorescent labeling and subsequent optical interrogation of cell membrane antigens, while highly effective, limit expression profiling to centralized facilities that can afford and operate complex instrumentation. Here, we introduce a cytometry technique that computes surface expression of immunomagnetically labeled cells by electrically tracking their trajectory under a magnetic field gradient on a microfluidic chip with a throughput of >500 cells per min. In addition to enabling the creation of a frugal cytometry platform, this immunomagnetic cell manipulation-based measurement approach allows direct expression profiling of target subpopulations from non-purified samples. We applied our technology to measure epithelial cell adhesion molecule expression on human breast cancer cells. Once calibrated, surface expression and size measurements match remarkably well with fluorescence-based measurements from a commercial flow cytometer. Quantitative measurements of biochemical and biophysical cell characteristics with a disposable cytometer have the potential to impact point of care testing of clinical samples particularly in resource limited settings.

Percutaneous TA puncture provides direct access for SH procedures and may overcome the disadvantages of surgical access. This study sought to evaluate the safety of percutaneous TA left ventricular access for SH interventions. We performed a retrospective analysis at a university hospital. Thirteen percutaneous TA procedures were performed on consecutive patients between January 2013 and July 2017 to provide LV access for transcatheter therapies. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia with three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography guidance. All TA punctures were successful. Delivery sheath sizes ranged from 5 Fr to 7 Fr. Eleven of the 13 TA sites were closed with a device. Total median procedural and fluoroscopy times were 106 minutes (interquartile range, 39-117 minutes) and 26.5 minutes (interquartile range, 8.3-43.8 minutes), respectively. The planned procedure was completed successfully in all cases. One access-site complication occurred, involving embolism of a duct occluder into the pleural space and extravasation from the apical puncture site. Hemostasis of the apex site was achieved immediately with placement of three vascular plugs from a femoral approach. Two patients died prior to discharge and neither death was related to a procedural complication. There were no significant pericardial effusions. Percutaneous TA access can be achieved safely in most cases to provide access for transcatheter procedures with short procedure times. Device closure of the TA access site is reliable, with a low complication rate and no procedure-related mortality. "

Two tissue-perfusion models were developed to address this need. The first, an intact heart model, allows simulation of percutaneous coronary interventional procedures. The second focuses upon isolated arteries, allowing quantification of simulated procedures. Both models were applied for clinical training and for investigations into medical device behavior. The manner of preparation facilitates access to clinically relevant disease, thus providing a platform to further research on coronary artery disease. "

This was a single-center, prospective registry of patients undergoing PCI following a baseline FFR ≤0.80. Patients were divided according to the post-PCI FFR value (<0.90 vs ≥0.90). The primary endpoint was the proportion of cases in which further action was undertaken in light of a post-PCI FFR value <0.90. Of 65 PCIs, a total of 43 (66%) had a post-PCI FFR <0.90 and 22 (34%) had a post-PCI FFR ≥0.90. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Baseline FFR was similar between patients with post-PCI FFR <0.90 and ≥0.90 (0.72 ± 0.08 vs 0.69 ± 0.14; P=.40). Post-PCI FFR values were 0.82 ± 0.05 in post-PCI FFR <0.90 patients and 0.94 ± 0.02 in post-PCI FFR ≥0.90 patients (P<.001). The most common reason for a post-PCI <0.90 was residual small-vessel disease (42%). In 15 patients (35%) with a post-PCI FFR <0.90, an action was undertaken. An increase of 0.05 ± 0.07 in FFR value (P=.01) was noted after these maneuvers. However, a final FFR value ≥0.90 was achieved in only 3 patients (20%). The major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate at 1-year follow-up was higher in patients with final FFR <0.90 (31.6% vs 9.1%; P=.047). A suboptimal physiologic outcome is observed in two-thirds of patients undergoing PCI. Despite further interventions, a satisfactory outcome is achieved in only a minority of cases. A post-PCI suboptimal physiologic outcome appears to be associated with a higher incidence of MACE at follow-up. "

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Kinesiotaping on managing spasticity of upper extremity and motor performance in patients with subacute stroke. A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study. One hospital center. Participants with stroke within six months. Thirty-one participants were enrolled. Patients were randomly allocated into Kinesiotaping (KT) group or control group. In KT group, Kinesio tape was applied as an add- on treatment over the dorsal side of the affected hand during the intervention. Both groups received regular rehabilitation 5 days a week for 3 weeks. The primary outcome was muscle spasticity measured by modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). Secondary outcomes were functional performances of affected limb measured by using Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity (FMA-UE), Brunnstrom stage, and the Simple Test for Evaluating Hand Function (STEF). Measures were taken before intervention, right after intervention (the third week) and two weeks later (the fifth week). Within-group comparisons yielded significant differences in FMA-UE and Brunnstrom stages at the third and fifth week in the control group (p=0.003-0.019). In the KT group, significant differences were noted in FMA-UE, Brunnstrom stage, and MAS at the third and fifth week (p=0.001-0.035), and in the proximal part of FMA-UE between the third and fifth week (p=0.005). Between-group comparisons showed a significant difference in the distal part of FMA-UE at the fifth week (p=0.037). Kinesiotaping could provide some benefits in reducing spasticity and in improving motor performance on the affected hand in patients with subacute stroke. Kinesiotaping could be a choice for clinical practitioners to use for effectively managing post-stroke spasticity. "

Not only healthcare providers, but also patients, citizens and politicians, are becoming aware of the consequences of inappropriate decisions and behaviors since inappropriateness has economic (waste of resources), clinical (risks), but also ethical implications. In Italy the movement was launched and still is coordinated by the Slow Medicine organization, that created the campaign Doing more does not mean doing better - Choosing Wisely Italy, which aimed to improve clinical appropriateness through the reduction of unnecessary tests and treatments and the dialogue between physicians and patients. Currently, 44 societies of physicians, nurses, pharmacists and physiotherapists identified 230 recommendations about tests, treatments and procedures commonly used in Italy's clinical practice that do not provide any benefit to most patients but may cause harm.

This study aimed to assess the expression of the WNT5A gene at the mRNA and protein levels in the specimens derived from endometrial cancer (EC) or unchanged control endometrium. The associations between the WNT5A expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics and survival of EC patients were evaluated. Total RNA was isolated in order to assess the relative amounts of WNT5A mRNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) in samples of unchanged endometrial control (n = 8) and tumor tissues of EC patients (n = 28). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine the presence of WNT5A protein in the sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens derived from unchanged endometrial controls (n = 6) and EC tumors (n = 19). Significance of differences in WNT5A expression levels between the studied groups of EC patients and correlations between the WNT5A and demographic data, pathological features, hematological parameters and overall survival of the patients were evaluated by statistical analysis. The level of WNT5A mRNA was decreased in EC in comparison to unchanged endometrium. WNT5A expression and influenced by was associated with primary tumor invasion status, exhibiting reduced level of transcripts in EC that involved organs beyond the uterus when compared to the uterus-confined cancers. WNT5A immunoreactivity was visualized in the cytoplasm and nuclei of EC cells as well as in the luminal and glandular epithelial cells of unchanged endometrium. WNT5A mRNA expression levels correlated negatively with cytoplasmic, and positively with nuclear immunoreactivity of the WNT5A protein in the EC cells. In addition, the relationships between blood leucocyte count (in particular granulocytes and lymphocytes) of patients with EC and their WNT5A mRNA and protein expression levels were established. A positive correlation between the nuclear immunoexpression of WNT5A protein in the cancer cells in cell nuclei and mean platelet volume in blood was also found. The results of the first study of WNT5A expression at the transcript and protein levels indicate that it could be considered as a potential marker of molecular changes that take place during EC development.

Content validity, construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), internal consistency and cut-off for SRC were investigated for the PEI after treatment. The SRC value was the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve optimal cut-off point. After treatment all items were completed by 516 patients (mean standard deviation (SD) age 45.1 years (SD 10.1), women 75% (n = 385)). The 1-factor PEI model had approximate fit to the data. The internal consistency Cronbach's alpha was between 0.878 and 0.929 for the 3 groups. Correlations between the PEI and the NDI/FRI, HADS and EQ-5D were fair to good. The SRCROC for whiplash-associated disorders, cervical radiculopathy and mixed chronic pain groups was 5, 6 and 4 points in the PEI, respectively.

Dipolar magnetic interactions, proportional to the particle volume, are identified as the key driving force behind the formation of macroscopic aggregates for particle sizes above about 20 nm. However, aggregates' shape and size are also strongly influenced by topological ordering. 1-D macroscopic chains of several micrometer lengths are obtained with cube-shaped magnetic nanoparticles prepared by the gas-aggregation technique. Using an analytical model and molecular dynamics simulations, the energy landscape of interacting cube-shaped magnetic nanoparticles is analysed revealing unintuitive dependence of the force acting on particles with the displacement and explaining pathways leading to their assembly into long linear chains. The mechanical behaviour and magnetic structure of the chains are studied by a combination of atomic and magnetic force measurements, and computer simulation. The results demonstrate that [111] magnetic anisotropy of the cube-shaped nanoparticles strongly influences chain assembly features. "

Each choice question had a pair of hypothetical treatments characterized by attributes with varying levels: improvements in severe dysmenorrhea, severe NMPP, and severe dyspareunia; mode of administration; and treatment-related risks of pregnancy-related problems, bone fracture later in life, and moderate to severe hot flashes. A random-parameters logit model was used to quantify preferences and the attributes' conditional relative importance. A total of 250 women (mean age 34 years) completed the survey.

To fill this gap, we developed the Infant Quality of life Instrument (IQI), which is administered through a mobile application. This article explains how weights were derived for the 4 levels of each health item. The IQI includes 7 health items: sleeping, feeding, breathing, stooling/poo, mood, skin, and interaction. In an online survey, respondents from the general population (n = 1409) and primary caregivers (n = 1229) from China, the United Kingdom, and the United States were presented with 10 discrete choice scenarios. Coefficients for the item levels were obtained with a conditional logit model. The highest coefficients were found for sleeping, feeding, and breathing. All coefficients for these items were negative and logically ordered, meaning that more extreme levels were less preferred. Stooling, mood, skin, and interaction showed some irregularities in the ordering of coefficients. Results for caregivers and the general population were about the same. The IQI is the first generic instrument to assess overall HRQoL in infants up to 1 year of age. It is short and easy to administer through a mobile application. We demonstrated how to derive values for infant health states with a discrete choice methodology. Our next step will be to normalize these values into utilities ranging from 0 (dead) to 1 (best health state) and to collect IQI values in a clinical population. "

Five-hundred forty-one participants, from premanifest to end-stage disease, completed the HDQoL, together with generic quality-of-life measures and in-person motor, cognitive, and behavioral assessments. The psychometric properties of the HDQoL were examined using factor analysis and Rasch analysis. Four HDQoL domains emerged, reflecting the classical triad of HD features; they were Physical-Functional, Cognitive, and 2 different behavioral aspects, that is, the Mood-Self domain and a distinct Worries domain. These domains clarify the behavioral sequelae as experienced by patients, and all showed good to excellent internal consistency. Known-groups analyses illustrated significant and graded changes in clinical assessments and corresponding HDQoL domains across disease severity levels. Convergent and discriminant validity was demonstrated by the expected pattern of correlations between specific HDQoL domains and corresponding domain-relevant clinical assessments as well as patient-reported measures. The data demonstrate robust support for the refined HDQoL across disease stages. The HDQoL, with its 2 distinct behavioral domains of Mood-Self and Worries as well as the Physical-Functional and Cognitive domains, is a relevant, reliable, and valid patient-derived instrument to measure the impact of HD across all severity stages.

An instrument to measure patients' preparation for medical interventions (MiPrep) was developed and tested with patients undergoing medical imaging, radiotherapy, or surgery. Patients were recruited and asked to complete 2 surveys. Survey A assessed patient and intervention characteristics. Survey B (postintervention) contained MiPrep to assess validity (face, content, and construct) and reliability (internal consistency and test-retest). A total of 869 (85%) patients consented to participate and 551 (63%) returned the postintervention survey. Face and content validity were demonstrated. Exploratory factor analysis identified 2 survey modules: receipt and adequacy of information (2 domains) and overall appraisal of patient-centered care (1 domain). Reliability was evidenced by adequate internal consistency (Cronbach α 0.81-0.89) and item-total correlations higher than 0.20. Nevertheless, individual item test-retest reliability requires further confirmation. The final instrument contained 27 items. The MiPrep instrument has evidence of being a valid and reliable instrument of preparation for medical interventions. Healthcare providers can use the instrument as a quality assurance tool to identify areas for improvement and areas of excellence in patients' preparation. Future studies should verify these findings in other populations and examine the divergent and predictive validity of the instrument. "

Assuming a UK National Health Service perspective, we used a probabilistic decision tree and Markov model to compare 3 unstratified shortened treatment durations (8, 6, and 4 weeks) against a standard 12-week treatment duration. Patients failing shortened first-line treatment were re-treated with a 12-week treatment regimen. Parameter inputs were taken from published studies. The 8-week treatment duration had an expected incremental net monetary benefit of £7737 (95% confidence interval £3242-£11 819) versus the standard 12-week treatment, per 1000 patients. The 6-week treatment had a positive incremental net monetary benefit, although some uncertainty was observed. The probability that the 8- and 6-week treatments were the most cost-effective was 56% and 25%, respectively, whereas that for the 4-week treatment was 17%. Results were generally robust to sensitivity analyses, including a threshold analysis that showed that the 8-week treatment was the most cost-effective at all drug prices lower than £40 000 per 12-week course. Shortening treatments licensed for 12 weeks to 8 weeks is cost-effective in genotype 1 noncirrhotic treatment-naive patients. There was considerable uncertainty in the estimates for 6- and 4-week treatments, with some indication that the 6-week treatment may be cost-effective. "

Utility-theoretic outcome equivalents are widely used in other areas of applied economics. Equivalence values can be derived for time, money, risk, and other metrics. These equivalence measures preserve all available information about individual preferences and are valid measures of individual welfare changes. The objective of this study was to derive alternative generalized equivalence measures from first principles and illustrate their application in an empirical comparative-effectiveness example. We specify a general-equilibrium model incorporating neoclassical utility functions, health production function, severity-duration preferences, and labor-market tradeoff function. The empirical implementation takes advantage of discrete-choice experiment methods that are widely accepted in other areas of applied economics and increasingly in health economics. We illustrate the practical significance of restrictive QALY assumptions using comparative-effectiveness results based on both QALYs and estimates of welfare-theoretic time-equivalent values for anti-tumor necrosis factor and prolonged corticosteroid treatments for Crohn's disease in three distinct preference classes. The QALY difference between the two treatments is 0.2 months, while time-equivalent values range between 0.5 and 1.3 months for aggregate and class-specific differences. Thus, the QALY-based analysis understates welfare-theoretic values by 60%-85%. These results suggest that using disease-specific equivalence values offer a meaningful alternative to QALYs to compare global outcomes across treatments. The equivalence values approach is consistent with principles of welfare economics and offers several features not represented in QALYs, including accounting for preference nonlinearities in disease severity and duration, inclusion of preference-relevant nonclinical healthcare factors, representing preferences of clinically-relevant patient subpopulations, and including utility losses related to risk aversion.

Innovators worry about bias against ""cures"" in favor of repeat treatment, which is not in patients' interests. We find that even in the absence of a difference in uncertainty of outcomes, adverse pay-offs differ. The greater financial risk associated with a cure is related to the issue of treatment discontinuation, driven by irreversibility. This paper uses a stylized example to illustrate the need to separate three different elements of the issue: (i) one-off versus repeat or ongoing treatment, (ii) duration of treatment effect, and (iii) the potential role of financial arrangements or risk sharing to mitigate the financial risk to the payer. It concludes that: (i) prevalence and discontinuation issues mean that the impact on the payer of an incorrect decision is greater with a one-off treatment than a repeat therapy; (ii) with evidence collection this risk diminishes over time (a form of CED or OWR); and (iii) financial arrangements or risk sharing can eliminate differences for the payer as between one-off and repeat therapy. The impact of (iii) also addresses payer concerns about budget impact. "

Curing CHC infection reduces the need for liver transplants and enables cured individuals to donate organs of all types. We adapted a double-queuing model of organ allocation to estimate the effects of CHC infection cures on liver, lung, heart, and kidney transplants in the United Kingdom. We assumed that cured individuals would donate organs at similar rates as the general population and no longer require liver transplants because of CHC infection. We estimated how curing CHC infection influences waitlist lengths for each organ and the annual net present value to society on the basis of quality-adjusted life-years gained through additional transplants under opt-in and opt-out organ donation policies. Curing CHC generates the most value for patients on the liver waitlist, because it increases the number of transplantable livers and reduces the need for transplants. Under the current opt-in policy, liver waitlist length falls by 24%, generating £34.3 million of annual net present value. Growth in the number of uninfected lungs, hearts, and kidneys generates an additional £19.2 million annually, with £18.7 million from kidneys. Implementing the opt-out policy, liver waitlist length would decrease by 75%, implying that treating CHC eliminates one-third of the excess liver waitlist due to an opt-in policy. Treating CHC has large positive spillovers to uninfected individuals by reducing the need for liver transplants and allowing cured individuals to donate organs. These spillovers have not been included in traditional value assessments of CHC treatment. "

The objectives of this study are to understand how healthcare payers define and manage cures. We investigated payers' views on key features of curative treatments and the affordability and value challenges they present. We conducted semistructured interviews in 2016 with key informants in US payer organizations. Interviewees were directly involved in coverage determination for highly effective and curative therapies. We contacted 24 individuals and 18 participated. When asked what aspects of cures were important for coverage determination, an equal percentage of respondents (61% each) mentioned clinical and economic factors. In defining a cure, half of respondents included an economic element such as no downstream costs associated with the disease. When asked about challenges, 72% of respondents mentioned uncertainty regarding long-term outcomes and 56% mentioned membership churn and competition. Payers expressed a novel definition of a cure-which we call a ""healthcare cost cure""-that captures both the clinical and economic consequences of treatment. This definition may be more pertinent in fragmentary financing systems that unevenly distribute cure costs and benefits across payers. Overall findings indicate that decision makers desire evidence to ensure that the long-term real-world consequences of covering cures match the expected benefits. Future policies need to balance upfront acquisition costs with downstream financial benefits. "

Payers cited regulation, plan turnover, and ability to track long-term outcomes as barriers to implementation of new models. Access to new gene therapies may be impacted by payer ability to absorb the cost of coverage. Variation exists in awareness of new gene therapies and level of incorporation of new costs into future plan coverage. The sustainability of current financing mechanisms varies by payer segment, profitability, and size; smaller plans and Medicaid are likely to be impacted first. Government reinsurance, commercial reinsurance, and stop-loss insurance backstop current reimbursement models, dampening the need for urgent action. The tipping point for action may be severe premium inflation in stop loss and reinsurance.

We found a dose propensity-adjusted increase of 0.32 cups (95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.45 cups) for each additional visit while holding constant the predicted number of visits and site. An equal portion of the change-score increase was attributed to vegetable consumption and fruit consumption (β = 0.16 for each).

Counties with the highest prevalence of mental distress were found in regional clusters where levels of social capital were low, including the Black Belt, central/southern Appalachia, on the Mississippi River, and around some Indian Reservations. Most of the association between social capital and mental distress was indirect, from the neighboring counties, although significant direct effects showed the within-county association. Models also confirmed the importance of county-level socioeconomic status. We found that county social capital is negatively related to mental distress.

The objective of this analysis was to describe methods for the analysis of highly censored data. A substitution approach was compared with 1) a simple, nonspatial Bayesian model that smooths rates toward their statewide averages and 2) a more complex Bayesian model that accounts for spatial and between-age sources of dependence. Age group-specific county-level data on heart disease mortality were used for the comparisons. Although the substitution and nonspatial approach provided age-standardized rate estimates that were more highly correlated with the true rate estimates, the estimates from the spatial Bayesian model provided a superior compromise between goodness-of-fit and model complexity, as measured by the deviance information criterion. In addition, the spatial Bayesian model provided rate estimates with greater precision than the nonspatial approach; in contrast, the substitution approach did not provide estimates of uncertainty. Because of the ability to account for multiple sources of dependence and the flexibility to include covariate information, the use of spatial Bayesian models should be considered when analyzing highly censored data from CDC WONDER.

The intersection of the two curves is the current circulating blood flow under the Pra at this moment. In patients with hemodynamically unstable shock, the primary treatment goal is to restore circulating blood volume and tissue perfusion with primary methods including fluid resuscitation and the use of vasoactive drugs. This review described the dynamic evolution of VR curve in hemodynamic intervention of shock patients and the changes in physiological indicators such as mean systemic filling pressure (Pmsf), venous resistance (Rv), and stressed volume (Vs), in order to more accurately interpret changes in hemodynamic parameters and guide the clinical treatment of shock from a goal-oriented perspective.

Specimens of sputum, urine, blood, secretions and puncture fluid were collected from patients admitted to the Harrison International Peace Hospital from November 2013 to November 2018. The origin of specimens, the distribution of departments and the distribution of pathogenic bacteria isolated were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 61 286 specimens were sent for examination during the 5 years. The top 5 specimens were sputum culture (n = 18 302, 29.9%), sputum smear (n = 11 253, 18.4%), blood culture (n = 9 713, 15.8%), urine culture (n = 6 448, 10.5%) and secretion culture (n = 6 133, 10.0%), accounting for 84.6% (51 849/61 286). Sputum specimens accounted for 48.2% (29 555/61 286) with the largest proportion. The number of specimens from medical wards was much higher than that from surgical wards (specimens: 25 468 vs. 10 521), respiratory medicine, department of critical care medicine and emergency intensive care unit (EICU) were important sources of pathogenic specimens in the hospital, accounting for 29.8% (18 243/61 286) in total. The average positive rate of all specimens was 23.5% (14 424/61 286). The positive rates of sputum culture and urine culture were 29.7% (5 428/18 302) and 35.4% (2 281/6 448), respectively, while the positive rate of blood culture was only 6.6% (643/9 713).

The clinical data of 302 patients with multiple trauma hospitalized in the emergency department of Gansu Provincial People's Hospital from August 2015 to December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. The general clinical data of the patients were collected. The patients were divided into three groups according to injury severity score (ISS): mild injury group (ISS ≤ 16), serious injury group (ISS 17-25), and severe injury group (ISS > 25). The results of vital signs, routine coagulation test, blood routine, blood biochemistry, and arterial blood gas analysis were recorded, and the National early warning score (NEWS) was calculated. TEG parameters were analyzed. Pearson correlation analysis and linear regression analysis were used to analyze the correlation between TEG indicators and NEWS score. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of TEG indicators for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with severe injury. 299 patients were enrolled in the final analysis, including 92 patients in the mild injury group, 109 in the serious injury group and 98 in the severe injury group. With the increase in trauma severity, the NEWS score and TEG indicators including coagulation reaction time (R value) and blood clot generation time (K value) were gradually increased [NEWS score in mild, serious, and severe injury group was 3.46±0.89, 5.85±0.62, 9.75±1.76, R value (minutes) was 5.8±2.8, 7.8±2.6, 11.7±3.0, and K value (minutes) was 2.4±1.0, 4.2±1.4, 5.5±2.9, respectively], and blood clot generation rate (α angle), maximum width value (MA value) and coagulation index (CI) were gradually decreased [α angle (degree angle) in mild, serious, and severe injury group was 66.9±13.5, 55.7±22.9, 46.8±26.3, MA value (mm) was 51.8±9.7, 48.1±17.0, 38.5±15.2, and CI was 2.0±3.6, -2.8±3.5, -6.7±2.9, respectively], the differences were statistically significant among the groups (all P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the NEWS score was positively correlated with R and K values (r value was 0.463,0.588, respectively, both P < 0.01), and it was negatively correlated with α angle, MA value and CI (r value was -0.622, -0.689, -0.902, respectively, all P < 0.01). Linear correlation analysis showed that for every 1 minute increase in R value, NEWS score increased by 0.882 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.691 to 1.073]; for every 1 minute increase in K value, NEWS score increased by 0.484 (95%CI = 0.408 to 0.559); for every 1degree angleincrease in α angle, NEWS score decreased by 2.910 (95%CI = -3.325 to -2.494); for every 1 mm increase in MA value, NEWS score decreased by 2.223 (95%CI = -2.488 to -1.958); for every 1 increase in CI, NEWS score decreased by 1.292 (95%CI = -1.362 to -1.221). The R and K values in DIC patients (n = 37) of the severe injury group were significantly higher than those in non-DIC patients [n = 61; R value (minutes): 15.8±5.6 vs. 9.8±2.6, K value (minutes): 7.6±3.1 vs. 4.3±2.2], and α angle, MA value and CI were significantly lowered [α angle (degree angle): 48.7±19.8 vs. 59.6±26.2, MA value (mm): 37.5±19.2 vs. 49.2±18.6, CI: -8.5±3.4 vs. -5.2±3.1], the differences were statistically significant between the two groups (all P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the R and K values for predicting DIC was 0.999 and 0.958, respectively. When the optimal cut-off value of R value was 12.3 minutes, the sensitivity and specificity were 97.5% and 100%; when the optimal cut-off value of K value was 5.7 minutes, the sensitivity and specificity were 92.5% and 82.0%. The AUC of α angle, MA value and CI were 0.084, 0.060 and 0.114, which had no predictive value. TEG indicators have clinical value on predicting the severity of illness in patients with multiple trauma. The changes in R and K values are effective indicators to judge the risk of DIC in patients with severe multiple trauma. "

Thirty septic shock patients with spontaneous respiration admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Tianjin First Center Hospital from July 2016 to August 2018 were enrolled. PLR and volume expansion (VE) were performed successively. The hemodynamic parameters including left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), stroke volume (SV) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before PLR (baseline level), after PLR, immediately after VE were examined by echocardiography, and the central venous pressure (CVP) was monitored. The patients with increase in SV after VE (ΔSV) ≥ 15% were served as reaction group, while ΔSV < 15% were served as non-reaction group. The changes in LVEDV, LVESV, SV, LVEF and CVP at baseline level, after PLR and after VE were compared between the two groups. Pearson correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between ΔSV, increase in LVEF (ΔLVEF) after PLR and ΔSV, and ΔLVEF after VE. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the predictive value of ΔSV and ΔLVEF after PLR for volume responsiveness. PLR and VE were successfully performed in 30 patients, of which 23 patients (76.7%) were enrolled in the reaction group, and 7 patients (23.3%) in the non-reaction group.

The septic patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Tianjin Third Central Hospital from July 2014 to September 2017 were enrolled. Montreal cognitive assessment scale (MoCA) was used to assess the cognitive function of patients at 3, 12 and 24 months after discharge from hospital. The patients were divided into cognitive impairment group (MoCA score < 26) and normal cognitive function group (MoCA score ≥ 26) according to the MoCA scores at 12 months after discharge from hospital. The basic characteristics and clinical data were recorded in both groups, the variables with statistical significance in univariate analysis were enrolled in bivariate Logistic regression analysis, and the influencing factors of cognitive impairment in patients with sepsis were screened. During the study period, 1 748 patients with sepsis were admitted, 210 survived and discharged, and 125 patients participated in the follow-up. Cognitive impairment occurred in 61.6% (77/125), 54.4% (56/103) and 54.2% (39/72) of the septic patients at 3, 12 and 24 months after discharge, respectively. The MoCA score of 103 patients who completed 12-month follow-up was significantly higher than that of 3-month follow-up (23.4±5.7 vs. 23.0±6.0, P < 0.01); the MoCA score of 72 patients who completed 24-month follow-up was only slightly lower than that of 12-month follow-up (23.6±5.4 vs. 23.7±5.0, P > 0.05). Following up for 12 months, 47 patients were enrolled in the normal cognitive function group and 56 in the cognitive impairment group. Compared with the normal cognitive function group, the cognitive dysfunction group had more female [51.8% (29/56) vs. 31.9% (15/47)] and older patients (years old: 66.1±15.9 vs. 52.4±18.9), also had shorter time to receive education (years: 7.6±4.0 vs. 11.2±3.1), longer duration of delirium [days: 2 (0, 3) vs. 0 (0, 1)], with significant differences (all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the marital status, severity of infection, underlying diseases, routes of transfer, total length of hospital stay, the length of ICU stay, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score within 24 hours of admission to ICU, hypoxemia, hypotension, mechanical ventilation, hemofiltration, or drug use between the two groups. Bivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the duration of education was a protective factor for cognitive impairment in patients with sepsis who were followed up for 12 months [odds ratio (OR) = 0.791, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.678-0.923, P = 0.003], and age and duration of delirium were risk factors (age: OR = 1.038, 95%CI = 1.009-1.068, P = 0.010; duration of delirium: OR = 1.314, 95%CI = 1.002-1.724, P = 0.048). Long-term cognitive impairment occurs in many septic patients after discharge and improves over time. Duration of education is a protective factor for cognitive impairment in patients with sepsis, while age and delirium duration are risk factors. "

The Chinese and English literatures concerning the diagnostic accuracy of ROSIER published from January 1st 2005 to December 31st 2018 by PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, VIP and CNKI databases were searched comprehensively and systematically. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of ROSIER in total population and subgroup analysis were pooled by using bivariate mixed effects model. Sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the stability of the results. Deek funnel plot was utilized to evaluate publication bias. The clinical applicability of ROSIER was evaluated by Fagan Nomogram. A total of 28 studies incorporating 7 579 subjects were enrolled in this Meta-analysis. Meta-analysis in total population showed that the pooled sensitivity, specificity and DOR of ROSIER was 0.89 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.86-0.91, P = 0.00], 0.74 (95%CI = 0.67-0.80, P = 0.00) and 22.09 (95%CI = 14.86-32.82, P = 0.00), respectively.

Subgroup analysis of pooled specificity of ROSIER showed that European patients was significantly higher than Asian patients [0.81 (95%CI = 0.73-0.89) vs. 0.79 (95%CI = 0.73-0.85), P < 0.05], retrospective study was significantly higher than prospective study [0.88 (95%CI = 0.78-0.97) vs. 0.79 (95%CI = 0.73-0.84), P < 0.05], pre-hospital emergency was significantly higher than emergency department [0.82 (95%CI = 0.73-0.91) vs. 0.79 (95%CI = 0.73-0.85), P < 0.01], emergency physicians was significantly higher than other medical workers [0.80 (95%CI = 0.74-0.86) vs. 0.79 (95%CI = 0.69-0.90), P < 0.05], study with sample size ≤ 200 was significantly higher than study with sample size > 200 [0.82 (95%CI = 0.76-0.89) vs. 0.78 (95%CI = 0.71-0.85), P < 0.05], but there was no significant difference between different male or female ratio subgroups. Sensitivity analysis showed that there was no significant change in pooled DOR before and after excluding each study, indicating that the results were stable. Funnel plot showed that there was a significant publication bias in the total population (P = 0.04), but there was no publication bias in the European population (P = 0.57) or the Asian population (P = 0.08). According to the results of the Fagan Nomogram, with the pretest probability of 50%, when ROSIER was positive, the probability of being diagnosed with stroke increased to 77%, and when ROSIER was negative, the probability of being diagnosed with non-stroke decreased to 13%. It was suggested that ROSIER had good applicability and high clinical diagnostic value. ROSIER has high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, and has high clinical diagnostic value. It is a valid stroke identification tool which can be widely used in Asian population, pre-hospital emergency and be utilized by trained medical worker. "

The patients with craniocerebral injury admitted to neurosurgery intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from July to November in 2018 were enrolled. The changes in antral contraction frequency (ACF), antral contraction amplitude (ACA) and antral motility index (MI) were dynamically observed at 1-6 days after injury by ultrasonography. According to Glasgow coma score (GCS), the patients were divided into moderate to severe craniocerebral (GCS ≤ 11) and mild craniocerebral injury groups (GCS > 11). The differences in ACF, ACA and MI between the two groups were compared to observe the effect of craniocerebral injury on gastric antral motility. The patients were divided into simple supratentorial and supratentorial combined infratentorial lesion groups according to the lesion location of craniocerebral injury. The differences in ACF, ACA and MI between the two groups were compared to analyze the influence of lesion location on gastric antrum activity. A total of 68 patients with craniocerebral injury were screened during the study period, 50 patients were in accorded with the admission criteria, 17 patients were withdrawn from the observation because they could not tolerate the ultrasonography of gastric antrum or discharged from ICU. Finally, 33 patients were enrolled in the analysis. (1) The ACF, ACA and MI at 1 day after injury were lower [ACF (times/min): 1.67 (0.00, 2.00), ACA: 42.06 (0.00, 44.45)%, MI: 0.70 (0.00, 0.87)], and then gradually increased, till 6 days after injury, ACF was 1.83 (1.25, 2.79) times/min, ACA was 56.80 (33.25, 60.77)%, and MI was 0.89 (0.50, 1.70), which showed no differences among all time points (all P > 0.05). (2) The contractile function of gastric antrum in two groups of patients with different degrees of craniocerebral injury was decreased, especially ACA in patients with moderate to severe craniocerebral injury (n = 22), which showed significant differences at 3 days and 5 days after injury as compared with mild craniocerebral injury [n = 11; 3 days: 35.05 (0.00, 53.69)% vs. 58.51 (49.90, 65.45)%, 5 days: 39.88 (0.00, 77.01)% vs. 56.94 (41.71, 66.66)%, both P < 0.05], indicating that the degree of craniocerebral injury affected the contractive function of gastric antrum. However, there was no significant difference in ACF or MI between the two groups at different time points after injury. (3) The contractile function of gastric antrum was decreased after craniocerebral injury in both groups of patients with different lesion locations of craniocerebral injury. The ACF, ACA, and MI at 3-4 days in patients with supratentorial combined infratentorial lesion (n = 12) were slightly lower than those in patients with simple supratentorial lesion [n = 21; 3 days: ACF (times/min) was 0.83 (0.00, 2.00) vs. 2.25 (0.00, 3.00), ACA was 35.05 (0.00, 53.60)% vs. 49.93 (0.00, 63.44)%, MI was 0.29 (0.00, 1.07) vs. 1.23 (0.00, 1.61); 4 days: ACF (times/min) was 1.42 (0.50, 2.63) vs. 2.00 (1.63, 2.63), ACA was 30.45 (21.69, 60.61)% vs. 43.29 (38.41, 53.35)%, MI was 0.50 (0.15, 1.45) vs. 0.97 (0.66, 1.28)] without statistical differences (all P > 0.05), indicating that the lesion location might not affect the contractive function of gastric antrum. In the early stage of craniocerebral injury, the contractile function of gastric antrum was decreased, and the more severe the craniocerebral injury, the worse contractive function of gastric antrum.

Fifty-one male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups by random digit table: normal control group (n = 13), EHS group (n = 13), EHS+water group (n = 12), and EHS+ORS III group (n = 13). All rats in the EHS groups received adaptive training for 7 days before the experiment. On the 8th day, the rats of EHS+water and EHS+ORS III groups were orally given 20 mL/kg water or ORS III 30 minutes before the experiment. No pretreatment was performed in the EHS group. EHS model was reproduced by forcing rats to run under hot environment. The rats which refused to exercise and which core temperature > 40.5 centigrade were considered as the onset of EHS. The rats in the normal control group were exposed to room temperature (25±2) centigrade and humidity (50±5)% without any treatment. Six hours later, blood of inferior vena cava was collected, and the levels of serum MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum potassium, serum sodium and serum chloride were determined by automatic chemical analyzer. Serum intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

In the EHS+ORS III group, only serum potassium level was significantly lower than that in the EHS group [mmol/L: 4.0 (3.7, 4.4) vs. 5.5 (4.4, 6.2), P < 0.01], while no significant difference in other parameters was found between the EHS+ORS III group and the EHS group as well as the EHS+water group. Serum I-FABP level in the EHS group was significantly higher than that in the normal control group [μg/L: 36.90 (29.10, 45.00) vs. 11.39 (0.31, 20.80), P < 0.01].

EHS could lead to liver, intestinal barrier dysfunction and electrolyte disturbance. Pre-treatment of ORS III could alleviate the intestinal dysfunction and electrolyte disorder caused by EHS in rats. It can lower the serum potassium to some extent. However, ORS III failed to protect liver from EHS. "

The patients who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) due to chest pain admitted to department of cardiology of Tianjin Chest Hospital from April 2017 to December 2018 were enrolled, and they were divided into CHD group and non-CHD group according to the CAG results. The gender, age, history of hypertension, smoking history, diabetes, the levels of cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein AI (apoAI), apolipoprotein B (apoB), lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)], MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB) and other clinical data of patients were collected. The serum levels of OPG, sRANKL, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Correlation analysis showed that IGF-1 level was significantly positively correlated with the number of coronary artery lesions (r = 0.612, P < 0.01), while IL-6 was not correlated with the number of coronary artery lesions (r = 0.185, P > 0.05). (3) Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated serum OPG and IGF-1 levels were risk factors for CHD [OPG: odds ratio (OR) = 1.995, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.936-2.067, P = 0.012; IGF-1: OR = 1.009, 95%CI = 1.004-1.015, P = 0.001]. (4) ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of OPG and IGF-1 was 0.716 and 0.867, respectively.

CHD was associated with increased in OPG, related inflammatory cytokines including MMP-9, MCP-1, IGF-1 and IL-6, and decreased in sRANKL. The level of IGF-1 was positively correlated with the severity of CHD. The serum levels of OPG and IGF-1 were risk factors for CHD, which had good predictive value for CHD. "

A prospective observational study was conducted. Thirty septic patients (septic group) and 30 septic shock patients (septic shock group) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from August 2018 to December 2018, and 20 healthy adults were served as healthy control group. Serum samples were collected within 24 hours after ICU admission in septic shock and septic groups, and in healthy control group during physical examination. The serum I-FABP, D-lactic acid, endotoxin, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and lactic acid (Lac) were determined. Gender and age of all subjects, and basic diseases, the main area of infection and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores within 24 hours after ICU admission of all patients were recorded. At the same time, the survival of the patients was followed up for 28 days. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum I-FABP, D-lactic acid and other parameters. Risk factors of death in patients with sepsis and septic shock were screened by multivariate Logistic regression analysis of bicategorized variables. There was no significant difference in gender or age among the groups, as well as in the proportion of basic diseases, celiac infection or non-celiac infection between the sepsis group and the septic shock group, indicating that the general clinical baseline data among the groups were comparable. Serum levels of I-FABP and D-lactic acid in the sepsis group and the septic shock group were significantly higher than those in the healthy control group [I-FABP (μg/L): 27.46 (22.52, 34.39), 36.95 (29.82, 44.24) vs. 17.93 (14.65, 22.11), D-lactic acid (mg/L): 15.32 (9.84, 38.62), 27.95 (10.01, 47.69) vs. 9.38 (8.81, 14.48), all P < 0.01]. The serum level of I-FABP in the septic shock group was significantly higher than that in the sepsis group (P < 0.05), but the difference in serum D-lactic acid level between the two groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Serum I-FABP level in the celiac infection group (n = 40) was significantly higher than that in the non-celiac infection group [n = 20; μg/L: 34.76 (27.46, 43.90) vs. 25.71 (20.55, 37.77), P < 0.01], but the difference in serum D-lactic acid level was not statistically significant [mg/L: 25.13 (9.83, 40.55) vs. 30.36 (10.17, 50.00), P > 0.05]. There was no significant difference in serum I-FABP or D-lactic acid levels between the survival group (n = 34) and the death group [n = 26; I-FABP (μg/L): 33.39 (25.20, 39.50) vs. 29.26 (22.50, 43.81), D-lactic acid (mg/L): 14.83 (9.71, 38.45) vs. 33.90 (11.93, 45.34), both P > 0.05]. Correlation analysis between serum I-FABP, D-lactic acid level and endotoxin, inflammatory factors, Lac and APACHE II score in septic and septic shock patients showed that only D-lactic acid was significantly positively correlated with TNF-α and Lac (r values were 0.455 and 0.406, respectively, both P < 0.01), while I-FABP was not correlated with endotoxin, inflammatory factors, Lac or APACHE II score. Multivariable Logistic regression analysis showed the APACHE II score was an independent risk factor to affect the prognosis (death for 28 days) of septic and septic shock patients [odds ratio (OR) = 1.248, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 1.091-1.427, P = 0.001], while I-FABP, D-lactic acid, endotoxin, hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6, and Lac had no impact on 28-day prognosis of patients. Serum I-FABP and D-lactic acid levels can evaluate early intestinal injury in patients with sepsis and septic shock, but neither of them is related to the prognosis of patients. "

In 2018, editors of the Chinese Journal of Emergency Medicine evaluated the current situation of the emergency departments of county-level hospitals and found an unbalanced, inadequate, irregular, and unstable status existed among them. In order to provide developmental principles and constructional goals for the emergency departments of county-level hospitals, which located in different regions and with uneven foundations, Emergency Medical Branch of Chinese Medical Association particularly formulated this expert consensus. It not only suits for county-level general hospitals but also offers reference to the traditional Chinese medicine hospitals and specialized hospitals. The consensus includes: duties and scope of the emergency department, flow layout, equipment configuration and technology, job setting and staffing, management of emergency department, information construction and centralized construction. Construction specifications are divided into basic standards and recommended standards. The terms in the text are basic standards, and recommendations are improvements on basic standards. The basic standards are mainly suitable for the 2 Grade general hospitals, and the recommended standards mainly for 3 Grade general hospitals. "

This consensus aims at the critical and weak link of emergency medical service system (EMSS) in China, providing the public with the first responders action guidance, and guiding the public how to effectively rescue the ""first scene"", ""first time"" and ""first responder"" in the event of sudden injury or illness. Strengthen risk pre-control, environmental control and overall joint control in the ""first scene"" of different emergencies were emphasized. How to correctly judge, recognize, call for help and give first aid in the ""first time"" were presented. The first aid skills of the ""first responder"" should include cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), automated external defibrillator (AED) defibrillation, Heimlich (abdominal impingement), hemostasis, dressing, fixation, and handling. The best place, the best training method and the best communication way to popularize the first aid knowledge and skills were proposed, and the first responder action plan was jointly promoted from various social levels such as policy, law, science and technology, culture and so on. This consensus refers to relevant foreign guidelines and scientific basis and combines with Chinese actual national conditions to provide guidance for the first responders' action and training, aiming to promote the development of first aid in China.

Many wrote books for an increasingly numerate metropolitan market on topics covering a wide range of mathematical disciplines, ranging from algebra to arithmetic, from merchants' accounts to the art of surveying. They were also teachers of mathematics like John Kersey or Euclid Speidell who would use their own rooms or the premises of instrument-makers for instruction. There was a high degree of interdependency even beyond their immediate milieu. Authors would cite not only each other, but also practitioners of other professions, especially those artisans with whom they collaborated closely. Practical mathematical books effectively served as an advertising medium for the increasingly self-conscious members of a new emerging professional class. Contemporaries would talk explicitly of 'the London mathematicians' in distinction to their academic counterparts at Oxford or Cambridge. The article takes a closer look at this metropolitan knowledge culture during the second half of the century, considering its locations, its meeting places and the mathematical clubs which helped forge the identity of its practitioners. It discusses their backgrounds, teaching practices and relations to the London book trade, which supplied inexpensive practical mathematical books to a seemingly insatiable public. "
