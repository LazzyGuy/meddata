            <Abstract>
                <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Population mobility and migration are important processes of human life. It affects broad range of sociocultural parameters. Mobility increases personal interaction and exposure to sexual partners from high-risk group. Although traditional Indian value prohibits premarital or extramarital sexual activities, but this aspect has not been explored in migrant workers.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">It was a qualitative study based on indepth interview of participants. The participants were wives of migrant workers. Indepth interviews were conducted by two female field interviewers recruited for the study. A total of 24 study subjects were recruited for the study. An indepth interview guide was prepared which mainly focused on sexual behavior, including premarital, marital, and extramarital, quality of marital relationship, gender roles, peer networks, substance abuse, work-related activities, etc., The transcripts were analyzed in NVIVO and themes were generated.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The premarital sex was more common in boys than girls. It is more common in the same age group and has increased in the recent years. Various reasons were cited in relation to premarital sex in rural areas like love affair, delayed marriage, watching bad movies, bad company, allurement for gifts money, etc., Some women had opinion that males belonging to affluent and powerful families had tendency to enjoy sex with other women within and outside village. The major themes which emerged from the study were the sexual activity, type of sexual partners, reasons for multiple sexual partner, and risky and nonrisky sexual activity.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The findings of the study provided insights to design and conduct a larger and more representative quantitative study among the wives of migrant workers to understand the dynamic combination of biomedical, behavioral, and sociocultural factors that may influence transmission of infection within marriage.</AbstractText>
