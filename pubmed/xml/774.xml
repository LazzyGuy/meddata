                <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Studies have revealed a higher incidence of injury and illness among elite adaptive athletes when compared to able-bodied athletes in competition. However, individuals with disabilities report poorer access to healthcare.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">The purpose of this study is to identify differences in healthcare access, satisfaction and unmet needs between recreational adaptive and able-bodied athletes in all sports and within a single sport (hockey).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">Cross-sectional, survey-based study SETTING: Recreation sports programs in Boston, MA and Chicago, IL PARTICIPANTS: Adult, recreational, competitive adaptive and able-bodied athletes INTERVENTIONS: Not Applicable MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The Short-Form Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ-18) for healthcare access and satisfaction; percentage of athletes reporting unmet sports-related healthcare needs in the prior year RESULTS: Sixty adaptive athletes (78% male, age 35.7 +/-12.4 years) and 65 able-bodied athletes (40% male, age 34.9 +/- 11.9 years) participated. Mean access and satisfaction scores were not significantly different between groups in all sports (p=0.53 and p=0.19, respectively) or hockey (p=0.28 and p=0.55, respectively). Unmet needs were more commonly reported among adaptive athletes (18.3% all sports, 20.0% hockey) as compared to able-bodied athletes (9.2% all sports, 4.0% hockey). This reached statistical significance in the hockey group (p=0.03), but not all sports (p=0.12).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">No differences were seen between groups in healthcare access or satisfaction scores. Adaptive athletes of the same sport reported a higher rate of unmet sports-related healthcare needs but with few doctor's visits in the preceding year, suggesting discrepancies in expectations and healthcare-seeking behavior.
