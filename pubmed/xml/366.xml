                <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) may reflect a systemic dysplastic arteriopathy independent of a recognized connective tissue disease. It is hypothesized that RAAs are associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms (IcAs). The objective of this study was to better define the association of IcAs in women with RAAs.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Women aged 20 to 60 years-old having RAAs encountered at the University of Michigan from 2001-2016 were identified for study. Their clinical status and radiologic images were retrospectively reviewed. with particular attention directed to the prevalence of IcAs. Phenotypic characteristics predictive of associated cerebrovascular lesions were assessed using various statistical analyses, including binomial logistic regression.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Among 83 women with RAAs, the average age at time of RAA detection was 45.3 ± 9.9 years (range, 20-60 years). Hypertension affected 67.5% (n56) and poorly controlled hypertension prompted imaging for suspected renal arterial disease in 14.5% (n12) patients. Multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia occurred in 14.8% (n12) of patients, and unifocal stenosis affected 8.4% (n7). Imaging of the intracranial vasculature (n31) documented 12 aneurysms in nine women; the cavernous internal carotid artery being most commonly affected. Among the study's patients, 24.1% (n20) had an 'at-risk disorder for IcA formation', although the frequency of relevant 'at-risk disorders' in those with and without IcAs was not statistically different (p=0.21). Rupture risk defined by PHASES score was less than 1% for 10 IcAs, but two IcAs carried a 2.4% and 7.2% respective rupture risk over a 5 year time period, respectively. Surgical management was pursued in 50% (n6) of the study's IcAs.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Coexisting RAAs and IcAs may reflect a systemic arteriopathy. IcAs appear to occur with greater frequency in women with RAAs than the general population. This observation warrants prospective investigation as to the clinical appropriateness and relevance of cerebrovascular imaging in women having RAAs. Furthermore, this study's findings prompt further investigation of the underlying pathogenesis of what appears to be a broader and more complex arterial disease than previously recognized.</AbstractText>
