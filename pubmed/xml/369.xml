                <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare disorder that has relatively high prevalence in the Huang-Huai area of China. Effective treatment of BCS accompanied with inferior vena cava thrombosis is challenging.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="OBJECTIVE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical effectiveness and safety of traditional open operations versus pre-opening and staged percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the inferior vena cava in treating BCS accompanied with inferior vena cava thrombosis.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Data from patients hospitalized and treated for BCS accompanied with inferior vena cava thrombosis between January 1997 and December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-two patients received traditional open operation (open group). Fifty-six patients received pre-opening and staged percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the inferior vena cava (PTA group). Baseline and clinical data were compared between groups. The patients were followed for up to 60 months. Postoperative recurrence rates and restenosis degree were recorded.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Eighty-eight patients were included (47 males and 41 females), aged 41.82±10.12 years (range: 29-65 years). In the open group, no pulmonary arterial embolism was found during and after the operation, and the technique success rate was 100%. One patient died of intrathoracic bleeding. In the PTA group, two patients had shifting of thrombus in the inferior vena cava that blocked the blood flow restored by the pre-opening, one resulted in treatment failure, while the other had blood flow restored by dilation with a 12 mm balloon; the success rate was 55/56 (98.21%). The median follow-up time was 32 months (range: 3-60 months). Two patients in the open group developed restenosis 2 years after operation (recurrence rate: 6.25%), and were successfully treated by balloon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Seven patients in the PTA group had severe restenosis 18-42 months after operation (recurrence rate: 12.96%). No thrombosis was found in these seven patients, normal blood flow was restored in the inferior vena cava after balloon percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Pre-opening and staged percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the inferior vena cava is a safe and simple method for the treatment of BCS accompanied with inferior vena cava thrombosis, with satisfactory treatment effectiveness that could be applied in clinical practice.</AbstractText>
