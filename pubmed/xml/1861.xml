                <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) in the obstetric anesthesia practice is one of the most annoying, common, and important problems.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Aim" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">This comparative study was designed to assess the efficacy of naratriptan in relieving PDPH in parturients who gave birth by cesarean section under intrathecal anesthesia and to compare its efficacy with sumatriptan.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Settings and Design" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">One hundred and eighty-nine adult parturients who complained of PDPH in the first 3 days postpartum period were enrolled in this study. They were divided into three equal parallel groups of 63 each.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Materials and Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Group-1 controlled (C-group) received multivitamin tablets, Group-2 sumatriptan (S-group) received sumatriptan tablets and Group-3 naratriptan (N-group) received naratriptan tablets. The efficacy of naratriptan in relieving PDPH was studied and compared with that of sumatriptan. Incidences of complications of both drugs were also noted.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Statistical Analysis" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The collected data were organized, tabulated, and statistically analyzed using SPSS software statistical computer package version 18 (SPSS Inc., USA).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">After the first 6 h, there were statistically significant differences between Groups S and N from one side and control group from the other side (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001 and 0.001), respectively, and the difference between Group S and Group N was statistically significant (<i>P</i> = 0.004). After 12 h, there were statistically significant differences between Groups S and N from one side and the control group from the other side (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) and the difference between Group S and Group N was statistically significant (<i>P</i> = 0.002). After 72 h, there were statistically significant differences between Groups S and N from one side and control group from the other side (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 and 0.009), respectively. The difference was nonsignificant between S and N group (<i>P</i> = 0.717).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The study revealed that anti-migraine drug naratriptan in combination with supportive treatment was effective in relieving PDPH in parturients.</AbstractText>
