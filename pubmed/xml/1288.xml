            <Abstract>
                <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Warts are benign conditions of the skin and mucosa caused by human papilloma viruses (HPV) that affect many people worlwide OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate OS by TOS/TAS, levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) an indicator of DNA damage, and also protein oxidation levels by determining the dynamic serum thiol/disulfide homeostasis in patients with warts. We also aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between thiol/disulfide homeostasis, recalcitrance of warts and DNA damage.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Forty patients of age ≥ 18 years, having recalcitrant genital and/or non-genital warts that persisted for more than two years, 40 patients with warts that persisted for less than 2 years and 40 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Blood TAS, TOS, OSI, 8-OHdG and dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis were evaluated.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Significant differences were detected between the groups in the levels of 8-OHdG, TOS, OSI, total thiol, native thiol, reduced thiol, as well as native thiol/total thiol ratio, disulfide/total thiol ratio and disulfide/native thiol ratio. Compared to the controls, patients with recalcitrant warts had significantly higher levels of 8-OHdG, TOS, and OSI levels. Total thiol and native thiol levels were significantly lower in patients with recalcitrant warts compared to patients with warts that persisted for less than 2 years. Disulfide levels were significantly higher in the latter group of patients compared to patients with recalcitrant warts and controls. Native thiol/total thiol ratio was significantly higher in both patient groups compared to controls whereas disulfide/total thiol and disulfide/native thiol ratios were significantly lower in both patient groups than in controls.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Our findings suggest that impairment of thiol disulfide homeostasis in patients with recalcitrant warts may lead to increased OS and DNA damage. Thus, antioxidant administration with thiol containing proteins may help in the regression of warts and thereby prevent carcinogenesis. This article is protected by copyright.
