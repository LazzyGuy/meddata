            <Abstract>
                <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and nonspecific autoimmune disease, which leads to joint destruction and deformity. To investigate the potential of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a new therapeutic strategy for patients with RA, we compared the therapeutic effects of bone marrow derived MSCs (BMSCs), umbilical cord derived MSCs (UCs), and stem cells derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">A total of 24 DBA/1 mice were infused with type II collagen to induce RA in the experimental model. MSC-treated mice were infused with UCs, BMSCs, and SHED, respectively. Bone erosion and joint destruction were measured by micro-computed tomographic (micro-CT) analysis and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were measured by immunohistochemistry and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Systemic delivery of MSCs significantly improved the severity of the symptoms related to CIA to greater extent compared with the untreated control group. Micro-CT revealed reduced bone erosions in the metatarsophalangeal joints upon treatment with MSCs. Additionally, according to histologic evaluation, reduced synovitis and articular destruction were observed in MSC-treated groups. The levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in the serum and joints decreased with treatment by MSCs.</AbstractText>
                <AbstractText Label="Conclusion" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Our findings suggest that systemic infusion of UCs, BMSCs, and SHED may significantly alleviate the effects of RA. The therapeutic effect of BMSCs was greater than that of SHED, while the UCs were shown to have the best therapeutic effect on CIA mice. In conclusion, compared with BMSCs and SHED, UCs may be a more suitable source of MSCs for the treatment of patients with RA.</AbstractText>
