Mutations in the members of ABC transporters have been associated with psychiatric illnesses.OBJECTIVE:In this study, we investigated whether 9 SNPs in ABCB1 (rs6946119, rs28401781, rs4148739, and rs3747802), ABCB6 (rs1109866, rs1109867, rs3731885, and rs3755047), and ABCG1 (rs182694) contribute to the risk of SCZ in a Han Chinese population.METHODS:We conducted a case-control study in a Han Chinese population, involving 1,034 SCZ patients and 1,034 unrelated healthy controls to genotype 9 SNPs.RESULTS:The analysis demonstrated that rs182694 of ABCG1 was significantly different between SCZ patients and controls as to allele (rs182694: p = 0.0070, χ2 = 7.27) and genotype frequencies (rs182694: p = 0.0013, χ2 = 13.35).CONCLUSIONS:Our findings support an association between ABCG1 polymorphism and SCZ in a Han Chinese population.","Gaini Ma:Bio-X Institutes, Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders (Ministry of Education), Shanghai Jiao

Recent developments in the field of nanofluidic technology open new horizons for point-of-care management of this unmet medical need.OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to compare IgE diagnostic agreement between a nanofluidic assay (abioSCOPE®) and a laboratory reference method (Phadia Laboratory System®) in a real-world clinical setting.METHODS:Sera from 105 patients whose routine allergy diagnostic workup required a blood sampling were used to compare the novel nanofluidic IgE assay to a reference method in a blind manner for a panel of five respiratory allergens. To assess the agreement between methods, patient records were reviewed by four independent experts to establish the final diagnosis. Experts were blinded to the IgE serological method used, but had access to patient history, skin prick tests, and blood test results.RESULTS:Analytic agreement between the two methods was 81% for the tested panel of allergens (ranging from 77 to 89%).

Experts were blinded to the IgE serological method used, but had access to patient history, skin prick tests, and blood test results.RESULTS:Analytic agreement between the two methods was 81% for the tested panel of allergens (ranging from 77 to 89%).

However, these possible associations have not been studied in individuals with attempted suicide.OBJECTIVE:To examine the relationship between leptin, HPA axis activity, and anxiety in individuals with a recent suicide attempt.METHODS:Sixty-nine individuals with a recent suicide attempt (n = 37 females; n = 32 males) were recruited and subjected to the Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST), lumbar puncture, and evaluation with the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale from which the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA) was derived.

Patients treated with digitalis were compared to patients without digitalis treatment. The primary prognostic outcome was first recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were applied.RESULTS:A total of 394 ICD recipients with AF and/or HF was included (26% with digitalis treatment and 74% without). Digitalis treatment was associated with decreased freedom from recurrent ventricular tachy-arrhythmias (HR = 1.423; 95% CI 1.047-1.934; p = 0.023). Accordingly, digitalis treatment was associated with decreased freedom from appropriate ICD therapies (HR = 1.622; 95% CI 1.166-2.256; p = 0.004) and, moreover, higher rates of rehospitalization (38 vs. 21%; p = 0.001) and all-cause mortality (33 vs. 20%; p = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS:Among ICD recipients suffering from AF and HF, treatment with digitalis was associated with increased rates of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and ICD therapies. However, the endpoints may also have been driven by interactions between digitalis, AF, and HF.","Tobias Schupp:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Michael Behnes:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany, michael.behnes@umm.de.Christel Weiss:Institute of Biomathematics and Medical Statistics, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.Christoph Nienaber:Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, NHS, London, United Kingdom.Linda Reiser:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Armin Bollow:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Gabriel Taton:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Thomas Reichelt:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Dominik Ellguth:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Niko Engelke:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Jonas Rusnak:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Kathrin Weidner:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Muharrem Akin:Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.Kambis Mashayekhi:Department of Cardiology and Angiology II, University Heart Center Freiburg, Bad Krozingen, Germany.Martin Borggrefe:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.Ibrahim Akin:First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Mannheim (UMM), Faculty of Medicine Mannheim, Heidelberg University, European Center for AngioScience (ECAS), and DZHK (German Center for Cardiovascular Research) partner site Heidelberg/Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany."

However, the roles of magnesium in anemia and erythropoietin (EPO) responsiveness remain unclear in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study aims to investigate the level of serum magnesium and its relationship with EPO responsiveness in MHD patients.METHODS:A total of 307 MHD patients were recruited for this survey. Laboratory data and anthropometrics were collected. EPO responsiveness was evaluated by the erythropoietin resistance index (ERI). The subjects were divided into 3 groups according to serum magnesium concentrations (group A, the lowest tertile; group B, the middle tertiles; and group C, the highest tertile). Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate the factors that may be associated with EPO responsiveness.RESULTS:The mean serum magnesium level was significantly higher than normal levels in MHD patients, while no hypomagnesemia was observed. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, serum albumin, and magnesium levels were correlated with a high ERI. The OR of a high ERI was found to be 2.57 (95% CI 1.330-4.975, p = 0.005) for group A and 1.66 (95% CI 0.878--3.140, p > 0.05) for group B compared with the OR for group C.CONCLUSIONS:Serum magnesium levels were higher than normal levels in MHD patients. A high serum magnesium level was correlated with good EPO responsiveness and was therefore suggested to be a protective factor for EPO hyporesponsiveness.","Ling Yu:Department of Blood Purification, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Jinghong Song:Department of Blood Purification, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Xiangxue Lu:Department of Blood Purification, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Yuan Zu:Department of Blood Purification, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.Han Li:Department of Blood Purification, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China, hanli@ccmu.edu.cn.Shixiang Wang:Department of Blood Purification, Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."

31189165,2019-06-12,Switzerland Cardiology 1266406 0008-6312,Long-Term Effect of Different Optimizing Methods for Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure: A Randomized and Controlled Pilot Study.,"OBJECTIVE:During cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), optimized programming of the atrioventricular (AV) delay and ventricular-to-ventricular (VV) interval can lead to improved hemodynamics, symptomatic response, and left ventricular systolic function. Currently, however, there is no recommendation for the best optimization method. This study aimed to compare the long-term clinical outcomes of 4 different CRT optimization methods.METHODS:One hundred and twenty-four consecutive CRT patients with severe heart failure and left bundle-branch block configuration were randomly assigned into four groups to undergo AV/VV delay optimization through echocardiogram (ECHO; n = 30), electrocardiogram (ECG; n = 32), QuickOpt algorithm (n = 28), and nominal AV/VV (n = 36) groups. Patients were followed up and underwent examinations, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac functional classification, 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and echocardiography, at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. The patients' survival and clinical outcomes were compared among the four groups.RESULTS:Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that the median survival was the same in the 4 groups: ECHO, 43 months; ECG, 44 months; QuickOpt, 44 months, and nominal, 41 months. At the 6-month follow-up, the reduction in left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was significantly less in the nominal group (-1.91 ± 2.58 mm) than that in the other three groups (ECHO: -3.70 ± 2.78 mm, p = 0.012; ECG: -3.53 ± 3.14 mm, p = 0.020; QuickOpt: -3.46 ± 2.65 mm, p = 0.032); 6MWD was significantly shorter in the nominal group (87.88 ± 34.76 m) than that in the other three groups (ECHO: 120.63 ± 56.93 m, p = 0.006; ECG: 114.97 ± 54.95 m, p = 0.020; QuickOpt: 114.57 ± 35.41 m, p = 0.027). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly increased in ECHO (7.23 ± 2.76%, p = 0.010), ECG (8.50 ± 3.17%, p < 0.001), and QuickOpt (8.39 ± 2.90%, p < 0.001) compared with the nominal group (5.35 ± 2.59%). There were no significant differences among the groups in the aforementioned parameters at 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS:While LVEDD, LVEF, 6MWD, and NYHA were significantly improved in ECHO, ECG, and QuickOpt at 6 months, there were no significant improvements in any of the groups at 12, 24, and 48 months. These findings suggested that the long-term effect of the four CRT methods for heart failure was not significantly different.","Yu Zhang:Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, lqlk57@163.com.Qiang Xing:Department of Cardiology, Xinjiang Medical University Affiliated First Hospital, Urumqi, China.Jiang-Hua Zhang:Department of Cardiology, Xinjiang Medical University Affiliated First Hospital, Urumqi, China.Wei-Feng Jiang:Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Mu Qin:Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Xu Liu:Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."

This paper aims to establish the construct validity of the VSS by testing the extent to which percentage intelligibility in single word speech and connected speech predicts VSS rating.METHODS:This is a secondary analysis of two sets of anonymised data collected for previous research. The full data set comprised 79 children with cerebral palsy from the US (n = 43) and the UK (n = 36): (43 boys, 36 girls); mean age 7.2 years (SD 3.3). Single word intelligibility was measured using the TOCS+ words for US children and Children's Speech Intelligibility Measure for the UK children. Connected speech intelligibility was measured from a subset of repeated sentences in TOCS+ for US children and picture description for the UK children. We used ordinal logistic regression to examine prediction of VSS rating by percentage single word and connected speech intelligibility scores in both samples.RESULTS:Percentage single word intelligibility and connected speech intelligibility predicted VSS rating in univariate and multivariate regression models for both the US and UK samples.CONCLUSIONS:Intelligibility predicts VSS for both single words and connected speech, establishing the construct validity of VSS.","Lindsay Pennington:Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, lindsay.pennington@ncl.ac.uk.Katherine C Hustad:Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.:Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA.:"

Diagnostic accuracy of FB (prothrombin time-derived method), WBC, ANC, and CRP were assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve.RESULTS:A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the study (27 NSAP, 17 uncomplicated, and 38 complicated appendicitides). WBC and ANC had moderate diagnostic accuracy for appendicitis versus NSAP (WBC: AUC 0.66, ANC: AUC 0.67). CRP and FB had good diagnostic accuracy for appendicitis versus NSAP (CRP: AUC 0.78, FB: AUC 0.77). WBC and ANC are not useful to discriminate complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis (WBC: AUC 0.43, ANC: AUC 0.45). CPR and FB had good diagnostic accuracy for complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis (CRP: AUC 0.80, FB: AUC 0.73).CONCLUSIONS:CRP and FB are more useful than WBC and ANC to discriminate appendicitis from NSAP in preschool children. CRP and FB are especially useful to discriminate complicated from uncomplicated appendicitis and NSAP. In a child with suspected appendicitis, a plasma FB level (prothrombin time-derived method) >540 mg/dL is associated with an increased likelihood of complicated appendicitis.","Marcos Prada-Arias:Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Vigo, Spain.:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute, Vigo, Spain.:Javier Gómez-Veiras:Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Vigo, Spain.Ángel Salgado-Barreira:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute, Vigo, Spain.:Methodology and Statistics Unit, Galicia Sur Health Research Institute, Vigo, Spain.:José Luis Vázquez:Department of Radiology, University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Vigo, Spain.Margarita Montero-Sánchez:Department of Pediatric Surgery, University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Vigo, Spain.:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute, Vigo, Spain.:José Ramón Fernández-Lorenzo:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute, Vigo, Spain.:Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, Vigo, Spain.:"

Free-text descriptions of incident reports may provide useful data to identify the connection between health information technology (HIT) usability flaws and patient safety.OBJECTIVE:This article examines the feasibility of using incident reports about HIT to learn about the usability flaws that affect patient safety. We posed three questions: (1) To what extent can we gain knowledge about usability issues from incident reports? (2) What types of usability flaws, related usage problems, and negative outcomes are reported in incidents reports? (3) What are the reported usability issues that give rise to patient safety issues?METHODS:A sample of 359 reports from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was examined. Descriptions of usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes were extracted and categorized. A supplementary analysis was performed on the incidents which contained the full chain going from a usability flaw up to a patient safety issue to identify the usability issues that gave rise to patient safety incidents.RESULTS:A total of 249 reports were included. We found that incident reports can provide knowledge about usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes. Thirty-six incidents report how usability flaws affected patient safety (ranging from incidents without consequence, to death) involving electronic patient scales, imaging systems, and HIT for medication management. The most significant class of involved usability flaws is related to the reliability, the understandability, and the availability of the clinical information.CONCLUSIONS:Incidents reports involving HIT are an exploitable source of information to learn about usability flaws and their effects on patient safety. Results can be used to convince all stakeholders involved in the HIT system lifecycle that usability should be considered seriously to prevent patient safety incidents.","Romaric Marcilly:Univ.

Free-text descriptions of incident reports may provide useful data to identify the connection between health information technology (HIT) usability flaws and patient safety.OBJECTIVE:This article examines the feasibility of using incident reports about HIT to learn about the usability flaws that affect patient safety. We posed three questions: (1) To what extent can we gain knowledge about usability issues from incident reports? (2) What types of usability flaws, related usage problems, and negative outcomes are reported in incidents reports? (3) What are the reported usability issues that give rise to patient safety issues?METHODS:A sample of 359 reports from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was examined. Descriptions of usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes were extracted and categorized. A supplementary analysis was performed on the incidents which contained the full chain going from a usability flaw up to a patient safety issue to identify the usability issues that gave rise to patient safety incidents.RESULTS:A total of 249 reports were included. We found that incident reports can provide knowledge about usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes. Thirty-six incidents report how usability flaws affected patient safety (ranging from incidents without consequence, to death) involving electronic patient scales, imaging systems, and HIT for medication management. The most significant class of involved usability flaws is related to the reliability, the understandability, and the availability of the clinical information.CONCLUSIONS:Incidents reports involving HIT are an exploitable source of information to learn about usability flaws and their effects on patient safety. Results can be used to convince all stakeholders involved in the HIT system lifecycle that usability should be considered seriously to prevent patient safety incidents.CONCLUSIONS:Incidents reports involving HIT are an exploitable source of information to learn about usability flaws and their effects on patient safety.

The lateral neck recurrence-free survival (LRFS) advantages achieved by pCCND are still under investigation.METHODS:The records of 2,074 consecutive patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) at the time of surgery from 1996 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 611 consecutive patients were included in the final analyses. We used R version 3.5.1 to match patients with total thyroidectomy (TT)/lobectomy + pCCND with patients with TT/lobectomy alone and analyzed the following factors with a potential influence: age at diagnosis, sex, extrathyroid extension, and primary tumor multifocality and bilaterality. LRFS was analyzed.

The aim of the current study was to investigate this method in a subset of ADRs with a longer TTO and to compare its performance with disproportionality analysis.METHODS:Using The Netherlands's spontaneous reporting database, TTO distributions for drug-ADR associations with a median TTO of 7 days or more were compared with other drugs with the same ADR using the two-sample Anderson-Darling (AD) test. Presence in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) was used as the gold standard for identification of a true ADR. Twelve combinations with different values for the number of reports and median TTO were tested. Performance in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) was compared with disproportionality analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the results with those from the previous study.RESULTS:A total of 38 017 case reports, containing 32 478 unique drug-ADR associations. Sensitivity was lower for the TTO method (range 0.08-0.34) compared with disproportionality analysis (range 0.60-0.87), whereas PPV was similar for both methods (range 0.93-1.0). The results from the sensitivity analysis were similar to the original analysis.CONCLUSIONS:Because of its low sensitivity, the developed TTO method cannot replace disproportionality analysis as a signal detection tool. It may be useful in combination with other methods.","Joep H G Scholl:Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands.:Department of PharmacoTherapy - Epidemiology & -Economics, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.:Florence P A M van Hunsel:Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands.Eelko Hak:Department of PharmacoTherapy - Epidemiology & -Economics, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.Eugène P van Puijenbroek:Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb, 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands.:Department of PharmacoTherapy - Epidemiology & -Economics, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.:"

In recent years, basic research in SI-NETs has attempted to unravel the molecular events underlying SI- NET tumorigenesis.OBJECTIVE:We aim to provide an overview of the current literature regarding prognostic and predictive molecular factors in patients with SI-NETs.METHODS:A PubMed search was conducted on (epi)genetic prognostic factors in SI-NETs from 2000 until 2019.RESULTS:The search yielded 1522 articles of which 18 reviews and 35 original studies were selected for further evaluation. SI-NETs are mutationally quiet tumours with a different genetic make-up compared to pancreatic NETs. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18 is the most frequent genomic aberration (44-100%) followed by mutations of CDKN1B in 8%. Prognostic analyses were performed in 16 studies, of which 8 found a significant (epi)genetic association for survival or progression. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18, gains of chromosome 4,5, 7, 14 and 20p, copy gain of the SRC gene and low expression of RASSF1A and P16 were associated with poorer survival. In comparison with genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations are significantly more common in SI-NETs and may represent more promising targets in the treatment of SI-NETs.CONCLUSIONS:SI-NETs are mutationally silent tumours. No biomarkers have been identified yet that can easily be adopted into current clinical decision making. SI-NETs may represent a heterogeneous disease and larger international studies are warranted to translate molecular findings into precision oncology.","Kris Giulia Samsom:K Samsom, Pathology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.Linde M van Veenendaal:L van Veenendaal , Medical Oncology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.Gerlof D Valk:G Valk, Endocrinology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.Menno R Vriens:M Vriens, Department of Surgery, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands.Margot Tesselaar:M Tesselaar, Medical Oncology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.Jose G van den Berg:J van den Berg, Pathology, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands."

Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18 is the most frequent genomic aberration (44-100%) followed by mutations of CDKN1B in 8%. Prognostic analyses were performed in 16 studies, of which 8 found a significant (epi)genetic association for survival or progression. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18, gains of chromosome 4,5, 7, 14 and 20p, copy gain of the SRC gene and low expression of RASSF1A and P16 were associated with poorer survival. In comparison with genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations are significantly more common in SI-NETs and may represent more promising targets in the treatment of SI-NETs.CONCLUSIONS:SI-NETs are mutationally silent tumours.

Prognostic analyses were performed in 16 studies, of which 8 found a significant (epi)genetic association for survival or progression. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18, gains of chromosome 4,5, 7, 14 and 20p, copy gain of the SRC gene and low expression of RASSF1A and P16 were associated with poorer survival. In comparison with genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations are significantly more common in SI-NETs and may represent more promising targets in the treatment of SI-NETs.CONCLUSIONS:SI-NETs are mutationally silent tumours.

Escherichia coli phage (T4) can potentially interfere with adsorption of HAdV-5 to cellular integrins by its KGD motif, while staphylococcal A5/80 phage does not possess this structure. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of T4 and A5/80 phage preparations on type 5 human adenovirus (HAdV-5) DNA synthesis and the expression of HAdV-5 genes.METHODS:Experiments were performed on the A549 cell line. HAdV-5 DNA synthesis was investigated with real-time PCR. Expression of HAdV-5 early (DBP) and late (hexon) genes was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in preincubation and coincubation experiments.RESULTS:While both phage preparations significantly reduced the expression of HAdV-5 genes, synthesis of HAdV-5 DNA was inhibited only by T4.CONCLUSIONS:Phage preparations show promise as novel antiviral agents. However, further studies are required to investigate their antiviral effects.","Maciej Przybylski:Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.Tomasz Dzieciątkowski:Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.Jan Borysowski:Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland, jborysowski@interia.pl.Ryszard Międzybrodzki:Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.:Bacteriophage Laboratory, Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Wrocław, Poland.:Andrzej Górski:Department of Clinical Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.:Bacteriophage Laboratory, Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Wrocław, Poland.:"

Recently, serum cystatin C (sCyC) has been proposed to be a better biomarker in the prediction of AKI. The clinical utility and performance of combining sCyC and sCr in patients with AKI, particularly for the prediction of long-term outcomes, remain unknown.METHODS:We measured sCyC together with sCr in 628 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. sCyC and sCr were assessed at baseline and 24 and 48 h after surgery. CSA-AKI determined by sCr (CSA-AKIsCr) was defined as an sCr increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL or 50% from baseline. Major adverse events (MAEs; including death of any cause and dialysis) at 3 years were assessed.RESULTS:CSA-AKIsCr developed in 178 patients (28.3%). Three-year follow-up was available for 621 patients; MAEs occurred in 42 patients (6.8%). An increase in sCyC concentration ≥30% within 48 h after surgery was detected in 228 patients (36.3%). This was the best sCyC cutoff for CSA-AKIsCr detection (negative predictive value = 88.8%, positive predictive value = 58.3%). To evaluate the use of both sCyC and sCr as CSA-AKI diagnostic criteria, we stratified patients into 3 groups: non-CSA-AKI, CSA-AKI detected by a single marker, and CSA-AKI detected by both markers. By multivariable logistic regression analysis, the independent predictors of MAEs at 3 years were group 2 (non-CSA-AKI group as the reference, CSA-AKI detected by a single marker: odds ratio [OR] = 3.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-9.58, p = 0.016), group 3 (CSA-AKI detected by both markers: OR = 5.12, 95% CI: 2.01-13.09; p = 0.001), and baseline glomerular filtration rate (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.27-3.95; p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS:Combining sCyC and sCr to diagnose CSA-AKI would be beneficial for risk stratification and prognosis in patients after cardiac surgery.","Miaolin Che:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Xudong Wang:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Bo Xie:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Ritai Huang:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Shang Liu:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Yucheng Yan:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Mingli Zhu:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Renhua Lu:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Jiaqi Qian:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Weiming Zhang:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Leyi Gu:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Shan Mou:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.Zhaohui Ni:Department of Nephrology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, drnizhaohui@126.com.Song Xue:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."
