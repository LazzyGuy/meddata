Although new memory formation is typically studied in a laboratory setting, most real-world associations are modifications to existing memories, particularly in the aging, experienced brain. To date, the field has lacked a simple behavioral paradigm that can measure whether original and updated information is remembered in a single test session. To address this gap, we have developed a novel memory updating paradigm, called the Objects in Updated Locations (OUL) task that is capable of assessing memory updating in a non-stressful task that is appropriate for both young and old rodents. We first show that young mice successfully remember both the original memory and the updated information in OUL. Next, we demonstrate that intrahippocampal infusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin disrupts both the updated information and the original memory at test, suggesting that memory updating in OUL engages the original memory. To verify this, we used the Arc CatFISH technique to show that the OUL update session reactivates a largely overlapping set of neurons as the original memory. Finally, using OUL, we show that memory updating is impaired in aging, 18-m.o. mice. Together, these results demonstrate that hippocampal memory updating is impaired with aging and establish that the OUL paradigm is an effective, sensitive method of assessing memory updating in rodents.","Hepatoprotective, Antihyperlipidemic and Radical Scavenging Activity of Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) and Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) on Alcoholic Liver Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202212,Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2019 06 15,"Alcohol catabolism produces oxidative stress, causing cell death and inflammation in liver tissue principally. Hawthorn (Crataegus oxyacantha) and Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) are medicinal plants that have shown a potent antioxidant activity related with anti-inflammatory properties. The objective of this study was the evaluation of Hawthorn and Rosemary methanol extracts as preventive treatment in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). ALD rat model was used to measure serum hepatic enzyme levels (AST, ALT, γ-GT and ACP), total bilirubin, liver glycogen, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and serum lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL) as well as histopathological analysis in hepatic tissues was recorder. Phytotreatments showed preventive effect, decreasing AST, γ-GT, lipid peroxidation and bilirubin indictors while TAC and liver glycogen stores increase. Interestingly, Rosemary diminished the levels of ALT and ACP. Remarkable both treatments show liver tissue damage reduction. Hawthorn proved antihyperlipidemic effect, eviting increase in all lipid indicators, while Rosemary showed antihyperlipidemic effect only in LDL levels without affecting HDL levels. The results indicate that Hawthorn and Rosemary treatments have different mechanisms of action; however they show hepatoprotective effect against ALD in rat model. Hawthorn and Rosemary could be used to prevent or help in the treatment of ALD.","Multicenter, Prospective, Controlled Double-Blind Study Comparing Fib-19-01, A Phytotherapy Treatment, To A Dietary Supplement And To Conventional Care In Patients Suffering From Fibromyalgia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202211,Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2019 06 15,Current therapeutic modalities for fibromyalgia (FM) do not provide satisfactory results and new approaches have to be explored.,Manual Therapy With Cryotherapy Versus Kinesiotherapy With Cryotherapy for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202210,Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2019 06 15,"Manual therapy and kinesiotherapy are used for knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was exposed to 200 mM NaCl for 30 d in hydroponics, with or without 2 mM Si. X-ray microanalysis coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to quantify the cell-specific ion profiles across root and leaf cells, paralleled by measurements of wheat growth and physiological responses. Under salt stress, higher Na+ and Cl- concentrations were detected in root epidermal, cortical and stelar cells, eventually increasing their concentrations in different leaf cells, being highest in the epidermal cells and lowest in the vascular bundle cells. The potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg2+) profiles were generally opposite to those of Na+ and Cl-. NaCl-dependent deregulation of essential nutrient homeostasis and excessive toxic ions accumulation in leaves was correlated with enhanced electrolyte leakage index (ELI), decreased chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis and other physiological parameters, and ultimately hampered plant growth. Conversely, Si addition improved the growth and physiological performance of salinized wheat by reducing Na+ and Cl- concentration in root epidermal and cortical cells, and it improved root uptake and storage of K+ and Mg2+ ions and their loading into xylem for distribution to shoots. These results suggest that Si-mediated inhibition of Na+ uptake, maintained nutrient homeostasis and improved physiological parameters to contribute to wheat growth improvement under salt stress.","Transcriptome analysis reveals novel insights into the continuous cropping induced response in Codonopsis tangshen, a medicinal herb.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202192,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 06 15,"Codonopsis tangshen Oliv.

Transcriptome profiling found 762 differentially expressed genes, including 430 up-regulated and 332 down-regulated genes by C-cro. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to 'Tyrosine degradation I', 'Glycogen synthesis' and 'Phenylalanine and tyrosine catabolism' were up-regulated, and genes associated with 'Signal transduction', 'Immune system', etc. were down-regulated by C-cro. The expression of target genes was further validated by Q-PCR.

To perform affinity chromatography for evaluating DNA amplicons, avidin-conjugated MPs and succinimide-linked sepharose were used with biotin-primers. To mimic the centrifugal-based affinity ligand chromatography, a smartphone-mountable low-power fan was plugged into the charging port of a smartphone. The charging port stably emitted electric current at 3.0 V, and the fan blades were modified for use as a portable rotor. Based on the binding variation of MPs with DNA amplicons, the position of MPs in sepharose changed significantly during centrifugation. The change in distance was optically analyzed using the illumination sensor of the smartphone with respect to the altered transmittance due to the MPs. Amplified genes from Escherichia. coli O157:H7 samples ranging from 1.0 × 101 to 1.0 × 106 colony-forming units could be rapidly and immediately detected by the naked eye using a simple smartphone-based optical device.

The application of cylindrical single-chamber microbial fuel cell gives full play to the role of anode carbon brush and increases contact with surrounding oxygen by enlarging the surface area of the cathode. Both cylindrical design and P. aeruginosa inoculation in anode have positive effects on power output of microbial fuel cells. Changing the configuration from cubic to cylindrical resulted in a substantial reduction in internal resistance from 127.21 Ω to 49.66 Ω. Meanwhile, the cylindrical microbial fuel cell inoculated with mixed anaerobic bacteria exhibits power overshoot, and the dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte is raised. Thus, we also select P. aeruginosa inoculation in cylindrical reactor, where the maximum power density is increased to 3322 ± 38 mW m-2 and internal resistance is reduced to 34.0 ± 1.1 Ω, and then power overshoot is improved. Thus, P. aeruginosa showed better electrogenic performance than anaerobic mixtures.

They have 3-dimensional protrusions that have large surface areas to accommodate a large number of membrane proteins such as ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors, resulting in high sensitivity and specificity to target molecules. From the perspective of mimicking this system, BLM, which has been used extensively as a platform for a single nanopore-based sensing systems, has some limitations, i.e., some residual solvent, low mechanical stability, small surface area for appropriate stability, and difficulty in high-throughput fabrication. Herein, to eliminate these limitations, a solvent-free, size-controllable, 3-dimensional free-standing lipid bilayer (3DFLB) structure array with high stability (∼130 h) and high density (∼300,000 cm-2) is proposed, and its structural advantages for efficient and rapid protein reconstitution, compared to BLM, is demonstrated by human 5-HT3A receptor assay as well as α-hemolysin assay.

A distortion in energy spectrum and degradation in timing resolution take place when pulse pile-up occurs. This in turn leads to degradations of the signals used in applications such as nuclear medicine. Pile-up pulses are commonly removed in most algorithms if they are detected, but in this case, getting a clean spectrum becomes a challenge due to data loss. A proposed pile-up detection and recovery algorithm based on fitting the preamplifier data and signal extrapolation is presented. The extrapolated pulse is used for recovering (extracting) the piled-up pulse to estimate its parameters. A smoothed first derivative algorithm is used for peak tracking inside the detected events. To evaluate the proposed pile-up recovery algorithm theoretically and experimentally, it is applied on both simulated input signals generated with different time displacements between the piled-up events, and experimental preamplifier radiation signals. The obtained results prove that the proposed algorithm achieves better utilization of power and can be used for high count rate (high activity elements) spectroscopy systems.",Application of 252Cf neutron source for precise nuclear data experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202184,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 06 15,"Purpose of this paper is to provide extensive information helpful for anyone performing any experiment involving 252Cf neutron source and aiming for high precision experiments.

Furthermore, we prove that our source is volumetric, i.e. non-point and can be considered as an isotropic in our experimental settings. Influence of the palladium matrix density on the reaction rates is also investigated. Concerning nuclear data, we are measuring fast neutron leakage spectra in various benchmark sets including spheres of different materials. Our work extends benchmark sets to possible use of cubes, in our case graphite cube of side 30 cm. The neutron spectra are measured by stilbene scintilation detector in the energy range of 1-10 MeV in the steps of 100 keV in the distance of 100 cm from the centre of the cube. There is no significant difference between measurements performed using cube or sphere except lower cost for the cube production. The agreement between calculation using ENDF/B-VII.1 library and experimental data is not satisfactory especially in the regions around 3.5 MeV and 8 MeV. The agreement within 4% of calculation to experiment ratio for neutron leakage fluxes of pure 252Cf source validates our MCNP model for studying reaction rates and leakage fluxes in the region above 1 MeV."

FLuo-3 AM labeling showed that the Ca2+ concentration in cells increased under hypoxia condition. shRNA-ASIC3 and ASIC3 expression vector were transfected into cells. Subsequently, cells were divided into six groups: Control, 2% O2, shRNA-NC+2% O2, shRNA-ASIC3 + 2% O2, Vector+2% O2 and ASIC3 + 2% O2. Flow cytometry, CCK-8 assay, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescent labeling, RT-PCR and western blot demonstrated that hypoxia and ASIC3 over-expression inhibited the proliferation, arrested cell cycle in G1 phase, promoted the apoptosis, initiated the autophagy and up-regulated the expression of ASIC3, HIF-1α, light chain 3, p-ERK1/2 and p-MAPK. However, ASIC3 silencing could significantly relieve these phenomena. Co-immunoprecipitation assay found ASIC3 was interacted with HIF-1α&ERK1/2. Evaluation of the effect of HIF-1αsilencing on ASIC3 expression showed that the high expression of ASIC3 induced by hypoxia was reduced significantly by HIF-1α silencing. In conclusion, hypoxia and ASIC3 changed the behavior of nucleus pulposus cells by activating the MAPK pathway.

The Ik6+ Ph+ -ALL cell lines Sup-B15 or BV173 were treated with Huaier extract, imatinib or the combination of the two. Analysis of cell proliferation showed that the combined treatment of imatinib and Huaier extract exhibited a greater effect on cell inhibition. Using flow cytometry and Western blot, enhanced effects on the induction of cell apoptosis were observed. The combination of the two drugs also exhibited a significant effect in decreasing the protein and enzymatic activity levels of BCR-ABL. The molecular mechanisms may be involved in BCR-ABL related pathways, including the inactivation of p-AKT, p-STAT5, p-mTOR and p-Lyn. Consistent with the in vitro results, the combination of Huaier extract and imatinib inhibit the growth and infiltration of xenografted tumors.

The frequency of HLA-C*03:02 was 6.7% (5/75) in the MMI-DILI case patients and 6.4% (4/62) in MMI-induced cholestatic/mixed liver damage, which were significantly different from the percentage of 0.4% (1/231) in the MMI-tolerant patients (odds ratio (OR) = 15.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.77-133.9, adjusted P = 0.0292; OR=14.9, 95% CI=2.38-182.9, adjusted P = 0.0323; respectively). HLA-A*02:01 was also found to be associated with MMI-induced cholestatic/mixed liver injury (OR = 3.13, 95%CI=1.45-6.91, adjusted P = 0.0464). The present study demonstrated that individuals carrying HLA-C*03:02 allele are at increased risk of developing MMI-induced DILI. These results may assist doctors to prevent the occurrence of hepatotoxicity in GD patients receiving MMI.",Long non-coding RNA CRNDE enhances cervical cancer progression by suppressing PUMA expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202167,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 15,"Cervical cancer is the second most common gynecological malignancy, and it remains a leading cause of tumor-related death among female in the world. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been indicated to play essential roles in tumorigenesis, and the lncRNA colorectal neoplasia differentially expressed (CRNDE) is increased in several tumors. Nevertheless, little is known about the effects of lncRNA CRNDE on human cervical cancer. The aim of the study was to explore the clinical significance of lncRNA CRNDE expression in human cervical cancer. Our results indicated that CRNDE expression was increased in cervical cancer tissues and several cervical cancer cell lines. Through loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we found that CRNDE knockdown markedly reduced cervical cancer cell proliferation, while CRNDE overexpression significantly promoted cervical cancer cell growth. Consistently, CRNDE decreasing obviously inhibited tumorigenicity of cervical cancer cells in vivo, whereas CRNDE increasing markedly promoted cervical cancer progression. Mechanistically, we verified that CRNDE bond to p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), and PUMA was required for CRNDE to enhance cervical cancer cell growth. Our study demonstrated that CRNDE, combined with PUMA, could be utilized as factor for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer, and might be potential target for developing effective therapeutic strategy to prevent cervical cancer progression.",Tamoxifen affects the histology and hepatopancreatic lipid metabolism of swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202166,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 15,"Tamoxifen (TAM) is an antiestrogenic agent and can enter the aquatic environment in wastewater. It has been reported that TAM can induce hepatic steatosis in vertebrates, however, the effects of TAM exposure on lipid metabolism of hepatopancreas in crustaceans remains unclear. In this study, four TAM concentrations (0, 6.7, 13.4 and 20 μg g-1 crab body weight) were injected into the swimming-leg of swimming crabs Portunus trituberculatus, as a means of evaluating the effects of TAM on the expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes, lipid composition, and hepatopancreas histology. The results showed that the mRNA levels of three lipogenic related genes (diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acyl desaturase (FAD)) decreased significantly in the 6.7 μg g-1 and 20 μg g-1 TAM treatments compare to the control. The mRNA levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner as TAM concentration increased. The mRNA levels of two lipid catabolism-related genes (acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) and fatty acid transport protein (FATP)) were down-regulated among the three TAM treatments, while the enzyme activity and mRNA level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I) was up-regulated by TAM treatments. Compared to the control, the lowest levels of total lipids and phospholipids were detected in the 6.7 μg g-1 TAM treatment, while the 20 μg g-1 TAM treatment had the lowest free fatty acids concentration. The 6.7 μg g-1 TAM treatment had the lowest percentages of 16:1n-7, 18:1n-9, 18:1n-7 and total monounsaturated fatty acids (∑MUFA), whilst simultaneously recording the highest percentages of 18:2n-6 and 20:2n-6 in this treatment. Moreover, histological observations indicated that TAM caused the walls of the hepatopancreatic tubules to become brittle, with a concurrent increase in the number of blister-like cells. These results suggest that TAM damages the hepatopancreas and leads to a reduction in hepatopancreatic lipid deposition in P. trituberculatus.","Current practice and perceptions regarding pain, agitation and delirium management in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202165,Journal of critical care,2019 06 15,"To characterize monitoring of pain, agitation, and delirium; investigate opioid and sedative choices; and describe prevention and treatment of delirium in adults receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) for respiratory failure.",Assessment of need for lower level acuity critical care services at a tertiary acute care hospital in Canada: A prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202164,Journal of critical care,2019 06 15,"Critical care beds are commonly described in three levels (highest level 3, lowest level 1).

However, the diversity of seizures among patients makes it difficult to develop universal features that are applicable for automatic seizure detection in all cases, and the rarity of seizures results in a lack of sufficient training data for classifiers.",IQ estimation by means of EEG-fNIRS recordings during a logical-mathematical intelligence test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202152,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 06 15,"Intelligence differences of individuals are attributed to the structural and functional differences of the brain. Neural processing operations of the human brain vary according to the difficulty level of the problem and the intelligence level of individuals. In this study, we used a bimodal system consisting of functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) to investigate these inter-individual differences. A continuous wave 32-channel fNIRS from OxyMonfNIRS device (Artinis) and 19-channel EEG from (g.tec's company) were utilized to study the oxygenation procedure as well as the electrical activity of the brain when doing the problems of Raven's Progressive Matrix (RPM) intelligence test. We used this information to estimate the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the individual without performing a complete logical-mathematical intelligence test in a long-time period and examining the answers of people to the questions. After EEG preprocessing, different features including Higuchi's fractal dimension, Shannon entropy values from wavelet transform coefficients, and average power of frequency sub-bands were extracted. Clean fNIRS signals were also used to compute features such as slope, mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness, and peak. Then dimension reduction algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to select an effective feature set from fNIRS and EEG in order to improve the IQ estimation process. We utilized two regression methods, i.e., Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to extract optimum models for the IQ determination. The best regression models based on fNIRS-EEG and fNIRS presented 3.093% and 3.690% relative error for 11 subjects, respectively.",Structural change in GadD2 of Listeria monocytogenes field isolates supports nisin resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202151,International journal of food microbiology,2019 06 15,"The lantibiotic nisin is used as a food additive to effectively inactivate a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes. In total, 282 L. monocytogenes field isolates from German ready-to-eat food products, food-processing environments and patient samples and 39 Listeria reference strains were evaluated for their susceptibility to nisin. The MIC90 value was <1500 IU ml-1. Whole genome sequences (WGS) of four nisin susceptible (NS; growth <200 IU ml-1) and two nisin resistant L. monocytogenes field isolates (NR; growth >1500 IU ml-1) of serotype IIa were analyzed for DNA sequence variants (DSVs) in genes putatively associated with NR and its regulation. WGS of NR differed from NS in the gadD2 gene encoding for the glutamate decarboxylase system (GAD). Moreover, homology modeling predicted a protein structure of GadD2 in NR that promoted a less pH dependent GAD activity and may therefore be beneficial for nisin resistance. Likewise NR had a significant faster growth rate compared to NS in presence of nisin at pH 7. In conclusion, results contributed to ongoing debate that a genetic shift in GAD supports NR state.",Bacterial content and characterization of antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Danish sushi products and association with food inspector rankings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202150,International journal of food microbiology,2019 06 15,"This study examined the prevalence and phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance patterns of Staphylococcus aureus in sushi from 20 Danish outlets. Microbial quality of sushi products and food inspector ranking of outlets were assessed and results for thirteen of the outlets were compared with findings from a previous study in 2012. Inspector rankings were similar in the two studies. The mesophilic aerobic counts were slightly lower (p = 0.0296) in 2017 than in 2012 with average values of the 13 shops of 5.2 log CFU/g and 5.7 log CFU/g, respectively. In both studies E. coli was only found in the products from outlets that did not have consistently superior rankings. On the other hand prevalence and average counts of Staphylococcus spp. were slightly higher in 2017 (p = 0.0286) but no methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were observed in the present study. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) were, however, isolated from 18.7% of sushi products with an average count below 2 log CFU/g. Based on spa and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), isolates belonged to clonal complex CC7 (t2016), CC20 (t7836), CC45 (t065, t127, t362), CC88 (t1998) and CC398 (t164, t331, t1451). The Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-encoding gene lukF was detected only in isolates of the t065 spa-type whereas the scn gene from the ΦSa3 prophage was detected in 76.5% of the isolates, supporting that the majority of isolates were of likely human origin. Thirty-six isolates (70.6%) were resistant to at least one of the antibiotic compounds tested. Antibiotic resistance genes that confer resistance to β-lactams (blaZ) and macrolides (ermC) were detected in 33.3% and 9.8% of isolates, respectively. The tet(K) gene that encode tetracycline resistance was only found in a t7836 strain. Overall, this study indicates that S. aureus in sushi products in Denmark do not represent a major food safety hazard due to, firstly, the low temperature and limited time of storage of product may prevent significant growth and production of toxic levels of enterotoxin of this species. Secondly, the S. aureus isolates obtained did not include MRSA variants and none of them encoded PVL that constitute one of the virulence factors in pathogenesis. Several MSSA isolates contained however genes encoding antibiotic resistance, which emphasize the potential role of foods as vehicles for transmission of such variants.",Evaluation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis survival during the manufacturing process of Italian raw milk hard cheeses (Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202149,International journal of food microbiology,2019 06 15,"Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the agent of paratuberculosis in ruminants, is suspected to be involved in the aetiology of some human diseases. Notably, the consumption of milk and dairy products is considered to be the main route of human exposure to MAP because of its ability to survive during pasteurization and manufacturing processes. The aim of this study was to investigate, through a microbiological challenge test, the survival of MAP during the manufacturing and ripening period of two Italian hard cheeses, Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, made from raw bovine milk. The challenge test was performed in two different phases: the creaming phase and the manufacturing phase. The creaming phase, which is the first step of cheese production, was reproduced in the laboratory employing raw cow's milk spiked with a MAP reference strain at a final concentration of 5.58 log10 CFU/mL. After the creaming at 18 °C and 27 °C for 12 h, a decrease of 0.80 log10 and 0.77 log10 was observed in partially skimmed milk, respectively. In the second phase, two batches of raw cow's milk (1000 L each) were inoculated with MAP reference and wild strains, respectively. Then, the entire manufacturing process for Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano, both of Protective Designation of Origin (PDO), was reproduced in an experimental cheese factory, starting from a concentration in milk of 5.19 ± 0.01 and 5.28 ± 0.08 log10 CFU/mL of MAP reference and wild strains, respectively. Heating the curd at 53 °C for 20 min did not affect MAP survival, however a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in MAP viability was observed during the moulding phase and after salting in brine, regarding the wild strains and the reference strain, respectively. In addition, a significant decrease was observed during the ripening period, at which time the MAP concentration dropped below the limit of detection from the second and the third month of ripening, for the wild and reference strains, respectively. Taking into account the poor data availability about MAP survival in hard cheeses, this study may improve the knowledge regarding the effect of the cheese manufacturing process on the MAP dynamics, supporting also the safety of traditional raw milk hard cheeses.",Characterization of the in situ pellicle ultrastructure formed under the influence of bovine milk and milk protein isolates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202148,Archives of oral biology,2019 06 15,"The present study aimed to investigate if bovine milk or milk protein isolates, respectively, alter the ultrastructure of thein situ pellicle and might therefore have an influence on oral health.",An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of 12 psychotropic drugs and metabolites in hair: Identification of acute quetiapine poisoning using hair root.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202147,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"A rapid, sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the determination and quantification of 12 psychotropic drugs and metabolites in hair was developed and validated. After freeze grinding with methanol, the supernatant was determined by LC-MS/MS using an Allure PFPPropyl column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) with a gradient elution of acetonitrile and 10 mmol/L ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid, and in the subsequent analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, two ion transitions were monitored for each analyte. The limits of detection ranged from 0.002 to 0.05 ng/mg, and the limits of quantitation were in the range of 0.005-0.1 ng/mg. Good linearity (r > 0.995) was observed for all analytes over the linear range. Acceptable intraday and interday precision (RSD ≤ 20%) and accuracy (85.3%-112.9%) were achieved. This method of detection was applied to the analysis of guinea pig hair roots after a single dose of quetiapine. Quetiapine and 7-hydroxyquetiapine were both detected in guinea pig hair roots from 5 min post administration. The concentration of quetiapine (10.3-1733.8 ng/mg) was much higher than that of 7-hydroxyquetiapine (0.1-40.6 ng/mg) in the hair roots of guinea pigs, and higher concentrations of quetiapine and 7-hydroxyquetiapine occurred in black hair root than in that of white and brown. The animal experiment demonstrated that hair roots may be a good specimen for proving acute quetiapine poisoning when other biological matrices are not available.",Effects of long term storage on secondary metabolite profiles of cannabis resin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202146,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"The structural identification and the monitoring of the relative concentrations of a wide range of major (3) and minor secondary (16) metabolites used as marker substances for profiling of cannabis resin using GC-FID at the Swedish National Forensic Centre (NFC) has facilitated the mapping of their chemical and physical behaviors over a period of 48months whilst stored under different conditions (exposure to light, exposure to air, temperature). In all cases the behavior of this group of sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpenoids, cannabinoids and waxes could be directly related to their chemical lability/functionality. In particular, the identification of homologue triads for both Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) together with a group of seemingly chemically inert substances (for example, cannabicyclol(CBL) and the waxes (n-alkanes)) has created new tools for the establishment of common origins between samples of cannabis resins aged under different conditions. Since sampling of the resin blocks in NFC's method for profiling of cannabis resin is made below the surface, the effects of light incursion were found to be negligible. The effects of exposure to air (and indirectly temperature) were found to be more significant, not unexpectedly as many of the observed transformations were based on oxidation or rearrangement processes.","50 years later, insect evidence overturns Canada's most notorious case - Regina v. Steven Truscott.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202145,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"On 11 June 1959, the body of 12-year old Lynne Harper was discovered in a woodlot northeast of Clinton, Ontario. Although insect evidence was photographed and collected at the scene and autopsy, this evidence was not used in the 1959 trial. Instead, time of death was pinpointed to a 45-min window of 1900-1945 h on 9 June 1959 based on stomach content analysis. Based on circumstantial evidence and this time frame that he was the last suspect to see her alive, 14-year old Steven Truscott was convicted of her murder. He was scheduled to be hanged, but a temporary reprieve postponed his execution. In 1960, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Truscott was the youngest person to be sentenced to death in Canada, and his case provided the major impetus toward abolition of the death penalty in Canada. Truscott always maintained his innocence. In 2001, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted filed an appeal to have the case reopened. In 2006, the authors of this paper were contacted by Attorneys James Lockyer and Phil Campbell of the LCP Law Firm in Toronto to investigate this case. Fresh evidence was presented at the Ontario Court of Appeal in 2006-2007 including testimony of 3 forensic entomologists. This resulted in controversy regarding identification of the insects and assumptions of insect behaviour that affected the postmortem interval estimate. Lack of scientific evidence for the controversial theories proposed by one testifying entomologist resulted in disregarding his testimony. Instead, testimony by VanLaerhoven and Merritt was accepted. Based on their analysis and a re-creation experiment of the insect evidence, initial fly colonization occurred during daylight hours of 10 June 1959. The collected larvae were not likely to have been deposited on the body before dark (2140 h) on 9 June 1959 as this would have resulted in significantly larger and more advanced larval instar than were collected at the scene or autopsy. This analysis, together with a pathology reanalysis of stomach content analysis, demonstrated that the original estimate of time of death was unreliable. Truscott was with numerous witnesses prior to 1900 h and after 2000 h on 9 June 1959, thus the estimate of time of death was the most critical evidence in the original 1959 trial and the 2006-2007 appeal. On 28 August 2007, his conviction was overturned, declared a wrongful conviction and miscarriage of justice. Steven Truscott was acquitted of the murder charges.",Evaluation of the accuracy of the Nolla method for the estimation of dental age of children between 4-14 years old in Spain: A radiographic study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31202144,Forensic science international,2019 06 15,"The aim of this study was to estimate the age of subjects from their dental age by showing the different stages of tooth development using the Nolla method in a Spanish population sample considering the gender, age group, and the development of the two dental arches. The sample consisted of 604 orthopantomographs corresponding to Spanish children (male: 302 and female: 302) aged from 4 to 14 years old. The resulting chronological and dental ages were compared using Student's t-test. We obtained a good index of agreement between the evaluators and good internal consistency in the evaluation of the ages of the teeth. In general, the dental age estimates were lower than the chronological ages, obtaining an underestimation with the application of the Nolla method. In the male group, the average dental age of the maxillary teeth was 8.36 years and that of the mandibular teeth was 8.40 years, compared to the chronological age of 8.84 years in both cases. In the female group, the average dental age of the maxillary teeth was 7.76 years and that of the mandibular teeth was 7.88 years, compared to the chronological age of 8.70 years in both cases. On applying the Nolla method to our sample, a significant overestimation was observed only in children aged between 4 and 6.9 years. The Nolla method can be used as a complementary tool for estimating age in children of Spanish origin. The application of this method is more favourable in the case of individuals evaluated under the law applied to minors. In general, with this method, age is underestimated, but the calculations involved are reliable, and greater precision has been observed in male than in female. The data from this study can be used as a reference to determine the dental maturity of Spanish children and to estimate their ages."
