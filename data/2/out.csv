Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1, also called CD91) is an important receptor through which the hemin-Hpx complex can undergo endocytosis. This study investigated changes in the hemin-Hpx-CD91 axis in both hematoma and perihematomal tissue in a large animal ICH model. The effect of deferoxamine (DFX) on hemin-Hpx-CD91 was also examined. The study consisted of two parts. First, piglets had an injection of autologous blood into the right frontal lobe of brain and were euthanized from day 1 to day 7. Hematoma and perihematomal tissue of brains were used for hemin assay, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Second, piglets with ICH were treated with deferoxamine or vehicle, and were euthanized for hemin measurement and Hpx and CD91 immunohistochemistry. We found that there was an increase of hemin levels within the hematoma and perihematomal brain tissue after ICH. Hpx and CD91-positive cells were present in the clot and perihematomal tissue from day 1. Hpx and CD91 positive cells were Iba1 positive. After DFX therapy, hemin dropped markedly in the hematoma and perihematomal brain tissue. Furthermore, DFX treatment decreased the number of Hpx and CD91 positive cells in and around the hematoma. In conclusion, hemin accumulation occurs in and around the hematoma. Increases in Hpx and CD91 may be important in scavenging that hemin. DFX treatment decreased hemin release from the hematoma and reduced the expression of Hpx and CD91.",Mitochondrial methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 links oxidative stress to Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078523,Experimental neurology,2019 06 15,"Methionine sulfoxide reductase B2 (MSRB2) is a mitochondrial protein that protects cell from oxidative stress. The antioxidant activity suggests that MSRB2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that in APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD, MSRB2 protein levels were decreased in the hippocampus at both young (6 mon) and old (18 mon) age, and in the cortex only at an old age, respectively. In HEK293 cells that stably express human full-length β-amyloid precursor protein (APP, HEK/APP), MSRB2 reduced the protein and mRNA levels of APP and β-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), and the consequent amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) 1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels. MSRB2 overexpression or knockdown also oppositely affected Tau phosphorylation at selective sites, with the concomitant alteration of the phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (p-ERK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) levels. Moreover, in cells treated with long-term (24 h) hydrogen peroxide, the alterations of APP processing and Tau phosphorylation were reversed by MSRB2 overexpression. We further found that MSRB2-mediated regulation of APP transcription involved JNK and ERK signaling, as MSRB2 also reduced the levels of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), and JNK or ERK inhibitor attenuated the effect of MSRB2 on APP proteins and transcripts. Finally, MSRB2 reduced apoptosis-related proteins Bax and caspase3 and enhanced the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. These results indicated that the role for MSRB2 in AD-like pathology was closely associated with its antioxidant activity. By attenuating both amyloidogenesis and Tau phosphorylation, MSRB2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD.",Treatment of keratinocytes with 4-phenylbutyrate in epidermolysis bullosa: Lessons for therapies in keratin disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078522,EBioMedicine,2019 05 12,"Missense mutations in keratin 5 and 14 genes cause the severe skin fragility disorder epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) by collapsing of the keratin cytoskeleton into cytoplasmic protein aggregates.

Neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the seizure focus is often curative but frequently contraindicated by risks of irreversible impairment to brain function. Novel therapies are therefore required that better balance seizure suppression against the risks of side effects. Among experimental gene therapies, chemogenetics has the major advantage that the action on the epileptogenic zone can be modulated on demand. Two broad approaches are to use a designer G-protein-coupled receptor or a modified ligand gated ion channel, targeted to specific neurons in the epileptogenic zone using viral vectors and cell-type selective promoters. The receptor can be activated on demand by either an exogenous compound or by pathological levels of extracellular glutamate that occur in epileptogenic tissue. We review the principal designer receptor technologies and their modes of action. We compare the drawbacks and benefits of each designer receptor with particular focus on the drug activators and the potential for clinical translation in epilepsy.",Seno-destructive smooth muscle cells in the ascending aorta of patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078518,EBioMedicine,2019 06 04,"Ascending aortic aneurysms constitute an important hazard for individuals with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV).

FFA4 is known to be phosphorylated and internalized in response to agonists and protein kinase C activation. In this paper report the modulation of this fatty acid receptor by activation of receptor tyrosine kinases. Cell-activation with growth factors (insulin, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, and platelet-derived growth factor) increases FFA4 phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. This effect was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, suggesting the involvement of these kinases in it. FFA4 phosphorylation did not alter agonist-induced FFA4 calcium signaling, but was associated with decreased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation. In addition, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, epidermal growth factor, and to a lesser extent, platelet-derived growth factor, induce receptor internalization. This action of insulin, insulin-like growth factor I, and epidermal growth factor was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Additionally, cell treatment with these growth factors induced FFA4-β-arrestin coimmunoprecipitation. Our results evidenced cross-talk between receptor tyrosine kinases and FFA4 and suggest roles of protein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase in such a functional interaction.",Severe phlebitis-like abnormal reaction following great saphenous vein cyanoacrylate closure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078516,Journal of vascular surgery.

Respiratory medicine,2019 05 24,"Tuberculosis is a major cause of death and disability among children globally, yet children have been neglected in global tuberculosis control efforts. Historically, tuberculosis in children has been thought of as a family disease, and because of this, household contact tracing of children after identification of an adult tuberculosis case has been emphasised as the principal public health intervention. However, the population-level effect of household contact tracing is predicated on the assumption that most paediatric tuberculosis infections are acquired within the household. In this Personal View, we focus on accumulating scientific evidence indicating that the majority of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission to children in high-burden settings occurs in the community, outside of households in which a person has tuberculosis. We estimate the population-attributable fraction of M tuberculosis transmission to children due to household exposures to be between 10% and 30%. M tuberculosis transmission from the household was low (<30%) even in children younger than age 5 years. We propose that an effective public health response to childhood tuberculosis requires comprehensive, community-based interventions, such as active surveillance in select settings, rather than contact tracing alone. Importantly, the historical paradigm that most paediatric transmission occurs in households should be reconsidered on the basis of the scientific knowledge presented.",Prospective validation of the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) score for in-hospital cardiac arrest prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078496,Resuscitation,2019 06 14,"We aimed to prospectively validate the Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation (GO-FAR) score, which predicts the likelihood of survival to discharge neurologically intact or with minimal deficits (conscious, alert, and able to work) after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA).",Burden of non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases in Saudi Arabian children: The first nationwide experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078494,Journal of infection and public health,2019 05 12,Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) causing pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases are increasing worldwide.

In a previous study, we developed Photo-DEAN, a universal-microarray-based RNA quantification method that enabled reverse transcription-free multiplex measurement of the absolute amount of RNA. Photo-DEAN promotes high-throughput and bias-less transcriptome analysis without the need for common controls or additional complicated normalization steps. In this study, we empirically identified two conditions (individual specificity and uniform duplex stability) necessary for in silico design of probe sequences, allowing the Photo-DEAN method to accurately measure the absolute amount of target RNA in total RNA. We then demonstrated that using the modified probe design conditions, the Photo-DEAN method successfully measured the absolute amount of pgi mRNA spiked into E. coli total RNA. The measurement was performed at five different sites in the coding region of pgi mRNA, exhibiting no significant site dependence. Theoretical considerations suggested that probe sequences longer than the previously used 30-bases better satisfy the necessary design conditions.",Adsorption of DNA by using polydopamine modified magnetic nanoparticles based on solid-phase extraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078490,Analytical biochemistry,2019 06 15,"A polydopamine magnetic composite (PDA@Fe3O4) was prepared for the extraction of human genomic DNA and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectrometer, zeta potential and vibrating sample magnetometry. PDA@Fe3O4 based on magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) method have highly efficient capture of genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)and gene fragments ranging from about 100 bp to 200 bp. Compared with commercial beads (Shenggong, China) and spin column nucleic acid extraction kit (Tiangen, China), the PDA coated magnetic nanoparticles display superior genomic DNA extraction capacity (116 mg/g) and yield (90.2%). The isolation protocol used the solutions (composed of PEG and NaCl) with a specific pH for the binding and release of DNA. The procedure can be attributed to the charge switch of amino and hydroxyl groups on surface of the magnetic particle. The extracted DNA with high quality (A260/A280 = 1.82 ± 0.04) can be directly used as template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The results showed the new composite to be an ideal adsorbent for separation of DNA which had the advantage of its low cost, high extraction capacity and yield."

In this report, new insights are brought out into the diversity of putative phleboviruses circulating in Portugal (both the continental territory and the islands of São Miguel, in the Azores, and Madeira), as well as in the Spanish western regions of Extremadura and Castilla and León. Phlebovirus sequences were frequently detected (L-segment) from both questing and feeding ticks, but especially in Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.) specimens. These sequences were detected in adult ticks, as well as nymphs and eggs, supporting the hypothesis of viral maintenance by vertical transmission. Though multiple genetic groups could be identified in phylogenetic trees (AnLuc, KarMa, RiPar virus 1, and Spanish group 1 and 2), all the sequences from Portugal and Spain shared common ancestry with other viral sequence obtained from samples collected over a large geographic coverage. Spatiotemporal analysis placed Middle-East as the geographic origin of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all phleboviruses analysed in the present study. More recent viral transitions might include migrations from Spain to continental Portugal, and from there to the Portuguese Islands. Our findings suggest that the time of the MRCA of phleboviruses was dated around 225 years ago [95% HPD: 124-387 year before the last sampling date].",First detection and genetic identification of Hepatozoon canis in Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks collected from dogs of Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078466,Ticks and tick-borne diseases,2019 05 24,"We determined the prevalence of infection and genetic identity of Hepatozoon spp. harbored by Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks in Taiwan.

Hepatozoon infection was detected by performing a nested-PCR assay based on the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene. The genetic identity of detected Hepatozoon was identified by gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Hepatozoon infection was detected in nymphs, males and females of R. sanguineus s. l. ticks with an infection rate of 20.8%, 22.8% and 29.4%, respectively. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that these Hepatozoon spp. of Taiwan were genetically affiliated to the same clade within the genospecies of H. canis and can be discriminated from other genospecies of H. americanum and H. felis. Intraspecies analysis based on the genetic distance (GD) values indicates a lower level (GD < 0.005) genetic divergence within the same genospecies of H. canis detected in Taiwan, Brazil and Spain. Interspecies analysis also reveals a higher heterogeneity of Taiwan strains distinguished from other genospecies of H. felis (GD > 0.040) and H. americanum (GD > 0.056). This study provides the first molecular evidence of H. canis detected and identified in various stages of R. sanguineus s. l. ticks in Taiwan. Detection of H. canis in unfed male ticks may imply the possible mechanism of transstadial survival in R. sanguineus s. l. ticks. Further investigations on Hepatozoon spp. harbored by various vector ticks in Taiwan may illustrate the epidemiological significance of this parasite.","Axitinib plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced sarcomas including alveolar soft-part sarcoma: a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078463,The Lancet.

Here, we review our current knowledge of the biology of interleukin-1β, a key regulator of inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque and the target of the first clinical trial to demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can effectively reduce cardiovascular risk. We discuss the challenges faced by interleukin-1β inhibitors and other anti-inflammatory compounds in their translation to the clinical scenario, and identify other potential targets within this signaling pathway that hold promise in the cardiovascular setting."
