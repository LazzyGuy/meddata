Mutations in the members of ABC transporters have been associated with psychiatric illnesses.OBJECTIVE:In this study, we investigated whether 9 SNPs in ABCB1 (rs6946119, rs28401781, rs4148739, and rs3747802), ABCB6 (rs1109866, rs1109867, rs3731885, and rs3755047), and ABCG1 (rs182694) contribute to the risk of SCZ in a Han Chinese population.METHODS:We conducted a case-control study in a Han Chinese population, involving 1,034 SCZ patients and 1,034 unrelated healthy controls to genotype 9 SNPs.RESULTS:The analysis demonstrated that rs182694 of ABCG1 was significantly different between SCZ patients and controls as to allele (rs182694: p = 0.0070, χ2 = 7.27) and genotype frequencies (rs182694: p = 0.0013, χ2 = 13.35).CONCLUSIONS:Our findings support an association between ABCG1 polymorphism and SCZ in a Han Chinese population.,Gaini Ma:Bio-X Institutes- Key Laboratory for the Genetics of Developmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders (Ministry of Education)- Shanghai Jiao Tong

Water reabsorption in the CD depends on the action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and a transepithelial osmotic gradient between the luminal fluid and surrounding interstitium. AVP induces transcellular water reabsorption across CD principal cells through associated signaling pathways after binding to arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2). This signaling cascade regulates the water channel protein aquaporin-2 (AQP2). AQP2 is exclusively localized in kidney connecting tubules and CDs. Specifically, AVP stimulates the intracellular translocation of AQP2-containing vesicles to the apical plasma membrane, increasing the osmotic water permeability of CD cells. Moreover, AVP induces transcription of the  gene, increasing AQP2 protein abundance. This review provides new insights into the transcriptional regulation of the  gene in the kidney CD with an overview of AVP and AQP2. It summarizes current therapeutic approaches for X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by  gene mutations.'},Hyun Jun Jung:Department of Physiology- University of Maryland School of Medicine- Baltimore- MD- USA.Tae-Hwan Kwon:Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- School of Medicine- Kyungpook National University- Daegu- Korea.

However, the effects of the GSK-3β gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in those receiving antidepressant therapy are unknown.OBJECTIVE:In the present study, we examined the relationship between brain volume-related SNPs of the GSK-3β gene and antidepressant treatment effects in patients with MDD.METHODS:Paroxetine, fluvoxamine, or milnacipran was administered to 143 Japanese patients with MDD. Two SNPs of the GSK-3β gene (rs6438552 and rs12630592) that influence brain volume in the hippocampus were genotyped. For the primary outcome, the relationship between genetic variations in the SNPs and the percent change in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score at week 6 was examined. In addition, rs334558, which has been reported repeatedly, was also genotyped.RESULTS:There was a significant correlation between the two SNPs and the percent change in the HAM-D scores at week 6 (rs6438552 A/A vs. A/G + G/G: p = 0.016; rs12630592 G/G vs. G/T + T/T: p = 0.016). There was high linkage disequilibrium between the rs6438552 and rs12630592 SNPs. The correlation between high therapeutic response over time and the two SNPs were also confirmed (rs6438552 A/A vs. others: p = 0.031; rs12630592 G/G vs. others: p = 0.031).CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that two GSK-3β variants that influence brain volume were associated with changes in the HAM-D scores at week 6 in patients with MDD.,Naotaka Sunada:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Kansai Medical University- Moriguchi- Japan.Yoshiteru Takekita:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Kansai Medical University- Moriguchi- Japan.Shinpei Nonen:Department of Pharmacy- Hyogo University of Health Sciences- Kobe- Japan.Masataka Wakeno:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Kansai Medical University- Moriguchi- Japan.Yosuke Koshikawa:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Kansai Medical University- Moriguchi- Japan.Haruhiko Ogata:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Kansai Medical University- Moriguchi- Japan.Toshihiko Kinoshita:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Kansai Medical University- Moriguchi- Japan.Masaki Kato:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Kansai Medical University- Moriguchi- Japan- katom@takii.kmu.ac.jp.
31189194,2019-06-12,United States Facial Plast Surg 8405303 0736-6825,Overview of Deep Dermal Fillers.,Dermal fillers have become an integral part of both medical and cosmetic dermatology. Our expanding knowledge of the aging face has allowed us to shift the focus from skin-reduction lifting procedures to soft tissue augmentation. Within the past 5 years alone, nine new dermal fillers have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for soft tissue augmentation. The rise in both the use and number of dermal fillers in recent years is a testament to their safety and efficacy. Dermal fillers can be broken down to three major types: temporary, semipermanent, and permanent. The former, which include hyaluronic acid based fillers, provide safe and effective correction but only for a limited time, typically approximately 1 to 2 years at best. This review will cover the semipermanent (poly-L-lactic acid and calcium hydroxylapatite) and permanent (polymethylmethacrylate and liquid silicone) injectable fillers. These so-called deep dermal fillers are valuable, durable tools in correcting the aging face. Given their extended duration of effect, these fillers inherently carry their own risk for potential adverse events. Thus, it is essential that clinicians have a thorough understanding of these products to best counsel, recommend, and perform soft tissue augmentation using these fillers.,Michael H Liu:Department of Dermatology- University of California Los Angeles- Los Angeles- California.David P Beynet:Department of Dermatology- University of California Los Angeles- Los Angeles- California.:Department of Dermatology- VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System- Los Angeles- California.:Nima M Gharavi:Department of Dermatology- Cedars-Sinai Medical Center- Los Angeles- California.

New strategies, including regenerative cell-based therapies, have emerged as therapeutic alternatives. Results from several groups, including our own, have reported evidence of a supportive role for mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in functional recovery and prevention of tissue damage in murine models of CKD. Prompted by these data, an open pilot study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of a single injection of autologous adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) for treatment of CKD.UNASSIGNED:AT-MSCs were infused intravenously into six CKD patients at a dose of 1 million cells/kg. Patients were stabilized and followed for one year prior to MSC infusion and one year following infusion.UNASSIGNED:No patients presented with adverse effects. Statistically significant improvement in urinary protein excretion was observed in AT-MSCs transplanted patients, from a median of 0.75 g/day (range, 0.15-9.57) at baseline to 0.54 g/day (range, 0.01-2.66) at month 12 ( = 0.046).

31189157,2019-06-12,Switzerland Int Arch Allergy Immunol 9211652 1018-2438,Novel Nanofluidic IgE Assay versus a Reference Method: A Real-World Comparison.,BACKGROUND:Clinically meaningful specific IgE determination is an important step in the diagnosis of allergic diseases. While patient's history and skin prick tests are available during the medical visit, most IgE immunoassays require hours to several days to be available. Recent developments in the field of nanofluidic technology open new horizons for point-of-care management of this unmet medical need.OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to compare IgE diagnostic agreement between a nanofluidic assay (abioSCOPE®) and a laboratory reference method (Phadia Laboratory System®) in a real-world clinical setting.METHODS:Sera from 105 patients whose routine allergy diagnostic workup required a blood sampling were used to compare the novel nanofluidic IgE assay to a reference method in a blind manner for a panel of five respiratory allergens. To assess the agreement between methods, patient records were reviewed by four independent experts to establish the final diagnosis. Experts were blinded to the IgE serological method used, but had access to patient history, skin prick tests, and blood test results.RESULTS:Analytic agreement between the two methods was 81% for the tested panel of allergens (ranging from 77 to 89%). The overall agreement in clinical diagnosis decision taken by the expert panel was 94.6% with the nanofluidic IgE assay when compared to the reference method.CONCLUSIONS:The nanofluidic IgE assay, as determined through an evaluation based on clinical history, skin prick tests, and IgE measurement, is a valuable tool for allergy experts to identify patients' sensitization patterns at the point of care, and for routine IgE diagnostic workup.,Samuel Roethlisberger:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Olfa Karoui:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Daria Mapelli:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Régine Audran:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Vincent Aubert:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Laurie D Girard:Abionic SA- Epalinges- Switzerland- laurie.girard@abionic.com.Fabien Rebeaud:Abionic SA- Epalinges- Switzerland.Annette Leimgruber:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Guillaume Buss:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Joël Duc:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Felicitas Langner-Viviani:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.Iwan Maerki:Abionic SA- Epalinges- Switzerland.François Spertini:Division of Immunology and Allergy- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois- Lausanne- Switzerland.
31189107,2019-06-12,United States Cell Rep 101573691  ,Transcriptional States and Chromatin Accessibility Underlying Human Erythropoiesis.,Human erythropoiesis serves as a paradigm of physiologic cellular differentiation. This process is also of considerable interest for better understanding anemias and identifying new therapies. Here, we apply deep transcriptomic and accessible chromatin profiling to characterize a faithful ex vivo human erythroid differentiation system from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We reveal stage-specific transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility during various stages of erythropoiesis, including 14,260 differentially expressed genes and 63,659 variably accessible chromatin peaks. Our analysis suggests differentiation stage-predominant roles for specific master regulators, including GATA1 and KLF1. We integrate chromatin profiles with common and rare genetic variants associated with erythroid cell traits and diseases, finding that variants regulating different erythroid phenotypes likely act at variable points during differentiation. In addition, we identify a regulator of terminal erythropoiesis, TMCC2, more broadly illustrating the value of this comprehensive analysis to improve our understanding of erythropoiesis in health and disease.,Leif S Ludwig:Division of Hematology/Oncology- Boston Children's Hospital- and Department of Pediatric Oncology- Dana-Farber Cancer Institute- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA.Caleb A Lareau:Division of Hematology/Oncology- Boston Children's Hospital- and Department of Pediatric Oncology- Dana-Farber Cancer Institute- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA; Molecular Pathology Unit- Massachusetts General Hospital- Charlestown- MA 02129- USA; Program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences- Harvard University- Cambridge- MA 02138- USA.Erik L Bao:Division of Hematology/Oncology- Boston Children's Hospital- and Department of Pediatric Oncology- Dana-Farber Cancer Institute- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA; Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA.Satish K Nandakumar:Division of Hematology/Oncology- Boston Children's Hospital- and Department of Pediatric Oncology- Dana-Farber Cancer Institute- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA.Christoph Muus:Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA; Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences- Harvard University- Cambridge- MA 02138- USA.Jacob C Ulirsch:Division of Hematology/Oncology- Boston Children's Hospital- and Department of Pediatric Oncology- Dana-Farber Cancer Institute- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA; Program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences- Harvard University- Cambridge- MA 02138- USA.Kaitavjeet Chowdhary:Division of Hematology/Oncology- Boston Children's Hospital- and Department of Pediatric Oncology- Dana-Farber Cancer Institute- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA; Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA; Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA.Jason D Buenrostro:Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA; Society of Fellows- Harvard University- Cambridge- MA 02138- USA.Narla Mohandas:Laboratory of Membrane Biology- New York Blood Center- New York- NY 10065- USA.Xiuli An:Laboratory of Membrane Biology- New York Blood Center- New York- NY 10065- USA; School of Life Science- Zhengzhou University- Zhengzhou- Henan 450001- China.Martin J Aryee:Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard- Cambridge- MA 02142- USA; Molecular Pathology Unit- Massachusetts General Hospital- Charlestown- MA 02129- USA; Department of Pathology- Harvard Medical School- Boston- MA 02115- USA; Department of Biostatistics- Harvard T.H.

The therapeutic effects of volasertib, a PLKs inhibitor for papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (known as well-differentiated thyroid cancer) were evaluated in this study. Volasertib inhibited cell proliferation in two papillary and two follicular thyroid cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Volasertib treatment reduced cells in S phase and increased cells in G2/M phase. Volasertib activated caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis. Drug combinations of volasertib and sorafenib showed mostly synergism in four well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma cell lines in vitro. Volasertib treatment in vivo retarded the growth of a papillary thyroid tumor model. Furthermore, the combination of volasertib with sorafenib was more effective than either single treatment in a follicular thyroid cancer xenograft model. Promising safety profiles appeared in animals treated with either volasertib alone or volasertib and sorafenib combination therapy. These findings support volasertib as a potential drug for the treatment of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer.,Shu-Fu Lin:S Lin- Internal Medicine- Chang Gung Memorial Hospital- Taoyuan- Taiwan.Jen-Der Lin:J Lin- Internal Medicine- Chang Gung Memorial Hospital- Taoyuan- Taiwan.Chun Nan Yeh:C Yeh- General Surgery Department- Chang Gung Memorial Hospital- Taoyuang- Taiwan.Yu-Tung Huang:Y Huang- Center for Big Data Analytics and Statistics- Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkou Main Branch- Taoyuan- Taiwan.Ting-Chao Chou:T Chou- Laboratory of Preclinical Pharmacology Core- Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center- New York- United States.Richard J Wong:R Wong- Surgery- Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center- New York- United States.
31189110,2019-06-12,United States Cell Rep 101573691  ,TRIM5α Restricts Flavivirus Replication by Targeting the Viral Protease for Proteasomal Degradation.,Tripartite motif-containing protein 5α (TRIM5α) is a cellular antiviral restriction factor that prevents early events in retrovirus replication. The activity of TRIM5α is thought to be limited to retroviruses as a result of highly specific interactions with capsid lattices. In contrast to this current understanding, we show that both human and rhesus macaque TRIM5α suppress replication of specific flaviviruses. Multiple viruses in the tick-borne encephalitis complex are sensitive to TRIM5α-dependent restriction, but mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including yellow fever, dengue, and Zika viruses, are resistant. TRIM5α suppresses replication by binding to the viral protease NS2B/3 to promote its K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Importantly, TRIM5α contributes to the antiviral function of IFN-I against sensitive flaviviruses in human cells. Thus, TRIM5α possesses remarkable plasticity in the recognition of diverse virus families, with the potential to influence human susceptibility to emerging flaviviruses of global concern.,Abhilash I Chiramel:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Nicholas R Meyerson:Department of Molecular- Cellular and Developmental Biology- University of Colorado Boulder- Boulder- CO 80309- USA.Kristin L McNally:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Rebecca M Broeckel:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Vanessa R Montoya:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Omayra Méndez-Solís:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Shelly J Robertson:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Gail L Sturdevant:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Kirk J Lubick:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Vinod Nair:Research Technology Branch- RML- NIAID- NIH- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Brian H Youseff:Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology- College of Medicine and Life Sciences- University of Toledo Health Science Campus- Toledo- OH 43606- USA.Robin M Ireland:Immunity to Pulmonary Pathogens Section- Laboratory of Bacteriology- RML- NIAID- NIH- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Catharine M Bosio:Immunity to Pulmonary Pathogens Section- Laboratory of Bacteriology- RML- NIAID- NIH- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.Kyusik Kim:Program in Molecular Medicine- University of Massachusetts Medical School- Worcester- MA 01655- USA.Jeremy Luban:Program in Molecular Medicine- University of Massachusetts Medical School- Worcester- MA 01655- USA.Vanessa M Hirsch:Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology- NIAID- Bethesda- MD 20892- USA.R Travis Taylor:Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology- College of Medicine and Life Sciences- University of Toledo Health Science Campus- Toledo- OH 43606- USA.Fadila Bouamr:Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology- NIAID- Bethesda- MD 20892- USA.Sara L Sawyer:Department of Molecular- Cellular and Developmental Biology- University of Colorado Boulder- Boulder- CO 80309- USA.Sonja M Best:Innate Immunity and Pathogenesis Section- Laboratory of Virology- Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML)- National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)- National Institutes of Health (NIH)- Hamilton- MT 59840- USA.

Previous attempts have failed to gain widespread adoption as they were not freely shareable or did not contain the right level of specificity, structure, and clinical relevance to gain acceptance by the larger emergency medicine community. Using real-world data, we constructed a presenting problem list that addresses these challenges.METHODS:We prospectively captured the presenting problems for 180,424 consecutive emergency department patient visits at an urban, academic, Level I trauma center in the Boston metro area. No patients were excluded. We used a consensus process to iteratively derive our system using real-world data. We used the first 70% of consecutive visits to derive our ontology, followed by a 6-month washout period, and the remaining 30% for validation. All concepts were mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT).RESULTS:Our system consists of a polyhierarchical ontology containing 692 unique concepts, 2,118 synonyms, and 30,613 nonvisible descriptions to correct misspellings and nonstandard terminology. Our ontology successfully captured structured data for 95.9% of visits in our validation data set.CONCLUSIONS:We present the HierArchical Presenting Problem ontologY (HaPPy). This ontology was empirically derived and then iteratively validated by an expert consensus panel. HaPPy contains 692 presenting problem concepts, each concept being mapped to SNOMED CT.

31189134,2019-06-12,England J Endocrinol 0375363 0022-0795,Novel mechanisms for the metabolic control of puberty: implications for pubertal alterations in early-onset obesity and malnutrition.,Puberty is driven by sophisticated neuroendocrine networks that timely activate the brain centers governing the reproductive axis. The timing of puberty is genetically determined; yet, puberty is also sensitive to numerous internal and external cues, among which metabolic/nutritional signals are especially prominent. Epidemiological evidence suggests that alterations of the age of puberty are becoming more frequent; the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, but the escalating prevalence of obesity and other metabolic/feeding disorders is possibly a major contributing factor. This phenomenon may have clinical implications, since alterations in pubertal timing have been associated to adverse health outcomes, including higher risk of earlier all-cause mortality. This urges for a better understanding of the neurohormonal basis of normal puberty and its deviations. Compelling evidence has recently documented the master role of hypothalamic neurons producing kisspeptins, encoded by Kiss1, in the neuroendocrine pathways controlling puberty. Kiss1 neurons seemingly participate in transmitting the regulatory actions of metabolic cues on pubertal maturation. Key cellular metabolic sensors, as the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and the fuel-sensing deacetylase, SIRT1, have been recently shown to participate also in the metabolic modulation of puberty. Recently, we have documented that AMPK and SIRT1 operate as major molecular effectors for the metabolic control of Kiss1 neurons and, thereby, puberty onset. Alterations of these molecular pathways may contribute to the perturbation of pubertal timing linked to conditions of metabolic stress in humans, such as subnutrition or obesity, and might become druggable targets for better management of pubertal disorders.,Maria J Vazquez:M Vazquez- Physiology Section- University of Cordoba- Cordoba- Spain.Inmaculada Velasco:I Velasco- Physiology Section- University of Cordoba- Cordoba- Spain.Manuel Tena-Sempere:M Tena-Sempere- Physiology Section- University of Cordoba- Cordoba- 14004- Spain.

Preclinical and clinical studies have shown interactions between the HPA axis and leptin. There is also evidence for a negative relationship between leptin and anxiety in humans. However, these possible associations have not been studied in individuals with attempted suicide.OBJECTIVE:To examine the relationship between leptin, HPA axis activity, and anxiety in individuals with a recent suicide attempt.METHODS:Sixty-nine individuals with a recent suicide attempt (n = 37 females; n = 32 males) were recruited and subjected to the Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST), lumbar puncture, and evaluation with the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale from which the Brief Scale for Anxiety (BSA) was derived. Leptin was analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cortisol in serum. Leptin was corrected for body mass index (BMI) by dividing CSF-leptin by BMI (CSF-leptin/BMI). Due to gender-related differences in leptin secretion and HPA axis activity, calculations were made for males and females separately.RESULTS:Significant differences were only found among females; CSF-leptin/BMI levels correlated significantly and negatively with BSA (p < 0.05), pre-DST cortisol, and post-DST serum cortisol at 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, CSF-leptin/BMI was significantly lower in nonsuppressors of dexamethasone as compared to suppressors (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS:These findings suggest that in females with a recent suicide attempt, low CSF leptin may be related to symptoms of anxiety and a hyperactive HPA axis.,Livia Ambrus:Section of Psychiatry- Department of Clinical Sciences- Clinical Psychiatric Research Center- Lund University- Lund- Sweden- ambruslivia@gmail.com.Sofie Westling:Section of Psychiatry- Department of Clinical Sciences- Clinical Psychiatric Research Center- Lund University- Lund- Sweden.

Twelve years after her diagnosis of CLL, routine follow-up chromosome analysis of peripheral blood revealed an abnormal metaphase with a dup(3)(q21q27) in 18 of 20 metaphase cells. To further characterize the abnormal chromosome 3, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using the Abbott BCL6 probe for 3q27. An additional BCL6 signal was observed in 303 of the 500 interphase nuclei examined. The ISCN was reported as 46,XX,dup(3)(q21q27)[1]/46,XX[2]. nuc ish(5'BCL6, 3'BCL6)x3(5'BCL6 with 3'BCL6x3)[303/500]. This abnormality was seen again in one of three available metaphases in a follow-up peripheral blood study five years later, consistent with persistent disease. Molecular genetic analysis identified the presence of somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene variable region (IGH-V), which is recognized as an independent favorable prognostic marker in CLL. FISH analysis was negative for loss of SEC63 (6q21), amplification of MYC (8q24), loss of ATM (11q22.3), trisomy 12, loss of D13S319 (13q14.3), loss of TP53 (17p13.1) and CCND1/MYEOV IGH rearrangement [t(11;14)(q13;q32.30)]. Partial trisomy 3 is a relatively rare event seen in B-CLL, with commonly overrepresented segments including the q21-23 region and the q25-29 region of the long arm of chromosome 3, as well as changes leading to gains of 3q26- q27.

31189137,2019-06-12,England Phys Med Biol 0401220 0031-9155,An in vitro study for the dosimetric and radiobiological validation of respiratory gating in conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy of the lung: effect of dose, dose rate, and breathing pattern.,Stereotactic body radiosurgery (SBRT) of the lung has become a standard of care for early-stage inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A common strategy to manage respiratory motion is gating, which inevitably results in a treatment time increase, especially in irregular-breathing patients. Flattening-filter free (FFF) beams allow to deliver the treatment with a higher dose rate, therefore counteracting shortening the beam-on time. In this study, we perform our in vitro evaluation of the dosimetric and radiobiological effect of gated lung SBRT with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) using both flattened and FFF beams. A moving thorax-shaped phantom with inserts and applicators were used for simulation, planning, gated treatment delivery measurements and in-vitro tests. The effect of gating window, dose rate, and breathing pattern is evaluated. Planned doses represented a typical conventional fractionation, 200cGy per fraction with SIB to 240cGy, flattened beam only, and SBRT, 800 cGy with SIB to 900 cGy, flattened and FFF beams. Ideal, as well as regular and irregular patient-specific breathing patterns with and without gating were used. Survival assay for lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line was performed. Delivered dose was within 6% for locations planned to receive 200 and 800 cGy and within 4% for SIB locations. Time between first beam-on and last beam-off varied from approximately 1.5 min for conventional fractionation, to 10.5 minutes, 800/900cGy doses, flattened beam and irregular breathing motion pattern. With FFF beams dose delivery time was shorter by a factor of 2-3, depending on the gating window and breathing pattern. We have found that survival depended on dose, and, for the most, not on dose rate, gating window, or breathing regularity.,Laura Cervino:Department of Radiation Medicine and Applies Sciences- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.Dima Soultan:University of Kansas Cancer Center- Kansas City- Kansas- UNITED STATES.Sunil J Advani:Department of Radiation Medicine and Applies Sciences- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.Mariel Cornell:Department of Radiation Medicine and Applies Sciences- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.Adam Yock:Radiation Oncology- Vanderbilt University Medical Center- 2220 Pierce Ave- Preston Research Bldg Rm B-948- Nashville- Nashville- Tennessee- 37232- UNITED STATES.Niclas Pettersson:Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering- Sahlgrenska University Hospital- Goteborg- SWEDEN.William Y Song:Radiation Oncology- Virginia Commonwealth University- Richmond- Virginia- UNITED STATES.Joseph Aguilera:Department of Radiation Medicine and Applies Sciences- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.James D Murphy:Department of Radiation Medicine and Applies Sciences- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.Carl K Hoh:Radiology- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.Claude James:Radiology- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.Anthony Paravati:Kettering Medical Center- Kettering- Ohio- UNITED STATES.Robin Coope:BC Cancer Agency- Vancouver- British Columbia- CANADA.Brad Gill:Department of Medical Physics- BC Cancer Agency- Vancouver- British Columbia- CANADA.Vitali V Moiseenko:Department of Radiation Medicine and Applies Sciences- University of California San Diego- La Jolla- California- UNITED STATES.

Nevertheless, the use of this technique is often limited by its lack of sensitivity, which can prevent the observation of surfaces, defects or insensitive isotopes. Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) has been shown to improve by one to three orders of magnitude the sensitivity of NMR experiments on materials under Magic-Angle Spinning (MAS), at static magnetic field B\u202f≥\u202f5\u202fT, conditions allowing for the acquisition of high-resolution spectra. The field of DNP-NMR spectroscopy of materials has undergone a rapid development in the last ten years, spurred notably by the availability of commercial DNP-NMR systems. We provide here an in-depth overview of MAS DNP-NMR studies of materials at high B field. After a historical perspective of DNP of materials, we describe the DNP transfers under MAS, the transport of polarization by spin diffusion and the various contributions to the overall sensitivity of DNP-NMR experiments. We discuss the design of tailored polarizing agents and the sample preparation in the case of materials. We present the DNP-NMR hardware and the influence of key experimental parameters, such as microwave power, magnetic field, temperature and MAS frequency. We give an overview of the isotopes that have been detected by this technique, and the NMR methods that have been combined with DNP.

The goal of this study was to design a pulsed ultrasound (US) exposure scheme that reduced intracranial constructive interference and tissue heating, and maintained thrombolytic efficacy relative to continuous wave (CW) insonation. Three 220-kHz US schemes were evaluated, two pulsed insonation schemes (15 cycles, 68 µs pulse duration, 33% or 62.5% duty cycle) and an intermittent CW insonation scheme (50 s active, 30 s quiescent) over a 30-min treatment period. An in silico study using a finite-difference model of transcranial US propagation was performed to estimate the intracranial acoustic field and temperature rise in the skull for each insonation scheme. In vitro measurements with flow were performed to assess thrombolysis using time-lapse microscopy. Intracranial constructive interference was not reduced with pulsed US using a pulse length of 15 cycles compared to intermittent CW US. The 33.3% duty cycle pulsed US scheme reduced heating in the temporal bone as much as 60% relative to the intermittent CW scheme. All insonation schemes promoted sustained stable cavitation in vitro and augmented thrombolysis compared to rt-PA alone (p&amp;lt;0.05). Ultraharmonic and harmonic cumulative energy over a 30-min treatment period was significantly higher (p&amp;lt;0.05) for the intermittent CW US scheme compared to either pulsed US scheme. Despite the difference in cavitation emissions, no difference was observed in the clot lysis between the three US schemes. These findings demonstrate that a 33.3% duty cycle pulsed US scheme with a 15 cycle burst can reduce bone heating and achieve equivalent thrombolytic efficacy as an intermittent CW scheme.,Robert Terence Kleven:Biomedical Engineering- University of Cincinnati- Cincinnati- Ohio- UNITED STATES.Kunal B Karani:Internal Medicine - Cardiovascular Diseases- University of Cincinnati- Cincinnati- UNITED STATES.Nuria G Salido:Internal Medicine - Cardiovascular Diseases- University of Cincinnati- Cincinnati- UNITED STATES.Himanshu Shekhar:Internal Medicine - Cardiovascular Diseases- University of Cincinnati- Cincinnati- UNITED STATES.Kevin J Haworth:Internal Medicine - Cardiovascular Diseases- University of Cincinnati- CVC 3939- 231 Albert Sabin Way- ML 0586- Cincinnati- 45267-0586- UNITED STATES.T Douglas Mast:Biomedical Engineering- University of Cincinnati- Cincinnati- Ohio- UNITED STATES.Dawit G Tadesse:Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology- Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center- Cincinnati- Ohio- UNITED STATES.Christy K Holland:Internal Medicine - Cardiovascular Diseases- University of Cincinnati- Cincinnati- UNITED STATES.

In 2 subsequent runs, the chickens were subjected to 1 of 4 dietary treatments with and without PCa and Phy supplementation. Sanitized eggs were hatched in 8 germfree isolators, and a minimum of 9 male Ross 308 chickens were placed in each pen (total 16 pens). Treatments implemented on day 10 included gamma-irradiated diets without (PCa-; 4.1 g P and 6.2 g Ca/kg DM) or with (PCa+; 6.9 g P and 10.4 g Ca/kg DM) monosodium phosphate and limestone supplementation and without (Phy-) or with (Phy+) 1,500 FTU Phy/kg feed in a factorial arrangement. On day 15, digesta was collected from different sections of the intestinal tract and analyzed for InsP isomers and myo-inositol. The isolators did not remain germfree, but analysis of contaminants and results of InsP degradation indicated no or minor effects of the identified contaminants. Prececal InsP6 disappearance was 42% with the PCa-Phy- treatment and 17% with PCa+Phy-. No InsP3-4 isomers were found in the digesta of the terminal ileum in PCa-Phy-. The concentration of myo-inositol in the ileal digesta from PCa-Phy- (6.1 μmol/g DM) was significantly higher than that from PCa+Phy- (1.7 μmol/g DM), suggesting rapid degradation of the lower InsP isomers by mucosal phosphatases and their inhibition by PCa. Phytase supplementation increased InsP6 disappearance and prevented inhibitory effects of PCa supplements (72% in PCa-Phy+ and 67% in PCa+Phy+). However, PCa supplementation reduced the degradation of lower InsP isomers mainly in the posterior intestinal sections in the presence of Phy, resulting in significantly lower myo-inositol concentrations. It is concluded that mucosa-derived phosphatases might significantly contribute to InsP6 degradation in broiler chickens. The potential of mucosa-derived phosphatases to degrade InsP6 and lower InsP is markedly reduced by dietary PCa supplementation.,Vera Sommerfeld:Institute of Animal Science- University of Hohenheim- 70599 Stuttgart- Germany.Andrew G Van Kessel:Department of Animal and Poultry Science- University of Saskatchewan- Saskatoon- SK S7N 5A8- Canada.Henry L Classen:Department of Animal and Poultry Science- University of Saskatchewan- Saskatoon- SK S7N 5A8- Canada.Margit Schollenberger:Institute of Animal Science- University of Hohenheim- 70599 Stuttgart- Germany.Imke Kühn:AB Vista- 64293 Darmstadt- Germany.Markus Rodehutscord:Institute of Animal Science- University of Hohenheim- 70599 Stuttgart- Germany.

One medial population and one lateral population contain neurons that receive a remarkably large axon terminal from the utricular branch of the octaval nerve. Immunocytochemistry for connexin 35 (Cx35) was used to determine whether this connection includes electrical synapses. Although Cx35 was not localized to these large contacts, it was observed in the three other lateral dDO populations. Another first-order nucleus, the dorsal portion of the anterior octaval nucleus (dAO), primitively projects to the auditory midbrain in jawed fishes and contains neurons positive for Cx35. Utricular branch terminals were coincident with some Cx35 puncta in dDO and dAO.

The aim was to analyze the adaptations induced by 2 types of sports: one involving intensive use of trunk muscles (i.\u2009e., judo), and one known to induce high aerobic capacity in the whole body (i.\u2009e., cycling). Eleven judokas, 10 cyclists and 9 healthy untrained young men performed trunk extension exercises on an isokinetic dynamometer. During the first session, muscle strength was assessed during maximal trunk extension. During a second session, a 5-min exercise was performed to investigate aerobic responses with regard to trunk muscles. The near infrared spectroscopy technique and a gas exchange analyzer were used continuously to evaluate mechanical efficiency, V̇O on-set kinetics, trunk muscle deoxygenation and blood volume. Judokas showed greater trunk strength and mechanical efficiency (p<0.05). Cyclists presented faster V̇O on-set kinetics (p<0.05) and greater muscle deoxygenation and blood volume compared to untrained men (p<0.001).

Although carotenoids are largely known in the context of food science, nutrition, and health as natural colorants and precursors of vitamin A (VA) evidence has accumulated that even those that cannot be converted to VA may be involved in health-promoting biological actions. It is not surprising that carotenoids (most notably lutein) are among the bioactives for which the need to establish recommended dietary intakes (RDI) have been recently discussed. In this review, the importance of carotenoids (including apocarotenoids) and key derivatives (retinoids with VA activity) in agro-food with relevance to health is summarized. Furthermore, the "European Network to Advance Carotenoid Research and Applications in Agro-Food and Health (EUROCAROTEN)" (www.eurocaroten.eu, http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA15136) is introduced.

31189126,2019-06-12,England Endocr Connect 101598413 2049-3614,ACTH signalling and adrenal development: lessons from mouse models.,The melanocortin-2-receptor (MC2R), also known as the ACTH receptor, is a critical component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The importance of MC2R in adrenal physiology is exemplified by the condition familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD), a potentially fatal disease characterised by isolated cortisol deficiency. MC2R mutations cause ~25% of cases. The discovery of a MC2R accessory protein MRAP, mutations of which account for ~20% of FGD, has provided insight into MC2R trafficking and signalling. MRAP is a single transmembrane domain accessory protein highly expressed in the adrenal gland and essential for MC2R expression and function. Mouse models helped elucidate the action of ACTH. The Mc2r knockout (Mc2r-/-) mice was the first mouse model developed to have adrenal insufficiency with deficiencies in glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and catecholamines. We recently reported the generation of the Mrap-/- mice which better mimics the human FGD phenotype with isolated glucocorticoid deficiency alone. The adrenal glands of adult Mrap-/- mice were grossly dysmorphic with a thickened capsule, deranged zonation and deranged WNT4/beta-catenin and sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway signalling. Collectively, these mouse models of FGD highlight the importance of ACTH and MRAP in adrenal progenitor cell regulation, cortex maintenance and zonation.,Tatiana Novoselova:T Novoselova- Centre for Endocrinilogy- Wiliam Harvey Research Institute- Queen Mary University of London- London- EC1M 6BQ- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Peter King:P King- London- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Leo Guasti:L Guasti- London- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Louise A Metherell:L Metherell- London- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Adrian J L Clark:A Clark- London- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Li F Chan:L Chan- London- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
31189115,2019-06-12,United States Cell Rep 101573691  ,Systematic Analysis of Drug Vulnerabilities Conferred by Tumor Suppressor Loss.,In addition to oncogene inhibition, targeting tumor suppressor deficiency could provide potential venues for precision cancer medicine. However, the full spectrum of drug vulnerability conferred by tumor suppressor loss remains unclear. We systematically analyzed how loss of 59 common tumor suppressors each affected cellular sensitivity to 26 different types of anticancer therapeutics. The experiments were performed in a one-gene, one-drug manner, and through such a large gene-drug iteration study, we were able to generate a drug sensitivity map that describes numerous examples of drug resistance or hypersensitivity conferred by tumor suppressor loss. We further delineated the mechanisms of several gene-drug interactions, showing that loss of tumor suppressors could modify drug sensitivity at various steps of drug action. This systematic drug sensitivity map highlights potential drug vulnerabilities associated with tumor suppressor loss, which may help expand precision cancer medicine on the basis of tumor suppressor status.,Hongyu Ding:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Jie Zhao:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Yanli Zhang:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Jiao Yu:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Mingxian Liu:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Xiaoxi Li:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Liang Xu:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Minghui Lin:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Chuan Liu:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Zhengjin He:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Shishuang Chen:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.Hai Jiang:State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology- Key Laboratory of Systems Biology- Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network- CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science- Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology- Chinese Academy of Sciences- University of Chinese Academy of Sciences- 320 Yueyang Road- Shanghai 200031- China.

This study evaluated the effects of ADX on ICV (lateral ventricle) injection of insulin-induced changes on food intake, mRNA expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides [insulin receptor (InsR), proopiomelanocortin, cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), agouti-related protein, neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), corticotrophin-releasing factor in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus], and hypothalamic protein content of insulin signaling related molecules [insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1, protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP1B) and T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP)]. Compared with sham animals, ADX increased hypothalamic content of pJNK/JNK, PTP1B and TCPTP, as well as decreased mRNA expression of InsR, and corticosterone (B) treatment reversed these effects. Insulin central injection enhanced hypothalamic content of pAKT/AKT and CART mRNA expression, decreased NPY mRNA expression and food intake only in sham rats, without effects in ADX and ADX+B rats. Insulin did not alter hypothalamic phosphorylation of IRS1 and ERK1/2 in the three experimental groups. These data demonstrate that ADX reduces the expression of InsR and increases insulin counter-regulators in the hypothalamus, as well as ADX abolishes hypophagia, activation of hypothalamic AKT pathway and changes in CART and NPY mRNA expression in the ARC induced by insulin. Thus, the higher levels of insulin counter-regulatory proteins and lower expression of InsR in the hypothalamus are likely to underlie impaired insulin-induced hypophagia and responses in the hypothalamus after ADX.,Ernane Torres Uchoa:E Uchoa- Department of Physiological Sciences - State University of Londrina- UEL - Londrina- Brazil.Paula Beatriz Marangon:P Marangon- Physiology- Ribeirao Preto Medical School - University Of Sao Paulo- Ribeirao Preto- Brazil.Rodrigo Rorato:R Rorato- Physiology- Ribeirao Preto Medical School - University Of Sao Paulo- Ribeirao Preto- Brazil.Silvia G Ruginsk:S Ruginsk- Physiology - Ribeirao Preto Medical School - University Of Sao Paulo- Ribeirao Preto- Brazil.Lucas Kniess Debarba:L Debarba- Physiology- Ribeirao Preto Medical School - University of Sao Paulo- Ribeirao Preto- Brazil.José Antunes-Rodrigues:J Antunes-Rodrigues- Physiology- Ribeirao Preto Medical School - University of Sao Paulo- Ribeirao Preto- Brazil.Lucila Leico Kagohara Elias:L Elias- Physiology- Ribeirao Preto Medical School - University of Sao Paulo- Ribeirao Preto- Brazil.
31189164,2019-06-12,Switzerland Cardiology 1266406 0008-6312,Diagnostic Value of Different Noninvasive Criteria of Latent Myocarditis in Comparison with Myocardial Biopsy.,OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study was to quantify the value of various clinical, laboratory, and instrumental signs in the diagnosis of myocarditis in comparison with morphological studies of the myocardium.METHODS:In 100 patients (65 men, 44.7 ± 12.5 years old) with "idiopathic" arrhythmias (n = 20) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM; n = 80), we performed the following: 71 endomyocardial biopsies (EMB), 13 intraoperative biopsies, 5 studies of explanted hearts, and 11 autopsies with virus investigation (real-time PCR) of the blood and myocardium. Antiheart antibodies (AHA) were also measured as well as cardiac CT (n = 45), MRI (n = 25), and coronary angiography (n = 47). The comparison group included 50 patients (25 men, 53.7 ± 11.7 years old) with noninflammatory heart diseases who underwent open heart surgery.RESULTS:Active/borderline myocarditis was diagnosed in 76.0% of the study group and in 21.6% of patients in the comparison group (p < 0.001). The myocardial viral genome was observed more frequently in patients in the comparison group than in the study group (65.0 and 40.2%; p < 0.01). We evaluated the diagnostic value of noninvasive markers of myocarditis. The panel of AHA had the greatest importance in the identification of myocarditis: sensitivity was 81.5%, and the positive and negative predictive values were 75.0 and 60.5%. This defined the diagnostic value of noninvasive markers of myocarditis and established a diagnostic algorithm providing an individual assessment of the likelihood of myocarditis development.CONCLUSIONS:AHA have the greatest significance in the diagnosis of latent myocarditis in patients with "idiopathic" arrhythmias and DCM. The use of a complex of noninvasive criteria allows the probability of myocarditis to be estimated and the indications for EMB to be determined.,Olga Blagova:I.M.

Beraprost sodium (BPS) has been shown to be effective in patients with pulmonary hypertension. However, the effect of BPS on O2-sensitive KV channels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) remains unclear. In the present study, the effect of BPS on rats with HPH was observed, and the influence of BPS on the expression and function of O2-sensitive KV channels in PASMCs was investigated. The results revealed that BPS reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure, suppressed right ventricular hypertrophy, and attenuated the remodeling of pulmonary arteries in rats exposed to discontinuous hypoxia for 4 weeks (8 h/day). This was accompanied with the significantly upregulated expression of KV channel α-subunits (KV1.2, KV1.5 and KV2.1) and O2-sensitive voltage-gated K+ (KV) channel current (IK(V)) in small pulmonary arteries in HPH model rats, as well as in hypoxia-induced PASMCs. Furthermore, in vitrostudies have revealed that the upregulation of BPS on O2-sensitive KV channels was significantly inhibited after treatment with prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype EP4 antagonist GW627368X. Taken together, these results suggest that BPS attenuates the development of HPH through the upregulation of O2-sensitive KV channels, which was probably via the EP4 receptor-related pathway.,Hua Tian:Department of Cardiovascular Medicine- The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University- Xi'an- China.Fenling Fan:Department of Cardiovascular Medicine- The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University- Xi'an- China.Jie Geng:Department of Cardiovascular Medicine- The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University- Xi'an- China.Jizhao Deng:Department of Cardiology- Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital- Xi'an- China.Hongyan Tian:Department of Cardiovascular Medicine- The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University- Xi'an- China- tianhongyan_xjtu@163.com.

Patients treated with digitalis were compared to patients without digitalis treatment. The primary prognostic outcome was first recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses were applied.RESULTS:A total of 394 ICD recipients with AF and/or HF was included (26% with digitalis treatment and 74% without). Digitalis treatment was associated with decreased freedom from recurrent ventricular tachy-arrhythmias (HR = 1.423; 95% CI 1.047-1.934; p = 0.023). Accordingly, digitalis treatment was associated with decreased freedom from appropriate ICD therapies (HR = 1.622; 95% CI 1.166-2.256; p = 0.004) and, moreover, higher rates of rehospitalization (38 vs. 21%; p = 0.001) and all-cause mortality (33 vs. 20%; p = 0.011).CONCLUSIONS:Among ICD recipients suffering from AF and HF, treatment with digitalis was associated with increased rates of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and ICD therapies.

31189174,2019-06-12,Switzerland Kidney Blood Press Res 9610505 1420-4096,Association between Serum Magnesium and Erythropoietin Responsiveness in Hemodialysis Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study.,OBJECTIVE:As shown in the China Health and Nutrition Survey, serum magnesium is associated with anemia. However, the roles of magnesium in anemia and erythropoietin (EPO) responsiveness remain unclear in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. This study aims to investigate the level of serum magnesium and its relationship with EPO responsiveness in MHD patients.METHODS:A total of 307 MHD patients were recruited for this survey. Laboratory data and anthropometrics were collected. EPO responsiveness was evaluated by the erythropoietin resistance index (ERI). The subjects were divided into 3 groups according to serum magnesium concentrations (group A, the lowest tertile; group B, the middle tertiles; and group C, the highest tertile). Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted to evaluate the factors that may be associated with EPO responsiveness.RESULTS:The mean serum magnesium level was significantly higher than normal levels in MHD patients, while no hypomagnesemia was observed. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, serum albumin, and magnesium levels were correlated with a high ERI. The OR of a high ERI was found to be 2.57 (95% CI 1.330-4.975, p = 0.005) for group A and 1.66 (95% CI 0.878--3.140, p > 0.05) for group B compared with the OR for group C.CONCLUSIONS:Serum magnesium levels were higher than normal levels in MHD patients. A high serum magnesium level was correlated with good EPO responsiveness and was therefore suggested to be a protective factor for EPO hyporesponsiveness.,Ling Yu:Department of Blood Purification- Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital- Capital Medical University- Beijing- China.Jinghong Song:Department of Blood Purification- Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital- Capital Medical University- Beijing- China.Xiangxue Lu:Department of Blood Purification- Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital- Capital Medical University- Beijing- China.Yuan Zu:Department of Blood Purification- Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital- Capital Medical University- Beijing- China.Han Li:Department of Blood Purification- Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital- Capital Medical University- Beijing- China- hanli@ccmu.edu.cn.Shixiang Wang:Department of Blood Purification- Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital- Capital Medical University- Beijing- China.

In this article, the method and clinical implications of the mortality hazard ratio analyses of various clinical parameters in the 2017 registry report have been described, with the inclusion of data on four additional parameters. The mortality risk based on clinical parameters was analyzed only for hemodialysis patients. The number of registered patients with laboratory data was 13,943 (8,446 male and 5,497 female patients), and death was reported in 3,139 patients. Analysis of the effects of various clinical parameters on mortality was performed using non-linear Cox proportional hazard model with the R statistics program. For all clinical parameters, univariate and adjusted multivariate hazard ratio analyses were performed. Analysis of the mortality hazard ratio showed that low body mass index, low hemoglobin, low serum albumin, low serum phosphorus, and low urea reduction ratio were associated with a significantly increased mortality risk, whereas paradoxically high serum creatinine levels were associated with low mortality risk.,Dong-Chan Jin:Department of Internal Medicine- College of Medicine- The Catholic University of Korea- Seoul- Korea.

There was a significant trend (p < 0.0001) of greater mean (SD) AoD across the three OSA groups: normal (n = 87), 3.13 cm (0.35); mild (n = 215), 3.25 (0.34); moderate to severe (n = 406), 3.37 (0.36). In adjusted analysis, participants with moderate to severe OSA had a greater mean AoD compared with the normal group: adjusted mean difference (95% CI), 0.12 cm (0.05, 0.20), p = 0.002. This AoD gradient was observed in women but not in men (p for interaction = 0.02). No differences were found in AoPWV or AAD among the OSA groups.CONCLUSIONS:In a diverse community-based cohort, moderate to severe OSA (vs. no OSA) was associated with a larger ascending AoD in women.,Younghoon Kwon:Department of Medicine- University of Virginia School of Medicine- Charlottesville- Virginia- USA- yk2j@virginia.edu.Jeongok Logan:School of Nursing- University of Virginia- Charlottesville- Virginia- USA.Susan Redline:Brigham and Women's Hospital- Harvard Medical School- Boston- Massachusetts- USA.Daniel Duprez:Department of Medicine- University of Minnesota School of Medicine- Minneapolis- Minnesota- USA.David R Jacobs:School of Public Health- University of Minnesota- Minneapolis- Minnesota- USA.Pamela Ouyang:Department of Medicine- Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine- Baltimore- Maryland- USA.W Greg Hundley:School of Medicine- Virginia Commonwealth University- Richmond- Virginia- USA.Joao Lima:Department of Medicine- Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine- Baltimore- Maryland- USA.David A Bluemke:Department of Radiology- University of Wisconsin School of Medicine- Madison- Wisconsin- USA.Pamela L Lutsey:School of Public Health- University of Minnesota- Minneapolis- Minnesota- USA.

A dataset was compiled, registering demographic and clinical features, biochemical analysis at onset, and also the therapies received 3 months prior to EGPA diagnose. Statistical analyses were subsequently conducted dividing patients in 2 groups based on ANCA positivity and comparing them.RESULTS:Two groups were clearly identified by ANCA serology and specific organ involvement in accordance with literature reports; however, our data underline for the first time the association between anti-leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) and ANCA positivity. The group of previously treated patients presents an OR of 6.42 to be ANCA positive. This finding could be attributed to an imbalanced stimulation of leukotriene receptors, inducing both mast cells activation and an increased neutrophil extracellular traps release from neutrophils.CONCLUSIONS:Despite the limitations of this retrospective study, the association between LTRAs and ANCA antibodies elucidates the mechanism by which innate immunity is directly involved in tolerance breakdown and autoantibodies production. Validation of our results with targeted studies could clarify the differences between ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative patients with important consequences on the use of some drug classes in the treatment of EGPA and asthmatic subjects.,Jan Walter Schroeder:Unit of Allergology and Immunology- ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda Ca' Granda- Milan- Italy.Marco Folci:Department of Internal Medicine- Division of Clinical Immunology- Humanitas Research Hospital- Rozzano- Italy.Laura Michelina Losappio:Unit of Allergology and Immunology- ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda Ca' Granda- Milan- Italy.Michel Chevallard:Unit of Allergology and Immunology- ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda Ca' Granda- Milan- Italy.:DISCCO- University of Study of Milan- Milan- Italy.:Renato Alberto Sinico:Department of Medicine and Surgery- Nephrology Unit- University of Milano-Bicocca- Monza- Italy.Corrado Mirone:Unit of Allergology and Immunology- ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda Ca' Granda- Milan- Italy.Fabrizio De Luca:Unit of Allergology and Immunology- ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda Ca' Granda- Milan- Italy.Michele Nichelatti:Service of Biostatistics- ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda Ca' Granda- Milan- Italy.Elide Anna Pastorello:Unit of Allergology and Immunology- ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda Ca' Granda- Milan- Italy- elide.pastorello@ospedaleniguarda.it.:DISCCO- University of Study of Milan- Milan- Italy- elide.pastorello@ospedaleniguarda.it.:

However, little is known about the dynamics of microbial communities and the level of microbiota transmission after cohousing. We extensively analyzed the fecal microbiota in Jackson and Taconic C57BL/6 mice to study horizontal transmission after weaning. Changes in the microbiota were clearly detected on day 3, almost plateaued on day 7, and resulted in near-comparable composition by day 28 after cohousing. Notably, the transmission of bacterial species was asymmetric in kinetics and abundance, resulting in a microbiota that is more similar to that of Jackson mice than Taconic. Several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) increased their abundance rapidly after cohousing in Taconic mice whereas several OTUs including two mucus-associated bacteria increased their abundance with delayed kinetics in Jackson mice. These studies provide insight into the dynamics and normalization of the microbiota during horizontal transmission.,Roberta Caruso:Department of Pathology- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA; Rogel Cancer Center- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA.Masashi Ono:Department of Pathology- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA.Marie E Bunker:Department of Pathology- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA; Rogel Cancer Center- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA.Gabriel Núñez:Department of Pathology- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA; Rogel Cancer Center- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA.Naohiro Inohara:Department of Pathology- University of Michigan Medical School- Ann Arbor- MI 48109- USA.

Their postprocedure healing involves healing by secondary intention. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the use of diamond fraise dermabrasion to improve scars and the use of wire loop electrocautery to treat rhinophyma surface irregularities. Both techniques are minimally invasive and low cost, and at the same time, can significantly improve facial skin deformities. An advantage in using wire loop electrocautery for rhinophyma excision is that it is a simple, economic, and very effective technique to sculpt the nose, with minimal intraoperative bleeding. With dermabrasion, pretreatment and postregimens can help improve postprocedure results. Future efforts to modulate the healing from both of these techniques include the potential use of topical growth factors, autologous platelet-rich plasma, or using stem cells to accelerate collagen formation and reepithelization during the postprocedure period.,David B Hom:Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery- Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery- Department of Surgery- University of California San Diego School of Medicine- San Diego- California.Jeffrey Harmon:Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery- University of Cincinnati College of Medicine- Cincinnati- Ohio.

Seventy trained athletes (56 males, 14 females) wore the Polar OH1 armband and the H7 chest belt during training. A total of 390 h and 38 min of recording were compared using a 20-bpm window to assess data quality, and Bland-Altman agreements and ICC analyses were used to test accuracy. Linear regression analyses evaluated the HR accuracy and correlation with skin tone. Training loads (TRIMPs) were compared for each session. Reliability was high for endurance sports (>99%) and lower for sports involving arm movements (92~95%). Biases were slightly negative for all sports, whereas widths of limits of agreement varied from 7-20bpm. Bland-Altman agreements were all under 5% except tennis, kayak and fitness. HR accuracy was positively correlated to skin tone (p<0.05). Finally, TRIMPs from the OH1 device were inferior to criterion's (except walking and soccer), within a 3% range from reference. Hence, OH1 represents a valid tool to monitor instantaneous HR and training load, especially for endurance sports.,Eric Hermand:EA3596 ACTES 'Acclimatation au Climat Tropical- Exercice et Santé'- Universite des Antilles et de la Guyane- Pointe-a-Pitre- Guadeloupe.:EA6310 HAVAE 'Handicap- Activité- Vieillissement- Autonomie- Exercice'- Universite de Limoges- Limoges- France.:Johan Cassirame:EA 4660 "Culture- sport- santé et société"- Universite de Franche-Comte- Besancon- France.:EA7507 'Performance- santé- métrologie- Société'- Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne- Reims- France.:Gaël Ennequin:EA4267 PEPITE 'Pathologies et épithéliums : prévention- innovation- traitements- évaluations'- Universite de Franche-Comte- Besancon- France.Olivier Hue:EA3596 ACTES 'Acclimatation au Climat Tropical- Exercice et Santé'- Universite des Antilles et de la Guyane- Pointe-a-Pitre- Guadeloupe.

In this work, the structures and properties of (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 (T=Hf, Nb, and V) are studied using first-principles calculations. The obtained structural parameters are in good accordance with previously reported data in the literature. Based on the phase stability investigations, the potentially stable layered (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 (T=Hf, Nb, and V) solid solutions are proposed, which confirms that Zr3Al3C5 and Hf3Al3C5 can be synthesized. The substitution, especially with group VB transitional metals, endows layered (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 series with greatly enhanced mechanical and thermal properties. It is indicated that the bulk modulus B of all the three systems increase with increasing substitution concentration x. A significant increase in the ratio of bulk modulus to shear modulus, B/G, is found with increasing V concentration, which corresponds to the improved ductility. Moreover, solid solutions with V substitution, (Zr1-xVx)3Al3C5, yield a larger effect on thermal conductivity with respect to x, indicating flexible modulation of the thermal conductivity of (Zr1-xVx)3Al3C5 by V substitution can be achieved, which may promote them as promising coating materials. The intrinsic mechanism involved in the enhancements of the mechanical and thermal properties were elucidated through thorough electronic band structure analysis. The difference in the electronic structure and bonding between Zr and T in (Zr1-xTx)3Al3C5 compounds are shown to account for the abnormal variations in their properties.,Hui Tian:State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials- College of Physics- Jilin University- Changchun- Jilin- CHINA.Kan Luo:Engineering Laboratory of Specialty Fibers and Nuclear Energy Materials- Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences- Ningbo- Zhejiang- CHINA.Jiajian Lang:Engineering Laboratory of Specialty Fibers and Nuclear Energy Materials-- Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences- Ningbo- Zhejiang- CHINA.Yuhong Zhou:Engineering Laboratory of Specialty Fibers and Nuclear Energy Materials- Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences- Ningbo- Zhejiang- CHINA.Tao Yan:Engineering Laboratory of Specialty Fibers and Nuclear Energy Materials- Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences- Ningbo- Zhejiang- CHINA.Nianxiang Qiu:Engineering Laboratory of Specialty Fibers and Nuclear Energy Materials- Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences- Ningbo- Zhejiang- CHINA.Jian Zhang:State Key Laboratory of Superhard Materials- College of Physics- Jilin University- Changchun- Jilin- CHINA.Qing Huang:Engineering Laboratory of Specialty Fibers and Nuclear Energy Materials- Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences- Ningbo- Zhejiang- CHINA.Shiyu Du:Engineering Laboratory of Specialty Fibers and Nuclear Energy Materials- Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering Chinese Academy of Sciences- Ningbo- Zhejiang- CHINA.

A total of 480 slow feathering Cobb × Cobb 500 male broilers were randomly distributed into 10 treatments with 8 replicates of 6 birds each. Birds were fed a common starter to 14 D post-hatch. The experimental diets were provided subsequently until 25 D, which were a conventional corn-soy basal diet (CS) and a corn-soy diet displaced with 40% of corn (CN). These were fed as-is or supplemented with 40, 80, 120, or 160 kilo-Novo α-amylase units (KNU)/kg. Dietary treatments were distributed factorially as a 2 × 5 arrangement (diet type vs. amylase). Samples of feed, excreta, and ileal digesta were analyzed for determination of ileal digestible energy (IDE), ME, total tract retention, and digestibility of dry matter, protein, and fat. No interactions between diet type and amylase were observed. The CN diet had lower (P < 0.05) energy utilization and nutrient digestibility when compared to the CS diet. AMEn and IDE increased (P < 0.05) by 110 and 207 kcal/kg, respectively, when CS and CN diets were supplemented with 80 KNU/kg. The amylase added to the CS diet led to quadratic increases (P < 0.05) on growth performance, IDE, AME, and AMEn, as well as in dry matter, protein, and fat digestibility. Energy utilization and crude protein digestibility were linearly increased (P < 0.05) when amylase was added to the CN diet or the extrapolated 100% of corn. In conclusion, energy utilization, digestibility of crude protein, fat, and dry matter increased with amylase supplementation in corn-soy-based diets. When amylase was tested in a complete diet having 53.6% corn, 100 and 105 KNU/kg maximized AMEn and IDE, respectively; however, the maximum energy response in the CN diet or 100% of corn was not achieved until 160 KNU/kg, suggesting an association between amylase dose optimization and dietary starch concentration.,C Stefanello:Department of Animal Science- Federal University of Santa Maria- Av.

Recent studies revealed that TH induces browning of white adipose tissue, possibly contributing to the observed hyperthermia in hyperthyroid patients and potentially providing metabolic benefits. Here, we show that browning by TH requires TH-receptor β and occurs independently of the sympathetic nervous system. The beige fat, however, lacks sufficient adrenergic stimulation and is not metabolically activated despite high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Studies at different environmental temperatures reveal that TH instead causes hyperthermia by actions in skeletal muscle combined with a central body temperature set-point elevation. Consequently, the metabolic and thermogenic effects of systemic hyperthyroidism were maintained in UCP1 knockout mice, demonstrating that neither beige nor brown fat contributes to the TH-induced hyperthermia and elevated glucose consumption, and underlining that the mere presence of UCP1 is insufficient to draw conclusions on the therapeutic potential of browning agents.,Kornelia Johann:Internal Medicine I- Molecular Endocrinology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Anna Lena Cremer:Multimodal Imaging of Brain Metabolism- Max Planck Institute of Metabolism Research- 50931 Cologne- Germany.Alexander W Fischer:Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology- University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf- 20246 Hamburg- Germany.Markus Heine:Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology- University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf- 20246 Hamburg- Germany.Eva Rial Pensado:NeurObesity Group- Department of Physiology- CIMUS- University of Santiago de Compostela-Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria- Santiago de Compostela 15782- Spain; CIBER Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBERobn)- Santiago de Compostela 15782- Spain.Julia Resch:Internal Medicine I- Molecular Endocrinology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Sebastian Nock:Internal Medicine I- Molecular Endocrinology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Samuel Virtue:University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories- Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science- Cambridge CB2 0QQ- UK.Lisbeth Harder:Internal Medicine I- Molecular Endocrinology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Rebecca Oelkrug:Internal Medicine I- Molecular Endocrinology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Mariana Astiz:Institute of Neurobiology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Georg Brabant:Internal Medicine I- Molecular Endocrinology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Amy Warner:University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories- Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science- Cambridge CB2 0QQ- UK.Antonio Vidal-Puig:University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories- Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science- Cambridge CB2 0QQ- UK.Henrik Oster:Institute of Neurobiology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.Anita Boelen:Laboratory of Endocrinology- Amsterdam University Medical Centers- 1105 Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Miguel López:NeurObesity Group- Department of Physiology- CIMUS- University of Santiago de Compostela-Instituto de Investigación Sanitaria- Santiago de Compostela 15782- Spain; CIBER Fisiopatología de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBERobn)- Santiago de Compostela 15782- Spain.Joerg Heeren:Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology- University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf- 20246 Hamburg- Germany.Jeffrey W Dalley:Department of Psychology- University of Cambridge- Cambridge CB2 3EB- UK; Department of Psychiatry- University of Cambridge- Cambridge CB2 2QQ- UK.Heiko Backes:Multimodal Imaging of Brain Metabolism- Max Planck Institute of Metabolism Research- 50931 Cologne- Germany.Jens Mittag:Internal Medicine I- Molecular Endocrinology- Center of Brain- Behavior and Metabolism- University of Lübeck- 23562 Lübeck- Germany.

The study was carried out on 84 Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) chickens, between 1st and 21st day of their life. Animals were divided into 4 groups fed ad libitum: 3 with an addition of synbiotics A, B or C and a control group (feed with no additives). Synbiotics contained Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and inulin (prebiotic). Rearing parameters were determined taking into account undesirable clinical and sectional symptoms, daily mortality and body weight of birds. In addition, chicken blood parameters were determined based on haematological, biochemical and serological tests. Samples of the intestinal content and of the excreta constituted a material for research aimed at determination of the dominant chicken gut microbiota. On the basis of the conducted investigation, it was found that synbiotics met the basic requirements for this type of formulas regarding the safety of use and had a positive effect on the health of chickens. Therefore, further research is being carried out on the application of these formulas in large-scale production.

Currently, however, there is no recommendation for the best optimization method. This study aimed to compare the long-term clinical outcomes of 4 different CRT optimization methods.METHODS:One hundred and twenty-four consecutive CRT patients with severe heart failure and left bundle-branch block configuration were randomly assigned into four groups to undergo AV/VV delay optimization through echocardiogram (ECHO; n = 30), electrocardiogram (ECG; n = 32), QuickOpt algorithm (n = 28), and nominal AV/VV (n = 36) groups. Patients were followed up and underwent examinations, including New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac functional classification, 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and echocardiography, at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. The patients' survival and clinical outcomes were compared among the four groups.RESULTS:Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that the median survival was the same in the 4 groups: ECHO, 43 months; ECG, 44 months; QuickOpt, 44 months, and nominal, 41 months. At the 6-month follow-up, the reduction in left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was significantly less in the nominal group (-1.91 ± 2.58 mm) than that in the other three groups (ECHO: -3.70 ± 2.78 mm, p = 0.012; ECG: -3.53 ± 3.14 mm, p = 0.020; QuickOpt: -3.46 ± 2.65 mm, p = 0.032); 6MWD was significantly shorter in the nominal group (87.88 ± 34.76 m) than that in the other three groups (ECHO: 120.63 ± 56.93 m, p = 0.006; ECG: 114.97 ± 54.95 m, p = 0.020; QuickOpt: 114.57 ± 35.41 m, p = 0.027). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly increased in ECHO (7.23 ± 2.76%, p = 0.010), ECG (8.50 ± 3.17%, p < 0.001), and QuickOpt (8.39 ± 2.90%, p < 0.001) compared with the nominal group (5.35 ± 2.59%). There were no significant differences among the groups in the aforementioned parameters at 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively.CONCLUSIONS:While LVEDD, LVEF, 6MWD, and NYHA were significantly improved in ECHO, ECG, and QuickOpt at 6 months, there were no significant improvements in any of the groups at 12, 24, and 48 months. These findings suggested that the long-term effect of the four CRT methods for heart failure was not significantly different.,Yu Zhang:Department of Cardiology- Shanghai Chest Hospital- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China- lqlk57@163.com.Qiang Xing:Department of Cardiology- Xinjiang Medical University Affiliated First Hospital- Urumqi- China.Jiang-Hua Zhang:Department of Cardiology- Xinjiang Medical University Affiliated First Hospital- Urumqi- China.Wei-Feng Jiang:Department of Cardiology- Shanghai Chest Hospital- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Mu Qin:Department of Cardiology- Shanghai Chest Hospital- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Xu Liu:Department of Cardiology- Shanghai Chest Hospital- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.

We queried demographic data from the electronic medical record and calculated travel time with ArcGIS. Multinomial logistic regression models estimated the association between travel time and attendance, adjusted for sociodemographic covariates.RESULTS:For every 10 minutes of additional travel time, women were 1.05 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.08,  < 0.001) times as likely to arrive late and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01-1.04,  < 0.001) times as likely to cancel appointments than arrive on time. Travel time did not significantly affect a patient's likelihood of not showing for appointments. Non-Hispanic black patients were 71% more likely to arrive late and 51% more likely to not show for appointments than non-Hispanic white patients ( < 0.05). Publicly insured women were 28% more likely to arrive late to appointments and 82% more likely to not show for appointments than privately insured women ( < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS:Changes to transportation availability alone may only modestly affect outcomes compared with strategically improving access for sociodemographically marginalized women.,Lauren Y Maldonado:Department of Maternal and Child Health- UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health- Chapel Hill- North Carolina.Kimberly E Fryer:Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill- Chapel Hill- North Carolina.Christine M Tucker:Department of Maternal and Child Health- UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health- Chapel Hill- North Carolina.Alison M Stuebe:Department of Maternal and Child Health- UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health- Chapel Hill- North Carolina.:Divsion of Maternal-Fetal Medicine- Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology- University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill- Chapel Hill- North Carolina.:

We exploited the physical properties of three input MQCA majority gate, where the fixed input of the majority gate is coupled ferromagnetically to one of the primary input operands. Subsequently, we propose a design methodology, mapping logic and micromagnetic software implementation, validation of the binary full adder architecture built using two-three inputs MQCA majority gates. In addition, we also analyzed our proposed design for switching errors to ensure bit stability and reliability. Our proposed design leads to 36% - 69% reduction in the number of nanomagnets, 50% - 75% reduction in the number of clock cycles and 33% - 50% reduction in the number of majority gate operations required for the binary full adder implementation compared to the state of art designs.,Santhosh Sivasubramani:Electrical Engineering- Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad- Hyderabad- Telangana- INDIA.Venkat Mattella:Electrical Engineering- Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad- Hyderabad- Telangana- INDIA.Chandrajit Pal:Electrical Engineering- Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad- Hyderabad- Telangana- INDIA.Amit Acharyya:Electrical Engineering- Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad- IITH Main Road- Near NH-65- Sangareddy-- Kandi-- Hyderabad- Telangana- 502285- INDIA.

Here, we performed small RNA-seq on Dicer1 knockdown (KD) oocytes in pig, and observed short interspersed nuclear elements 1B (SINE1B) derived endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs), termed SINE1B-siRNAs, were significantly decreased and their biogenesis was dependent on Dicer1 and transcript of SINE1B. Furthermore, by injection of mimics and inhibitors of the SINE1B-siRNAs into germinal vesicle-stage (GV-stage) oocytes, we found the maturation rate was significantly decreased by SINE1B-siRNAs, indicating the SINE1B-siRNAs are indispensible for in vitro maturation (IVM) of porcine oocyte. To figure out the mechanism, we checked the expression pattern and DNA methylation status of SINE1B during IVM of porcine oocytes, and demonstrated the SINE1B-siRNAs could repress SINE1B expression induced by hypomethylation at a post-transcriptional level. Our results suggest that during gametogenesis when the erasure of DNA methylation occurs, endo-siRNAs act as a chronic response to limit retrotransposon activation.,Qing-Ran Kong:Key Laboratory of Animal Cellular and Genetics Engineering of Heilongjiang Province- College of Life Science- Northeast Agricultural University- Harbin- 150030- Heilongjiang- PR China.

This paper aims to establish the construct validity of the VSS by testing the extent to which percentage intelligibility in single word speech and connected speech predicts VSS rating.METHODS:This is a secondary analysis of two sets of anonymised data collected for previous research. The full data set comprised 79 children with cerebral palsy from the US (n = 43) and the UK (n = 36): (43 boys, 36 girls); mean age 7.2 years (SD 3.3). Single word intelligibility was measured using the TOCS+ words for US children and Children's Speech Intelligibility Measure for the UK children. Connected speech intelligibility was measured from a subset of repeated sentences in TOCS+ for US children and picture description for the UK children. We used ordinal logistic regression to examine prediction of VSS rating by percentage single word and connected speech intelligibility scores in both samples.RESULTS:Percentage single word intelligibility and connected speech intelligibility predicted VSS rating in univariate and multivariate regression models for both the US and UK samples.CONCLUSIONS:Intelligibility predicts VSS for both single words and connected speech, establishing the construct validity of VSS.,Lindsay Pennington:Institute of Health and Society- Newcastle University- Newcastle upon Tyne- United Kingdom- lindsay.pennington@ncl.ac.uk.Katherine C Hustad:Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders- University of Wisconsin- Madison- Wisconsin- USA.:Waisman Center- University of Wisconsin- Madison- Wisconsin- USA.:

Diagnostic accuracy of FB (prothrombin time-derived method), WBC, ANC, and CRP were assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic curve.RESULTS:A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the study (27 NSAP, 17 uncomplicated, and 38 complicated appendicitides). WBC and ANC had moderate diagnostic accuracy for appendicitis versus NSAP (WBC: AUC 0.66, ANC: AUC 0.67). CRP and FB had good diagnostic accuracy for appendicitis versus NSAP (CRP: AUC 0.78, FB: AUC 0.77). WBC and ANC are not useful to discriminate complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis (WBC: AUC 0.43, ANC: AUC 0.45). CPR and FB had good diagnostic accuracy for complicated versus uncomplicated appendicitis (CRP: AUC 0.80, FB: AUC 0.73).CONCLUSIONS:CRP and FB are more useful than WBC and ANC to discriminate appendicitis from NSAP in preschool children. CRP and FB are especially useful to discriminate complicated from uncomplicated appendicitis and NSAP. In a child with suspected appendicitis, a plasma FB level (prothrombin time-derived method) >540 mg/dL is associated with an increased likelihood of complicated appendicitis.,Marcos Prada-Arias:Department of Pediatric Surgery- University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro- Vigo- Spain.:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute- Vigo- Spain.:Javier Gómez-Veiras:Department of Pediatric Surgery- University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro- Vigo- Spain.Ángel Salgado-Barreira:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute- Vigo- Spain.:Methodology and Statistics Unit- Galicia Sur Health Research Institute- Vigo- Spain.:José Luis Vázquez:Department of Radiology- University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro- Vigo- Spain.Margarita Montero-Sánchez:Department of Pediatric Surgery- University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro- Vigo- Spain.:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute- Vigo- Spain.:José Ramón Fernández-Lorenzo:Galicia Sur Health Research Institute- Vigo- Spain.:Department of Pediatrics- University Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro- Vigo- Spain.:

However, storage duration and use of anticoagulant K3-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) may interfere with these measurements.OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study was to measure the variability of MPV in obese patients following exposure to EDTA.METHODS:A total of 160 patients were divided into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI; normal: <25 kg/m2; overweight: 25-30 kg/m2; obese: >30 kg/m2). Blood was collected in sterile tubes containing K3-EDTA. Blood cell counts were obtained using the CELL-DYN Ruby system immediately and 1, 2, and 3 h after collection.RESULTS:MPV was found to be directly proportional to BMI. With the addition of EDTA, MPV was increased in the first hour after collection; MPV then decreased to levels that were lower than initial baseline measurements.CONCLUSIONS:K3-EDTA use alters platelet volume. The time from collection to measurement should be standardized to reduce MPV value variance. MPV should be determined within 1 h of collection to avoid anticoagulant use-related interference.,Renata V L Pinto:Laboratório Central- Hospital Universitário Pedro Ernesto- Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro- Rio de Janeiro- Brazil.Genilson Rodrigues:Laboratório de Farmacologia Celular e Molecular- Departamento de Biologia Celular- Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes- Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro- Rio de Janeiro- Brazil.Rafael L Simões:Laboratório de Farmacologia Celular e Molecular- Departamento de Biologia Celular- Instituto de Biologia Roberto Alcantara Gomes- Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro- Rio de Janeiro- Brazil.Luís Cristóvão Porto:Serviço de Patologia Clínica- Piquet Carneiro Policlínica- Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro- Rio de Janeiro- Brazil- luis.cristovaoporto@gmail.com.

The presence of harmonic components in the EEG signals during SSVEP suggests the non-linearity of the visual-system response to rhythmic stimulation, but the nature of this behavior has not been deeply understood. The aim of this study is the quantitative evaluation and characterization of this non-linear phenomenon and its interference with the physiological alpha rhythm by means of spectral and higher order spectral analysis.&amp;#13; Approach: EEG signals were acquired in a group of 12 healthy subjects during a pattern-reversal stimulation protocol at three different driving frequencies (7.5 Hz, 15 Hz and 24 Hz). Spectral power values were estimated, after Laplacian spatial filtering, to quantitatively evaluate the changes in the power of the individual alpha and stimulation frequencies related harmonic components. Bicoherence measure were employed to assess the presence of quadratic phase coupling (QPC) at each channel location.&amp;#13; Main results: Our analysis confirmed a strong non-linear response to the rhythmic stimulus principally over the parieto-occipital channel locations and a simultaneous significant alpha power suppression during 7.5 Hz and 15 Hz stimulation. A prominent sub-harmonic component characterized the resonance behavior of the 24 Hz stimulation.&amp;#13; Significance: The findings presented suggest that bicoherence is a useful tool for the identification of QPC interactions between stimulus-related frequency components within the same signal and the characterization of the non-linearity of SSVEP-induced harmonics generation. In addition, the applied methodology demonstrates the presence of coupled EEG rhythms (harmonics of the main oscillation) both in resting condition and during stimulation, with different characteristics in the distinct brain areas. &amp;#13.'},Stefania Coelli:Department of Electronics- Information and Bioengineering- Politecnico di Milano- Piazza Leonardo da Vinci- 32- Milano- 20133- ITALY.Giulia Tacchino:Politecnico di Milano Dipartimento di Elettronica Informazione e Bioingegneria- Milano- 20133- ITALY.Elisa Visani:Neurophysiopathology Department and Epilepsy Centre- Foundation IRCCS Carlo Besta Neurological Institute- Milano- Lombardia- ITALY.Ferruccio Panzica:Neurophysiopathology Department and Epilepsy Centre- Foundation IRCCS Carlo Besta Neurological Institute- Milano- Lombardia- ITALY.Silvana Franceschetti:Neurophysiopathology Department and Epilepsy Centre- Foundation IRCCS Carlo Besta Neurological Institute- Milano- Lombardia- ITALY.Anna Maria Bianchi:Department of Electronics- Information and Bioengineering- Politecnico di Milano- piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32- 20133 Milano- Milano- 20133- ITALY.

Here we describe a remarkable inversion of this paradigm, in which bacterial Tn7-like transposons have co-opted nuclease-deficient CRISPR-Cas systems to catalyze RNA-guided integration of mobile genetic elements into the genome. Programmable transposition of Vibrio cholerae Tn6677 in E. coli requires CRISPR- and transposon-associated molecular machineries, including a novel co-complex between Cascade and the transposition protein TniQ. Donor DNA integration occurs in one of two possible orientations at a fixed distance downstream of target DNA sequences, and can accommodate variable length genetic payloads. Deep sequencing experiments reveal highly specific, genome-wide DNA integration across dozens of unique target sites. This work provides the first example of a fully programmable, RNA-guided integrase and lays the foundation for genomic manipulations that obviate the requirements for double-strand breaks and homology-directed repair.,Sanne E Klompe:Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics- Columbia University- New York- NY- USA.Phuc L H Vo:Department of Pharmacology- Columbia University- New York- NY- USA.Tyler S Halpin-Healy:Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics- Columbia University- New York- NY- USA.Samuel H Sternberg:Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics- Columbia University- New York- NY- USA. shsternberg@gmail.com.

Free-text descriptions of incident reports may provide useful data to identify the connection between health information technology (HIT) usability flaws and patient safety.OBJECTIVE:This article examines the feasibility of using incident reports about HIT to learn about the usability flaws that affect patient safety. We posed three questions: (1) To what extent can we gain knowledge about usability issues from incident reports? (2) What types of usability flaws, related usage problems, and negative outcomes are reported in incidents reports? (3) What are the reported usability issues that give rise to patient safety issues?METHODS:A sample of 359 reports from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database was examined. Descriptions of usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes were extracted and categorized. A supplementary analysis was performed on the incidents which contained the full chain going from a usability flaw up to a patient safety issue to identify the usability issues that gave rise to patient safety incidents.RESULTS:A total of 249 reports were included. We found that incident reports can provide knowledge about usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes. Thirty-six incidents report how usability flaws affected patient safety (ranging from incidents without consequence, to death) involving electronic patient scales, imaging systems, and HIT for medication management. The most significant class of involved usability flaws is related to the reliability, the understandability, and the availability of the clinical information.CONCLUSIONS:Incidents reports involving HIT are an exploitable source of information to learn about usability flaws and their effects on patient safety. Results can be used to convince all stakeholders involved in the HIT system lifecycle that usability should be considered seriously to prevent patient safety incidents.,Romaric Marcilly:Univ.

Body Media activity monitors were worn by 47 healthy participants. AMS was defined by the Lake Louise symptom questionnaire. Venous blood samples were taken at sea level and approximately 48 h after high altitude exposure. AMS incidence was 34% (n=16/47) over the first 48 h and 40% (n=19/47) over 72 h. On day 2 at high altitude, individuals with AMS demonstrated a significantly greater increase in the percent change in physical activity metrics from baseline: total energy expenditure 19±13 vs. 5±7%, total steps 65±51 vs. 10±18%, metabolic equivalent of tasks 21±13 vs. 7±13%, and time spent performing moderate to vigorous physical activity 114±79 vs. 26±27% for individuals with AMS vs. no AMS, respectively, p<0.05. In addition, erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor were 1.69 and 1.75 times higher, respectively, in those with AMS.

31189131,2019-06-12,England J Endocrinol 0375363 0022-0795,Endothelial adenosine kinase deficiency ameliorates diet-induced insulin resistance.,Insulin resistance-related disorders are associated with endothelial dysfunction. Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for adenosine signaling in the regulation of endothelial function. Here, we identified a crucial role of endothelial adenosine kinase (ADK) in the regulation of insulin resistance. Feeding mice with a high-fat diet (HFD) markedly enhanced expression of endothelial Adk. Ablation of endothelial Adk in HFD fed mice improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, decreased hepatic steatosis, adipose inflammation, and adiposity, which were associated with improved arteriole vasodilation, decreased inflammation and increased adipose angiogenesis. Mechanistically, ADK inhibition or knockdown in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) elevated intracellular adenosine level and increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) activity, resulting in an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production. Antagonism of adenosine receptor A2b abolished ADK-knockdown- enhanced NOS3 expression in HUVECs. Additionally, increased phosphorylation of NOS3 in ADK-knockdown HUVECs was regulated by an adenosine receptor-independent mechanism. These data suggest that Adk-deficiency-elevated intracellular adenosine in endothelial cells ameliorates diet-induced insulin resistance and metabolic disorders, and this is associated with an enhancement of NO production caused by increased NOS3 expression and activation. Therefore, ADK is a potential target for prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders associated with insulin resistance.,Jiean Xu:J Xu- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Qiuhua Yang:Q Yang- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Xiaoyu Zhang:X Zhang- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Zhiping Liu:Z Liu- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Yapeng Cao:Y Cao- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Lina Wang:L Wang- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Yaqi Zhou:Y Zhou- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Xianqiu Zeng:X Zeng- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Qian Ma:Q Ma- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Yiming Xu:Y Xu- Cellular Biology and Anatomy- Augusta University Medical College of Georgia- Augusta- United States.Yong Wang:Y Wang- Cellular Biology and Anatomy- Augusta University Medical College of Georgia- Augusta- United States.Lei Huang:L Huang- Cardiovascular surgery- Peking University Shenzhen Hospital- Shenzhen- China.Zhen Han:Z Han- Cardiovascular surgery- Peking University Shenzhen Hospital- Shenzhen- China.Tao Wang:T Wang- Cardiovascular surgery- Peking University Shenzhen Hospital- Shenzhen- China.David Stepp:D Stepp- Vascular Biology Center- Augusta University- Augusta- United States.Zsolt Bagi:Z Bagi- Physiology- Augusta University- Augusta- United States.Chaodong Wu:C Wu- Nutrition & Food Sciences- Texas A&M University System- College Station- United States.Mei Hong:M Hong- Drug Discovery Center- Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology- Nanshan- China.Yuqing Huo:Y Huo- Vascular Biology Center- Augusta University- Augusta- United States.

Generic models are a novel innovation to efficiently address a critical PM evidence shortage and implementation barrier by enabling use of population-specific input values. This is a generic PM economic evaluation model proof-of-concept study for a pharmacogenomic use case.METHODS:An 8-step generic economic model development process was applied to the use case of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*15:02genotyping for prediction of carbamazepine-induced cutaneous reactions, with a user-friendly decision-making tool relying on user-provided input values. This generic model was transparently documented and validated, including cross-validation comparing cost-effectiveness results with 3 country-specific models.RESULTS:A generic pharmacogenomic use case cost-effectiveness model with decision-making tool was successfully developed and cross-validated using input values for 6 populations which produced consistent results for HLA-B*15:02 screening at country-specific cost-effectiveness threshold values. Differences between the generic and country-specific model results were largely due to differences in model structure and assumptions.CONCLUSIONS:This proof on concept demonstrates the feasibility of generic models to provide useful PM economic evidence, supporting their use as a pragmatic and timely approach to address a growing need.,Susan R Snyder:Department of Epidemiology and Health Services Research- Geisinger Health System- Danville- Pennsylvania- USA- srsnyder1@geisinger.edu.Jing Hao:Department of Epidemiology and Health Services Research- Geisinger Health System- Danville- Pennsylvania- USA.Larisa H Cavallari:Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research- University of Florida- Gainesville- Florida- USA.Zhi Geng:Department of Epidemiology and Health Services Research- Geisinger Health System- Danville- Pennsylvania- USA.Amanda Elsey:Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research- University of Florida- Gainesville- Florida- USA.Julie A Johnson:Department of Pharmacotherapy and Translational Research- University of Florida- Gainesville- Florida- USA.Zahurin Mohamed:Department of Pharmacology- University of Malaya- Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia.Nathorn Chaiyakunapruk:School of Pharmacy- Monash University Sunway Campus- Subang Jaya- Malaysia.:Center of Pharmaceutical Outcomes Research (CPOR)- Department of Pharmacy Practice- Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences- Naresuan University- Phitsanulok- Thailand.:School of Pharmacy- University of Wisconsin- Madison- Wisconsin- USA.:Asian Centre for Evidence Synthesis in Population- Implementation and Clinical Outcomes (PICO)- Global Asia in the 21st Century (GA21) Platform- Monash University- Subang Jaya- Malaysia.:Department of Pharmacotherapy- College of Pharmacy- University of Utah- Salt Lake City- Utah- USA.:Huey Yi Chong:School of Pharmacy- Monash University Sunway Campus- Subang Jaya- Malaysia.Maznah Dahlui:Department of Social and Preventive Medicine- Julius Centre- University of Malaya- Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia.Fatiha H Shabaruddin:Department of Pharmacy- University of Malaya- Kuala Lumpur- Malaysia.George P Patrinos:University of Patras School of Health Sciences Department of Pharmacy- Patras- Greece.:United Arab Emirates University- College of Medicine- Department of Pathology- Al-Ain- United Arab Emirates.:Christina Mitropoulou:The Golden Helix Foundation- London- United Kingdom.Marc S Williams:Genomic Medicine Institute- Geisinger Health System- Danville- Pennsylvania- USA.

Cell cultures were compared morphologically with neuronal cultures on control glass coverslips.&amp;#13; Main results: We found enhanced SGN in-vitro cultures in MPS areas with small and intermediate inter-pillar spacing (from 0.6 μm to 3.2 μm) as well as in MPS areas with wider pillars (from 1.8 µm to 4 µm) compared to MPS flat zones and control glass coverslips. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images highlighted how neurites of SGNs follow straight lines by growing on top and between micro-pillars. Only micro-pillars with small and intermediate pillar spacings favor neurite alignment along preferred angles (30°, 90°, and 150°), while pillars with wider spacing produced less aligned neurites. We found propensity of adult SGNs grown on MPSs to attain more bipolar and multipolar morphologies.

Oxygen vacancies formed between Ti and P are characterized by a negative-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;U&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; behavior. Their neutral charge state is favored for Fermi levels near the conduction band and gives rise to a defect level in the band gap, which leads to an additional optical absorption peak. In contrast, the two-fold positive charge state, stable for low and intermediate values of the Fermi level, modifies the KTP optical response only slightly. Oxygen vacancies formed between two Ti atoms are two-fold positively charged, while potassium vacancies are negatively charged irrespective of the Fermi level position. In both these cases, the KTP optical response is essentially not affected.,Adriana Bocchini:Physics- Universität Paderborn- Paderborn- 33098- GERMANY.Sergej Neufeld:Universität Paderborn- Paderborn- Nordrhein-Westfalen- GERMANY.Uwe Gerstmann:Universität Paderborn- Paderborn- Nordrhein-Westfalen- GERMANY.Wolf Gero Schmidt:Universität Paderborn- Paderborn- Nordrhein-Westfalen- GERMANY.

The CaSR is a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is functionally active as a homodimer and couples to multiple G-protein subtypes to activate intracellular signalling pathways. The importance of the CaSR in the regulation of Ca2+e has been highlighted by the identification of >400 different germline loss- and gain-of-function CaSR mutations that give rise to disorders of Ca2+e homeostasis. CaSR inactivating mutations cause neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, characterised by marked hypercalcaemia, skeletal demineralisation and failure to thrive in early infancy; and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, an often asymptomatic disorder associated with mild-moderately elevated serum calcium concentrations. Activating mutations are associated with autosomal dominant hypocalcaemia, which is occasionally associated with a Bartter's-like phenotype. Recent elucidation of the CaSR extracellular domain structure enabled the locations of CaSR mutations to be mapped and has revealed clustering in locations important for structural integrity, receptor dimerisation and ligand-binding. Moreover, the study of disease-causing mutations has demonstrated that CaSR signals in a biased manner and have revealed specific residues important for receptor activation. This review presents the current understanding of the genetic landscape of CaSR mutations by summarising findings from clinical and functional studies of disease-associated mutations. It concludes with reflections on how recently uncovered signaling pathways may expand understanding of calcium homeostasis disorders.,Caroline Gorvin:C Gorvin- Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research- University of Birmingham- Birmingham- United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Interleukin (IL)-6 have been verified to be critical for tumor progression in several human cancers. In this study, we provided evidence that 17β-estradiol (E2) could significantly promote endometrial cancer cells viability, migration and invasion through activation of IL-6 pathway, which involved in its downstream pathway and target genes (p-Stat3, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, CyclinD1 and MMP2). Meanwhile, utilization of IL-6 neutralizing antibody could partially attenuate the increased cancer growth and invasion abilities in Ishikawa and RL95-2 endometrial cancer cell lines and an orthotopic endometrial cancer model. We established a causative link between estrogen and IL-6 signaling activation in the development of endometrial cancer. The molecular mechanism defined in this study provided the evidence that E2 promotes endometrial carcinoma progression via activating the IL-6 pathway, indicating that interruption of IL-6 might be an essential therapeutic strategy in estrogen-dependent endometrial cancer.,Qi Che:Q Che- Reproductive Medicine Center- Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University- Shanghai- China.Xirong Xiao:X Xiao- The Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynaecology- Fudan University- Shanghai- China.Xu Jun:X Jun- Reproductive Medicine Center- Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University- Shanghai- China.Miao Liu:M Liu- Reproductive Medicine Center- Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University- Shanghai- China.Yongning Lu:Y Lu- Reproductive Medicine Center- Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University- Shanghai- China.Suying Liu:S Liu- Reproductive Medicine Center- Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University- Shanghai- China.Xi Dong:X Dong- Reproductive Medicine Center- Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University- Shanghai- China.

The lateral neck recurrence-free survival (LRFS) advantages achieved by pCCND are still under investigation.METHODS:The records of 2,074 consecutive patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) at the time of surgery from 1996 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 611 consecutive patients were included in the final analyses. We used R version 3.5.1 to match patients with total thyroidectomy (TT)/lobectomy + pCCND with patients with TT/lobectomy alone and analyzed the following factors with a potential influence: age at diagnosis, sex, extrathyroid extension, and primary tumor multifocality and bilaterality. LRFS was analyzed. Moreover, the data were reanalyzed after separating the pairs of patients with pN1a from those with pN0.RESULTS:We were able to select 159 pairs sharing the major prognostic risk factors as listed. Overall, there was no difference in the LRFS, although patients with pCCND more often had recurrence. Moreover, the central lymph node metastasis status had no significant influence on the risk of recurrence.CONCLUSIONS:Routine pCCND was not a protective factor for LRFS in PTMC patients with cN0. The difference in LRFS between pN0 and pN1a was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).,Siyuan Xu:Department of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology- National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital- Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College- Beijing- China- xusyuan@126.com.Wensheng Liu:Department of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology- National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital- Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College- Beijing- China.Zongmin Zhang:Department of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology- National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital- Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College- Beijing- China.Yang Liu:Department of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology- National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital- Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College- Beijing- China.Zhengang Xu:Department of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology- National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital- Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College- Beijing- China.Jie Liu:Department of Head and Neck Surgical Oncology- National Cancer Center/National Clinical Research Center for Cancer/Cancer Hospital- Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College- Beijing- China.

Such chemicals can exert estrogenic activity and thereby disrupt neurobehavioral programming. Besides inducing direct host effects, GEN might cause gut dysbiosis and alter gut metabolites. To determine whether exposure to GEN affects these parameters, California mice (Peromyscus californicus) dams were placed two weeks prior to breeding and throughout gestation and lactation on a diet supplemented with GEN (250 mg/kg feed weight) or AIN93G phytoestrogen-free control diet (AIN). At weaning, offspring socio-communicative behaviors, gut microbiota and metabolite profiles were assayed. Exposure of offspring to GEN induced sex-dependent effects on gut microbiota and metabolites. GEN exposed females were less likely to investigate a novel female mouse when tested in a three-chamber social test. When isolated, GEN males and females exhibited increased latency to elicit their first call, suggestive of reduced motivation to communicate with other individuals. Correlation analyses revealed interactions between GEN-induced microbiome, metabolome, and socio-communicative behaviors. For instance, comparison of GEN males with AIN males revealed the fraction of calls above 20 kHz was associated with daidzein, tocopherol, Flexispira spp., and Odoribacter spp. Results suggest early GEN exposure disrupts normal socio-communicative behaviors in California mice, which are otherwise evident in these social rodents. Such effects may be due to GEN disruptions on neural programming but might be attributed to GEN-induced microbiota shifts and resultant changes in gut metabolites. Findings indicate cause for concern that perinatal exposure to GEN might detrimentally affect offspring microbiome-gut-brain axis.,Brittney L Marshall:B Marshall- Biomedical Sciences- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.Yang Liu:Y Liu- Informatics Institute- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.Michelle J Farrington:M Farrington- Biomedical Sciences- University of Missouri System- Columbia- United States.Jiude Mao:J Mao- Biomedical Sciences- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.William Helferich:W Helferich- Food Science and Human Nutrition- University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign- Urbana- 61801- United States.A Katrin Schenk:A Schenk- Physics- Randolph College- Lynchburg- United States.Nathan J Bivens:N Bivens- DNA Core Facility- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.Saurav J Sarma:S Sarma- MU Metabolomics Center- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.Zhentian Lei:Z Lei- MU Metabolomics Center- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.Lloyd W Sumner:L Sumner- Biochemistry- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.Trupti Joshi:T Joshi- Informatics Institute- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.Cheryl Susan Rosenfeld:C Rosenfeld- Bond Life Sciences Center- University of Missouri- Columbia- United States.

Deleterious mutations or perturbations in one enzyme can often be compensated by mutations to others. We used comparative genomics and experiments to examine evolutionary interactions with the essential metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Analyses of synteny and co-occurrence across bacterial species indicate that DHFR is coupled to thymidylate synthase (TYMS) but relatively independent from the rest of folate metabolism. Using quantitative growth rate measurements and forward evolution in Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that the two enzymes adapt as a relatively independent unit in response to antibiotic stress. Metabolomic profiling revealed that TYMS activity must not exceed DHFR activity to prevent the depletion of reduced folates and the accumulation of the intermediate dihydrofolate. Comparative genomics analyses identified >200 gene pairs with similar statistical signatures of modular co-evolution, suggesting that cellular pathways may be decomposable into small adaptive units.,Andrew F Schober:The Green Center for Systems Biology- University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center- Dallas- TX 75390- USA; Department of Biophysics- University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center- Dallas- TX 75390- USA.Andrew D Mathis:The Green Center for Systems Biology- University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center- Dallas- TX 75390- USA.Christine Ingle:The Green Center for Systems Biology- University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center- Dallas- TX 75390- USA.Junyoung O Park:Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics- Princeton University- Princeton- NJ 08544- USA; Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering- Princeton University- Princeton- NJ 08544- USA.Li Chen:Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics- Princeton University- Princeton- NJ 08544- USA; Department of Chemistry- Princeton University- Princeton- NJ 08544- USA.Joshua D Rabinowitz:Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics- Princeton University- Princeton- NJ 08544- USA; Department of Chemistry- Princeton University- Princeton- NJ 08544- USA.Ivan Junier:Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique- Université Grenoble Alpes- TIMC-IMAG- F-38000 Grenoble- France.Olivier Rivoire:Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Biology (CIRB)- Collège de France- CNRS- INSERM- PSL Research University- F-75005 Paris- France.Kimberly A Reynolds:The Green Center for Systems Biology- University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center- Dallas- TX 75390- USA; Department of Biophysics- University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center- Dallas- TX 75390- USA.

However, it remains largely unexplored how viruses exploit interferon (IFN)-independent host lncRNAs to facilitate viral replication. Here, we have identified a group of human lncRNAs that modulate influenza A virus (IAV) replication in a loss-of-function screen and found that an IFN-independent lncRNA, called IPAN, is hijacked by IAV to assist IAV replication. IPAN is specifically induced by IAV infection independently of IFN and associates with and stabilizes viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase PB1, enabling efficient viral RNA synthesis. Silencing IPAN results in PB1 degradation and severely impairs viral infection. Therefore, our data unveil an important role of host lncRNAs in promoting viral replication by modulating viral protein stability.

In avian species, the somatic cells in the follicles decide the process of follicle selection but the precise molecular regulation is not well defined. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a ubiquitous reversible epigenetic RNA modification that plays an important role in the gene expression regulation and cell functions. In this study, we profiled transcriptome-wide m6A methylation in chicken follicles during follicular selection process in order to identify key factors involved in the follicle selection. The chicken follicle transcriptome was extensively methylated by m6A and a negative correlation was found between the m6A methylation enrichment and gene expression levels. Interestingly, both the m6A methylation peaks and the m6A modified transcripts increased during follicle selection, which lead to the dynamic expression of many folliculogenesis relevant genes.

The aim of the study was to compare diurnal variation in bone turnover in patients with diabetes and controls.METHODS:A clinical 24-hour study with patients with type 1 diabetes (n=5), patients with type 2 diabetes (n=5), and controls (n=5).METHODS:Inclusion criterion: age >50 years.METHODS:diseases/medication that affect bone metabolism or recent use of incretin-based drugs. We drew blood samples hourly during the day and every three hours during the night. We served an identical diet on all study days. We used repeated measures one-way analysis of variance to compare the levels of the investigated markers, and we quantified the effect of time by comparing group mean standard deviations.RESULTS:The bone formation marker procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide showed significant interaction between time and group (p=0.01), and the mean standard deviation was lower in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with controls (p=0.04) and patients with type 1 diabetes (p=0.02). Other markers of bone formation and resorption showed significant effect of time. Levels of glucagon-like peptide-2, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, and sclerostin only showed significant effect of time (all p-values 0.01), but levels of sclerostin tended to being highest in type 2 diabetes and lowest in controls.CONCLUSIONS:The diurnal variation in bone formation is attenuated in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is not explained by changes in incretin hormone levels, but possibly mediated by sclerostin.,Katrine Hygum:K Hygum- Department of Endocrinology and Internal medicine- Aarhus University Hospital- Aarhus N- Denmark.Jakob Kau Starup-Linde:J Starup-Linde- Department of Endocrinology and Internal medicine- Aarhus University Hospital- Aarhus N- Denmark.Torben Harsløf:T Harsløf- Department of Endocrinology and Internal medicine- Aarhus University Hospital- Aarhus N- Denmark.Niklas Rye Joergensen:N Joergensen- Department of Clinical Biochemistry- Rigshospitalet- Kobenhavn- Denmark.Bolette Hartmann:B Hartmann- Department of Biomedical Science- University of Copenhagen- The Novo Nordisk Foundation for Basic Metabolic Research- Copenhagen- Denmark.Jens Juul Holst:J Holst- Department of Biomedical Science- University of Copenhagen- The Novo Nordisk Foundation for Basic Metabolic Research- Copenhagen- Denmark.Bente Langdahl:B Langdahl- Department of Endocrinology and Internal Medicine- Aarhus University Hospital- Aarhus N- Denmark.

One of the most recent accidents occurred in 2002 when the oil-tanker Prestige sank over the Galician Bank causing two major oil-spills followed by several small leaks until March 2003. This resulted in contamination of virtually all types of marine habitat. Considering that parasites have proved to be good effect and accumulation bioindicators, the present study addresses the medium-term changes in trace element content after the Prestige oil-spill in a model host-parasite system, the bogue, Boops boops (Sparidae) and the isopod Ceratothoa oestroides. To our knowledge, this study is the first to address trace element concentrations in natural fish and parasite populations associated with the effects of an oil-spill. We observed that both test organisms examined, the host and the parasite, indicate a detectable change in the relative composition of trace element concentrations before and after the Prestige oil-spill. Multivariate analyses also indicated a differential response of the different tissues to the temporal sampling sequence. However, analyses of both host and parasite tissues supported the pattern of a gradual temporal transition to a state of relative trace element content distinctly departing from the pre-spill situation. Moreover, the parasite-host element accumulation ratios better depicted this temporal pattern. Additionally, changes in V concentrations in fish liver tissues and Ni concentrations in the parasite tissues suggest that this host-parasite system may be a useful tool to assess these two element contaminations linked to heavy fuel oil-spill.,Ana Pérez-Del-Olmo:Marine Zoology Unit- Cavanilles Institute of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology- Science Park- University of Valencia- C/Catedrático José Beltrán 2- 46980 Paterna- Spain; Aquatische Ökologie- Universität of Duisburg-Essen- Universitätsstrasse 5- D-45141 Essen- Germany.

However, because nearly half of patients show insufficient SSRI responses, serotonergic dysfunction in heterogeneous OCD patients should be investigated for precision medicine. We aimed to determine whether functional connectivity (FC) of the raphe nucleus (RN), the major source of most serotonergic neurons, was altered in OCD patients and could predict the SSRI response. A total of 102 medication-free OCD patients and 101 matched healthy control (HC) subjects participated in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Among them, 54 OCD patients were treated with SSRIs for 16 weeks, resulting in 26 responders and 28 nonresponders. Seed-based whole brain FC with the RN as a seed region was compared between the OCD and HC groups, as well as between SSRI responders and nonresponders. FC cluster values showing significant group differences were used to investigate factors correlated with symptomatic severity before treatment and predictive of SSRI response. Compared to HCs, OCD patients exhibited significantly larger FC between the RN and temporal cortices including the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), paracingulate gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, putamen, thalamus, and brain stem. Greater RN-left MTG FC was positively correlated with OC symptom severity at baseline. In addition, larger FC of the RN-left MTG was also found in SSRI nonresponders compared to responders, which was a significant predictor of SSRI response after 16 weeks. The FC of RN may reflect the neurobiological underpinning of OCD and could aid future precision medicine as a differential brain-based biomarker.,Minah Kim:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Seoul National University Hospital- Seoul- Republic of Korea.:Department of Psychiatry- Seoul National University College of Medicine- 101 Daehak-no- Chongno-gu- Seoul- 03080- Republic of Korea.:Seoyeon Kwak:Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences- Seoul National University College of Natural Science- Seoul- Republic of Korea.Youngwoo Bryan Yoon:Department of Psychiatry- Washington University in St. Louis- St. Louis- MO- USA.Yoo Bin Kwak:Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences- Seoul National University College of Natural Science- Seoul- Republic of Korea.Taekwan Kim:Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences- Seoul National University College of Natural Science- Seoul- Republic of Korea.Kang Ik K Cho:Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences- Seoul National University College of Natural Science- Seoul- Republic of Korea.Tae Young Lee:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Seoul National University Hospital- Seoul- Republic of Korea.Jun Soo Kwon:Department of Neuropsychiatry- Seoul National University Hospital- Seoul- Republic of Korea. kwonjs@snu.ac.kr.:Department of Psychiatry- Seoul National University College of Medicine- 101 Daehak-no- Chongno-gu- Seoul- 03080- Republic of Korea. kwonjs@snu.ac.kr.:Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences- Seoul National University College of Natural Science- Seoul- Republic of Korea. kwonjs@snu.ac.kr.:Institute of Human Behavioral Medicine- SNU-MRC- Seoul- Republic of Korea. kwonjs@snu.ac.kr.:

The aim of the current study was to investigate this method in a subset of ADRs with a longer TTO and to compare its performance with disproportionality analysis.METHODS:Using The Netherlands's spontaneous reporting database, TTO distributions for drug-ADR associations with a median TTO of 7 days or more were compared with other drugs with the same ADR using the two-sample Anderson-Darling (AD) test. Presence in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) was used as the gold standard for identification of a true ADR. Twelve combinations with different values for the number of reports and median TTO were tested. Performance in terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) was compared with disproportionality analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed to compare the results with those from the previous study.RESULTS:A total of 38 017 case reports, containing 32 478 unique drug-ADR associations. Sensitivity was lower for the TTO method (range 0.08-0.34) compared with disproportionality analysis (range 0.60-0.87), whereas PPV was similar for both methods (range 0.93-1.0). The results from the sensitivity analysis were similar to the original analysis.CONCLUSIONS:Because of its low sensitivity, the developed TTO method cannot replace disproportionality analysis as a signal detection tool. It may be useful in combination with other methods.,Joep H G Scholl:Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb- 's-Hertogenbosch- The Netherlands.:Department of PharmacoTherapy - Epidemiology & -Economics- University of Groningen- Groningen- The Netherlands.:Florence P A M van Hunsel:Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb- 's-Hertogenbosch- The Netherlands.Eelko Hak:Department of PharmacoTherapy - Epidemiology & -Economics- University of Groningen- Groningen- The Netherlands.Eugène P van Puijenbroek:Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb- 's-Hertogenbosch- The Netherlands.:Department of PharmacoTherapy - Epidemiology & -Economics- University of Groningen- Groningen- The Netherlands.:

In recent years, basic research in SI-NETs has attempted to unravel the molecular events underlying SI- NET tumorigenesis.OBJECTIVE:We aim to provide an overview of the current literature regarding prognostic and predictive molecular factors in patients with SI-NETs.METHODS:A PubMed search was conducted on (epi)genetic prognostic factors in SI-NETs from 2000 until 2019.RESULTS:The search yielded 1522 articles of which 18 reviews and 35 original studies were selected for further evaluation. SI-NETs are mutationally quiet tumours with a different genetic make-up compared to pancreatic NETs. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18 is the most frequent genomic aberration (44-100%) followed by mutations of CDKN1B in 8%. Prognostic analyses were performed in 16 studies, of which 8 found a significant (epi)genetic association for survival or progression. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 18, gains of chromosome 4,5, 7, 14 and 20p, copy gain of the SRC gene and low expression of RASSF1A and P16 were associated with poorer survival. In comparison with genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations are significantly more common in SI-NETs and may represent more promising targets in the treatment of SI-NETs.CONCLUSIONS:SI-NETs are mutationally silent tumours. No biomarkers have been identified yet that can easily be adopted into current clinical decision making. SI-NETs may represent a heterogeneous disease and larger international studies are warranted to translate molecular findings into precision oncology.,Kris Giulia Samsom:K Samsom- Pathology- Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute- Amsterdam- Netherlands.Linde M van Veenendaal:L van Veenendaal - Medical Oncology- Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute- Amsterdam- Netherlands.Gerlof D Valk:G Valk- Endocrinology- University Medical Center Utrecht- Utrecht- Netherlands.Menno R Vriens:M Vriens- Department of Surgery- University Medical Center Utrecht- Utrecht- Netherlands.Margot Tesselaar:M Tesselaar- Medical Oncology- Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute- Amsterdam- Netherlands.Jose G van den Berg:J van den Berg- Pathology- Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Netherlands Cancer Institute- Amsterdam- Netherlands.
31189111,2019-06-12,United States Cell Rep 101573691  ,N-Glycolylneuraminic Acid as a Receptor for Influenza A Viruses.,A species barrier for the influenza A virus is the differential expression of sialic acid, which can either be α2,3-linked for avians or α2,6-linked for human viruses. The influenza A virus hosts also express other species-specific sialic acid derivatives. One major modification at C-5 is N-glycolyl (NeuGc), instead of N-acetyl (NeuAc). N-glycolyl is mammalian specific and expressed in pigs and horses, but not in humans, ferrets, seals, or dogs. Hemagglutinin (HA) adaptation to either N-acetyl or N-glycolyl is analyzed on a sialoside microarray containing both α2,3- and α2,6-linkage modifications on biologically relevant N-glycans. Binding studies reveal that avian, human, and equine HAs bind either N-glycolyl or N-acetyl. Structural data on N-glycolyl binding HA proteins of both H5 and H7 origin describe this specificity. Neuraminidases can cleave N-glycolyl efficiently, and tissue-binding studies reveal strict species specificity. The exclusive manner in which influenza A viruses differentiate between N-glycolyl and N-acetyl is indicative of selection.,Frederik Broszeit:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands.Netanel Tzarum:Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology- The Scripps Research Institute- La Jolla- CA 92037- USA.Xueyong Zhu:Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology- The Scripps Research Institute- La Jolla- CA 92037- USA.Nikoloz Nemanichvili:Department of Pathobiology- Faculty of Veterinary Medicine- Utrecht University- 3584 CL Utrecht- the Netherlands.Dirk Eggink:Department of Experimental Virology- Amsterdam Medical Centre- Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Tim Leenders:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands.Zeshi Li:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands.Lin Liu:Complex Carbohydrate Research Center- University of Georgia- Athens- GA 30602- USA.Margreet A Wolfert:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands; Complex Carbohydrate Research Center- University of Georgia- Athens- GA 30602- USA.Andreas Papanikolaou:Department of Pathobiology- Faculty of Veterinary Medicine- Utrecht University- 3584 CL Utrecht- the Netherlands.Carles Martínez-Romero:Department of Microbiology- Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai- New York- New York- USA; Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute- Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai- New York- New York- USA.Ivan A Gagarinov:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands.Wenli Yu:Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology- The Scripps Research Institute- La Jolla- CA 92037- USA.Adolfo García-Sastre:Department of Microbiology- Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai- New York- New York- USA; Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute- Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai- New York- New York- USA; Department of Medicine- Division of Infectious Diseases- Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai- New York- New York- USA.Tom Wennekes:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands.Masatoshi Okamatsu:Laboratory of Microbiology- Department of Disease Control- Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine- Hokkaido University- Sapporo- Japan.Monique H Verheije:Department of Pathobiology- Faculty of Veterinary Medicine- Utrecht University- 3584 CL Utrecht- the Netherlands.Ian A Wilson:Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology- The Scripps Research Institute- La Jolla- CA 92037- USA; Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology- The Scripps Research Institute- La Jolla- CA 92037- USA.Geert-Jan Boons:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands; Complex Carbohydrate Research Center- University of Georgia- Athens- GA 30602- USA.Robert P de Vries:Department of Chemical Biology & Drug Discovery- Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences- Utrecht University- 3584 CG Utrecht- the Netherlands.

Recent advances in manufacturing, however, have enabled the development of small legged robots capable of operation at multiple stride frequencies using multi-degree-of-freedom leg trajectories. Proprioceptive sensing and control is key to extending the capabilities of these robots to a broad range of operating conditions. In this work, we use concomitant sensing for piezoelectric actuation with a computationally efficient framework for estimation and control of leg trajectories on a quadrupedal microrobot. We demonstrate accurate position estimation (&amp;lt; 16% root-mean-square error) and control (&amp;lt; 16% root-mean-square tracking error) during locomotion across a wide range of stride frequencies (10-50 Hz). This capability enables the exploration of two bioinspired parametric leg trajectories designed to reduce leg slip and increase locomotion performance (e.g., speed, cost-of-transport, etc.). Using this approach, we demonstrate high performance locomotion at stride frequencies of (10-30Hz) where the robot's natural dynamics result in poor open-loop locomotion. Furthermore, we validate the biological hypotheses that inspired our trajectories and identify regions of highly dynamic locomotion, low cost-of-transport (3.33), and minimal leg slippage (&amp;lt; 10 %).,Neel Doshi:SEAS- Harvard University- Cambridge- Massachusetts- UNITED STATES.Kaushik Jayaram:John Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences- Harvard University- Cambridge- Massachusetts- UNITED STATES.Samantha Castellanos:School of Engineering and Applied Sciences- Harvard University- Cambridge- UNITED STATES.Scott Kuindersma:Harvard University John A Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences- Cambridge- Massachusetts- 02138-2933- UNITED STATES.Robert J Wood:Department of Materials Research Science and Engineering- Harvard University- Oxford St- Cambridge MA 02138- USA- Cambridge- Massachusetts- UNITED STATES.

Each tissue-specific detriment is determined from the nominal tissue-specific risk coefficient, weighted by the severity of the disease in terms of lethality, impact on quality of life and years of life lost. Total detriment is the sum of the detriments for separate tissues and organs. Tissue weighting factors for the calculation of effective dose are based on Relative contributions of each tissue to the total detriment. Calculating radiation detriment is a complex process that requires information from various sources and judgements on how to achieve calculations. As such, it is important to document its calculation methodology. To improve the traceability of calculations and form a solid basis for future recommendations, the ICRP Task Group 102 on detriment calculation methodology was established in 2016. As part of its mission, the history of radiation detriment was reviewed, and the process of detriment calculation was detailed. This article summarizes that work, aiming to clarify the methodology of detriment calculation currently used by ICRP.,Enora Clero:Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire - Siege social- Laboratory of Epidemiology - Fontenay-aux-Roses- FRANCE.Ludovic Vaillant:Centre d'etude sur l'Evaluation de la Protection dans le domaine Nucleaire- Centre d'etude sur l'Evaluation de la Protection dans le domaine Nucleaire- Fontenay-aux-Roses - FRANCE.Nobuyuki Hamada:Radiation Safety Research Center- Nuclear Technology Research Laboratory- Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry- 2-11-1 Iwado-kita- Komae- Tokyo- 201-8511- JAPAN.Wei Zhang:Radiation Effects- Public Health England Centre for Radiation Chemical and Environmental Hazards- Harwell Oxford- Didcot- Oxfordshire- OX11 0RQ- UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND.Dale L Preston:Hirosoft International- 1335 H St- Eureka- California- 95501- UNITED STATES.Dominique Laurier:Laboratory of Epidemiology IRSN DRPH/SRBE- Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire - Siege social- BP 17- Fontenay-aux-Roses- F-92262 cedex- FRANCE.Nobuhiko Ban:Genshiryoku Kisei Iinkai- 1-9-9 Roppongi- Minato-ku- Tokyo- 106-8450- JAPAN.
31189139,2019-06-12,England Phys Med Biol 0401220 0031-9155,Imaging of fragment particles in water by nuclear spallation during carbon-ion irradiation.,Recently we found that the luminescence imaging of water during carbon-ion irradiation was possible using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and the method could be used for range estimation of the beam. In the luminescence image, we found a luminescence from the fragment particles produced by the nuclear spallation reaction of carbon-ions. The luminescence may be used for the estimation of the distribution of the fragment particles by the nuclear spallation. For this purpose, we irradiated carbon-ion of 241.5 MeV/u to a water phantom and measured the luminescence image of water using CCD camera. Then, we carefully observed the luminescence distribution after the Bragg peak to find the luminescence from the nuclear spallation reaction. In the luminescence image, we could clearly observe the luminescence from the fragment particles produced by the nuclear spallation reaction during irradiation of carbon-ion. The beam widths of the luminescence image of the nuclear spallation were compared with those measured by the ionization chamber. The relative difference of the beam width in FWHM between luminescence image and ionization chamber was 23%. With these results, we conclude that the luminescence image of water during carbon-ion irradiation has a potential to be a new and efficient method for the width estimation of the fragment particles by the nuclear spallation reaction.,Takuya Yabe:Nagoya Daigaku Daigakuin Igakukei Kenkyuka Igakubu Hoken Gakka- Nagoya- JAPAN.Masataka Komori:Department of Radiological Sciences- Graduate School of Medicine- Nagoya University- 1-1-20 Daiko Minami- Higashi-ku- Nagoya- 461-8673- JAPAN.Takashi Akagi:Radiation physics- Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Centre- Tatsuno- Hyogo- JAPAN.Tomohiro Yamashita:Hyogo Ion Beam Medical Centre- Tatsuno- Hyogo- JAPAN.Seiichi Yamamoto:Graduate School of Medicine- Nagoya University- 1-1-20 Daikou-Minami- Higashi-ku- Nagoya - Aichi 461-8673- CHINA- Nagoya- JAPAN.

The difficulty in arriving at a universally accepted form of management is multifaceted: there is an incomplete understanding of the complex pathophysiology of scar formation; a lack of common metrics hampers the accurate description of scar quality and characteristics; model systems do not exist for proper investigation in the controlled environment of a laboratory; and there is only limited data from prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials. Accordingly, the management of cutaneous scars is typically based upon the experience from practitioners rather than from evidence-based data. This article will review the pathophysiology of excessive scar formation, define the most common scars-hypertrophic scars and keloids-and discuss the evidence to support the current nonsurgical therapies in use to both prevent and treat excessive scars.,Robert Saddawi-Konefka:Surgery (Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery)- University of California- San Diego- San Diego- California.Deborah Watson:Surgery (Division of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery)- University of California- San Diego- San Diego- California.

Based on findings of 3 Physical Therapy Summits on Global Health, addressing NCDs (heart disease, cancer, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, chronic lung disease) has been declared an urgent professional priority. The Third Summit established the status of health competencies in physical therapist practice across the 5 World Confederation for Physical Therapy (WCPT) regions with a view to establish health competency standards, this article's focus. Three general principles related to health-focused practice emerged along with 3 recommendations for its inclusion. Participants acknowledged that specific competencies are needed to ensure health promotion and NCD prevention are practiced consistently by physical therapists within and across WCPT regions (i.e., effective counseling for smoking cession, basic nutrition, weight control, and reduced sitting and increased activity/exercise in patients/clients, irrespective of their presenting complaints/diagnoses). Minimum accredit-able health competency standards within the profession including use of the WCPT-supported Health Improvement Card were recommended for inclusion into practice, entry-to-practice education, and research. Such standards are highly consistent with the mission of the WCPT and the World Health Organization. The physical therapist profession needs to assume a leadership role vis-à-vis eliminating the gap between what we know unequivocally about the causes of and contributors to NCDs and the long-term benefits of effective, sustained, non-pharmacological lifestyle behavior change, which no drug nor many surgeries have been reported to match.,Elizabeth Dean:Department of Physical Therapy- University of British Columbia- T325-2211 Wesbrook Mall- Vancouver- British Columbia V6T 2B5 Canada (NAC*).Margot Skinner:School of Physiotherapy- University of Otago- Dunedin- New Zealand (AWP*).Hellen Myezwa:Department of Physiotherapy- University of Witwatersrand- Johannesburg- South Africa (AFR*).Vyvienne Mkumbuzi:Physiotherapy Program- College of Medicine- University of Malawi- Blantyre- Malawi (AFR).Karien Mostert:Department of Physiotherapy- University of Pretoria- South Africa (AFR).Diana C Parra:Department of Physical Therapy- Washington University in St Louis School of Medicine- St Louis- Missouri; and Rosario University- Bogota- Colombia (NAC- SA*).Debra Shirley:Discipline of Physiotherapy- Faculty of Health Sciences- Sydney- The University of Sydney- Lidcombe- Australia (AWP).Anne Söderlund:School of Health- Care and Social Welfare- Mälardalen University- Västerås- Sweden (EUR).Armele Dornelas de Andrade:Departamento de Fisioterapia- Universidade Federal de Pernambuco- Recife- Brazil (SA).Ukachukwu Okoroafor Abaraogu:Department of Medical Rehabilitation- University of Nigeria Enugu Campus- Enugu- Nigeria (AFR); and School of Life Sciences- Glasgow Caledonia University- Glasgow- United Kingdom (EUR).Selma Bruno:Departmento de Fisioterapia- Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte- Natal- Brazil (SA).Diane Clark:Department of Physical Therapy- University of Alabama- Birmingham- Alabama (NAC).Sif Gylfadóttir:Physical Therapy- Reykjalundur Rehabilitation Center- Mosfellsbaer- Iceland (EUR).Alice Jones:Discipline of Physiotherapy- Faculty of Health Sciences- The University of Sydney- Australia; and Department of Rehabilitation Sciences- The Hong Kong Polytechnic University- Hong Kong (AWP).Sundar Kumar Veluswamy:Department of Physiotherapy- Ramaiah Medical College and Hospitals- Bangalore- India (AWP).Constantina Lomi:Department of Occupational and Physical Therapy- Karolinska University Hospital- Stockholm- Sweden (EUR).Marilyn Moffat:Department of Physical Therapy- New York University- New York- New York (NAC).David Morris:Department of Physical Therapy- University of Alabama (NA).Ann-Katrin Stensdotter:Department of Neuromedicine and Movement Science- Norwegian University of Science and Technology- NTNU- Trondheim- Norway (EUR).Wai Pong Wong:Academic Programmes Division- Singapore Institute of Technology- Singapore (AWP). : 
31189109,2019-06-12,United States Cell Rep 101573691  ,Robust Control of a Brain-Persisting Parasite through MHC I Presentation by Infected Neurons.,Control of CNS pathogens by CD8 T cells is key to avoid fatal neuroinflammation. Yet, the modalities of MHC I presentation in the brain are poorly understood. Here, we analyze the antigen presentation mechanisms underlying CD8 T cell-mediated control of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite in the CNS. We show that MHC I presentation of an efficiently processed model antigen (GRA6-OVA), even when not expressed in the bradyzoite stage, reduces cyst burden and dampens encephalitis in C57BL/6 mice. Antigen presentation assays with infected primary neurons reveal a correlation between lower MHC I presentation of tachyzoite antigens by neurons and poor parasite control in vivo. Using conditional MHC I-deficient mice, we find that neuronal MHC I presentation is required for robust restriction of T. gondii in the CNS during chronic phase, showing the importance of MHC I presentation by CNS neurons in the control of a prevalent brain pathogen.,Anna Salvioni:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Marcy Belloy:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Aurore Lebourg:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Emilie Bassot:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Vincent Cantaloube-Ferrieu:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Virginie Vasseur:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Sophie Blanié:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Roland S Liblau:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Elsa Suberbielle:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.Ellen A Robey:Department of Molecular and Cell Biology- University of California- Berkeley- CA 94720- USA.Nicolas Blanchard:Center for Pathophysiology Toulouse-Purpan (CPTP)- INSERM- CNRS- University of Toulouse- 31024 Toulouse- France.

Facial telangiectasias have been estimated to occur in tens of millions of people worldwide. The 585-nm laser was the first to follow the principle of selective photothermolysis for the treatment of cutaneous vascular lesions, but it caused significant postoperative purpura. Newer diode lasers target superficial and deep telangiectasias without the side effects of the 585-nm laser. Ablative resurfacing was introduced in the 1990s with the carbon dioxide laser to address facial rhytids and photoaging. While effective, the risks and downtime were significant. The newest fractionated nonablative lasers are demonstrating impressive results, with decreased risks and downtime. This new generation of lasers is being used extensively and in unique combinations for facial aging, striae, and acne scars.,Kaete A Archer:Private Practice- Aesthetic Institute of Manhattan for Facial and Plastic Surgery- New York- New York.Paul Carniol:Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery- Rutgers New Jersey Medical School- Summit- New Jersey.

Here, we describe SCLC subtypes in Mycl- and Nfib-driven GEMM that include CDH1-high peripheral primary tumor lesions and CDH1-negative, aggressive intrapulmonary metastases. Cisplatin treatment preferentially eliminates the latter, thus revealing a striking differential response. Using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach, we find a marked reduction in proliferation and metabolic rewiring following cisplatin treatment and present evidence for a distinctive metabolic and structural profile defining intrinsically resistant populations. This offers perspectives for effective combination therapies that might also hold promise for treating human SCLC, given the very similar response of both mouse and human SCLC to cisplatin.,Franziska Böttger:Amsterdam UMC- Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam- Department of Medical Oncology- Cancer Center Amsterdam- 1081 HV Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Ekaterina A Semenova:Oncode Institute- Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands; Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Ji-Ying Song:Department of Animal Pathology- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Giustina Ferone:Oncode Institute- Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands; Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Jan van der Vliet:Oncode Institute- Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands; Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Miranda Cozijnsen:Oncode Institute- Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands; Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Rajith Bhaskaran:Oncode Institute- Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands; Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Lorenzo Bombardelli:Oncode Institute- Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands; Division of Molecular Genetics- The Netherlands Cancer Institute- 1066 CX Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Sander R Piersma:Amsterdam UMC- Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam- Department of Medical Oncology- Cancer Center Amsterdam- 1081 HV Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Thang V Pham:Amsterdam UMC- Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam- Department of Medical Oncology- Cancer Center Amsterdam- 1081 HV Amsterdam- the Netherlands.Connie R Jimenez:Amsterdam UMC- Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam- Department of Medical Oncology- Cancer Center Amsterdam- 1081 HV Amsterdam- the Netherlands.

31189191,2019-06-12,Germany Int J Sports Med 8008349 0172-4622,The Relationship between Knee Biomechanics and Clinical Assessments in ACl Deficient Patients.,The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between knee biomechanics and clinical assessments in ACL deficient patients. Subjects included 22 patients with unilateral ACL rupture and 22 healthy controls. Knee kinematics and kinetics during walking and running were examined using a 3-dimensional motion analysis system. The passive knee joint laxity, range of motion of knee joint, and knee muscle strength were also measured. Correlations between the knee kinematic and kinetic data and clinical assessments were evaluated. In the ACL deficient patients, there were no significant relationships between tibial translation during walking and running and passive knee joint laxity. The correlations between knee kinematics and kinetics and range of motion of knee joint were also not significant. Additionally, there were no significant correlations between knee kinematics during walking and knee muscle strength. However, there were several significant correlations between knee kinematics during running and knee muscle strength. The results demonstrate the importance of knee muscle strength for knee kinematics and kinetics during running in ACL deficient patients. Patients with stronger knee muscle strength may demonstrate more nearly normal knee joint movement during dynamic activities such as running.,Yoshifumi Kono:Division of Rehabilitation- Department of Clinical Practice and Support- Hiroshima University Hospital- Hiroshima- Japan.Masataka Deie:Department of Orthopaedic Surgery- Aichi Medical University- Aichi-gun- Japan.Naoto Fujita:Department of Musculoskeletal Functional Research and Regeneration- Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences- Hiroshima University- Hiroshima- Japan.Kazuhiko Hirata:Division of Rehabilitation- Department of Clinical Practice and Support- Hiroshima University Hospital- Hiroshima- Japan.Noboru Shimada:Division of Rehabilitation- Department of Clinical Practice and Support- Hiroshima University Hospital- Hiroshima- Japan.Naoya Orita:Division of Rehabilitation- Department of Clinical Practice and Support- Hiroshima University Hospital- Hiroshima- Japan.Daisuke Iwaki:Division of Rehabilitation- Department of Clinical Practice and Support- Hiroshima University Hospital- Hiroshima- Japan.Makoto Asaeda:Division of Rehabilitation- Department of Clinical Practice and Support- Hiroshima University Hospital- Hiroshima- Japan.Chiaki Terai:Department of Rehabilitation- Nagoya University Hospital- Nagoya- Japan.Hiroaki Kimura:Department of Rehabilitation- Hiroshima University Hospital- Hiroshima- Japan.Nobuo Adachi:Department of Orthopaedic Surgery- Graduate School of Biomedical and Health Sciences- Hiroshima University- Hiroshima- Japan.
31189114,2019-06-12,United States Cell Rep 101573691  ,Quantitative Interactomics in Primary T Cells Provides a Rationale for Concomitant PD-1 and BTLA Coinhibitor Blockade in Cancer Immunotherapy.,Deciphering how TCR signals are modulated by coinhibitory receptors is of fundamental and clinical interest. Using quantitative interactomics, we define the composition and dynamics of the PD-1 and BTLA coinhibitory signalosomes in primary effector T cells and at the T cell-antigen-presenting cell interface. We also solve the existing controversy regarding the role of the SHP-1 and SHP-2 protein-tyrosine phosphatases in mediating PD-1 coinhibition. PD-1 predominantly recruits SHP-2, but when absent, it recruits SHP-1 and remains functional. In contrast, BTLA predominantly recruits SHP-1 and to a lesser extent SHP-2. By separately analyzing the PD-1-SHP-1 and PD-1-SHP-2 complexes, we show that both dampen the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways equally. Therefore, our study illustrates how comparison of coinhibitory receptor signaling via quantitative interactomics in primary T cells unveils their extent of redundancy and provides a rationale for designing combinations of blocking antibodies in cancer immunotherapy on the basis of undisputed modes of action.,Javier Celis-Gutierrez:Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France; Centre d'Immunophénomique- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.Peter Blattmann:Department of Biology- Institute of Molecular Systems Biology- ETH Zurich- 8093 Zurich- Switzerland.Yunhao Zhai:Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.Nicolas Jarmuzynski:Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France; Centre d'Immunophénomique- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.Kilian Ruminski:Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.Claude Grégoire:Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.Youcef Ounoughene:Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France; Centre d'Immunophénomique- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.Frédéric Fiore:Centre d'Immunophénomique- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.Ruedi Aebersold:Department of Biology- Institute of Molecular Systems Biology- ETH Zurich- 8093 Zurich- Switzerland; Faculty of Science- University of Zurich- 8006 Zurich- Switzerland.Romain Roncagalli:Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy- Aix Marseille Université- INSERM- CNRS- 13288 Marseille- France.

31189123,2019-06-12,England Water Res 0105072 0043-1354,"Candidatus Accumulibacter delftensis": A clade IC novel polyphosphate-accumulating organism without denitrifying activity on nitrate.,Populations of "Candidatus Accumulibacter", a known polyphosphate-accumulating organism, within clade IC have been proposed to perform anoxic P-uptake activity in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) systems using nitrate as electron acceptor. However, no consensus has been reached on the ability of "Ca. Accumulibacter" members of clade IC to reduce nitrate to nitrite. Discrepancies might relate to the diverse operational conditions which could trigger the expression of the Nap and/or Nar enzyme and/or to the accuracy in clade classification. This study aimed to assess whether and how certain operational conditions could lead to the enrichment and enhance the denitrification capacity of "Ca. Accumulibacter" within clade IC. To study the potential induction of the denitrifying enzyme, an EBPR culture was enriched under anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2O) conditions that, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and ppk gene sequencing, was composed of around 97% (on a biovolume basis) of affiliates of "Ca. Accumulibacter" clade IC. The influence of the medium composition, sludge retention time (SRT), polyphosphate content of the biomass (poly-P), nitrate dosing approach, and minimal aerobic SRT on potential nitrate reduction were studied. Despite the different studied conditions applied, only a negligible anoxic P-uptake rate was observed, equivalent to maximum 13% of the aerobic P-uptake rate. An increase in the anoxic SRT at the expenses of the aerobic SRT resulted in deterioration of P-removal with limited aerobic P-uptake and insufficient acetate uptake in the anaerobic phase. A near-complete genome (completeness = 100%, contamination = 0.187%) was extracted from the metagenome of the EBPR biomass for the here-proposed "Ca. Accumulibacter delftensis" clade IC. According to full-genome-based phylogenetic analysis, this lineage was distant from the canonical "Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis", with closest neighbor "Ca. Accumulibacter sp. UW-LDO-IC" within clade IC. This was cross-validated with taxonomic classification of the ppk1 gene sequences. The genome-centric metagenomic analysis highlighted the presence of genes for assimilatory nitrate reductase (nas) and periplasmic nitrate reductase (nap) but no gene for respiratory nitrate reductases (nar). This suggests that "Ca. Accumulibacter delftensis" clade IC was not capable to generate the required energy (ATP) from nitrate under strict anaerobic-anoxic conditions to support an anoxic EBPR metabolism. Definitely, this study stresses the incongruence in denitrification abilities of "Ca. Accumulibacter" clades and reflects the true intra-clade diversity, which requires a thorough investigation within this lineage.,F J Rubio-Rincón:Sanitary Engineering Chair Group.

Escherichia coli phage (T4) can potentially interfere with adsorption of HAdV-5 to cellular integrins by its KGD motif, while staphylococcal A5/80 phage does not possess this structure. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of T4 and A5/80 phage preparations on type 5 human adenovirus (HAdV-5) DNA synthesis and the expression of HAdV-5 genes.METHODS:Experiments were performed on the A549 cell line. HAdV-5 DNA synthesis was investigated with real-time PCR. Expression of HAdV-5 early (DBP) and late (hexon) genes was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in preincubation and coincubation experiments.RESULTS:While both phage preparations significantly reduced the expression of HAdV-5 genes, synthesis of HAdV-5 DNA was inhibited only by T4.CONCLUSIONS:Phage preparations show promise as novel antiviral agents.

Recently, serum cystatin C (sCyC) has been proposed to be a better biomarker in the prediction of AKI. The clinical utility and performance of combining sCyC and sCr in patients with AKI, particularly for the prediction of long-term outcomes, remain unknown.METHODS:We measured sCyC together with sCr in 628 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. sCyC and sCr were assessed at baseline and 24 and 48 h after surgery. CSA-AKI determined by sCr (CSA-AKIsCr) was defined as an sCr increase greater than 0.3 mg/dL or 50% from baseline. Major adverse events (MAEs; including death of any cause and dialysis) at 3 years were assessed.RESULTS:CSA-AKIsCr developed in 178 patients (28.3%). Three-year follow-up was available for 621 patients; MAEs occurred in 42 patients (6.8%). An increase in sCyC concentration ≥30% within 48 h after surgery was detected in 228 patients (36.3%). This was the best sCyC cutoff for CSA-AKIsCr detection (negative predictive value = 88.8%, positive predictive value = 58.3%). To evaluate the use of both sCyC and sCr as CSA-AKI diagnostic criteria, we stratified patients into 3 groups: non-CSA-AKI, CSA-AKI detected by a single marker, and CSA-AKI detected by both markers. By multivariable logistic regression analysis, the independent predictors of MAEs at 3 years were group 2 (non-CSA-AKI group as the reference, CSA-AKI detected by a single marker: odds ratio [OR] = 3.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27-9.58, p = 0.016), group 3 (CSA-AKI detected by both markers: OR = 5.12, 95% CI: 2.01-13.09; p = 0.001), and baseline glomerular filtration rate (OR = 2.24; 95% CI: 1.27-3.95; p = 0.005).CONCLUSIONS:Combining sCyC and sCr to diagnose CSA-AKI would be beneficial for risk stratification and prognosis in patients after cardiac surgery.,Miaolin Che:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Xudong Wang:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Bo Xie:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Ritai Huang:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Shang Liu:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Yucheng Yan:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Mingli Zhu:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Renhua Lu:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Jiaqi Qian:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Weiming Zhang:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Leyi Gu:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Shan Mou:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.Zhaohui Ni:Department of Nephrology- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China- drnizhaohui@126.com.Song Xue:Department of Cardiovascular Surgery- Renji Hospital- School of Medicine- Shanghai Jiao Tong University- Shanghai- China.
31189198,2019-06-12,United States Facial Plast Surg 8405303 0736-6825,The Applications of Medical Tattooing in the Head and Neck Region.,Medical tattooing has been used in various circumstances. In this review, the authors focus on the utilization of medical tattooing in the head and neck region as a minimally invasive alternative to corrective surgeries. It is mostly used to camouflage noticeable surgical scars on scalp, face, and perioral areas. Its use has also been described in cases of concealing depigmentation or hypopigmentation, hair loss, postirradiation telangiectasia, and congenital vascular malformation. These procedures are well-tolerated and safe. Its effects are long-lasting and satisfactory, leading to improvement in self-esteem and increased quality of life in treated patients. The limitations of medical tattooing in such uses include high technical requirement, color fading and alteration, unpredictable outcomes in scarred tissue, and potential cutaneous reactions. It also carries a risk of infection, albeit very low due to standardized sterilization process in a medical setting. The authors conclude that medical tattooing in the head and neck region may serve as an excellent option for patients who seek for cosmetic improvement in their deformities and/or discoloration but would prefer to avoid surgery.,Zhe Hou:Department of Dermatology- University of California- Irvine- California.Patrick K Lee:Department of Dermatology- University of California- Irvine- California.
