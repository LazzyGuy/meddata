MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network) is an integral part of a project against chronic diseases which it is focused on active and healthy aging and is supported by the European Union. It forms the third phase of ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) in which, through a mobile app on a smart device, the purpose is to guide patients in the control of their multimorbidity, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or asthma. The ""Allergy Diary"" app by MACVIA-ARIA is free and it is available for Android and iOS; on it, patients indicate how unpleasant the symptoms are on a daily basis through five screens with an analogous visual scale; two more screens were recently added (sleep affectation). With the app, it is also possible to download the information of the ""Allergy Diary"" on the physician's computer through a QR code at the moment of the medical consultation. In this article, we review the first year of experience in Spain, Mexico and Argentina, where the Spanish version is used.",[Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome.

CGD is the result of the lack of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme in the patient's phagocytes to produce superoxide. It is characterized by recurrent infections with a narrow spectrum of bacteria and fungi, as well as a common set of inflammatory complications, including inflammatory bowel disease. The most frequently found pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, species of Aspergillus, species of Klebsiella, Burkholderia cepacia, Serratia marcescens and species of Salmonella. Long term antibiotic prophylaxis has helped fight infections associated with chronic granulomatous disease, while the steady progress in bone marrow transplants and the possibility of gene therapy are defined as permanent treatment options.",[Chronic cough.

An epoxy master cast with 3 implants was fabricated. The first 2 implants were parallel to each other and perpendicular to the horizontal plane (implants A and B), and the third implant (implant C) had a 25-degree inclination. A passively fitting metal framework that was fabricated over this master cast was used to measure accuracy of fit. Ten casts were fabricated from this epoxy resin master cast with the use of polyether material and the open-tray technique. For the first 5 casts, the impression copings were splinted with dental floss and autopolymerizing acrylic resin; in the next 5 casts, the impression copings were not splinted. The metal framework in the master cast was fixed in the new specimens, and the microgap between this prosthesis and the implant analogs was evaluated. The specimens were observed under an optical microscope, and microgap measurements were made on photographs taken at a standardized magnification of 40×. The inclined implant C had the smallest mean microgap among the 3 implants, but the differences were not statistically significant. Microgaps for all 3 implants were smaller when they were splinted, but the difference from the mean of the nonsplinted counterpart was statistically significant only for the inclined implant. The results suggest that there is no clinical advantage in splinting the impression copings for parallel implants. On the other hand, when the implants are not parallel, splinting of the impression copings can result in greater accuracy of the fabricated cast.",Management of iatrogenic dislodgment of a mandibular third molar into the pterygomandibular space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199751,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"Although the surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar is routinely performed in dental clinics, the precise management of complications associated with it requires thorough knowledge and experience in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Iatrogenic dislodgment of a tooth or its fragment is a rare complication and usually occurs when excessive, uncontrolled forces are applied via elevators. It also is possible that this rare complication may be underreported. This case report describes the retrieval, under local anesthesia, of a mandibular left third molar crown from the posterosuperior region of the pterygomandibular space after iatrogenic dislodgment.",Short-term aging and the dentin bond strength of adhesive systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199749,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 2 aging methods on the dentin bond strength of different adhesive systems, including a universal adhesive. Seventy-two third molars were sectioned to create flat midcoronal dentin surfaces, which were randomly assigned to 12 groups (n = 6 each) according to the aging method (conventional aging, defined as 6 months of water storage; accelerated aging by means of a pH-cycling method; or negative control [immediate bond strength]) and adhesive system (Adper Single Bond 2, Clearfil SE Bond, Prime & Bond 2.1, or Scotchbond Universal). Composite resin blocks were constructed on the flattened dentin surfaces after application of the appropriate adhesive, and the specimens were stored in water for 24 hours. Specimens from the control group were immediately sectioned into resin-dentin sticks (0.8 mm2) and subjected to a microtensile bond strength test. Specimens from the experimental groups were sectioned and tested after undergoing the assigned aging method. Data were analyzed with 2-way analysis of variance and a Tukey test (α = 0.05). The study findings showed that neither aging method significantly affected the dentin bond strength (P = 0.917). Of the 4 adhesives, Adper Single Bond 2 had the highest bond strength value after aging (P < 0.001). Scotchbond Universal adhesive demonstrated statistically significantly higher bond strength values than Clearfil SE Bond and Prime & Bond 2.1, which had statistically similar values. Adhesive failures at the resin-dentin interface or adhesive failures mixed with cohesive failure of the adjacent substrate predominated in all groups. The 2 aging processes did not result in degradation of the adhesive interface or jeopardize the dentin bond strength of any of the adhesives tested.",Effect of gel replacement during in-office dental bleaching: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199748,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"In-office dental bleaching allows the dentist to have greater control of the procedure and prevents patients from ingesting chemicals. To obtain optimum results, in-office bleaching usually requires a longer period of application as well as changes of the bleaching agent applied to the tooth surfaces at each appointment. The objective of this case report was to assess, by means of a split-mouth design in a single patient, the final tooth color and tooth sensitivity resulting from 2 different bleaching protocols: 1 application of 35% hydrogen peroxide for 45 minutes and 3 applications of 35% hydrogen peroxide for 15 minutes each. Neither the patient nor 5 individuals who were blinded to the techniques noted a difference in the final esthetic results of the 2 protocols immediately after the procedure. In addition, the patient reported that no tooth sensitivity was associated with either protocol. The results of dental bleaching on both sides were maintained after 15 days. The results shown in the present case report suggest that there may be no need to renew the gel during in-office dental bleaching.",Clinical treatment of necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis: a case report with 10-year follow-up.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199747,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"The aim of this case report is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis. An 18-year-old man with no systemic problems reported with chief complaints of gingival bleeding during toothbrushing and spontaneous pain. Clinical examination revealed significant plaque accumulation on the surfaces of all teeth as well as papillary necrosis involving mainly the anterior teeth. Treatment included an initial phase of supragingival plaque and calculus removal along with at-home use of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinse twice a day for 30 days. After the initial phase, subgingival scaling was performed, and regular oral hygiene methods were resumed by the patient. After active therapy was completed, a periodontal maintenance regimen was established, and the patient was recalled for periodontal maintenance therapy. Follow-up occurred weekly throughout treatment, monthly for the first 6 months posttreatment, and 2-3 times a year during the periodontal maintenance therapy. Clinical results after 10 years showed that this approach controlled the acute phase and maintained the patient's periodontal health over time.",Effect of previous irrigation with chlorhexidine on the push-out bond strength of a calcium silicate-based material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199746,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"This study evaluated the effect of previous irrigation with chlorhexidine (CHX) on the bond strength of a calcium silicate-based material, Biodentine, when used for furcal repair. Furcal perforations were produced in 30 extracted mandibular molars. Teeth were divided into 3 groups according to the irrigant used: distilled water (DW), CHX followed by DW (CHX), and CHX followed by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and DW (CHX/EDTA). Biodentine was used to repair the perforations. A push-out bond strength test was performed after 7 days, and data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests (P < 0.05). The CHX/EDTA group showed significantly lower values than the DW and CHX groups (P < 0.05). The failure mode of the DW group was mainly mixed, while that of the CHX group was cohesive. The CHX/EDTA group exhibited adhesive and mixed failures. Irrigation with CHX prior to furcation repair did not result in a statistically significant difference, compared to the use of DW, in the push-out bond strength of Biodentine.",Prevention and management of life-threatening complications during dental implant surgery: a clinical case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199745,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"Complications can occur during implant placement; thus, clinicians should be aware of all potential outcomes, and staff members should be fully prepared to respond in case of emergency. A thorough medical history, precise surgical technique, knowledge, and skill are essential to prevent complications. The most serious complications, which could threaten the patient's life, are airway obstruction, bleeding, aspiration of the implant or its parts, infection, cavernous sinus thrombosis, nerve injury, and mandibular fracture.",Immediate restoration after mineral trioxide aggregate pulpotomy with amalgam condensation: an in vitro study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199744,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) pulpotomy may be an alternative to root canal therapy, with reported success rates as high as 85%. However, little technique-specific information has been reported regarding MTA placement in 1 visit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different placement methods for MTA and resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGI) cement before immediate restoration with amalgam. Forty pulpotomized extracted third molars were randomly divided into 4 groups, and moist cotton was used to simulate pulp tissue in all teeth. In group 1, cotton was placed over the entire pulp chamber floor and in each canal orifice, and MTA was placed over the cotton. The procedure for group 2 was the same as that for group 1 except that a layer of RMGI was placed over the MTA. In group 3, cotton was placed in the canal orifices only, a layer of MTA was placed only over the cotton in the orifices, and RMGI was layered over the MTA and pulp chamber floor. The procedure for group 4 was the same as that for group 3 except that RMGI was placed over the MTA but not on the pulpal floor. Each of these procedures was followed by amalgam condensation. After a 7-day setting period, restored teeth were sectioned mesiodistally, photographed, measured, and evaluated for disturbance of the MTA-restoration junction. The study findings showed that the MTA layer was disturbed in 40% of the specimens in group 1, whereas 10%-20% of specimens in groups 2 through 4 demonstrated disturbed MTA. Analysis with a Pearson chi-square test indicated that the difference between group 1 and groups 2 through 4 was statistically significant (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between groups 2, 3, and 4. Group 3, in which MTA was placed over each canal orifice and RMGI was placed over the entire pulpal floor, performed best--only 10% of specimens exhibited deformed MTA. The findings suggest that RMGI may protect initially placed MTA during amalgam condensation.",Comparison of the accuracy of CBCT effective radiation dose information in peer-reviewed journals and dental media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199743,General dentistry,2019 May-Jun,"Accessible sources of clinical information have proliferated over the past decade. Although these new sources that contextualize information for practice are user friendly, there are questions about their accuracy because much of the material is not peer reviewed. On the other hand, traditional peer-reviewed material can be somewhat removed from the needs of practicing dentists, and recently questions have been raised about the accuracy of journals. This study assessed the accuracy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) radiation safety information in both professional media and peer-reviewed journals. Articles introducing CBCT technology to dentists and published in peer-reviewed journals were compared to articles appearing in professional magazines, clinically oriented news sites, and blogs written by clinicians for clinicians. The reported radiation doses of CBCT and conventional dental radiographs were recorded, as were conclusions about the comparative doses of these 2 imaging modalities. The proportion of articles reporting CBCT dose to be greater than, equal to, or less than that of conventional dental radiographs was not different between the peer-reviewed and professional media articles during the period 2003-2016. There is weak evidence that the conclusions of peer-reviewed journal articles, but not professional media sources, became more conservative after the 2010 publication of an article in The New York Times that was critical of misinformation concerning the safety and efficacy of CBCT in dentistry. Professional media articles that were not peer reviewed were as accurate as peer-reviewed journals for this topic and during the time period assessed. However, the method used here necessitated a narrow focus, and more studies are needed to broaden understanding.",,,,,

A full understanding of the pathogenesis of this enigmatic condition is essential if we are to develop new prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. Central to our understanding of the pathogenesis of early-onset preeclampsia is absolute utero-placental ischaemia, which is lack of placental vascular transformation in early pregnancy. By contrast, relative utero-placental ischaemia, due to a mismatch between utero-placental blood flow and increased demand for nutrients occurring later in pregnancy, may be central to the development of late-onset pre-eclampsia. These pathogenic mechanisms have advanced our understanding of this condition, leading to better prediction, screening and intervention modalities. Screening for pre-eclampsia in the first and second trimesters by investigating the maternoplacental circulation and placental hormones could identify a high-risk subgroup. The advantage of screening in the first trimester is that a prophylactic intervention is available in the form of low-dose aspirin, if started before 16 weeks' gestation in the high-risk group, resulting in a substantial reduction in severe early-onset pre-eclampsia, while identification of a high-risk group in the second trimester will lead to focused management in this group. Using a combination of cardiac Doppler, multi-vessel Doppler assessment of the foetal circulation and biomarkers in established pre-eclampsia in the third trimester could predict adverse outcomes and guide clinicians to timeous delivery. Hopefully, advances in our understanding of this enigmatic disease will lead to further prophylactic and new therapeutic interventions.",Prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of cardiovascular risk factors among patients with hypertension in South African primary care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199426,Cardiovascular journal of Africa,2018 Nov/Dec,"To determine the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of cardiovascular risk factors among patients with hypertension at Johan Heyns Community Health Centre, Sedibeng district, South Africa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
