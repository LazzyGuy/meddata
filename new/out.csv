This TGFβ superfamily cytokine is known to provide the formation of the male-type reproductive system in mammalian embryogenesis, and regulate folliculogenesis, spermatogenesis and the balance of sex hormones after birth. The biologically active form of the hormone (aAMH) is formed as a result of limited proteolysis of the AMH molecule; it is not reliably known in which tissues and under the action of which enzyme it occurs. The serum level of aAMH seems to be a more informative clinical indicator than the content of total AMH (tAMH), but there are no ELISA systems at the world market that provide direct quantitative detection of aAMH. In this work, quantitative detection of total hormone (tAMH) and its biologically active form (aAMH) in serum was performed using specially developed enzyme immunoassay systems. We showed that in girls, the total serum AMH level, as well as the concentration ratio aAMH / tAMH, practically does not change with age, whereas in boys, there is not only a significant decrease in the total serum AMH level previously described in the literature (Pearson correlation coefficient R = - 0.86, p <0.001), but also in the ratios of the aAMH / tAMH level (R = -0.531, p <0.001). It was also found that in pregnant women, the amount of total AMH and the proportion of aAMH in serum was significantly higher (p <0.01 and p <0.001, respectively) than in the control group women. The obtained results are in good agreement with the available data on the total and activated AMH content in the blood serum of people of different sex and age and indicate a change in the ratio of aAMH / tAMH serum levels in pregnancy. These data may be important both for deepening the understanding of AMH biology and for interpreting the results obtained using AMH detection based diagnostics.",[Biochemical markers of myocardium damage in children with cardiomyopathy.],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200404,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,20190614,"The article presents the results of studies of 104 patients with cardiomyopathy hospitalized in the cardiorheumatological departments of the Republican Specialized Scientific and Practical Medical Center of Pediatrics in Tashkent and the Republican Children's Multidisciplinary Medical Center of the Republic of Karakalpakstan.

Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty acid (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce oleic nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral fat cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA metabolism into herbivorous dry land-living species with oleic type metabolism of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia.

Nanomedicine encompasses a variety of systems including nanoparticles, nanofibers, surface nano-patterning, nanoporous matrices, and nanoscale coatings. Of these, nanoparticle-based applications in drug formulations and delivery have emerged as the most utilized nanomedicine system. This review aims to present a comprehensive assessment of nanomedicine approaches in vascular diseases, emphasizing particle designs, therapeutic effects, and current state-of-the-art. The expected advantages of utilizing nanoparticles for drug delivery stem from the particle's ability to (1) protect the drug from plasma-induced deactivation; (2) optimize drug pharmacokinetics and biodistribution; (3) enhance drug delivery to the disease site via passive and active mechanisms; (4) modulate drug release mechanisms via diffusion, degradation, and other unique stimuli-triggered processes; and (5) biodegrade or get eliminated safely from the body. Several nanoparticle systems encapsulating a variety of payloads have shown these advantages in vascular drug delivery applications in preclinical evaluation. At the same time, new challenges have emerged regarding discrepancy between expected and actual fate of nanoparticles in vivo, manufacturing barriers of complex nanoparticle designs, and issues of toxicity and immune response, which have limited successful clinical translation of vascular nanomedicine systems. In this context, this review will discuss challenges and opportunities to advance the field of vascular nanomedicine.",The Impact of Fetal Anomalies on Contemporary Labor Patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200392,American journal of perinatology,20190614, To compare labor patterns in pregnancies affected by fetal anomalies to low-risk singletons.

Yet, the anatomical extent of these neural networks has not been described and the question of lateralization of EP has not been fully addressed. To this end, an extended number of brain regions in which electrical stimulation elicited EP were studied to test whether there is a lateralization propensity to EP phenomena.","Surgical treatment of meningiomas located in the rolandic area: the role of navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation for preoperative planning, surgical strategy, and prediction of arachnoidal cleavage and motor outcome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200378,Journal of neurosurgery,20190614,"Surgical treatment of convexity meningiomas is usually considered a low-risk procedure.

Bailey (1892-1973) was a scholar, neuroscientist, neuropathologist, and neurosurgeon who made decisive contributions in the field of neuro-oncology. Far less known are his groundbreaking insights into understanding hypothalamic physiology through the study of craniopharyngiomas. As one of Harvey W. Cushing's most talented trainees, Bailey was instrumental in developing Cushing's project of a histologically based prognostic classification of brain tumors. He worked at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital on and off between 1919 and 1928, owing to frequent clashes with his mentor. A major cause of this long-term conflict was Bailey's 1921 experimental demonstration of the hypothalamic origin of diabetes insipidus and Fröhlich's syndrome. This finding challenged Cushing's view that both alterations were due to pituitary gland insufficiency. In a seminal monograph written with John F. Fulton in 1929, both authors provided the first comprehensive account of the specific hypothalamic disturbances caused by tumors that originated within the infundibulum and third ventricle. The methodical study of Cushing's craniopharyngioma specimens allowed Bailey to recognize the close contact between these lesions and hypothalamic nuclei, a key concept that Bailey originally advanced for proper surgical planning.

In substrate, >50% of total As, Co, Mn and Ni and <40% of total Fe, Zn and Mo were identified in bio-accessible fractions. In digestate, all elements demonstrated poor bio-accessibility except for As.",Controlling nitritation in a continuous split-feed/aeration biofilm nitrifying bioreactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200347,Bioresource technology,20190614,"This study explored the stability of partial ammonium oxidation at low feed concentration (50 g N/m3), suitable for anammox process, in continuous fixed bed up-flow biofilm reactors with external recirculation-aeration. The reactors, filled with crushed basalt, were fed with synthetic medium at 20-25 °C at constant flow-rate with limiting dissolved oxygen concentration controlled by the recirculation ratio (R). Successful nitritation was achieved at R ≅ 4-6 with approx. 50% of NH4+ oxidized to NO2- with <5% NO3-accumulation. q-PCR analysis along the reactor showed ammonia oxidizing bacteria being the prevalent nitrifiers over the three-fourths of the bed in the flow direction, negligible denitrifiers and absent ammonium oxidizing archaea. A numerical model for predicting the concentration of the nitrogen species and DO was formulated. The model successfully predicted the experimental results and displayed good sensitivity to intrinsic oxygen uptake parameters. The proposed numerical model can serve both as an operational and design tool.",Preparation of porous biomass-derived hydrothermal carbon modified with terminal amino hyperbranched polymer for prominent Cr(VI) removal from water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200346,Bioresource technology,20190614,"Herein, a series of functionalized hydrochars with high density of nitrogen-containing functional groups were engineered by co-processing of terminal amino hyperbranched polymer and walnut shell biomass in the hydrothermal carbonization media. Hydrothermal Carbonization with optimized key parameters was implemented to determine the impact of added polymer to the biomass on the properties of the obtained hydrochars. Consequently, the optimum hydrochar which was achieved with the values of 250 °C, 60 min, and 50% (w/w) for temperature, time, and polymer/biomass weight ratio, demonstrated a highly improved surface area of 544 m2.g-1 and the highest adsorption capacity for Cr(VI) removal which was obtained from Freundlich isotherm model and described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model to be 363.22 mg.g-1 (at pH = 2.0). This work suggests that the co-hydrothermal carbonization promotes the uniform incorporation of polymers into the hydrochar matrix and provides adsorbents for the effective removal of Cr(VI) from water.",A novel strategy for efficient anaerobic co-digestion based on the pretreatment of corn stover with fresh vinegar residue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200345,Bioresource technology,20190614,"A novel method was advanced for efficient anaerobic co-digestion by using fresh vinegar residue (FVR) as acidifier for pretreating corn stover (CS). FVR acted as one substrate as well as an acidifier by the acids contained in FVR. It was found that the organic acids in FVR could efficiently enhance the hydrolysis of lignocellulose in CS. The biomethane production from co-digestion of FVR and CS pretreated reached 140.48 L/kg VS, which was 35.7% higher than that of unpretreated mixture substrates. The highest biomethane production was obtained when pretreatment was conducted at 150 °C. The increase of biomethane production was contributed to the improved hydrolysis of CS due to the acidic pretreatment. Pretreatment and co-digestion could improve the asynchronism and generate synergistic effect. The study provides one novel method for efficient biomethane conversion from FVR and CS."

However, studies in structural topological properties are still limited, especially those investigating the relationship between structural connectome alterations and auditory abilities. To clarify this, we investigated white matter structural connectivity changes and the relationship between connection strength and hearing abilities in individuals with long-term single-sided deafness (SSD), a common form of partial hearing deprivation, using diffusion tensor imaging and network-based analysis. The results showed globally improved connection efficiency, locally weakened visual networks, and strengthened fronto-parietal sub-networks in SSD compared to normal hearing controls. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation between hearing abilities (including speech recognition in noise and sound localization) and connection strength, mainly in the fronto-parietal areas, was found in SSD. Our study reveals alteration of the structural network connections in SSD, especially in cognitive related networks, which showed close correlation with hearing abilities. Our findings provide new insights into topological white matter reorganization of the brain after partial sensory deprivation.","Effects of atrazine on life parameters, oxidative stress, and ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway in the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200332,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",20190614,"Atrazine is a widely used pesticide which acts as an endocrine disruptor in various organisms. The aim of this study was to investigate adverse effects of atrazine on life parameters, oxidative stress, and ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway in the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus. In T. japonicus, no mortality was shown in response to atrazine up to 20 mg/L in acute toxicity assessment. In nauplii, retardation in the growth and prolonged molting and metamorphosis resulted under chronic exposure of atrazine at 20 mg/L. In addition, body sizes of T. japonicus nauplii were significantly decreased (P < 0.01 in length and P < 0.001 in width) in response to 20 mg/L of atrazine. Furthermore, atrazine induced oxidative stress by the generation of reactive oxygen species at all concentrations compared to the control in the nauplii. Also, significant increase in glutathione-S transferase activity was observed in adult T. japonicus at low concentration of atrazine. To understand effects of atrazine on ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway-involved genes (e.g., neverland, CYP307E1, CYP306A1, CYP302A1, CYP3022A1 [CYP315A1], CYP314A1, and CYP18D1) were examined with mRNA expressions of ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP) in response to 20 mg/L atrazine in nauplii and adults. In the nauplii, these genes were significantly downregulated (P < 0.05) in response to atrazine, compared to the control but not in the adult T. japonicus. These results suggest that atrazine can interfere in vivo life parameters by oxidative stress-induced retrogression and ecdysteroid biosynthetic pathway in this species.",Behaviour and cardiac response to stress in signal crayfish exposed to environmental concentrations of tramadol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200331,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",20190614,"Evidence of the ecological and biological impact of pharmaceuticals in surface waters on aquatic organisms is increasing. Tramadol is a synthetic opioid analgesic used to treat chronic and acute pain. To investigate its long-term effects at environmentally relevant levels, we evaluated heart rate (HR) and locomotion of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus during a 21-day exposure to 1 μg L-1 tramadol followed by 14 days depuration. Locomotion and HR were recorded over a period 30 min before and 30 min after exposure to physiological fluids of an injured conspecific, a natural stressor, four times during the tramadol exposure and four times during depuration. A significant increase in HR following stress induction was found in the majority of tramadol-exposed and control crayfish, as well as significant group-specific HR changes between both groups. Locomotor activity during tramadol treatment differed from that during depuration, in general showing less time spent in locomotion and lower distance moved. The tramadol exposed crayfish exhibited higher velocity during depuration than during the exposure period. Results may suggest a potential shift in prey-predator relationships.",Metabolite profiling of Breviolum minutum in response to acidification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200330,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",20190614,"Coral reefs are in significant decline globally due to climate change and environmental pollution. The ocean is becoming more acidic due to rising atmospheric pCO2, and ocean acidification is considered a major threat to coral reefs. However, little is known about the exact mechanism by which acidification impacts coral symbiosis. As an important component of the symbiotic association, to explore the responses of symbionts could greatly enhance our understanding of this issue. The present work aimed to identify metabolomic changes of Breviolum minutum in acidification (low pH) condition, and investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was applied to determine metabolite profiles after exposure to ambient and acidic conditions. We analysed the resulting metabolite data, and acidification appeared to have little effect on photosynthetic parameters, but it inhibited growth. Marked alterations in metabolite pools were observed in response to acidification that may be important in acclimation to climate change. Acidification may affect the biosynthesis of amino acids and proteins, and thereby inhibit the growth of B. minutum. Metabolites identified using this approach provide targets for future analyses aimed at understanding the responses of Symbiodiniaceae to environmental disturbance.",Hydrogelled emulsion from chia and linseed oils: A promising strategy to produce low-fat burgers with a healthier lipid profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200329,Meat science,20190614,"Burgers (20% pork back fat) were produced with the replacement of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% of pork back fat by hydrogelled emulsion (HE) from chia and linseed oils. No changes (P > .05) were observed for the moisture retention, diameter reduction, and cooking loss of the treatments, with a significant increase in the lipid retention (P < .05). Hardness increased (P < .05) with increasing the lipid replacement level, and a significant color difference (ΔE) was detected between the treatments and the control. In addition to reducing animal fat, a healthier fatty acid profile was reached after the lipid reformulation of the burgers, thus allowing the burgers to be labeled with health claims. The sensory tests (acceptance and Check-All-That-Apply) indicated that it is possible to replace up to 60% of pork back fat by HE.","4,4'-Dichlorodiphenyl diselenide reverses a depressive-like phenotype, modulates prefrontal cortical oxidative stress and dysregulated glutamatergic neurotransmission induced by subchronic dexamethasone exposure to mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200328,Journal of psychiatric research,20190614,"Dexamethasone (DEX) is a synthetic agonist of glucocorticoid receptors that has been associated with neurotoxicity and neuropsychiatric diseases. (p-ClPhSe)2 is an organoselenium compound reported to have antioxidant, antidepressant-like, and neuroprotective actions. This study investigated whether antioxidant activity and modulation of the glutamatergic system contribute to the antidepressant-like effect of (p-ClPhSe)2 in mice subchronically exposed to DEX. Swiss mice received intraperitoneal injections of DEX (2 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle) once a day for 21 days. After, the mice received (p-ClPhSe)2 (1-10 mg/kg) or mineral oil (vehicle) by the intragastric route (i.g.) for 7 days. The mice exposed to DEX were treated with fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.g.) once a day for 7 days. 24 h after the last treatment, the animals performed the locomotor activity (LMA), tail suspension, and forced swimming tests. Ex vivo assays were performed in samples of prefrontal cortex (PFC). The results show that (p-ClPhSe)2 reversed depressive-like behavioral phenotype induced by DEX without affecting LMA. Further, (p-ClPhSe)2 at all doses reduced ROS levels and increased CAT activity in the PFC of DEX-exposed mice. The highest dose of (p-ClPhSe)2 was effective against the decrease of SOD activity in the PFC of mice exposed to DEX. (p-ClPhSe)2 increased the [3H] glutamate uptake/release and decreased the Na+/K+-ATPase activity as well as the EAAT1 and NMDA R2A protein contents in the PFC of DEX-exposed mice. Regarding the NMDA R2B levels, there was no difference among experimental groups. In conclusion, this study reveals the effectiveness of (p-ClPhSe)2 in reversing the depressive-like phenotype of DEX-exposed mice. In addition, (p-ClPhSe)2 modulated oxidative stress and glutamate neurotransmission in the PFC of mice subchronically exposed to DEX.",Allele Loss and Reduced Expression of CYCLOPS Genes is a Characteristic Feature of Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200327,Translational oncology,20190614,"Copy-number alterations Yielding Cancer Liabilities Owing to Partial losS (CYCLOPS) genes have been recently identified as the most enriched class of copy-number associated gene dependencies in human cancer. These genes are cell essential and render tumor cells highly sensitive to the expression of the remaining copy. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) is characterized by frequent chromosomal deletions, but the relevance of CYCLOPS genes in this tumor subtype is unclear. We found 39 (31%) of 124 recently published candidate CYCLOPS genes (B. Paolella et al., eLife 2017;6:e23268) located on 7 autosomes that are frequently lost in chRCC. GISTIC and RNA-seq data obtained from the TCGA-KICH database showed that 62% of these CYCLOPS genes had significantly lower expression levels in samples with deletion of the respective gene. As copy number (CN) loss of the CYCLOPS gene SF3B1 (Splicing factor 3B subunit 1) has been recently reported in 71% chRCC, we explored the relevance of SF3B1 CN alteration and SF3B1 expression in a set of chRCC and additional oncocytic renal neoplasms. The frequency of SF3B1 CN loss (65%) was similar to that obtained from the TCGA-KICH database and correlated significantly with both lower SF3B1 mRNA (P < .05) and protein expression (P < .001). Other tumor subtypes with oncocytic cytoplasm had normal SF3B1 CN and displayed strong SF3B1 protein expression. These results suggest that CN loss of CYCLOPS genes is a characteristic feature in chRCC. Since many CYCLOPS genes code for components of proteasomes and transcriptional regulation, their alteration could make chRCC vulnerable to targeted drugs.","Overview of ""home"" cultivation policies and the case for community-based cannabis supply.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200326,The International journal on drug policy,20190614,"Cannabis policies should be relevant to communities most impacted by them. Home cultivation policies can engage people who grow cannabis and build on their motivation to supply a safe product. This paper aims to examine the laws pertaining to ""home"" (i.e. personal, small-scale) cannabis cultivation internationally and their different aspects, and to discuss the potential of these policies to be expanded into community-level cannabis supply models.","Canada, cannabis and the relationship between UN child rights and drug control treaties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200325,The International journal on drug policy,20190614,"Article 33 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires States to take appropriate measures to protect children from illicit drugs 'as defined in the relevant international treaties'. Those treaties are the UN drugs conventions. Following cannabis legalisation, then, can Canada remain in compliance with the CRC while breaching treaties to which Article 33 expressly refers? This article investigates this question with reference to the drafting of the CRC and the drugs conventions, how the relationship between the two systems has been approached, and the practice of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child from 1993-2015. While the CRC could offer an alternative framework through which to critically assess drug laws and policies, by and large it has operated so as to reinforce the drug control system. An interpretation of Article 33 in the light of Canada's cannabis reforms is proposed. Based on the text of the provision, the pacta tertiis rule, and the object and purpose of the provision, it decouples the CRC from the normative requirements of the drugs conventions.",Social inclusion from on high: A poststructural comparative content analysis of drug policy texts from Canada and Scotland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200324,The International journal on drug policy,20190614,"This paper explores the social inclusion of the illicit drug user. It does this through a comparative examination of policy orientations to the social inclusion of people who use drugs. Six policy documents from Canada and Scotland produced in the years 2000 and 2001 were systematically sampled from 42 known documents. A poststructural content analysis adapted from the work of Maarten Hajer and mapped onto an analytic frame derived from Nikolas Rose's Governing the Soul: The Shaping of the Private Self is conducted. Within the years considered, drug policy texts from Scotland signaled a more punitive approach to drug use and a less socially inclusive approach to people who used drugs than drug policy texts from Canada. The differences in policy directions identified were in keeping with a priori interpretations of each country's broad approach to illicit drug use and to the social inclusion of the illicit drug user, if not to social inclusion itself. Methodologically, combining the approaches of Hajer and Rose proved complimentary and useful as well as promising for future application to the content analysis of public discourse."

Research on seepage has been extensive, but few comprehensive treatments evaluating all aspects relevant to the phenomenon are available. In this work, the current information relevant for understanding the state of seepage from tailings ponds was reviewed. The information suggests the infiltration of OSPW into groundwater occurs near some ponds. OSPW may also be present in sediments beneath the Athabasca River adjacent to one pond, but there are no clear observations of OSPW in the river water. Similarly, most water samples from tributaries also show no evidence of OSPW, but these observations are limited by the lack of systematic, systemic, and repeated surveys, missing baseline data, standard analytical approaches, and reference materials. Waters naturally influenced by bitumen, discharge of saline groundwaters, and dilution also potentially affect the consolidation of information and certainty of any conclusions. Despite these challenges, some data suggest OSPW may be present in two tributaries of the Athabasca River adjacent to tailings ponds: McLean Creek and Lower Beaver River. Irrespective of the possible source(s), constituents of OSPW often affect organisms exposed in laboratories, but research in all but one study suggests the concentrations of organics in the surface water bodies assessed are below the standard toxicological effect thresholds for these compounds. In contrast, many samples of groundwater, irrespective of source, likely affect biota. Biomonitoring of surface waters suggests generic responses to stressors, but the influence of natural phenomena and occasionally nutrient enrichment are often suggested by data. In summary, valuable research has been done on seepage. The data suggest infiltration into groundwater is common, seepage into surface waters is not, and anthropogenic biological impacts are not likely.",Effect of biochar amendment on sorption-desorption and dissipation of 17α‑ethinylestradiol in sandy loam and clay soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200312,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Animal manure application in agricultural land has caused the release of steroid estrogens in the soil environment and further movement to aquatic systems. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of biochar addition on sorption-desorption and dissipation behaviors of 17α‑ethinylestradiol (EE2) in two different textured soils. A Commerce sandy loam and a Shakey clay were selected and subjected to sterilization. Soil samples with and without sterilization were reacted with a series of EE2 solutions of different concentrations for sorption followed by desorption and quantification using HPLC-MS/MS. Long-term dissipation of EE2 in the same soils was also evaluated over a 30-d incubation. Biochar amendment increased the maximum EE2 sorption capacity but decreased its water desorption in both sandy loam and clay soils. On other hand, biochar addition increased the Koc in the clay soil which had low EE2 sorption efficiency but decreased Koc in the sandy loam which had high EE2 sorption efficiency. Biochar did significantly increase both desorbable and non-extractable fractions of EE2, while it reduced the bioavailability of EE2 to microbial degradation. The dissipation of EE2 in non-sterilized soils fit to the first-order kinetic model, whereas it was better described by zero-order kinetic for sterilized soil. Biochar increased the half-life of EE2 dissipation in non-sterilized Commerce sandy loam soil by 48% (from 3.63 to 5.37 d) and in non-sterilized Sharkey clay soil by 67% (from 2.28 to 3.81 d). Overall, this study demonstrated positive impacts of biochar on the retention of estrogen hormones in soils.",(Mis) management of floodplain vegetation: The effect of invasive species on vegetation roughness and flood levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200311,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Floodplains are prone to plant invasions, which increase their roughness and decrease their flood conveyance capacity. In recent decades, extremely high floods have occurred in the Tisza River (Hungary) without an increase in discharge. This could be partly explained by land cover changes, as plough fields and pastures have been replaced by forest plantations and invasive plants have become widespread in the Tisza River floodplain. The aims of the present research were (1) to evaluate long-term land cover changes from the point of view of floodplain roughness, (2) to calculate vegetation density with and without the invasive shrub Amorpha fruticosa, and (3) to model (HEC-RAS) the flood conveyance in the case of unmanaged and managed vegetation (eliminating invasive plants). The study was carried out at three floodplain sections of the Tisza and Maros rivers, Hungary. In the eighteenth century, wetlands (61-93%) covered the studied floodplain areas, but as a result of mid-nineteenth-century channel regulation works, pastures and plough fields (42-72%) became widespread, and riparian forests (8-19%) appeared. In the late twentieth century, poplar plantations (43-86%) replaced pastures and plough fields and provided a perfect habitat for invasive plants. As a result of these land cover changes, the mean vegetation roughness of the floodplains increased from 0.021-0.032 (1783) to 0.066-0.092 (2017). However, at-site measurements indicate considerably higher vegetation roughness values (0.093-0.134) when the invasive Amorpha is also considered. Invasive species clearance could decrease the vegetation roughness by 86%. Based on our modelled data, peak flood stages could be decreased by 13-34 cm after the clearance of invasive plants. However, these values are influenced by the floodplain slope and characteristics of the modelled flood wave. The management of longer floodplain sections would have a considerable effect on flood stages, while the clearance of smaller patches would not have this effect.",Evaluation of factors influencing secondary organic carbon (SOC) estimation by CO and EC tracer methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200310,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Secondary organic carbon (SOC) is known to account for a substantial fraction of fine-mode carbonaceous aerosol. Owing to a limited understanding of SOC formation processes and the absence of direct measurement methods, SOC concentrations are mostly estimated using a tracer-based method utilizing either elemental carbon (EC) or carbon monoxide (CO) as tracers. The performance of these tracer-based methods depends heavily on accurate determination of the (OC/Tracer)pri value. The minimum R squared (MRS) method is currently recognized as a relatively reasonable tool to determine (OC/Tracer)pri. This study estimated SOC based on the MRS method with EC and CO as tracers, followed by the Monte Carlo method to analyze quantitatively the effects of measurement uncertainty, emission scenario and sample size on SOC estimates. We report here four major findings: i) the concentration of O3 was used as an indicator to atmospheric secondary reaction potential, and it was found that the mass proportion of SOC in total OC estimated by CO as the tracer is more consistent with the seasonality of actual secondary reaction potential; ii) the estimation results are highly sensitive to the measurement uncertainty in different emission scenarios, which leads us to conclude that the CO tracer method is more robust than the EC tracer method due to large inherent uncertainties in current EC measurements; iii) oversimplification of emission scenarios has substantial impacts on the estimated SOC value, and careful evaluation of the interdependence between sources should be performed to minimize this bias; and iv) the estimation bias of SOC can be reduced by increasing the sample size, and the tracer method can be expected to generate robust results for sample sizes over 1000. These findings are important in terms of providing a reference to choose appropriate tracers, emission scenarios and sample sizes for robust estimation of SOC in future studies.",Diastereoisomer-specific neurotoxicity of hexabromocyclododecane in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200309,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is a widely applied brominated flame retardant (BFR) and is regarded as a persistent organic pollutant. It has been found in human tissues and has the potential to cause neurological disorders. However, our understanding of HBCD neurotoxicity at the diastereoisomer level remains lacking. Here, we investigated the neurotoxicity of three HBCD diastereoisomers, i.e., α-, β-, and γ-HBCD, in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Results showed that the HBCD diastereoisomers decreased cell viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and impaired cytoskeleton development. Typical morphological features and apoptosis rates showed that the HBCD diastereoisomers induced SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis. The expression levels of several cell apoptosis-related genes and proteins, including Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9, cytochrome c, Bcl-2, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), as well as the cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) levels, were examined. Results showed that the HBCD diastereoisomer neurotoxicity was ranked β-HBCD > γ-HBCD > α-HBCD. The cell apoptosis and caspase expression levels of the three HBCD diastereoisomers followed the same order, suggesting that caspase-dependent apoptosis may be one mechanism responsible for the structure-selective HBCD diastereoisomer neurotoxicity. The levels of intracellular Ca2+ and ROS increased significantly. The ROS levels were ordered β-HBCD > γ-HBCD > α-HBCD, whereas those of intracellular Ca2+ were γ-HBCD > β-HBCD > α-HBCD. Thus, ROS may be a key factor regulating the neurotoxicity of HBCD diastereoisomers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the diastereoisomer-specific toxicity of HBCD in human neural cells and on the possible mechanisms responsible for the selective neurotoxicity of HBCD diastereoisomers.",Unravelling mechanistic reasons for differences in performance of different Ti- and Bi-based magnetic photocatalysts in photocatalytic degradation of PPCPs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200308,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Despite numerous developments in the field of heterogeneous photocatalysis, particularly its environmental applications, there remain fundamental uncertainties regarding the key properties which primarily govern the performance of a photocatalyst. In this study, four visible-light-driven magnetic photocatalysts, viz., Ag/Fe,N-TiO2/Fe3O4@SiO2, g-C3N4/TiO2/Fe3O4@SiO2, BiOBr/Fe3O4@SiO2, and BiOBr0.9I0.1/Fe3O4@SiO2, were synthesized and comparatively studied in terms of their material characteristics, charge transfer efficiency, and photocatalytic performance in the degradation of two model pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), ibuprofen and benzophenone-3. Amongst the tested photocatalysts, the g-C3N4/TiO2/Fe3O4@SiO2 exhibited the fastest degradation kinetics for both the PPCPs. Property-performance relationships were evaluated in which the dependence of the photocatalytic performance on various adsorption-related, electronic band-structure-related, reactive species-related, and charge carriers-related properties was examined. The strongest performance relationship was found to be with photocurrent density-an indicator of charge transfer efficiency-for both PPCPs, indicating its influential role in governing the photocatalytic performance. The findings unfold a potential research direction towards exploration of factors which can enhance the charge transfer efficiency, thereby possibly enabling the rational design of highly efficient photocatalysts for PPCPs removal.",Anaerobic reductive bio-dissolution of jarosites by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans using hydrogen as electron donor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200307,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Jarosites are secondary iron-hydroxyl-sulfate minerals and widely occur in bioleaching, acid mine drainage, and acid sulfate soil environments. Anaerobic reductive dissolution of jarosites is yet to be methodically examined. In this study, we explored the bio-dissolution of jarosites by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (At. ferrooxidans) by using hydrogen in batch experiments. After bio-dissolution by At. ferrooxidans for 22 d, ferrous ion concentrations reached 10.07 mM (biologically produced jarosites), 7.68 mM (potassium jarosite), and 1.45 mM (lead jarosite). Strengthening the dissolved jarosites by decreasing the initial pH (pH < 2.0) or by adding citric acid (1, 5, and 10 mM) was inefficient for bio-dissolution owing to restricted cellular activity. The pathways of bio-dissolution should include direct contact bio-dissolution and indirect bio-dissolution and relate to the solubility of jarosites in a bio-dissolution system. The results demonstrate that anaerobic reductive bio-dissolution of jarosites by At. ferrooxidans using hydrogen shows potential. This study also provides opportunities to contribute to the development of the bioleaching field via the aerobic/anaerobic cycle using a single strain to control and reuse jarosites in situ.","Evidence for unmonitored coal ash spills in Sutton Lake, North Carolina: Implications for contamination of lake ecosystems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200305,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Coal combustion residuals (CCRs, also known as ""coal ash"") contain high concentrations of toxic and carcinogenic elements that can pose ecological and human health risks upon their release into the environment. About half of the CCRs that are generated annually in the U.S. are stored in coal ash impoundments and landfills, in most cases adjacent to coal plants and waterways. Leaking of coal ash ponds and CCR spills are major environmental concerns. One factor which may impact the safety of CCRs stored in impoundments and landfills is the storage area's predisposition to flooding. The southeastern U.S., in particular, has a large number of coal ash impoundments located in areas that are vulnerable to flooding. In order to test for the possible presence of CCR solids in lake sediments following Hurricane Florence, we analyzed the magnetic susceptibility, microscopic screening, trace element composition, and strontium isotope ratios of bottom sediments collected in 2015 and in 2018 from Sutton Lake in eastern North Carolina and compared them to a reference lake. The results suggest multiple, apparently previously unmonitored, CCR spills into Sutton Lake from adjacent CCR storage sites. The enrichment of metals in Sutton Lake sediments, particularly those with known ecological impact such as As, Se, Cu, Sb, Ni, Cd, V, and Tl, was similar to or even higher than those in stream sediments impacted by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in Kingston, Tennessee, and the Dan River, North Carolina coal ash spills, and exceeded ecological screening standards for sediments. High levels of contaminants were also found in leachates extracted from Sutton Lake sediments and co-occurring pore water, reflecting their mobilization to the ambient environment. These findings highlight the risks of large-scale unmonitored spills of coal ash solids from storage facilities following major storm events and contamination of nearby water resources throughout the southeastern U.S.",Use of Escherichia coli genes associated with human sewage to track fecal contamination source in subtropical waters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200304,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Escherichia coli (E. coli) is frequently used in assessment and regulation of recreational water quality, but it is a general fecal indicator that provides no information about fecal contamination source. Sewage-associated microorganisms and related marker genes have proven useful for microbial source tracking (MST) applications that link fecal contamination to host sources, but many MST marker genes are carried in taxa not used in regulatory contexts. A more direct connection with regulatory concerns, including human health risk and total maximum daily load (TMDL) assessments, could be accomplished with tools such as the human-associated marker genes of E. coli. We evaluated the performance of E. coli H8, H12, H14, and H24 marker genes for detection of domestic sewage at the E. coli isolate level in Florida. E. coli isolates (n = 1, 380) from reference fecal and wastewater samples were first tested by binary PCR for the presence of each H marker gene. H8 and H12 were >90% specific and sensitive for domestic sewage, while H14 and H24 were ≤86% specific. Therefore, quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were used to quantify H8 and H12 marker genes at the sample level. Specificity values for the H8 and H12 qPCR assays were 96 and 93%, respectively, while both marker genes showed 100% sensitivity. H12 concentrations were tenfold lower in wastewater than H8 (~6-7 log10 gene copies (GC)/100 mL). H8 concentrations in wastewater and contaminated environmental water samples were correlated with the sewage-associated Bacteroides HF183 marker gene. This study suggests that E. coli H genes, and H8 in particular, can be useful for sewage contamination tracking and TMDL development in subtropical waters.",Temporal changes in atmospheric mercury concentrations at a background mountain site downwind of the East Asia continent in 2006-2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200303,The Science of the total environment,20190614,"Atmospheric mercury (Hg) has been monitored at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS) in Taiwan since April 2006 and is still continuing. Here we reported the trend in gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations at LABS between April 2006 and December 2016, before the Minamata Convention on Mercury entered into force in 2017. Previous research indicated nighttime (0-8 am) data collected at LABS are better representative of regional influence. Therefore, only nighttime GEM data were used for trend analysis. A significant decreasing trend in GEM at a rate of -1.5% yr-1 (-0.022 ng m-3 yr-1, p < 0.01) was found, comparable to the decreasing trends observed in Europe, North America, South Africa, and over the North Atlantic Ocean. Five major GEM source regions to the LABS were identified, including northern Indochina Peninsula, China, Northeast Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and South China Sea. Significant decreasing trends in GEM were found for air masses coming from northern Indochina Peninsula (-0.042 ng m-3 yr-1, -2.6% yr-1, p < 0.01), China (-0.041 ng m-3 yr-1, -2.4% yr-1, p < 0.01), Northeast Asia (-0.031 ng m-3 yr-1, -2.0% yr-1, p < 0.05), and the Pacific Ocean (-0.022 ng m-3 yr-1, -1.7% yr-1, p < 0.05). Decreasing GEM trend (-0.020 ng m-3 yr-1, -1.5% yr-1), but insignificant (p > 0.05), was also found for air masses coming from South China Sea. The decreasing trends observed with air from the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea indicated declining background GEM concentrations in Northern Hemisphere. Decrease in GEM concentrations at the LABS was in agreement with the reduction in atmospheric Hg export from the East Asia continent caused by changes in Hg emission quantity and speciation, and temporal and spatial distribution in emission sources that have been suggested by recent research. Additionally, changes in the frequency distribution of air mass origins and transport paths may also contribute to the changes in GEM concentrations at LABS."

An original semi-supervised learning procedure, which makes efficient use of a large amount of non-segmented images and a small amount of images segmented manually by experts, is developed to generate pixel-wise apparent flow between two time points of a 2D+t cine MRI image sequence. Combining the apparent flow maps and cardiac segmentation masks, we obtain a local apparent flow corresponding to the 2D motion of myocardium and ventricular cavities. This leads to the generation of time series of the radius and thickness of myocardial segments to represent cardiac motion. These time series of motion features are reliable and explainable characteristics of pathological cardiac motion. Furthermore, they are combined with shape-related features to classify cardiac pathologies. Using only nine feature values as input, we propose an explainable, simple and flexible model for pathology classification. On ACDC training set and testing set, the model achieves 95% and 94% respectively as classification accuracy. Its performance is hence comparable to that of the state-of-the-art. Comparison with various other models is performed to outline some advantages of our model.",GRUU-Net: Integrated convolutional and gated recurrent neural network for cell segmentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200289,Medical image analysis,20190614,"Cell segmentation in microscopy images is a common and challenging task. In recent years, deep neural networks achieved remarkable improvements in the field of computer vision. The dominant paradigm in segmentation is using convolutional neural networks, less common are recurrent neural networks. In this work, we propose a new deep learning method for cell segmentation, which integrates convolutional neural networks and gated recurrent neural networks over multiple image scales to exploit the strength of both types of networks. To increase the robustness of the training and improve segmentation, we introduce a novel focal loss function. We also present a distributed scheme for optimized training of the integrated neural network. We applied our proposed method to challenging data of glioblastoma cell nuclei and performed a quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Insights on how our extensions affect training and inference are also provided. Moreover, we benchmarked our method using a wide spectrum of all 22 real microscopy datasets of the Cell Tracking Challenge.",Discovery of novel (+)-Usnic acid derivatives as potential anti-leukemia agents with pan-Pim kinases inhibitory activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200288,Bioorganic chemistry,20190614,"Usnic acid (UA) is the main secondary metabolite isolated from lichens, with moderate anticancer activity. A small group of (+)-UA derivatives characterized with flavanone moiety was designed and synthesized, and their anticancer activities were evaluated in leukemia cells. It was demonstrated that (+)-UA derivatives 6a-6g inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells HL-60 and K562 with low micromolar IC50 values. Mechanisms of action were investigated to find that 6g induced apoptosis in HL-60 and K562 cell lines, and affected the expression of MNK/eIF4E axis-related proteins, such as Mcl-1, p-eIF4E, p-4E-BP1. Finally, kinase inhibition assay suggested 6g was a potential inhibitor of pan-Pim kinases. Meanwhile, the blocking of phosphorylation of BAD and 4E-BP1 by 6g, together with the proposed binding mode of 6g with Pim-1 further confirmed its Pim inhibition effects. Our finding provides the sight towards the potential mechanism of (+)-UA derivatives 6g as anti-leukemia agents.",Potent inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by sargachromanol I from Sargassum siliquastrum and by selected natural compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200287,Bioorganic chemistry,20190614,"Six hundred forty natural compounds were tested for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activities. Of those, sargachromanol I (SCI) and G (SCG) isolated from the brown alga Sargassum siliquastrum, dihydroberberine (DB) isolated from Coptis chinensis, and macelignan (ML) isolated from Myristica fragrans, potently and effectively inhibited AChE with IC50 values of 0.79, 1.81, 1.18, and 4.16 µM, respectively. SCI, DB, and ML reversibly inhibited AChE and showed mixed, competitive, and noncompetitive inhibition, respectively, with Ki values of 0.63, 0.77, and 4.46 µM, respectively. Broussonin A most potently inhibited BChE (IC50 = 4.16 µM), followed by ML, SCG, and SCI (9.69, 10.79, and 13.69 µM, respectively). In dual-targeting experiments, ML effectively inhibited monoamine oxidase B with the greatest potency (IC50 = 7.42 µM). Molecular docking simulation suggested the binding affinity of SCI (-8.6 kcal/mol) with AChE was greater than those of SCG (-7.9 kcal/mol) and DB (-8.2 kcal/mol). Docking simulation indicated SCI interacts with AChE at Trp81, and that SCG interacts at Ser119. No hydrogen bond was predicted for the interaction between AChE and DB. This study suggests SCI, SCG, DB, and ML be viewed as new reversible AChE inhibitors and useful lead compounds for the development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","Design, synthesis and anticervical cancer activity of new benzofuran-pyrazol-hydrazono- thiazolidin-4-one hybrids as potential EGFR inhibitors and apoptosis inducing agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200286,Bioorganic chemistry,20190614,"This study represents the synthetic approaches of a new set of 2-(((3-(benzofuran-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methylene)hydrazono)-5-(aryl)thiazolidin-4-one derivatives 4-22 aiming to obtain new antiproliferative candidates against human cervix carcinoma cells (Hela) of EGFR PK inhibiting potency. The cancer cells represented promising sensitivity towards the compounds 6, 7, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17 more than or equal to that against the reference drug doxorubicin. In addition, the latter compounds were tested as EGFR protein kinase inhibitors. The results revealed that compound 14 showed more significant EGFR PK inhibitory activity than the reference drug erlotinib (IC50; 0.07, 0.08 µM, respectively). Moreover, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assay were performed for compound 14 proving its ability to cause G1/S phase arrest and apoptosis in Hela cancer cells, in addition to its activation of the caspases-7 and -3. In addition, derivative 14 increased the expression level of p53 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 which confirmed its mode of action. Molecular docking study of 14 was performed to investigate its binding mode of interaction with EGFR PK in the active site with the aim of rationalizing its promising inhibitory activity. Accordingly, compound 14 might be considered as a promising scaffold anticervical cancer chemotherapeutic and deserves further optimization and in-depth biological studies.","Bioaugmentation of atrazine removal in constructed wetland: Performance, microbial dynamics, and environmental impacts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200285,Bioresource technology,20190614,"Constructed wetland (CW) is an efficient technology to treat urban storm water runoff. However, the CW has limited capacity to degrade atrazine, a frequently detected herbicide in runoff. Bioaugmentation provides a feasible enhanced alternative; nevertheless, incorporating bioaugmentation into CW is likely to perpetuate the environmental consequences and incur complex trade-offs between environmental improvement and burdens. Since few efforts were made to improve above situation, the present work proposed the application of bioaugmentation, and tested the feasibility from both efficiency and sustainability dimensions. Results showed that bioaugmentation markedly enhanced atrazine degradation from 5 mg/L to below the threshold value within 43 day by increasing functional atrazine-degrading bacteria. Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter significantly proliferated among atrazine-degrading bacterial genera, indicating high adaptability and atrazine-degrading contribution. With life cycle assessment, enhancing 1 kg of atrazine degradation could decrease environmental burdens with 27.60 kg 1,4-DCB-Eq of freshwater-ecotoxicity reduction, and achieve shorter payback period compared to non-bioaugmented CW.",Impact of mesophilic co-composting conditions on the quality of substrates produced from winery waste activated sludge and grape stalks: Lab-scale and pilot-scale studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200284,Bioresource technology,20190614,"In this study, different amounts of a mixture of winery waste activated sludge and grape stalks were co-composted for 8 weeks, at lab-scale under different temperatures and aeration rates, and at pilot-scale. None of the experiments showed the occurrence of a thermophilic stage, even when the composting temperature was kept at 34 °C, which might suggest biological suppression by the acclimated mesophilic microorganisms ubiquitous to the winery waste activated sludge. The composted substrates were fully characterized by physicochemical analysis, plant growth tests and germination indexes using parsley (Petroselinum crispum) seedlings and seeds. Surprisingly, despite the higher volume reduction at lab-scale, it was the initial mixture and the mixture composted outdoors which presented the best horticultural qualities, with seedling survival rates of 88.9% and 87.0% and modified germination indexes of 54% and 161%, respectively. These findings shed some light on previous contradictory results and allow the development of new recycling strategies.",Aged refuse enhances anaerobic fermentation of food waste to produce short-chain fatty acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200283,Bioresource technology,20190614,"In this work, a new technology of intensifying anaerobic fermentation of food waste to accumulate SCFA by using landfill degradation product aged refuse (AR) was reported. The experimental results showed that AR enhanced the accumulation of SCFA, and when the optimal dosage of AR was 300 mg/g, the maximum accumulation of SCFA was 32.5 g/L, which was around 1.9 times that of the blank group. Mechanism investigations had shown that AR accelerated the disintegration of food waste to release soluble carbohydrates and proteins. The model experiment of synthetic wastewater revealed that AR improved both hydrolysis and acidification efficiencies but inhibited the methanogenesis process, thereby accumulating SCFA. 454 high-throughput sequencing showed that AR increased the relative abundance of Clostridium and Sporanaerobacter, which benefited anaerobic hydrolysis of food waste.",New insights on the sludge fermentation liquid driven denitrification: Evaluation of the system performance and effluent organic matter (EfOM).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200282,Bioresource technology,20190614,"Sludge fermentation liquid (FL) is a promising and sustainable carbon source for biological denitrification.

Results indicate that the FLNaOH (NaOH treatment at pH 10) contained the maximum amount of soluble organics, but led to the worst nitrate removal performance. Nitrate removal efficiency with FLcontrol was much higher than that of FLCaO2, FLCa(OH)2, and FLNaOH. On the other hand, it was found some organics in FL was hard to be utilized by denitrifiers. In particular, EfOM with FLNaOH presented the highest building blocks, high molecular weight (HMW) protein and HMW polysaccharide. It also contained much higher C-(C/H) group. This study provided a new insight on the FL driven denitrification. The necessarity of pursuing the alkali pretreatment to produce carbon source were discussed and evaluated."

However, these disparities in wellbeing are not captured in conventional QOL instruments, as they often do not include dimensions that are likely to be relevant to Indigenous people. The objective of this comprehensive literature review was to identify these wellbeing domains for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia (hereafter, respectfully referred to collectively as Indigenous Australians). We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Econlit, CINAHL, and Embase (from inception to June 2017, and updated in March 2019), and grey literature sources using keywords relating to adult Indigenous Australians' QOL and wellbeing. From 278 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 95 were included in a thematic analysis. This synthesis revealed nine broad interconnected wellbeing dimensions: autonomy, empowerment and recognition; family and community; culture, spirituality and identity; Country; basic needs; work, roles and responsibilities; education; physical health; and mental health. The findings suggest domains of wellbeing relevant to and valued by Indigenous Australians that may not be included in existing QOL and wellbeing instruments, domains that may be shared with Indigenous populations globally. This indicates the need for a tailored wellbeing instrument that includes factors relevant to Indigenous Australians. Developing such an instrument will ensure meaningful, culturally-relevant measurement of Indigenous Australians' wellbeing.","A highly sensitive and selective fluorescent ""off-on-off"" relay chemosensor based on a new bis(salamo)-type tetraoxime for detecting Zn2+ and CN.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200268,"Spectrochimica acta.

The results of successful application of SERS and micro-SERS for art pigments identification in the canvas paintings and icons have been demonstrated. The techniques allowed us to clearly identify the composition of blue and green paint layers as well as grounds in the nine artworks. This lead to determination of the lower time limit of work creation, to dating of the restoration interventions, to distinguish red ochers from two different deposit sources of raw mineral.

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",20190614,"With the miniaturization of Raman spectrometers, Raman spectroscopy (including Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy) has been widely applied to various fields, especially towards rapid detection applications. In order to deal with the accompanied massive databases, large numbers of Raman spectra require to be handled and identified in an effective and automatic manner. This paper proposes an algorithm of material auto-identification, which makes use of machine learning methods to analyze Raman spectra. Firstly, a universal method of spectral feature extraction is designed to automatically process Raman spectra after the background subtraction. Secondly, the extracted feature vectors are used to classify and identify target materials by Adaptive Hypergraph (AH), an efficient classifier in the field of machine learning, in a manner of automation with an accuracy rate of ~99%. Compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), two typical methods of classification, the AH classifier provides better performance free of tuning any parameter facing different targets. Thirdly, Cubic Spline Interpolation is introduced to enhance the universal of the proposed algorithm between different databases from different Raman spectrometers with variant vendors. The identification accuracy rate is up to 98% using the high frequency sampling spectra as the learning and the low frequency sampling ones as the testing, respectively.","Chelation of specific metal ions imparts coplanarity and fluorescence in two imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives: Potential chemosensors for detection of metal ions in aqueous and biosamples.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200265,"Spectrochimica acta.

Two neighboring lines of CO and CH4 around 2.3 μm were selected as candidates for simultaneous measurement by a single diode distributed feedback (DFB) laser. A special Herriott-type multipass absorption cell, with a 72 m optical path length, was designed and used to enhance the absorption signals of sample gases. Normalized wavelength modulation spectroscopy was applied to improve the sensitivity and robustness of the spectrometer and it was implemented on a home-made electronic system based on field programmable gate array (FPGA). Meanwhile, the electronic system controlled the temperature and current of DFB laser with the precision of 0.01 °C and 40 ppm. The 2nd-harmonic signals normalized by the corresponding 1st-harmonic signals for both CO and CH4 are of high linear response to their concentrations in the range of 0.046-4.6 ppm and 0.487-48.7 ppm, respectively.

First, the impact on amphiphilic properties of the alkyl chain size and the presence of branching and/or unsaturation is investigated. Then, various polar head parameters are explored, such as the degree of polymerization of the sugar unit (mono- or oligosaccharides), the chemical nature of the linker and the sugar configuration. Some systematic comparisons between ethoxylated surfactants and sugar-based surfactants are also carried out. While some structural trends with the impact of alkyl chain length or the polar head size are now well understood, this analysis points out that systematic studies of more specific effects of alkyl chain (e.g. branching, unsaturation, presence of rings, position on the polar head) and polar head (e.g. linker, anomeric configuration, internal stereochemistry, cyclic vs. acyclic sugar residues) were scarcer or not available to date. This work encourages the use of these structural trends in the perspective of developing new bio-based surfactants and their consideration in predictive models. It also highlights the need of further experimental tests to fill remaining gaps notably to explore some specific structural features (such as the introduction of rings in the alkyl chain or the position of the alkyl chain on the polar head) and towards applicative properties (like foaming capacity or wettability).",How do proteins 'response' to common carbon nanomaterials?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200262,Advances in colloid and interface science,20190614,"Carbon nanomaterials are widely produced and applied in biological and environmental fields because of their outstanding physical and chemical properties, which pose a threat to the safety of living organisms and the ecological environment.

This review pays special emphasis on how proteins response to the main carbon nanomaterials (fullerene, carbon nanotubes, graphene and their derivatives). In addition, how to use the interaction between carbon nanomaterials and proteins to do some beneficial things for human and the development of safe nanomaterials is simply discussed. Finally, some suggestions have been made to lay a theoretical foundation for future research.",Revisiting the link between childhood sexual abuse and adult sexual aggression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200261,Child abuse & neglect,20190614,Childhood maltreatment poses a risk factor for adult sexual aggression among men.

Aluminium (Al) due to its antibacterial properties easily affects the methanogens, which have a thinner cell membrane and slower growth rate. The effect of Al in suppressing methanogens was thus studied by adding 5 mg/L of aluminium sulphate in anolyte of the treated MFC (MFCT). Reduced COD removal efficiency of 86.11 ± 1.3% was observed in MFCT which was lower than that observed (96.25 ± 1.7%) in the control MFC (MFCC) operated without Al addition. An average volumetric power density of 1.84 ± 0.40 W/m3 was observed in MFCT whereas the average volumetric power density observed in MFCC was 1.54 ± 0.46 W/m3. An internal resistance of 195 Ω was observed in MFCT, which was significantly lower than 349 Ω, as observed in MFCC. The coulombic efficiency (CE) of MFCT was found to be 2.5 times higher than the CE of MFCC. This improved performance of MFCT denoted better biocatalytic activity and electron transfer capability of anodic biofilm of MFCT than MFCC. Higher current generation during electrochemical analysis showed better electron discharge at the anode and lesser electron loss at the interface of electrode and electrolyte.",An electrochemical method for plant species determination and classification based on fingerprinting petal tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200249,"Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",20190614,"The identification of plant species not only is a hobby but also has important application value in plant resources science. Traditional plant identification often relies on the experience of botanists. The infrageneric identification of plants is easily mistaken due to similarities in organ features. In this work, we propose an electrochemical method to obtain fingerprints of plant petal tissue. Fourteen species of Lycoris were used as a model for validating this methodology. Pattern and color recognition were established for visualization of electrochemical fingerprints recorded after various solvent extractions. In addition, the infrageneric relationships of these Lycoris species were deduced from the electrochemical fingerprints since the type and content of electroactive compounds in plants are controlled by genes. The results indicate that the electrochemical fingerprints of Lycoris petals are correlated with the infrageneric relationships of native Lycoris species.","Comparative gill and liver pathology of Tilapia zilli, Clarias gariepinus and Neochanna diversus in owan river (Nigeria): Relative ecological risks of species in a pesticide-impacted river.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200248,Chemosphere,20190614,"The dissimilar ecological behavior of species including, extent of mobility and feeding strategies, may predispose them to greater toxic effects. This hypothesis was tested by histological-based assessment of gills and liver of pelagic (Tilapia zilli) and benthic (Clarias gariepinus and Neochanna diversus) fish species of River Owan. The fish species were sampled monthly across seasons from river sites where they were observed to be most abundant. The pathologies were examined from light micrographs, and severity was evaluated by semi-quantitative analyses. Gill pathology of Tilapiazilli showed a moderate occurrence of shortened secondary lamellae, compared with Clarias gariepinus and Neochanna diversus which showed a high incidence of very distinct structural disruptions including epithelial lifting, collapsed secondary lamella structure due to pilaster disruption. Although hepatocellular damage, fibrotic biliary disruptions and parasite incidence were the most evident pathological features in liver of all species, parasite variety and lesion severity differed across species. Principal component analysis (PCA) associated benthic species with more severe gills and liver pathologies, indicating that, benthic species in the Owan riverscape were more at risks compared to pelagic species. As such, we successfully demonstrate that relative ecological risks and potential adverse health effects on fish species could be dependent on ecological behavior and preferences. Conservation efforts particularly for endangered species could be better developed if relative risks and vulnerability of species are understood.",A validated HPTLC method for the simultaneous quantifications of three phenolic acids and three withanolides from Withania somnifera plants and its herbal products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200247,"Journal of chromatography.

The extraction efficiency of withanolides and phenolic acids were tested using two solvents, chloroform and methanol, respectively. HPTLC separation was performed on silica coated aluminium plates Si 60F254; using toluene, ethyl acetate and acetic acid (60:40:4). The samples were quantitated at 231 nm. The purity and identity of peaks of all the six analytes were confirmed by matching Rf values and UV-spectrum with authentic standards. The identity of three withanolides was further confirmed by positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analyses. The developed method was validated for sensitivity, linearity, reproducibility, accuracy, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) following the guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). The method was found to be linear (r > 0.99) in the range of 50-2000 ng/band for benzoic acid and 50-1000 ng/band for the other five studied metabolites.

The retention mechanism was discussed. The lipophilicity parameters obtained in conventional reversed-phase systems expressed as RM0 and C0, as well as RM values determined in microemulsion reversed-phase systems were correlated with in silico determined lipophilicity values. In silico pharmacokinetic properties of 2-(methoxy)phenylpiperazine dopamine D2 ligands revealed the importance of experimentally determined lipophilicity values besides the molecular weight, on the blood-brain barrier permeability process. Also, the experimentally determined lipophilicity was found as a very important factor in plasma protein binding process of 2-(methoxy)phenylpiperazine dopamine D2 ligands. Besides, the Lipinski's rule of five indicates that examined ligands satisfy the criterion of drug-like molecules. The principal component analysis was performed on the experimentally determined and calculated lipophilicity values as well on the molecular descriptors which describe the pharmacokinetic properties in order to provide basic insights into similarities among the studied ligands.",Innovative HPTLC method for simultaneous determination of ternary mixture of certain DMARDs in real samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients: an application of quality by design approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200245,"Journal of chromatography.

MTX, SSZ with HCQ are the most common disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) combination used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This ternary mixture with montelukast (MK) added as internal standard, were separated by using a mixture of ethyl acetate: methanol: 25% ammonia, (8: 2: 3, v/v/v) as a mobile phase system. The separation was achieved on HPTLC precoated silica gel plate 60 F254 and the detection was carried out at 306 nm for MTX and at 340 nm for both SSZ and HCQ. The design was planned to obtain the most optimum retardation factors (Rf) with best resolution.

In this study, we proposed an efficient ""fishing"" strategy to profile and identify non-targeted flavonoids from lotus plumule aqueous extract based on a self-built mass data ""pool"" with an untargeted mass data acquisition method in order to acquire comprehensive structural information of flavonoids in lotus plumule. This mass data acquisition method was applied by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-orbitrap HRMS) executed in full MS/dd-MS2 mode with different collision energies in positive ionization mode. The self-built targeted data ""pool"" was constructed by the basic structure of flavonoids in lotus plumule, such as odd quasi-molecular ions, C6-C3-C6 skeleton, molecular weight limit. The ""molecule lures"" of fishing are characterized by molecular features, fragmental patterns, characteristic fragments ions, relative abundance and retention times. More importantly, the special ""lures"" of PredRet (the tool of predicting the retention times) and ClogP (the calculated lipophilicity parameter) were adopted to distinguish some isomers and some compounds whose mass spectra are difficult to determine with no reference substances. The ""fished"" flavonoids were further confirmed by their molecular features and fragmental patterns.

For this purpose, a glass tube containing a glass membrane filter was fabricated and a new synthesized deep eutectic solvent with density lighter than water was used as an extractant. The extraction solvent was forced to pass through the glass filter under N2 stream and it was dispersed as the fine droplets in the sample solution. In this step, the analytes were transferred into the droplets. Due to low density of the extractant, it was collected on top of the sample solution without centrifugation. After performing the validation of the method, low limits of detection in the ranges of 2-17 and 4-36 ng L-1 in urine and plasma were obtained, respectively.

Here, we sought to determine whether visual motion signals from that incorporated rubber hand would provide relevant cues for sensing movement (i.e. kinesthesia). After 180 s of visuo-tactile synchronous or asynchronous stroking, the fake hand was moved along the lateral or the sagittal axis. After synchronous stroking, movement of the rubber hand induced illusory movement of the static (real) hand in the same direction; the illusion was slightly more frequent and more intense when the fake hand was moved along the sagittal axis. We therefore conclude that visual signals of motion originating from the rubber hand are integrated for kinesthesia by the central nervous system just as visual signals from the real hand are.",Probabilistic graphical model identifies clusters of EEG patterns in recordings from neonates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200241,Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,20190614,"In this paper we introduce a novel method for the evaluation of neonatal brain function via multivariate EEG (electroencephalography) signal processing and embedding into a probabilistic graph, the so called Chow-Liu tree."

Pristine PbSe and PbSe:G composites (with different amount of graphene) are synthesized via hydrothermal process and the formation mechanism is explained. The systematic investigation indicates that the crystallite size of PbSe:G increases with increasing graphene content. The PCE of the classical BHJ solar cells based on P3HT:PC61BM is improved from 2.32 up to 2.57% by the incorporation of pristine PbSe. It is also enhanced by the incorporation of PbSe:G up to certain composition of graphene in which a maximum PCE value of 5.16% is achieved.

Six semi-purified diets were formulated containing 25 (control), 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50% protein. Each diet was fed to three groups of 35 fish (mean initial weight: 5.86 ± 0.10 g) for 56 days. The rate of weight gain and specific growth rate increased with dietary protein levels from 25% to 40%, but remained unchanged when fed with 45 or 50% dietary protein. The feed conversion ratio was significantly influenced by the dietary protein levels, being the lowest in fish fed 40% protein. Illumina RNA-seq analysis was performed to investigate liver gene expression changes under different dietary protein treatments. A total of 367.78 million clean reads were obtained from the six libraries. Compared with 25% protein treatment library, there were 734, 1946, 1755, 2726, and 1523 upregulated genes, and 407, 1882, 1865, 2216 and 1624 downregulated genes in the 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50% protein treatment libraries, respectively. Trend analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified six statistically significant trends. A series of DEGs that related to protein metabolism, growth and development, lipid metabolism and immune and stress response were identified. Moreover, gene ontology enrichment analysis of the DEGs demonstrated that cellular process, single-organism process, metabolic process and biological regulation were the most highly overrepresented biological processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis revealed that protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, PPAR signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades, and cytochrome P450 (CYP450s) were significantly enriched in the dietary protein treatment groups.

The prepared materials were fully characterized by SEM/EDX, TEM, FTIR, XRD, UV-DRS, and VSM analysis. Rhodamin B (RhB) was selected as the pollutant model. The results showed that the Ag/AgCl@CFNMT had super-fast degradation ability of RhB molecule due to the synergetic effect between Ag/AgCl and CFNMT in comparison with NMT and CFNMT. The introduced Ag/AgCl on the surface of CFNMT increased absorption of photons in the visible region and enhanced the transfer and separation of the produced charge on the contact area between Ag/AgCl and CFNMT.

Characterization of the microsphere by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) confirmed that UiO-66 was adhered on the surface of Fe3O4 functionalized by TA. Adsorption experiments showed that the magnetic Fe3O4@TA@UiO-66 had high adsorption capacity for As(III) and Sb(III) and could be rapidly separated from aqueous media within two minutes after treatment. The adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms were described well by the pesudo-second order model and Langmuir model, respectively. In addition, the composite exhibited excellent removal performance for As(III) and Sb(III) in a broad solution chemistry environment, including pH and co-existing anions. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement, we proposed that the removal mechanism was mainly controlled through a synergistic interaction of surface complexation and hydrogen bonding.

The addition of ZnO improves the thermal stability of GG based on the ratio of the oxygen in the OH form and the total oxygen in the samples as indicated via XPS and FTIR analyses. Among all tested composites, the ZnO NPs/GG nanocomposite showed the highest photocatalytic activity and hence used in extended adsorption and degradation studies against the anionic dye reactive red (RR195) and the cationic dye Rhodamine B (RhB). The adsorption mechanism and kinetics were studied in details. The ZnO NPs/GG nanocomposite showed quite high removal efficiency for both dyes reaching about 96 degradation percent of the initial dye concentration as well as a high adsorption capacity reaching 70 mg g-1. The adsorption of both dyes on ZnO NPs/GG was found to obey the Freundlich adsorption model with pseudo-second-order kinetics. The antibacterial assay showed an enhanced antibacterial effect of ZnO/GG against E-Coli/TOP10 (PTA 10989) strain compared to pristine ZnO or pure guar gum.

It is possible that biochar accepts the electrons from low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) in soil and then transfer them to the acceptors, e.g., Cr(VI). This study evaluated the interaction between seven soil LMWOAs and peanut shell biochar (BC) as well as its effect on the electron shuttling of biochar for Cr(VI) reduction. Both redox reactions and sorption process occurred during the interaction of biochar and LMWOAs, which altered the contents of Cr(VI) reduction-relevant groups (i.e., CO and CO) on the surface of biochar. The redox reactions were more important to the electron transfer between biochar produced at 400℃ (BC400) and LMWOAs due to the repeated cycle of reduction-oxidation of surface functional groups. The reduction rate of Cr(VI) by LMWOAs mediated by BC400 was 1.10-7.09 × 10-3 h-1, among which tartaric acid had the best reduction efficiency due to its highest reducing capability. For biochar produced at 700℃ (BC700), the sorption process of LMWOAs was the key factor to the direct electron shuttling process through the conjugated structure of biochar. The reduction rate of Cr(VI) by LMWOAs mediated by BC700 was significantly higher and ranged 7.40-864 × 10-3 h-1, with the oxalic acid having the best reduction efficiency due to its highest sorption capacity by BC700. The results obtained from this study can help to establish the linkage between biochar and LMWOAs in soil electron network, which better explains the multifunctional roles of biochar during the redox processes such as Cr(VI) reduction in soil.","Nurses' perceptions of adolescents accessing and utilizing sexual and reproductive healthcare services in Cape Town, South Africa: A qualitative study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200221,International journal of nursing studies,20190614,"In Sub-Saharan Africa access to and utilization of sexual and reproductive healthcare is unsatisfactory.

Infants watched teaching events in which a cover was lowered over an object and released, with outcomes that violated object principles. The object became fully hidden under a cover that was much shorter, and it remained partly visible under a cover that was much taller. Next, infants watched two test events identical to the teaching events except that one of the events was modified to present a plausible outcome and thus deviated from teaching. Infants at 3.5 months readily detected the regularity in the teaching events and noticed the change in the modified test event, whereas 6.5-month-olds did not. The pattern of response was reversed (1) when 3.5-month-olds were primed to notice the violation of object principles in the teaching events, which interfered with EBL and led infants to miss the change in the modified test event; and (2) when 6.5-month-olds were provided ways to remove the violation from the teaching events, which enabled EBL and led infants to notice the change in the modified test event. Together, the results shed light on young infants' approach to learning about physical events-one that integrates SL for pattern detection and EBL for causal coherence of the rule being learned.",Simplicity and complexity preferences in causal explanation: An opponent heuristic account.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200208,Cognitive psychology,20190614,"People often prefer simple to complex explanations because they generally have higher prior probability. However, simpler explanations are not always normatively superior because they often do not account for the data as well as complex explanations. How do people negotiate this trade-off between prior probability (favoring simple explanations) and goodness-of-fit (favoring complex explanations)? Here, we argue that people use opponent heuristics to simplify this problem-that people use simplicity as a cue to prior probability but complexity as a cue to goodness-of-fit. Study 1 finds direct evidence for this claim. In subsequent studies, we examine factors that lead one or the other heuristic to predominate in a given context. Studies 2 and 3 find that people have a stronger simplicity preference in deterministic rather than stochastic contexts, while Studies 4 and 5 find that people have a stronger simplicity preference for physical rather than social causal systems, suggesting that people use abstract expectations about causal texture to modulate their explanatory inferences. Together, we argue that these cues and contextual moderators act as powerful constraints that can help to specify the otherwise ill-defined problem of what distributions to use in Bayesian hypothesis comparison.","The euryhaline pygmy mussel, Xenostrobus securis, is a useful biomonitor of key metal contamination in the highly urbanised Sydney Estuary, Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200207,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",20190614,"This study critically evaluated the native pygmy mussel (Xenostrobus securis) as a biomonitor of the key metal contaminants in the highly urbanised Sydney Estuary, south-eastern Australia. Five metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) were identified as key contaminants, based on their enrichment factors (EFs) in the whole soft tissue of X. securis at 24 sampling sites, relative to baseline values from near-pristine reference sites in the adjacent Hawkesbury Estuary. Inverse relationships established between mussel size (dry tissue weight) and tissue concentrations of each metal were used to reduce variance (by 4-fold) among individuals; gender and reproductive status had no significant (p > 0.05) effect on tissue metal concentrations in X. securis. Metal concentrations in three environmental matrices - filtered (<0.2 μm) surface water (operationally defined as the dissolved/colloidal phase), suspended particulate matter (SPM; >0.2 μm) and surface sediment (<2 mm particle size), which are most relevant to a suspension-feeding estuarine bivalve, were also determined at each sampling site. For each of the five metals, highly significant (p < 0.01) positive linear regressions were established between metal EFs for mussel tissue and each environmental matrix. Metals in surface sediment and SPM explained 80-91% and 81-90%, respectively, of the variability in metal concentrations in mussel tissue, with filtered surface water explaining 74-86%. Cumulative mussel tissue EFs of all five metals, when regressed against each environmental matrix, showed that surface sediment concentrations explained 93% of their variability between sites, SPM 94% and filtered surface water 87-90%. Hence, X. securis very closely reflects the metal concentrations in its aquatic environment. The study provides a quality-assured benchmark of key metal contamination in the Sydney Estuary, and an appropriate methodology that may be used to discern any changes in metal contaminant status using X. securis.","Fate of 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid in pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) based on hydroponic culture: Uptake, translocation and biotransformation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200206,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",20190614,"6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA) is currently used as an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and is widely detected in the environment. The uptake, translocation and biotransformation of 6:2 FTSA in pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) were investigated by hydroponic exposure for the first time. The root concentration factor (RCF) of 6:2 FTSA was 2.6-24.2 times as high as those of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) of the same or much shorter carbon chain length, demonstrating much higher bioaccumulative ability of 6:2 FTSA in pumpkin roots. The translocation capability of 6:2 FTSA from root to shoot depended on its hydrophobicity. Six terminal perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) metabolites, including perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluoropropionic acid (PFPrA) and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) were found in pumpkin roots and shoots. PFHpA was the primary metabolite in roots, while PFBA was the major product in shoots. 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), a cytochromes P450 (CYPs) suicide inhibitor, could decrease the concentrations of PFCA products with dose-dependent relationships in pumpkin tissues, implying the role of CYP enzymes involved in plant biotransformation of 6:2 FTSA. This study indicated that the application of 6:2 FTSA can lead to the occurrence of PFCAs (C2-C7) in plants.",Relative effects of wind-induced disturbances and vegetation on tetrabromobisphenol A cycling in shallow lakes: Direct and indirect effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200205,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",20190614,"The environmental concerns regarding the possible threats of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) to aquatic environments are increasing. However, information about TBBPA cycling in the water-vegetation-sediment systems of shallow lakes is limited. In a shallow lake, wind-induced disturbance is considered as the key factor of affecting the cycling of contaminants. To address this issue, the TBBPA distribution and elimination processes were simulated for three typical wind speeds by using an annular flume. Four forms of TBBPA were studied in these systems, including water, suspended solids (SS), vegetation and sediment. The results showed that the mass distributions of TBBPA in water, SS and vegetation increased remarkably while enhancing the wind-induced disturbances, which resulted from the release of TBBPA from the sediment through resuspension and adsorption-desorption processes. However, most of the TBBPA (up to 94%) still accumulated in the sediment. Wind-induced disturbances and vegetation both increased the TBBPA elimination rate in the water-vegetation-sediment systems. The half-life (T1/2) of TBBPA in the fast wind condition was 16.1 ± 0.2 days, which was shorter than that in the static condition (29.8 ± 0.9 days). Compared to the systems without vegetation, the presence of vegetation shortened the T1/2 by 7.3 days in the static condition. Furthermore, a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of environmental factors on the TBBPA amounts in each form. The main effects of wind speed and vegetation in the TBBPA cycling of each form (except for the TBBPA on vegetation) were indirect by affecting the dissolved oxygen (DO), velocity and suspended solids concentration (SSC). Overall, the findings provide useful information about the fate of TBBPA and other related organic contaminants in shallow lake systems.",Abundances and concentrations of brominated azo dyes detected in indoor dust.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200204,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",20190614,"Dust samples were collected from four indoor environments, including childcare facilities, houses, hair salons, and a research facility from the USA and were analyzed for brominated compounds using full scan liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. A total of 240 brominated compounds were detected in these dust samples, and elemental formulas were predicted for 120 more abundant ions. In addition to commonly detected brominated flame retardants (BFRs), nitrogen-containing brominated azo dyes (BADs) were among the most frequently detected and abundant. Specifically, greater abundances of BADs were detected in indoor dusts from daycares and salons compared to houses and the research facility. Using authentic standards, a quantitative method was established for two BADs (DB373: Disperse Blue 373 and DV93: Disperse Violet 93) and 2-bromo-4,6-dinitroaniline, a commonly used precursor in azo dye production, in indoor dust. Generally, greater concentrations of DB373 (≤3850 ng/g) and DV93 (≤1190 ng/g) were observed in indoor dust from daycares highlighting children as a susceptible population to potential health risk from exposure to BADs. These data are important because, to date, targeted analysis of brominated compounds in indoor environments has focused mainly on BFRs and appears to underestimate the total amount of brominated compounds.","1,4-Dioxane cosolvency impacts on trichloroethene dissolution and sorption.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200203,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",20190614,"Solvent stabilizer 1,4-dioxane, an emerging recalcitrant groundwater contaminant, was commonly added to chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethene (TCE), and the impact of co-disposal on contaminant transport processes remains uncertain. A series of batch equilibrium experiments was conducted with variations of 1,4-dioxane and TCE composition to evaluate aqueous dissolution of the two components and their sorption to aquifer sediments. The solubility of TCE increased with increasing amounts of 1,4-dioxane, indicating that 1,4-dioxane acts as a cosolvent causing solubility enhancement of co-contaminants. The solubilization results compared favorably with predictions using the log-linear cosolvency model. Equilibrium sorption coefficients (Kd and Kf) were also measured for different 1,4-dioxane and TCE compositions, and the findings indicate that both contaminants adsorb to aquifer sediments and TCE Kd values increased with increasing organic matter content. However, the Kd for TCE decreased with increases in 1,4-dioxane concentration, which was attributed to cosolvency impacts on TCE solubility. These findings further advance our understanding of the mass-transfer processes controlling groundwater plumes containing 1,4-dioxane, and also have implications for the remediation of 1,4-dioxane contamination.",Monitoring of explosive residues in lake-bottom water using Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) and chemcatcher: determination of transfer kinetics through Polyethersulfone (PES) membrane is crucial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200202,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",20190614,"Between 1920 and 1967, approximatively 8200 tons of ammunition waste were dumped into some Swiss lakes. This study is part of the extensive historical and technical investigations performed since 1995 by Swiss authorities to provide a risk assessment. It aims to assess whether explosive monitoring by passive sampling is feasible in lake-bottom waters. Polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) and Chemcatcher were first calibrated in a channel system supplied with continuously refreshed lake water spiked with two nitroamines (HMX and RDX), one nitrate ester (PETN), and six nitroaromatics (including TNT). Exposure parameters were kept as close as possible to the ones expected at the bottom of two affected lakes. Sixteen POCIS and Chemcatcher were simultaneously deployed in the channel system and removed in duplicates at 8 different intervals over 21 days. Sorbents and polyethersulfone (PES) membranes were separately extracted and analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS. When possible, a three-compartment model was used to describe the uptake of compounds from water, over the PES membrane into the sorbent. Uptake of target compounds by sorbents was shown not to approach equilibrium during 21 days. However, nitroaromatics strongly accumulated in PES, thus delaying the transfer of these compounds to sorbents (lag-phase up to 9 days). Whereas sampling rate (RS) of nitroamines were in the range of 0.06-0.14 L day-1, RS of nitroaromatics were up to 10 times lower. As nitroaromatic accumulation in PES was integrative over 21 days, PES was used as receiving phase for these compounds. The samplers were then deployed at lake bottoms. To ensure that exposure conditions were similar between calibration and field experiments, low-density polyethylene strips spiked with performance reference compounds were co-deployed in both experiments and dissipation data were compared. Integrative concentrations of explosives measured in the lakes confirmed results obtained by previous studies based on grab sampling.","Distribution, availability and translocation of heavy metals in soil-oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) system related to soil properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200201,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",20190614,"Heavy metals contamination in agricultural soil has become a worldwide problem, and soil characteristics modulate metal availability in soils. Four field experiments were conducted simultaneously to evaluate concentration and distribution of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in 39 oilseed rape cultivars at four agricultural locations with different contamination levels of Cd and Pb, as well as the influence of soil characteristics together with soil total and bioavailable Cd and Pb concentration on metal transfer from soil to oilseed rape. Shoot concentrations of Cd and Pb in oilseed rape cultivars ranged from 0.09 to 3.18 and from 0.01 to 10.5 mg kg-1 across four sites. For most cultivars, Cd concentration in root or shoot were higher than pod and lowest in seed, while the highest Pb concentration was observed in root followed by shoot and seed. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis allows for a better estimation of Cd and Pb concentration in oilseed rape while taking soil properties into consideration. The results demonstrated that Cd and Pb concentration in oilseed rape were correlated with soil organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), sand, soil total and available Cd and Pb concentration, and R2 varied from 0.993 to 0.999 (P < 0.05). The Cd and Pb levels found in oilseed rape indicated its phytoextraction potential for Cd and Pb co-contaminated agricultural soils in winter without stopping agricultural activities.",Evaluation of the effectiveness of a bioremediation process in experimental soils polluted with chromium and lindane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200198,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,20190614,"Bioremediation using actinobacterium consortia proved to be a promising alternative for the purification of co-contaminated environments. In this sense, the quadruple consortium composed of Streptomyces sp. M7, MC1, A5, and Amycolatopsis tucumanensis AB0 has been able to remove significant levels of Cr(VI) and lindane from anthropogenically contaminated soils. However, the effectiveness of the bioremediation process could not be evaluated only by analytical monitoring, which is complex mainly due to the characteristics of the matrix, producing non-quantitative analyte recoveries, or interferences in the detection stage and quantification. However, the effectiveness of the bioremediation process cannot be evaluated only through analytical monitoring, which is complex due mainly to the characteristics of the matrix, to the recoveries of non-quantitative analytes or to interferences in the detection and quantification stage. For this reason, it is essential to have tools of ecological relevance to assess the biological impact of pollutants on the environment. In this context, the objective of this work was to establish the appropriate bioassays to evaluate the effectiveness of a bioremediation process of co-contaminated soils. For this, five model species were studied: four plant species (Lactuca sativa, Raphanus sativus, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays) and one animal species (Eisenia fetida). On plant species, the biomarkers evaluated were inhibition of germination (IG) and the length of hypocotyls/steam and radicles/roots of the seedling. While on E. fetida, mortality (M), weight lost, coelomocyte concentration and cell viability were tested. These bioindicators and the battery of biomarkers quantified in them showed a different level of sensitivity, from maximum to minimum: E. fetida > L. esculentum > L. sativa > R. sativus ≫>Z. mays. Therefore, E. fetida and L. esculentum and their respective biomarkers were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the bioremediation process due to the capability of assessing the effect on the flora and the fauna of the soil, respectively. The joint application of these bioindicators in a field scale bioremediation process is a feasible tool to demonstrate the recovery of the quality and health of the soil."

Large deposits of amyloid fibrils are typically associated with cell death in late stage pathology.

From the single sequence-specific DNA replication origin of the small Escherichia coli genome, up to thousands of origins that are necessary to replicate the large human genome, strict sequence specificity has been lost. Nevertheless, genome-wide analyses performed in the recent years, using different mapping methods, demonstrated that there are precise locations along the metazoan genome from which replication initiates. These sites contain relaxed sequence consensus and epigenetic features. There is flexibility in the choice of origins to be used during a given cell cycle, probably imposed by evolution and developmental constraints.

The majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease that has spread beyond the ovaries to the peritoneum or to distant organs (stage FIGO III-IV) with a 5-year overall survival of about 29%. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Among the factors that contribute to cancer development, lipids and ion channels have been described to be associated to cancerous diseases particularly in breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Here, we reviewed the literature data to determine how lipids or lipid metabolites may influence EOC risk or progression. We also highlighted the role and the expression of the calcium (Ca2+) and calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels in EOC and how lipids might regulate them. Although lipids and some subclasses of nutritional lipids may be associated to EOC risk, lipid metabolism of LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) and AA (arachidonic acid) emerges as an important signaling network in EOC. Clinical data showed that they are found at high concentrations in EOC patients and in vitro and in vivo studies referred to them as triggers of the Ca2+entry in the cancer cells inducing their proliferation, migration or drug resistance. The cross-talk between lipid mediators and Ca2+ and/or KCa channels needs to be elucidated in EOC in order to facilitate the understanding of its outcomes and potentially suggest novel therapeutic strategies including treatment and prevention.",The determinants of China's national and regional energy-related mercury emission changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200183,Journal of environmental management,20190614,"As the world's largest energy-related mercury emitter, proper reduction policy is urgently needed in China. However, a quantitative analysis on how different factors affect China's national and regional mercury emissions has been lacking, which hinders the design and implementation of mercury control strategies. To fill the knowledge gap, this study applies a temporal and spatial logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model to reveal the important determinants of mercury emissions across China from 2007 to 2015. The results show a descendant trend generally in energy-related mercury emissions at both national and regional level. Economic scale is the main driving factor while its effect is largely offset by the decreasing mercury emission and energy intensities. However, Jiangsu and Shanxi in 2012-2015 are exceptions with emission growth because of their rebounded emission factors and energy intensities. Moreover, a decoupling effect between energy-related mercury emissions and GDP growth is found, reflecting that there is ongoing green energy transition in China. The spatial decomposition verifies that effects of economic scale and energy intensity are the mainly determinants for mercury emission differences between national average and provincial emissions. Other factors' effects are prominent in several provinces such as Xinjiang, Chongqing and Heilongjiang, where the emission gap is primarily resulted by the differences between national and local mercury intensities. By identifying the determinants of emission changes as well as the differences between the national average and provincial emissions, this study provides insights for formulating more targeted mercury mitigation strategies.","Management feasibility of established invasive plant species in Queensland, Australia: A stakeholders' perspective.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200182,Journal of environmental management,20190614,"Managing and monitoring invasive alien species (IAS) is costly, and because resources are limited, prioritization decisions are required for planning and management. We present findings on plant pest prioritization for 63 established invader species of natural and grazing ecosystems of Queensland, Australia. We used an expert elicitation approach to assess risk (species occurrence, spread, and impact) and feasibility of control for each IAS. We elicit semi-quantitative responses from diverse expert stakeholders to score IAS on three management approaches (biocontrol, chemical and mechanical) in relation to cost, effectiveness and practicality, and incorporate uncertainty in expert inputs and model outputs. In the process, we look for promising management opportunities as well as seek general trends across species' ecological groups and management methods. Stakeholders were cautiously optimistic about the feasibility of managing IAS. Taking into consideration all factors, the overall feasibility of control was uncorrelated with the stakeholders' level of confidence. However, within individual management criterion, positive trend was observed for the same bivariate traits for chemical control, and negative trends for biocontrol and mechanical controls. Utility and confidence in IAS management options were in the order: chemical > biocontrol = mechanical, with practicality and effectiveness being the main driver components. Management feasibility differed significantly between IAS life forms but not between habitats invaded. Lastly, we combined IAS risk assessment and management feasibility scores to create a risk matrix to guide policy goals (i.e. eradication, spread containment, protection of sensitive sites, targeted control, site management, monitoring, and limited action). The matrix identifies promising species to target for each of these policy outcomes. Overall, our general approach illustrates (i) the importance of understanding the feasibility of IAS control actions and the factors that drive it, and (ii) demonstrates how quantifying management feasibility can be used to enhance traditional risk assessment rankings to improve policy outcomes.",Fluoride removal from natural volcanic underground water by an electrocoagulation process: Parametric and cost evaluations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200181,Journal of environmental management,20190614,"Excessive fluoride content in groundwater can cause serious risks to human health, and sources of groundwater intended for human consumption should be treated to reduce fluoride concentrations down to acceptable levels. In the particular case of the island of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain), the water supply comes mainly from aquifers of volcanic origin with a high content of fluorides that make them unacceptable for human consumption without prior conditioning treatment. The treatments that generate a high rejection of water are not acceptable because water is a scarce natural resource of high value. An electrocoagulation process was investigated as a method to treat natural groundwater from volcanic soils containing a hazardously high fluoride content. The operating parameters of an electrocoagulation reactor model with parallel plate aluminum electrodes were optimized for batch and continuous flow operations. In the case of the batch operation, acidification of the water improved the removal efficiency of fluoride, which was the highest at pH 3. However, operation at the natural pH of the water achieved elimination efficiencies between 82 and 92%, depending on the applied current density. An optimum current density of 5 mA/cm2 was found in terms of maximum removal efficiency, and the kinetics of fluoride removal conformed to pseudo-second-order kinetics. In the continuous-flow operation, with the optimal residence time of 10 min and a separation of 0.5 cm between the electrodes, it was observed that the current density that would be applied would depend on the initial concentration of fluoride in the raw water. Thus, an initial fluoride concentration of 6.02 mg/L required a current density >7.5 mA/cm2 to comply with the legal guidelines in the product water, while for an initial concentration of 8.98 mg/L, the optimal current density was 10 mA/cm2. Under these operating conditions, the electrocoagulation process was able to reduce the fluoride concentration of natural groundwater to below 1.5 mg/L according to WHO guidelines with an operating cost between 0.20 and 0.26 €/m3 of treated water.",Physically-based urban stormwater quality modelling: An efficient approach for calibration and sensitivity analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200180,Journal of environmental management,20190614,"Physically-based urban stormwater quality modelling is helpful for increasing the understanding of spatial-temporal dynamics of urban pollution, and for designing innovative management technologies. However, because of the high computational cost, calibration and validation of physically-based models is still challenging. In this context, this study aims to develop a new meta-model based framework for efficient calibration and sensitivity analysis of complex and computationally intensive physically-based models. The proposed approach is applied to the FullSWOF-HR model. According to the average rainfall intensity, 21 rainfall events are categorized into three groups, such as 9 light rains, 6 moderate rains and 6 heavy rains. After upscaling the original high-resolution model, 77 parameter nodes are selected by using the adaptive stochastic collocation method with sparse grids algorithm on the lower-resolution surrogate. 77 simulation runs are then performed with the original model for three representative rainfall events, respectively. The interpolating polynomials of the original models are hence generated. Once the meta-model is constructed, we performed the sensitivity analysis with the variance-based Sobol's method, the results of which are consistent with our previous studies. Calibration process of the meta-model is based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The optimized parameters are verified with the original model and then validated for different rainfall events. These promising results show that the proposed meta-model based approach can efficiently perform sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization for complex physical stormwater quality models, and hence will be very helpful for spreading the detailed water quantity and quality modelling for urban water management issues.",Constructed wetland for wastewater reuse: Role and efficiency in removing enteric pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200179,Journal of environmental management,20190614,"Water stress has become a perennial concern in most of the developing countries due to rapid urbanization and population growth. As the growing population requires more fresh water and better ways for wastewater disposal, the demand for wastewater reclamation has increased drastically in recent years. Wastewater, either raw or treated, is being widely used for agricultural irrigation in developing countries, which cause a serious threat to human health mainly because of its pathogenic content. One of the alternative methods to treat wastewater and make it reusable for agricultural irrigation is to implement constructed wetland (CW); a sustainable and cost-effective technology that is applicable for the elimination of both pollutants and pathogens from wastewater. Despite its wide application, the role of macrophytes that form an integral part of CW and specific mechanisms involved in pathogen removal by them is still barely understood due to complexities involved and influencing factors. This has, therefore, attracted various scientific studies to reveal further functional mechanisms involved in vegetated CW to increase its proficiencies. This review paper illustrates the comparative studies of different CW and their pathogen removal efficiencies with major emphasis on macrophytes involved and factors influencing related mechanism.

The ultimate objective is to further clarify the role of CW in enteric pathogen removal and its efficiency for wastewater purification in perspective with safe reuse in agriculture.",Difficulties for cost-benefit analysis in the 2020 environmental impact statement to recover the endangered wild salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River Basin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200178,Journal of environmental management,20190614,"Runs of the endangered wild salmon/steelhead in the Columbia River basin may be only two to seven percent of historic levels. These fish are a common-pool resource, where stakeholders over-consume, pollute rivers and oceans, block passage with dams and culverts, operate net pen fish farms, and plant huge numbers of hatchery fish that compete with and hybridize wild fish. Rivers provide free or subsidized services that stakeholders covet, however recovery of the endangered wild fish requires that peoples utilizing the rivers and the ocean must constrain their behavior, often reducing their profit. A new Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and cost-benefit analysis are in progress for recovery of the endangered wild salmon/steelhead in the Columbia River basin. New regulations require surveys of U.S. households to measure the non-use benefits of salmon/steelhead recovery that can be important for endangered species. We review the 2002 EIS for juvenile salmon migration on the lower Snake River tributary to find mistakes to avoid in the new EIS and in other recovery studies.",Boron toxicity induced specific changes of cell ultrastructure and architecture of components in leaf center and tip of trifoliate orange [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200177,Journal of environmental management,20190614,"The distribution of boron (B) in leaves is far from uniform, and tolerance to B toxicity should be varied in different portions of an entire leaf. Here, according to the order and degree of leaf chlorosis, a whole leaf blade of trifoliate orange [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.] rootstock was divided into two segments-leaf tip and leaf center, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to obtain more detailed information on the cell ultrastructure and component architecture of the two leaf segments under B toxicity. Results revealed that B toxicity led to alterations in pectin network crosslinking structure of leaf tip and destruction of cell wall integrity. Moreover, B toxicity altered protein structure and decreased protein content, while increased carbohydrate content in the two leaf segments, especially in leaf tip. Excess B supply reduced the cellulose content in leaf tip but increased in leaf center. TEM micrographs exhibited chloroplast disintegration and plastoglobulus accumulation in cells of two different leaf sections of B-toxicity plants, with less pronounced changes in leaf center. Furthermore, B toxicity only induced accumulation of starch grains in cells of leaf center. Overall results indicated that the B-toxic-induced biochemical changes of the cell ultrastructure and component architecture greatly differed in leaf tip and center. This study facilitates a better understanding of structural changes in different leaf portions of P. trifoliata under B toxicity stress and provides new ideas for further research on other elements in different plant leaf portions."

In this study, 11 contaminated soils from mining/smelting areas were analyzed for As-, Cd-, and Pb-RBA using a mouse bioassay and metal bioaccessibility via the UBM gastric phase assay. Metal-RBA varied considerably among soils, with As-RBA (2.5-23%, mean 12%) being generally lower than Cd-and Pb-RBA (3.4-88 and 3.3-59%, mean 42 and 28%), due to higher proportions of As in the residual fractions. Metal-RBA generally decreased with increasing metal concentrations probably due to reduced labile metal fractions. In addition, strong negative correlations were observed between total Fe with As-, Cd-, and Pb-RBA (R2 = 0.46-0.77), suggesting the role of Fe in controlling metal-RBA in soils. Like RBA, metal bioaccessibility by the UBM assay also varied among samples. However, strong in vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVCs) were observed between metal-RBA and bioaccessibility (R2 = 0.52-0.81). Further, there were little differences when As-, Cd-, and Pb-IVIVCs established using soils from this study and soils pooled from literature were compared, suggesting the robustness of the UBM assay to predict metal-RBA in contaminated soils.",Using phenome-wide association studies to examine the effect of environmental exposures on human health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200158,Environment international,20190614,"The field of environmental epidemiology has been using ""-omics"" technologies, including the exposome, metabolome, and methylome, to understand the potential effects and biological pathways of a number of environmental pollutants. However, the majority of studies have focused on a single disease or phenotype, and have not systematically considered patterns of multimorbidity and whether environmental pollutants have pleiotropic effects. These questions could be addressed by examining the relation between environmental exposures and the phenome - the patterns and profiles of human health that individuals experience from birth to death. By conducting Phenome Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), we can generate new hypotheses about new or poorly understood exposures, identify novel associations for established toxicants, and better understand biological pathways affected by environmental pollutants. In this article, we provide a conceptual framework for conducting PheWAS in environmental epidemiology and summarize some of the advantages and challenges to using the PheWAS to study environmental pollutant exposures. Ultimately, by adding the PheWAS to our ""-omics"" toolbox, we could substantially improve our understanding of the potential health effects of environmental pollutants.",Physico-chemical properties and gestational diabetes predict transplacental transfer and partitioning of perfluoroalkyl substances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200157,Environment international,20190614,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a growing public health concern.

A new perspective was put forward to reduce the potential ecological toxicity of neonicotinoid dinotefuran to honeybee in terms of an enantiomeric level in the study. Toxicity of dinotefuran was enantioselective, and S-dinotefuran was 41.1- to 128.4-fold more toxic than R-dinotefuran to honeybee Apis mellifera (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), whereas R-dinotefuran exhibited comparative insecticidal activities (1.7-2.4 times) to typical sucking pests Aphis gossypii and Apolygus lucorum compared to racemic mixtures. Our data suggested that use of R-dinotefuran could have a good efficacy in controlling target pests while minimizing hazard to honeybees. The mechanism for chiral specific toxicity to honeybee was further characterized by electrophysiological studies and molecular docking. S-dinotefuran appears to be more toxic by binding to α8 subunit of nAChR of Apis mellifera. The α8 also have a more stable, functional binding cavity to S-dinotefuran with a higher binding score of 7.15, primarily due to an extensive hydrogen bond network. Therefore, new chiral products with a high proportion of or an enantiomeric pure R-dinotefuran are recommended to achieve effective pests control reducing hazard to honeybee populations."

Therefore, targeting the stemness of CRC forms a basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. However, the pain and systemic side effect from long-term of venipuncture injection remain great challenges to neoplastic treatment. Here, we introduce an oral drug delivery system for sustained release of BMI-1 inhibitor (PTC209) that reverses the stemness of CRC to overcome these obstacles. In this system, nanoparticles modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) showed high-affinity to CD44/CD168 overexpressed-CRC cells, and efficiently targeted to tumor site in a metastatic orthotropic colon cancer mouse model by oral administration. Significantly, the observed tumor growth inhibition is accompanied by decreased expression of stemness markers in the tumor tissues. Furthermore, HA-NPs-PTC209 also significantly prevented metastasis to the gastrointestinal system, while failing to exhibit acute side effects. In summary, we have developed an orally active, easily synthesized nanomedicine that shows promise for the treatment of colon cancer.",Thermosensitive hydrogels for sustained-release of sorafenib and selenium nanoparticles for localized synergistic chemoradiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200144,Biomaterials,20190614,"In this study, we synthesized a thermosensitive composite of Gel-SOR-LUF-SeNPs to achieve the localized synergistic chemoradiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib (SOR) is one of the important clinical drugs for unresectable and advanced HCC. However, the uncontrollable release of SOR induced drug resistance and severe side effects. Recently, thermosensitive hydrogels have emerged as promising drug-delivery carriers, due to their superior advantages including biodegradability, low-toxicity, high drug loading, site-specificity, sustained and controlled drug release behavior. We synthesized the thermosensitive hydrogel nanosystem (Gel-SOR-LUF-SeNPs) as an effective drug release depot with the combination of radiotherapy for the localized and sustained treatment of HCC. The results showed that SOR was released continuously from Gel-SOR-LUF-SeNPs with the degradation of the hydrogel for a prolonged period (over 15 days). The combination of localized and chemoradiotherapy accelerated the apoptosis of HepG2 cells through reducing the expression of Ki67 and CD34, and activating caspase-3 signaling pathway. Further studies demonstrated that this nanosystem showed site-specific and long-term anticancer effects in mice up to 21 days after single subcutaneous injection, and no obvious side effects of mice were found. Taken together, this study presents a local and long-term treatment for HCC, which may shed light on unresectable HCC therapy in the future.",Neurturin-containing laminin matrices support innervated branching epithelium from adult epithelial salispheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200143,Biomaterials,20190614,"Cell transplantation of autologous adult biopsies, grown ex vivo as epithelial organoids or expanded as spheroids, are proposed treatments to regenerate damaged branching organs. However, it is not clear whether transplantation of adult organoids or spheroids alone is sufficient to initiate a fetal-like program of branching morphogenesis in which coordinated branching of multiple cell types including nerves, mesenchyme and blood vessels occurs. Yet this is an essential concept for the regeneration of branching organs such as lung, pancreas, and lacrimal and salivary glands. Here, we used factors identified from fetal organogenesis to maintain and expand adult murine and human epithelial salivary gland progenitors in non-adherent spheroid cultures, called salispheres. These factors stimulated critical developmental pathways, and increased expression of epithelial progenitor markers such as Keratin5, Keratin14, FGFR2b and KIT. Moreover, physical recombination of adult salispheres in a laminin-111 extracellular matrix with fetal salivary mesenchyme, containing endothelial and neuronal cells, only induced branching morphogenesis when neurturin, a neurotrophic factor, was added to the matrix. Neurturin was essential to improve neuronal survival, axon outgrowth, innervation of the salispheres, and resulted in the formation of branching structures with a proximal-distal axis that mimicked fetal branching morphogenesis, thus recapitulating organogenesis. Epithelial progenitors were also maintained, and developmental differentiation programs were initiated, showing that the fetal microenvironment provides a template for adult epithelial progenitors to initiate branching and differentiation. Further delineation of secreted and physical cues from the fetal niche will be useful to develop novel regenerative therapies that instruct adult salispheres to resume a developmental-like program in vitro and to regenerate branching organs in vivo.",Pediatric nurses' perceptions of their role in antimicrobial stewardship: A focus group study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200142,Journal of pediatric nursing,20190614,To explore pediatric nurses' perceptions of their role in antimicrobial stewardship.,Linking microbial diversity and population dynamics to the removal efficiency of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in an anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A2O) system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200141,Chemosphere,20190614,"The removal efficiencies (REs) of nineteen pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (six antibiotics-clarithromycin, ofloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim -, four β-blockers -atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and sotalol-, two antihypertensives/diuretics -furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide-, three lipid regulators -bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil-, and four psychiatric medications -carbamazepine, diazepam, lorazepam and paroxetine) were ascertained in a pilot-scale anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A2O) system treating urban wastewater, long term operated during two experimental phases using different sets of environmental conditions and operating parameters. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the structure, diversity and population dynamics of bacteria, archaea and fungi communities in the activated sludge. The results showed that mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M) were operational parameters significantly influencing the REs of five of the analyzed PhACs in the A2O system. Biota-environment (BIO-ENV) analysis revealed strong correlations between population shifts of the activated sludge community and the REs of PhACs of the different pharmaceutical families. Increased REs of clarithromycin, furosemide, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were concomitant to higher relative abundances of bacterial phylotypes classified within the Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae (Alphaproteobacteria), while those of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Methanomethylovorans (Euryarchaea) correlated positively with the REs of up to seven PhACs belonging to different therapeutic groups.",An ecotoxicological assessment of mine tailings from three Norwegian mines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200140,Chemosphere,20190614,"The study assessed the environmental toxicity of three Norwegian mine tailings from Omya Hustadmarmor, Sydvaranger, and Sibelco, which are all released into a seawater recipient.

Overall, based on the toxicity evaluation of the transformation/dissolution data, Sibelco tailings resulted in the highest toxicity albeit at relatively high concentrations, followed by Sydvaranger and Hustadmarmor. Sibelco was the only mine where process chemicals were not used. In contrast, the Corophium sediment contact assay revealed a significantly higher toxicity exerted by Hustadmarmor tailings, which may indicate a physical impact of the fine tailings.

Key experimental parameters such as adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial oil concentration and pH were evaluated for Optipore L493, Amberlite IRA 958, Amberlite XAD 7 and Lewatit AF 5. Oil removal rates upwards of 98% were achieved using AF 5, XAD 7 and L493. IRA 958 recorded very modest removal rates of less than 25%. Isotherm data were further investigated and fitted using Langmuir, Freundlich, Toth, Flory Huggins and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. The results show that the adsorption onto XAD 7 and L 493 is a multilayer adsorption process over a heterogeneous surface that is best illustrated by the Freundlich and Toth models respectively. The Dubinin-Radushkevich best described the removal using AF 5 resin that assumes that the adsorption process occurs on a heterogenous surface with a gaussian energy distribution. Kinetic studies assessing the rate of removal for each resin were conducted. Experimental results were best fitted using pseudo second order kinetics. It is concluded that XAD 7 had the highest kinetics among all tested resins. Also, AF 5 exhibited the highest adsorption capacity.

However, molecular response triggered by Cu have remained largely unknown in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. In the present study, we performed transcriptomic analysis to characterize molecular mechanisms of copper immunotoxicity in gills from M. rosenbergii. A large number of potential simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci in the transcriptome were identified. 19,417 and 8989 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained at 3 h and 48 h after exposure, respectively. Most of these DEGs were down-regulated implying that gene expressions were largely inhibited by Cu, which might lead to impairments of biological functions. Functional enrichment analysis of these DEGs revealed that immune, detoxification and apoptosis were the differentially regulated processes by Cu stress. 12 DGEs involved in immune response and heavy metal detoxification were discovered and validated by qRT-PCR. The results indicated that the M. rosenbergii might counteract the toxicity of Cu at the transcriptomic level by increasing expressions of immune- and heavy metal detoxification-related genes, and these selected genes could be used as molecular indicators for Cu stress. Our study firstly reported the stress response at transcriptional level in M. rosenbergii during Cu exposure. The genes and pathways identified here not only give us new insight into molecular mechanisms underlying Cu toxicity effects in prawn, but facilitate biomarker identification and stress-resistant breeding studies.","Nootropic drugs: Methylphenidate, modafinil and piracetam - Population use trends, occurrence in the environment, ecotoxicity and removal methods - A review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200137,Chemosphere,20190614,"Pharmaceuticals which originally were designed to treat people with neurological and psychiatric conditions, e.g. Alzheimer's disease or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are nowadays often misused by students as a 'brain doping' substances. These substances are known as nootropic drugs, smart drugs or cognitive enhancers, as they increase memory, attention and concentration of healthy individuals. Since they are easily available illicitly, their consumption is observed to be growing. Currently, these pharmaceuticals started gaining researchers' attention, especially since they have been recently detected in wastewater, surface water and even drinking water. This review summarises the current state of knowledge on nootropic drugs in terms of their population use trends and ethics, occurrence in the environment and detection techniques, toxicity and removal methods, in example of methylphenidate, modafinil and piracetam - three most popular nootropics. It points out that the main sources of knowledge on cognitive enhancers illicit use are often inconsistent questionnaires, which are not supported by wastewater analysis to become more veracious. Simultaneously, the studies concerning toxicity and removal methods of nootropic drugs are still limited and in many cases environmentally irrelevant. Although the prescription rules has been subjected to more strict control in developed countries, regulatory frameworks with regard to their ecosystem occurrence are still lacking and should be introduced. Moreover, the use of environmentally relevant concentrations in toxicity studies should be a standard, leading to proper ecotoxicity risk assessment. Based on this review, it is recommended to routinely monitor nootropics and their metabolites in waste- and surface waters.","Electrochemical removal of amoxicillin using a Cu doped PbO2 electrode: Electrode characterization, operational parameters optimization and degradation mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200136,Chemosphere,20190614,"This work investigated the electrochemical degradation of amoxicillin (AMX) in aqueous solution with Cu-PbO2 electrode. The main inﬂuence factors on the degradation of AMX, such as Na2SO4 concentration, initial AMX concentration, current density and initial pH value, were analyzed in detail. Under the optimal conditions, the removal rates of AMX and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached 99.4% and 46.3% after 150 min treatment. The results indicated that the electrochemical degradation of AMX ﬁtted pseudo-ﬁrst-order reaction kinetics. Compared with undoped PbO2 electrode, Cu-PbO2 electrode had a smaller crystal size, more proportion of hydroxyl oxygen species, greater AMX and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, higher average current efﬁciency (ACE) and lower electrical efﬁciency per log order (EE/O). Electrochemical oxidation using Cu-PbO2 electrodes was an effective way to eliminate amoxicillin in aqueous solution. Moreover, a possible degradation pathway including ring open and mineralization was proposed by intermediate products determined by GC-MS method. This paper could provide basic data and technique reference for the amoxicillin wastewater pollution control."

We previously identified serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) as an oncodriver in glioma via splicing control. However, its splicing-independent roles and mechanisms are poorly defined in glioma. In this study, by integrating the data mining of SRSF1-co-expressed genes, SRSF1-affected genes and experimental studies, we demonstrated that SRSF1 was the most highly expressed SRSF in the 9 tumor types tested, and it was a crucial cell cycle regulator in glioma. Importantly, we identified nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript1 (NEAT1), an upregulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in glioma, as a target of SRSF1. Endogenous NEAT1 inhibition resembled the effect of SRSF1 knockdown on glioma cell proliferation by retarding cell cycle. Mechanistically, we proved that SRSF1 bound to NEAT1 and facilitated its RNA stability. The positive correlation between SRSF1 and NEAT1 levels in cancers further supported the positive regulation of NEAT1 by SRSF1. Collectively, our results provide novel insights on the splicing-independent mechanisms of SRSF1 in glioma, and confirm that NEAT1, whose stability maintained by SRSF1, implicates gliomagenesis by regulating cell cycle. Both SRSF1 and NEAT1 may serve as promising targets for antineoplastic therapies.",ARtPM: Article Retrieval for Precision Medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200123,Journal of biomedical informatics,20190614,"Information curation and literature surveillance efforts that synthesize the current knowledge about the impact of genetic variability on disease states and drug responses are vitally important for the practise of evidence-based precision medicine. For these efforts, finding the relevant and comprehensive set of articles from the ever growing scientific literature is a challenge.",Safer cycling and the urban road environment: A case control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200122,Accident; analysis and prevention,20190614,"This study aimed to identify features of the road environment that increased the risk of on-road bicycle crashes in Perth, Australia between 2014-2017. This case-control study used a combination of an in-depth crash study and naturalistic study to compare the road environment characteristics of 100 case (crash) sites and 300 control sites where no crash occurred using conditional logistic regression. For intersection sites, roundabouts (adjusted OR: 2.98, 95% CI: 1.18, 7.56) and traffic lights (adjusted OR: 3.86, 95% CI 1.29, 11.63) significantly increased the risk of a bicycle crash, compared to priority control/uncontrolled intersections. For midblock (non-intersection) sites, roads with an incline (upwards/downwards) significantly increased the risk of a crash (adjusted OR: 3.39, 95% CI: 1.02, 11.22), compared to level roads. This study highlighted the risk of roundabouts, traffic lights and roads with an incline for bicycle crashes. Treatments that reduce vehicle speeds and encourage cyclists to claim the lane at roundabouts, as well as careful road design and road maintenance at traffic lights, may reduce the risk of crashes for cyclists. While it is impossible to remove hills and slopes from the topography, it is possible to select routes to target for bicycle infrastructure which are predominantly level.",Scenarios of crashes involving light mopeds on urban bicycle paths.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200121,Accident; analysis and prevention,20190614,"In the Netherlands, cyclists have to share the bicycle path with light moped riders. These riders are allowed to ride 25 km/h and do not have to wear a helmet (Dutch regulation). Due to several trends such as traffic congestion and the introduction of the scooter model, light mopeds have become more popular, both among older and younger people. This has led to an increased traffic density on bicycle paths as well as concerns about the safety of cyclists. In response to these concerns, several Dutch cities would like to ban light moped riders (LMRs) from the bicycle path and let them ride on the carriageway. However, it is uncertain what the consequences would be for the safety of light moped riders. Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the shared use of bicycle paths leads to serious crashes between cyclists and LMRs. Therefore, an in-depth crash investigation study was carried out to gain more insight into the factors and circumstances that influence the occurrence and consequences of light moped crashes on bicycle paths. A dedicated team for in-depth road crash investigation collected and analyzed detailed information on 36 light moped crashes that occurred on an urban bicycle path. This resulted in a description of the course of events for every crash that was analyzed, including a list of factors that contributed to the occurrence of the crash and possible injuries. Crashes with a similar course of events and a comparable combination of contributory factors were grouped into (sub)types of light moped crashes. Six types of crashes were identified. Based on the contributory crash factors of the identified crash types, remedial measures can be developed to prevent similar crashes from occurring in the future. Moving the LMR to the carriageway is only advisable on 30 km/h roads. Alternative measures to improve the safety of both cyclists and light moped riders include: 1) removing obstacles such as poles from the bicycle path, 2) following guidelines on the minimum width of bicycle paths given traffic volumes, 3) improving sight distances at intersections, 4) traffic light control without conflicts between traffic flows, and 5) introducing a helmet law for light moped riders and their passengers.",Quantitative proteomic profiling of ochratoxin A repression in Penicillium nordicum by protective cultures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200120,International journal of food microbiology,20190614,"Dry-cured meat products are usually contaminated with moulds during ripening. Although fungal development contributes to the desired sensory characteristics, some moulds, such as Penicillium nordicum are able to produce ochratoxin A (OTA) on meat products. Therefore, strategies to prevent OTA contamination in ripened meat products are required. Microorganisms isolated from these meat products can be adequate as biocontrol agents, given that no negative sensory impact is expected. The PgAFP antifungal protein-producer Penicillium chrysogenum (Pc) and Debaryomyces hansenii (Dh) have been shown to successfully inhibit toxigenic moulds. However, scarce information about the mechanism of action of these biocontrol agents on toxigenic mould inhibition is available. Comparative proteomic analysis is a powerful tool to investigate the physiological response of microorganisms to stimuli. Proteomic analysis was carried out on P. nordicum co-cultured with Pc, Dh, PgAFP, and their combinations on a dry-cured ham-based medium. Additionally, OTA production by P. nordicum in the different cultures was measured. The individual inoculation of Pc or Dh repressed OTA production by P. nordicum by 5 and 3.15 fold, respectively. A total of 2844 unique P. nordicum proteins were identified by proteomic analysis. The impact of the biocontrol agents on the proteome of P. nordicum was higher for Pc-containing cultures, followed by Dh-containing treatments. PgAFP alone had minimal impact on the proteome of P. nordicum. Proteomic analyses indicated Pc repressed P. nordicum OTA production through nutrient competition, potentially reducing glucose availability. Data also suggest that Dh and Pc inhibited P. nordicum through cell wall integrity impairment. Both Pc and Dh seem to hamper P. nordicum secondary metabolism (SM) as indicated by lower levels of MAP kinases and SM-associated proteins found in the co-inoculated P. nordicum. This work paves the way to use antifungal agents in the most efficient way to prevent OTA formation in meat products.",Development of a collagen-like peptide polymer via end-to-end disulfide cross-linking and its application as a biomaterial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200119,Acta biomaterialia,20190614,"Collagen is the most abundant protein in the animal kingdom and has a unique triple-helical structure. It not only provides mechanical strength to tissues, but also performs specific biological functions as a multifaceted signaling molecule. Animal-derived collagen is therefore widely used as a biocompatible material in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we developed a novel peptide-based material that mimicked both the polymeric properties and a selected biological function of native collagen. This material was prepared by end-to-end multiple disulfide cross-linking of chemically synthesized triple-helical peptides. The peptide polymer showed a gel-forming property, and receptor-specific cell binding was observed in vitro by incorporating a peptide harboring an integrin α2β1-binding sequence. Furthermore, cell signaling activity and biodegradability were tunable according to the polymer contents. The results demonstrated the potential of this material as a designer collagen. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Collagen is a useful biomaterial with the gel-forming property. It also exhibits various biological activities through the interaction of specific amino acid sequences displayed on the triple helix with functional biomacromolecules. Here we report a novel synthetic material, artificial collagen, by end-to-end cross-linking of chemically synthesized collagen-like triple-helical peptides. The material allows independent regulation of polymer properties, i.e. gel stiffness, and sequence-specific bioactivities by altering peptide compositions. This material can also be variously shaped, for example, thin films with high transparency. In addition, it has low inflamatogenic properties and tunable biodegradability in vivo.",In-air Production of 3D Co-culture Tumor Spheroid Hydrogels for Expedited Drug Screening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200118,Acta biomaterialia,20190614,"Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro tumor spheroids are becoming popular as pre-clinical platforms for testing the performance of existing drugs or for discovery of innovative anti-cancer therapeutics. This focus is correlated with in vitro 3D tumor models ability to mimic the multicellular compact structure and spatial architecture of human solid tumors. However, these microphysiological systems generally lack the pre-existence of tumor-ECM, a critical aspect that can affect the overall therapeutic performance and the decision of advancing candidate drugs to later stages of the pipeline. Aiming to face this drawback and mimic tumors-ECM, herein we rapidly fabricated in-air hyaluronan-methacrylate (HA-MA) and gelatin-methacrylate (GelMA) photocrosslinkable 3D spheroid microgels by using superhydrophobic surfaces. These platforms were used for establishing heterotypic 3D co-culture models of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and human osteoblasts (hOB) to mimic prostate cancer-to-bone metastasis cellular heterogeneity and the tumor-ECM microenvironment. 3D microgel microtumors morphology, size and cell number were easily controlled via digital droplet generation on polystyrene superhydrophobic surfaces and under solvent-free conditions when compared to microfluidics or electrospray. Co-culture 3D microgels formed by 2.5%HA-MA-5%GelMA and 5%HA-MA-5%GelMA ratios showed the highest calcium deposition after 14 days of culture, evidencing osteoblasts viability and the establishment of functional mineralization in the 3D hydrogel matrix. Cisplatin cytotoxicity evaluation showed that 3D microgels are more resistant to platin chemotherapeutics than single or co-culture 3D multicellular spheroid counterparts. Overall, our findings indicate that solvent-free, in-air produced 3D microgel microenvironments are cost-effective and robust tumor mimicking platforms for in vitro high-throughput screening of therapeutics targeted to prostate-to-bone metastasis microenvironments. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE:: The generation of robust microphysiological systems that recapitulate the complexity of the metastatic prostate-to-bone tumor microenvironment is crucial for pre-clinical evaluation of new therapeutics that can eradicate these secondary tumors. In this study, we employed superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces to rapidly fabricate photocrosslinkable hyaluronan-methacrylate/gelatin-methacrylate 3D spheroid microgels for prostate cancer cells and human osteoblasts co-culture models that simultaneously mimic the cellular and ECM tumor components. The use of SH platforms overcomes the issues of standard in-liquid microgel production technologies by providing a robust control over 3D microgels size/morphology and cell-cell co-encapsulation numbers, while avoiding the use of oil-based microgel droplets generation. Overall, SH surfaces allowed a solvent-free, cost-effective, reproducible and adaptable fabrication of heterotypic 3D spherical microgels for high throughput drug screening.",RGD-containing elastin like polypeptide improves islet transplantation outcomes in diabetic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200117,Acta biomaterialia,20190614,"Successful islet transplantation critically depends on the isolation of healthy islets. However, the islet isolation procedure itself contributes to islet death due to the destruction of intra- and peri-islet extracellular matrices (ECMs) during digestion. We investigated whether an RGD-containing elastin-like polypeptide (REP) could function as a self-assembling matrix to replenish ECMs and protects islets from cell death. Immediately following isolation, islets were coated with REP coacervate particles via isothermal adsorption of an REP solution followed by thermal gelation. REP-coated islets displayed increased viability and insulin secretory capacity pretransplant culture compared to untreated islets. Co-transplantation of REP-treated islets and REP beneath the renal sub-capsule in streptozoticin-induced diabetic mice restored normoglycemia and serum insulin levels. Mice that received co-transplants maintained normoglycemia for a longer period of time than those receiving untreated islets without REP. Moreover, co-transplantation sites exhibited enhanced β-cell proliferation and vascularization. Thus, the REP-based coacervation strategy improve the survival, function and therapeutic potential of transplanted islets. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 1). An artificial matrix polypeptide comprised of thermoresponsive elastin-like peptides and integrin-stimulatory RGD ligands (REP) to reconstitute damaged or lost matrices. 2). Through body temperature-induced coacervation, REP reconstitutes intra-islet environment and enhances islet viability and insulin secretion by activating the pro-survival and insulin signaling pathways. 3). REP-coated islets were transplanted together with the matrix polypeptide under the kidney sub-capsule of mice, it develops a new peri-insular environment, which protects the islet grafts from immune rejection thus extending islet longevity. 4). Our data suggest that in situ self-assembly of biomimetic islet environments become a new platform allowing for improved islet transplantation at extrahepatic sites.",Differential outcomes of venous and arterial tissue engineered vascular grafts highlight the importance of coupling long-term implantation studies with computational modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200116,Acta biomaterialia,20190614,"Electrospinning is commonly used to generate polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering. Using this approach, we developed a small-diameter tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) composed of poly-ε-caprolactone-co-L-lactic acid (PCLA) fibers and longitudinally assessed its performance within both the venous and arterial circulations of immunodeficient (SCID/bg) mice. Based on in vitro analysis demonstrating complete loss of graft strength by 12 weeks, we evaluated neovessel formation in vivo over 6-, 12- and 24-week periods. Mid-term observations indicated excellent physiologic graft function, characterized by 100% patency and excellent luminal matching with adjoining native vessel in both the venous and arterial circulations. An active and robust remodeling process was characterized by a confluent endothelial cell monolayer, macrophage infiltrate, and extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling. Long-term follow-up of venous TEVGs at 24 weeks revealed viable neovessel formation beyond graft degradation when implanted in this high flow, low-pressure environment. Arterial TEVGs experienced catastrophic graft failure due to aneurysmal dilatation and rupture after 14 weeks. Scaffold parameters such as porosity, fiber diameter, and degradation rate informed a previously described computational model of vascular growth and remodeling, and simulations predicted the gross differential performance of the venous and arterial TEVGs over the 24-week time course. Taken together, these results highlight the requirement for in vivo implantation studies to extend past the critical time period of polymer degradation, the importance of differential neotissue deposition relative to the mechanical (pressure) environment, and further support the utility of predictive modeling in the design, use, and evaluation of TEVGs in vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Herein, we apply a biodegradable electrospun vascular graft to the arterial and venous circulations of the mouse and follow recipients beyond the point of polymer degradation. While venous implants formed viable neovessels, arterial grafts experienced catastrophic rupture due to aneurysmal dilation. We then inform a previously developed computational model of tissue engineered vascular graft growth and remodeling with parameters specific to the electrospun scaffolds utilized in this study. Remarkably, model simulations predict the differential performance of the venous and arterial constructs over 24 weeks. We conclude that computational simulations should inform the rational selection of scaffold parameters to fabricate tissue engineered vascular grafts that must be followed in vivo over time courses extending beyond polymer degradation."

ROS signaling has become increasingly recognized as a mechanism implicated in the regulation of synaptic neurotransmission, under both physiological and pathological conditions. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion are the main biologically relevant endogenous ROS in the nervous system. They are predominantly produced in the mitochondria of neurons and glial cells and their levels are tightly regulated by the antioxidant cell machinery, which allows for dynamic signaling through these agents. Physicochemical and biological properties of H2O2 enable it to effectively play an important role in signaling. This review brings up some or the most significant evidence supporting ROS as signaling agents in the nervous system and summarizes data showing that ROS modulate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated neurotransmission by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. ROS induce changes on both, the activity of phasic and tonic GABAA receptors and GABA release from presynaptic terminals. Based on these facts, ROS signaling is discussed as a possible selective mechanism linking cellular metabolism to inhibitory neurotransmission through the direct or indirect modulation of the GABAA receptor function.",An attempt to conceptually replicate the dissociation between syntax and semantics during sentence comprehension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200104,Neuroscience,20190614,"Is sentence structure processed by the same neural and cognitive resources that are recruited for processing word meanings, or do structure and meaning rely on distinct resources? Linguistic theorizing and much behavioral evidence suggest tight integration between lexico-semantic and syntactic representations and processing. However, most current proposals of the neural architecture of language continue to postulate a distinction between the two. One of the earlier and most cited pieces of neuroimaging evidence in favor of this dissociation comes from a paper by Dapretto & Bookheimer (1999). Using a sentence-meaning judgment task, Dapretto & Bookheimer observed two distinct peaks within the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG): one more active during a lexico-semantic manipulation, and the other - during a syntactic manipulation. Although the paper is highly cited, no attempt has been made, to our knowledge, to replicate the original finding. We report an fMRI study that attempts to do so. Using a combination of whole-brain, group-level ROI, and participant-specific functional ROI approaches, we fail to replicate the original dissociation. In particular, whereas parts of LIFG respond reliably more strongly during lexico-semantic than syntactic processing, no part of LIFG (including in the region defined around the peak reported by Dapretto & Bookheimer) shows the opposite pattern. We speculate that the original result was a false positive, possibly driven by a small subset of participants or items that biased a fixed-effects analysis with low power.",The complete genome of Rachiplusia nu nucleopolyhedrovirus (RanuNPV) and the identification of a baculoviral CPD-photolyase homolog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200103,Virology,20190614,"We described a novel baculovirus isolated from the polyphagous insect pest Rachiplusia nu. The virus presented pyramidal-shaped occlusion bodies (OBs) with singly-embed nucleocapsids and a dose mortality response of 6.9 × 103 OBs/ml to third-instar larvae of R. nu. The virus genome is 128,587 bp long with a G + C content of 37.9% and 134 predicted ORFs. The virus is an alphabaculovirus closely related to Trichoplusia ni single nucleopolyhedrovirus, Chrysodeixis chalcites nucleopolyhedrovirus, and Chrysodeixis includens single nucleopolyhedrovirus and may constitute a new species. Surprisingly, we found co-evolution among the related viruses and their hosts at species level. Besides, auxiliary genes with homologs in other baculoviruses were found, e.g. a CPD-photolyase. The gene seemed to be result of a single event of horizontal transfer from lepidopterans to alphabaculovirus, followed by a transference from alpha to betabaculovirus. The predicted protein appears to be an active enzyme that ensures likely DNA protection from sunlight.",mir-234 controls neuropeptide release at the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200102,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,20190614,"miR-137 is a highly conserved microRNA (miRNA) that is associated with the control of brain function and the etiology of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The Caenorhabditis elegans genome encodes a single miR-137 ortholog called mir-234, the function of which is unknown. Here we show that mir-234 is expressed in a subset of sensory, motor and interneurons in C. elegans. Using a mir-234 deletion strain, we systematically examined the development and function of these neurons in addition to global C. elegans behaviors. We were however unable to detect phenotypes associated with loss of mir-234, possibly due to genetic redundancy. To circumvent this issue, we overexpressed mir-234 in mir-234-expressing neurons to uncover possible phenotypes. We found that mir-234-overexpression endows resistance to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb, suggesting modification of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function. Further analysis revealed that mir-234 controls neuropeptide levels, therefore positing a cause of NMJ dysfunction. Together, our data suggest that mir-234 functions to control the expression of target genes that are important for neuropeptide maturation and/or transport in C. elegans. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The miR-137 family of miRNAs is linked to the control of brain function in humans. Defective regulation of miR-137 is associated with psychiatric disorders that include schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Previous studies have revealed that miR-137 is required for the development of dendrites and for controlling the release of fast-acting neurotransmitters. Here, we analyzed the function a miR-137 family member (called mir-234) in the nematode animal model using anatomical, behavioral, electrophysiological and neuropeptide analysis. We reveal for the first time that mir-234/miR-137 is required for the release of slow-acting neuropeptides, which may also be of relevance for controlling human brain function.",1H NMR profiling of the 6-OHDA parkinsonian rat brain reveals metabolic alterations and signs of recovery after N-acetylcysteine treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200101,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,20190614,"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease caused by degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. The origin and causes of dopamine neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease are not well understood but oxidative stress may play an important role in its onset. Much effort has been dedicated to find biomarkers indicative of oxidative stress and neurodegenerative processes in parkinsonian brains. By using 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) to identify and quantify key metabolites, it is now possible to elucidate the metabolic pathways affected by pathological conditions like neurodegeneration. The metabolic disturbances in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) hemiparkinsonian rat model were monitored and the nature and size of these metabolic alterations were analyzed. The results indicate that a unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the striatum causes metabolic changes that not only affect the injected hemisphere but also the contralateral, non-lesioned side. We could clearly identify specific metabolic pathways that were affected, which were mostly related with oxidative stress and neurotransmission. In addition, a partial metabolic recovery by carrying out an antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was observable.",Embryonic and postnatal development of mouse olfactory tubercle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200100,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,20190614,"The olfactory tubercle (OT) is located in the ventral-medial region of the brain where it receives primary input from olfactory bulb (OB) projection neurons and processes olfactory behaviors related to motivation, hedonics of smell and sexual encounters. The OT is part of the dopamine reward system that shares characteristics with the striatum. Together with the nucleus accumbens, the OT has been referred to as the ""ventral striatum"". However, despite its functional importance little is known about the embryonic development of the OT and the phenotypic properties of the OT cells. Here, using thymidine analogs, we establish that mouse OT neurogenesis occurs predominantly between E11-E15 in a lateral-to-medial gradient. Then, using a piggyBac multicolor technique we characterized the migratory route of OT neuroblasts from their embryonic point of origin. Following neurogenesis in the ventral lateral ganglionic eminence (vLGE), neuroblasts destined for the OT followed a dorsal-ventral pathway we named ""ventral migratory course"" (VMC). Upon reaching the nascent OT, neurons established a prototypical laminar distribution that was determined, in part, by the progenitor cell of origin. A phenotypic analysis of OT neuroblasts using a single-color piggyBac technique, showed that OT shared the molecular specification of striatal neurons. In addition to primary afferent input from the OB, the OT also receives a robust dopaminergic input from ventral tegmentum (Ikemoto, 2007). We used tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression as a proxy for dopaminergic innervation and showed that TH onset occurs at E13 and progressively increased until postnatal stages following an 'inside-out' pattern. Postnatally, we established the myelination in the OT occurring between P7 and P14, as shown with CNPase staining, and we characterized the cellular phenotypes populating the OT by immunohistochemistry. Collectively, this work provides the first detailed analysis of the developmental and maturation processes occurring in mouse OT, and demonstrates the striatal nature of the OT as part of the ventral striatum (vST).",3D bioprinting models of neural tissues: the current state of the field and future directions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200099,Brain research bulletin,20190614,"3D bioprinting can potentially revolutionize the field of neural tissue engineering by increasing its throughput and reproducibility. However, many obstacles must be overcome to realize this immense potential. This review first discusses how 3D hydrogels can serve as powerful tools for engineering neural tissue, especially when combined with different types of cells. These tools enable us to gain a better understanding of neural tissue development and its associated disease states. Next, we define 3D bioprinting and detail the necessary tools for using this technique to produce neural tissue, along with reviewing relevant recent work in the area. We also compare with other approaches to generating 3D neural tissues while identifying key areas for future developments in the field of bioprinting.",Effects of anisomycin infusions into the dorsal striatum on memory consolidation of intense training and neurotransmitter activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200098,Brain research bulletin,20190614,"The most influential hypothesis about the neurobiological basis of memory consolidation posits that this process is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis. Strong support for this proposition has been provided by a multitude of experiments showing that protein synthesis inhibitors (PSIs) interfere with consolidation. However, this hypothesis has been challenged by the results of studies showing that PSIs also produce a host of side effects that, by themselves, could account for their amnestic effects. It has been demonstrated that amnestic treatments become innocuous when administered to animals that have been subjected to intense training in a variety of learning tasks. We now report that while infusion of anisomycin (ANI), a PSI, into the dorsal striatum (DS) impairs memory consolidation of inhibitory avoidance learning in response to moderate aversive stimuli, such impairment by ANI is overcome by application of an intense stimulus. We also confirmed that ANI induces inhibition of protein synthesis in the DS, as evidenced by a reduction of the activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein (Arc). We found, for the first time, that ANI also induces an increased concentration of serotonin in the DS, which, by itself, may account for the interference with memory consolidation. These findings suggest that de novo protein synthesis in the dorsal striatum is not necessary for the consolidation of intense emotionally arousing experiences. The possibility of a non-genomic-dependent mechanism of memory consolidation is discussed.",Long-lasting changes in hippocampal GABAB-receptor mediated inhibition following early-life seizures in kindling-prone but not kindling-resistant rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200097,Brain research bulletin,20190614,"The hypotheses that hippocampal GABAB receptor dysfunction is a long-lasting consequence of early-life seizures, and its dependence on genetic background, were tested. Two strains of rats bred to be prone (FAST) or resistant (SLOW) to amygdala kindling were used. On postnatal day (PND) 10, control rats were injected with saline, and seizure rats with kainic acid to induce status epilepticus (SE) for 2 hours. A significantly lower dose of kainic acid was found to induce SE in FAST as compared to SLOW rats. Population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (pEPSPs) and population spikes (PSs) were recorded in CA1 of hippocampal slices of adult rats in vitro, following stimulation of stratum radiatum. Input-output relation of the single-pulse pEPSP and PS did not show a significant difference between seizure and control rats, sex, or strain (FAST and SLOW). Paired-pulse PSs were significantly enhanced at 10-50 ms interpulse intervals, in FAST seizure male rats compared to FAST male controls, but not in other groups. In adult FAST but not SLOW rats, significantly lower suppression of pEPSPs at 250-300 ms following heterosynaptic burst stimulation was found in seizure rats compared to control rats; the heterosynaptic suppression of the pEPSP was blocked by selective GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845A. The results provide evidence that an early-life SE has a long-lasting effect in decreasing GABAB receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition in the hippocampus, in FAST but not in SLOW rats.",Porcine blastocyst viability and developmental potential is maintained for 48 h of liquid storage at 25 °C without CO2 gassing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200096,Theriogenology,20190614,"Short- and medium-term storage of pig embryos has become relevant for commercial application of non-surgical deep uterine embryo transfer (NsDU-ET) in the light of the strict legal and administrative requirements posed by the International Association for Air Transport (IATA) to allow shipment of liquid nitrogen (LN2) containers and the technical drawbacks when using vitrified embryos. Therefore, this study developed an efficient method for the liquid storage of in vivo-derived porcine blastocysts for a moderate duration (48 h) without controlled CO2 gassing. We evaluated two storage temperatures (25 °C and 37 °C) and three HEPES-supplemented media: the chemically defined media TL-PVA and NCSU-PVA and the semi-defined medium NCSU-BSA. We observed no differences in survival, hatching rate or final developmental stage between the two temperatures, but storage at 25 °C was more efficient to preserve zona pellucida (ZP) integrity. Blastocysts were successfully stored for 24 h in a chemically defined medium. Yet, only 48 h storage in NCSU-BSA medium supported blastocyst development. Although all storage conditions resulted in an embryonic developmental delay, blastocysts stored in NCSU-BSA at either tested temperature could hatch and attain the same final developmental stage as control blastocysts when cultured under standard conditions after storage.

To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance in C. thesioides. To better understand drought resistance, we used transcriptome analysis and Illumina sequencing technology on C. thesioides, to identify drought-responsive genes. Using de novo assembly 55,268 unigenes were identified from 207.58 Gb of clean data. Amongst these, 36,265 were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms and metabolic pathways. The sequencing results showed that genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) under drought stress were enriched in pathways such as carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, many functional genes were up-regulated under severe drought stress to enhance tolerance. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that there were key hub genes related to drought stress. Hundreds of candidate genes were identified under severe drought stress, including transcriptional factors such as MYB, G2-like, ERF, C2H2, NAC, NF-X1, GRF, HD-ZIP, HB-other, HSF, C3H, GRAS, WRKY, bHLH and Trihelix. These data are a valuable resource for further investigation into the molecular mechanism for drought stress in C. thesioides and will facilitate exploration of drought resistance genes.","Overexpression of a trypanothione synthetase gene from Trypanosoma cruzi, TcTrys, confers enhanced tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in rice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200083,Gene,20190614,"Plants are frequently exposed to variable environmental stresses that adversely affect plant growth, development and agricultural production. In this study, a trypanothione synthetase gene from Trypanosoma cruzi, TcTryS, was chemically synthesized and its roles in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses were functionally characterized by generating transgenic rice overexpressing TcTryS. Overexpression of TcTryS in rice endows transgenic plants with hypersensitivity to ABA, hyposensitivity to NaCl- and mannitol-induced osmotic stress at the seed germination stage. TcTryS overexpression results in enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, cadmium, and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol stresses in transgenic rice, simultaneously supported by improved physiological traits. The TcTryS-overexpression plants also accumulated greater amounts of proline, less malondialdehyde and more transcripts of stress-related genes than wild-type plants under drought and salt stress conditions. In addition, TcTryS might play a positive role in maintaining chlorophyll content under 2,4,6-trichlorophenol stress. Histochemical staining assay showed that TcTryS renders transgenic plants better ROS-scavenging capability. All of these results suggest that TcTryS could function as a key regulator in modulation of abiotic stress tolerance in plant, and may have applications in the engineering of economically important crops.",PHACTR1 haplotypes are associated with carotid plaque presence and affect PHACTR1 mRNA expression in carotid plaque tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200082,Gene,20190614,"Carotid plaque is a hallmark of advanced carotid atherosclerosis and there is evidence of phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (PHACTR1) involvement in the processes that lead to atherosclerosis.

This metabolic diversity is, to a large extent, due to chemical modification of the basic skeletons of metabolites. Here, we review the major known plant metabolite modifications and summarize the progress and challenges that have been achieved in the field. We cover both technical and functional aspects focusing on the influence that various modifications have on biosynthesis, degradation, transport, and storage of metabolites, as well as their bioactivity and toxicity. Finally, emerging insight into the evolution of metabolic pathways and metabolite functionality will be described.",OsBRXL4 Regulates Shoot Gravitropism and Rice Tiller Angle through Affecting LAZY1 Nuclear Localization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200078,Molecular plant,20190614,"Rice tiller angle is a key agronomic trait that contributes to ideal plant architecture and grain production. Our previous study showed that LAZY1 (LA1) controls tiller angle via affecting shoot gravitropism, but the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a LA1-interacting protein named Brevis Radix Like 4 (OsBRXL4). We showed that the interaction between OsBRXL4 and LA1 occurs at the plasma membrane and that their interaction determines LA1 nuclear localization. We found that LA1 nuclear localization is essential for LA1 function, which is different from AtLA1, the ortholog in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of OsBRXL4 leads to a prostrate growth phenotype, whereas OsBRXLs RNAi plants, in which the expression levels of OsBRXL1, OsBRXL4, and OsBRXL5 were decreased, display a compact phenotype. Further genetic evidence confirmed that OsBRXL4 controls rice tiller angle by affecting LA1 nuclear localization. Consistent with this, OsBRXL4 regulates the shoot gravitropism through affecting polar auxin transport as did LA1. Therefore, our study not only identifies OsBRXL4 as a regulatory component of rice tiller angle, but also provides a new insight into our understanding of rice plant architecture.",Thoracic vertebral fractures and hyperkyphosis in elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease; do these patients have different clinical outcomes?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200077,Bone,20190614,"Elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at high risk for fractures. However, the prevalence of vertebral fractures and hyperkyphosis is not studied well.

Therefore, the primary aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of vertebral fractures and hyperkyphosis in the ESKD population. The secondary aim was to assess if patients with vertebral fractures and/or hyperkyphosis more often have poor outcome after starting dialysis, such as accidental falling, functional decline and mortality compared to the patients without vertebral fractures and/or hyperkyphosis.","Molecular characterization of the NK-lysin in a teleost fish, Boleophthalmus pectinirostris: Antimicrobial activity and immunomodulatory activity on monocytes/macrophages.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200076,Fish & shellfish immunology,20190614,"NK-lysin (NKL) is a cationic host defense peptide that plays an important role in host immune responses against various pathogens. However, the immunomodulatory activity of NKL in fishes is rarely investigated. In this study, we characterized a cDNA sequence encoding an NK-lysin homolog (BpNKL) from the fish, mudskipper (Boleophthalmus pectinirostris). Sequence analysis revealed that BpNKL is most closely related to tiger puffer (Takifugu rubripes) NKL. BpNKL transcript was detected in all the tested tissues, with the highest level in the gill, followed by the spleen and kidney. Upon Edwardsiella tarda infection, the mRNA expression of BpNKL in the mudskipper was significantly upregulated in the spleen, kidney, and gill. A shortened peptide derived from BpNKL, BpNKLP40, was then chemically synthesized and its biological functions were investigated. BpNKLP40 exhibited a direct antibacterial activity against some gram-negative bacteria, including E. tarda, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio harveyi, and induced hydrolysis of E. tarda genomic DNA. Intraperitoneal injection of 1.0 μg/g BpNKLP40 significantly improved the survival of mudskipper following E. tarda infection and reduced the bacterial burden in tissues and blood. Moreover, 1.0 μg/ml BpNKLP40 treatment had an enhanced effect on the intracellular killing of E. tarda by monocytes/macrophages (MO/MФ) as well as on the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in MO/MФ. In conclusion, our study reveals that BpNKL plays a role against E. tarda infection in the mudskipper by not only directly killing bacteria but also through an immunomodulatory activity on MO/MФ.","Selective expression of a ""correct cloud"" of Dscam in crayfish survivors after second exposure to the same pathogen.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200075,Fish & shellfish immunology,20190614,"Arthropod hypervariable Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) may be involved in adaptive-like immune characteristics, namely immune priming, enabling the host to ""learn"" and ""remember"" pathogens previously encountered in arthropods. However, expression of Dscam in immune-primed arthropods after a second challenge has apparently not been confirmed. Herein, working with Dscam of Australian freshwater crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus, i.e. CqDscam), we further investigated whether immune priming is mediated by ""clouds"" of appropriate (or ""correct"") CqDscam isoforms. In crayfish that survived a first WSSV challenge (immune priming), long-lasting CqDscam expression remained higher after a second WSSV challenge. Selective CqDscam isoforms were also induced after both challenges. Based on pathogen binding assays, these WSSV-induced CqDscam isoforms had a higher WSSV binding ability, perhaps mainly mediated by Ig3-spliced variants. We therefore hypothesized that in these crayfish survivors, an unknown selection process was generating a ""correct cloud"" of CqDscam against a previously encountered pathogen."

In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method and checkerboard method were used to investigate potential synergies between CFZ and moxifloxacin (MOX) or capreomycin (CAP). 30 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains were collected, including 13 MDR strains, 2 extensive drug- resistant (XDR) strains, 3 pan-sensitive strains and 12 strains resistant to other drugs. When the minimum fractional inhibitory concentration indexes (FICIs) were calculated, synergy was found in 21 (70.00%) M. tuberculosis strains against the CFZ/CAP combination and 29 (96.67%) against the CFZ/MOX combination. When the maximum FICIs were calculated, 10 out of 15 MDR/XDR strains and 2 out of 15 other drug-resistant or pan-sensitive strains showed antagonism against the CFZ/CAP combination, whilst 8 out of 15 MDR/XDR strains and 1 out of 15 other drug-resistant or pan-sensitive strains showed antagonism against the CFZ/MOX combination, respectively. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that the combination of CFZ and MOX shows better synergism than the combination of CFZ and CAP. The MDR/XDR isolates are more likely to show antagonism than the other drug-resistant or pan-sensitive strains in both CFZ/MOX and CFZ/CAP combinations. Taken together, we suggest that CFZ, in combination with MOX, may be a promising drug regimen for the treatment of MDR-TB, especially for the susceptible M. tuberculosis infectious.",Comparison of antimicrobial stewardship programs in acute care hospitals in four European countries: a cross-sectional survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200022,International journal of antimicrobial agents,20190614,"Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are designed to improve antibiotic use.

Nitrofurantoin (NIT), with high therapeutic concentrations in urine, is recommended as first-line drug for both empiric treatment and chemoprophylaxis of UTIs. Although NIT resistance in K. pneumoniae is relatively high, the resistance mechanism is less understood. Here, we collected a NIT-resistant K. pneumoniae (NRKP, MIC=128 mg/L) and investigated the resistance mechanism. Addition of efflux pump inhibitors increased the susceptibility of NRKP to NIT (MIC, decreased from 128 to 32 mg/L), implying the important role of efflux pumps in NIT resistance. qRT-PCR analysis showed that NRKP had > 100-fold increased expression of ramA, which was further demonstrated to be caused by ramR mutation. Deletion of ramA lead to a 4-fold decrease in the MIC of NIT, and the expression levels of efflux pumps acrB and oqxB were downregulated by 4-7 folds. Complementation of ramA restored both of the MIC value and the expression level of acrB and oqxB in ramA mutant strain. In order to confirm the role of acrB and oqxB in NIT resistance, gene knockout strains were constructed. Deletion of acrB or oqxB alone lead to a 4-fold decrease in the MIC of NIT, and deletion of acrB and oqxB simultaneously lead to a 16-fold decrease in the MIC of NIT. These results demonstrated that AcrAB and OqxAB contributed to NIT resistance in K. pneumoniae.",A surrogate structural platform informed by ancestral reconstruction and resurrection of a putative CBM hybrid illuminates the neofunctionalization of a pectate lyase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200020,Journal of structural biology,20190614,"Yersinia enterocolitica is a pectinolytic zoonotic foodborne pathogen, the genome of which contains pectin-binding proteins and several different classes of pectinases, including polysaccharide lyases (PLs) and an exopolygalacturonase. These proteins operate within a coordinated pathway to completely saccharify homogalacturonan (HG). Polysaccharide lyase family 2 (PL2) is divided into two major subfamilies that are broadly-associated with contrasting 'endolytic' (PL2A) or 'exolytic' (PL2B) activities on HG. In the Y. enterocolitica genome, the PL2A gene is adjacent to an independent carbohydrate binding module from family 32 (YeCBM32) known to specifically bind HG and possess a N-terminal secretion tag. Independent CBMs are rare in nature and, most commonly, are fused to enzymes in order to potentiate catalysis. The unconventional gene architecture of YePL2A and YeCBM32, therefore, may represent an ancestral relic of a fission event that decoupled PL2A from its cognate CBM. To provide further insight into the evolution of this pectinolytic locus and the molecular basis of HG depolymerisation within Y. enterocolitica, we have resurrected a YePL2A-YeCBM32 chimera and demonstrated that the extant PL2A digests HG more efficiently. In addition, we have engineered a tryptophan from the active site of the exolytic YePL2B into YePL2A (YePL2A-K291W) and demonstrated, using X-ray crystallography of substrate complexes, that it is a structural determinant of exo-activity within the PL2 family. In this manner, surrogate structural platforms may assist in the study of phylogenetic relationships informed by the extant and resurrected sequences, and can be used to overcome challenging structural problems within carbohydrate active enzyme families.",3.1Å structure of yeast RNA polymerase II elongation complex stalled at a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion solved using streptavidin affinity grids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200019,Journal of structural biology,20190614,"Despite significant advances in all aspects of single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), specimen preparation still remains a challenge. During sample preparation, macromolecules interact with the air-water interface, which often leads to detrimental effects such as denaturation or adoption of preferred orientations, ultimately hindering structure determination. Randomly biotinylating the protein of interest (for example, at its primary amines) and then tethering it to a cryo-EM grid coated with two-dimensional crystals of streptavidin (acting as an affinity surface) can prevent the protein from interacting with the air-water interface. Recently, this approach was successfully used to solve a high-resolution structure of a test sample, a bacterial ribosome. However, whether this method can be used for samples where interaction with the air-water interface has been shown to be problematic remains to be determined. Here we report a 3.1Å structure of an RNA polymerase II elongation complex stalled at a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer lesion (Pol II EC(CPD)) solved using streptavidin grids. Our previous attempt to solve this structure using conventional sample preparation methods resulted in a poor quality cryo-EM map due to Pol II EC(CPD)'s adopting a strong preferred orientation. Imaging the same sample on streptavidin grids improved the angular distribution of its view, resulting in a high-resolution structure. This work shows that streptavidin affinity grids can be used to address known challenges posed by the interaction with the air-water interface.",Fabry disease caused by the GLA p.Phe113Leu (p.F113L) variant: Natural history in males.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200018,European journal of medical genetics,20190614,"aims and methods. The α-galactosidase gene (GLA) c.337T>C/p.Phe113Leu variant was originally described in patients with late-onset cardiac forms of Fabry disease (FD), who had residual α-galactosidase activity. It has since emerged as the most commonly reported GLA variant in Portuguese subjects diagnosed with FD but is also prevalent in the Italian population, where two boys carrying the GLA Leu113 allele were identified in a large-scale newborn screening program, the variant allele segregating in both cases with the same surrounding haplotype. To further delineate the genotype-phenotype correlations of this GLA variant, we have reviewed the natural history and clinical phenotypes of 11 symptomatic Portuguese males, from 10 unrelated families originating from several different areas in mainland Portugal and Madeira Island, who were diagnosed with FD associated with the GLA Leu113 allele in a diversity of clinical and screening settings. Nine of the patients were the probands of their respective families. To test whether the GLA Leu113 allele inherited by the 10 Portuguese and the two Italian families resulted from independent mutational events, we have additionally performed a haplotype analysis with 5 highly polymorphic, closely linked microsatellite markers surrounding the GLA gene.",Purification and characterization of a novel wild-type α-amylase from Antarctic sea ice bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. M175.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200017,Protein expression and purification,20190614,"A novel wild-type α-amylase named wtAmy175 from Pseudoalteromonas sp. M175 strain was purified through ammonium sulphate precipitation, DEAE cellulose, and Sephadex G-75 sequentially (25.83-fold, 7.67%-yield) for biochemical characterization. SDS-PAGE and zymographic activity staining of purified enzyme showed a single band with a predicted molecular mass of about 61 kDa. The optimum temperature and pH for enzyme activity were 30 °C and 7.5, respectively. Additionally, the enzyme exhibited high activity and remarkable stability in 0-10 mM SDS. The values of Km and Vmax for soluble starch as substrate were 2.47 mg/ml and 0.103 mg/ml/min, respectively. Analysis of hydrolysis products of soluble starch and maltooligosaccharides showed that wtAmy175 cleaved the interior and the terminal α-1,4-glycosidic linkage in starch, and had transglycosylation activity. The result of fluorescence spectroscopy showed that wtAmy175 had strong binding affinity with soluble starch. In brief, this study discovered the first wild-type α-amylase so far with several distinctive properties of cold activity, SDS-resistance, and the mixed activity of α-amylase and α-glucosidase, suggesting that wtAmy175 possess high adaptive capability to endure harsh industrial conditions and would be an excellent candidate in detergent and textile industries.",Multi-enzyme systems and recombinant cells for synthesis of valuable saccharides: Advances and perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200016,Biotechnology advances,20190614,"Saccharides have recently attracted considerable attention because of their biological functions and potential applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries.

The advancement of metabolic engineering and synthetic biology strategies facilitated the artificial pathway design and construction for production of multiple sugars in vitro and in vivo based on those characterized enzymes. This review presented a panoramic view of enzymes related to saccharide synthesis and gave the detailed information. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of the recent advances in the construction of cell-free reaction systems and engineering of microbial cells for the production of natural or unnatural saccharides.

This enzyme can be used as a first step in the utilization of CO2 as carbon substrate for production of high-in-demand chemicals. However, comparison and categorization of the very diverse group of FDH enzymes has received only limited attention. With specific emphasis on FDH catalyzed CO2 reduction to HCOO-, we present a novel classification scheme for FDHs based on protein sequence alignment and gene organization analysis. We show that prokaryotic FDHs can be neatly divided into six meaningful sub-types. These sub-types are discussed in the context of overall structural composition, phylogeny of the gene segment organization, metabolic role, and catalytic properties. Based on the available literature, the influence of electron donor choice on the efficacy of FDH catalyzed CO2 reduction is quantified and compared. This analysis shows that methyl viologen and hydrogen are several times more potent than NADH as electron donors. Hence, the new FDH classification scheme and the electron donor analysis provide an improved base for developing FDH-facilitated CO2 reduction as a viable step in the utilization of CO2 as carbon source for green production of chemicals."

The stromal interactive molecule 2 (STIM2) is a calcium sensor protein that regulates the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Whereas, whether STIM2 is associated with I/R injury remains largely unclear. We report here that STIM2, but not its homologue STIM1, is upregulated in cultured H9c2 cells, a cell model for cardiomyocytes, following I/R injury. In addition, the knockdown of STIM2, but not STIM1, reduces H9c2 cell apoptosis following I/R injury, and similar results were obtained in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes. This anti-apoptotic effect could be attributed to the inhibited activation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Moreover, STIM2 knockdown reduces ER calcium release and simultaneously alleviates mitochondrial calcium overload in H9c2 cells following I/R injury. Furthermore, STIM2 knockdown decreases mitochondrial injury and preserves mitochondrial function following I/R injury. Collectively, these results suggest that the protective role of STIM2 knockdown against I/R injury in cardiomyocytes is associated with the reduced mitochondrial calcium overload and preserved mitochondrial function. Hence, our study may provide a novel insight into the regulation of mitochondrial-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis following I/R injury.",Protein arginine methyltranferase-1 induces ER stress and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in renal tubular epithelial cells and contributes to diabetic nephropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199999,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Molecular basis of disease,20190614,"Heart failure is a global epidemic that drastically cuts short longevity and compromises quality of life. Approximately 6 million Americans ≥20 years of age carry a diagnosis of heart failure. Worldwide, about 40 million adults are affected. The treatment of HF depends on the etiology. If left untreated it rapidly progresses and compromises quality of life. One of the newer technologies still in its infancy is stem cell therapy for heart failure. This review attempts to highlight the clinical studies done in ischemic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. A combined approach of simultaneous revascularization and stem cell therapy appears to produce maximum benefit in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy with stem cells also holds promise but needs more definition with regards to timing, route of cell delivery and type of cell used to achieve reproducible results. The variability noted in response to stem cell therapy in patients could also be secondary to their co-morbidities. Abnormalities of glucose metabolism and diabetes in particular impair stem cell and angiogenic cell mobilization. This opens up a whole new area of investigation into exploring the biochemical microenvironment which could influence the efficacy of stem cell therapy.

The current study was conducted to evaluate the antihyperlipidemic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of methanol leaf extract from Erica multiflora (M-EML). Triton WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemic rats were divided into six groups: control group (CG), hyperlipidemic group (300 mg/kg body weight ""BW"") (HG), hyperlipidemic group treated with M-EML (150 and 250 mg/kg) (HG + M-EML), normal rats treated with M-EML (250 mg/kg) and fenofibrate-treated group (HG + FF) (65 mg/kg). After 24 h of administration, triton WR-1339 induced a significant increase in lipid profile, atherogenic index (AI) and Coronary Risk Index (CRI) in HG group compared to control group. Furthermore, triton WR-1339 administration induced alteration in the status of pro-inflammatory markers (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, IFN-γ and Nitric oxide production). HG group showed also, a high level of lipid peroxidation, an altered antioxidant enzyme profiles and an increase in DNA damages, in liver. However, orally administration of M-EML mitigates significantly these disorders, proving hence a protective potential against triton WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemia. These findings suggest that M-EML extract could be used as functional foods and natural adjuvant treatment of hyperlipidemia.",Investigation of number of replicate measurements required to meet cigarette smoke chemistry regulatory requirements measured under Canadian intense smoking conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199996,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,20190614,"There has been increased interest in recent years in regulatory reporting of cigarette smoke toxicants. There is a great deal of diversity in current regulatory standards around the world in terms of the identities of regulated toxicants, and the number of replicate analyses stipulated for their measurement. Furthermore, analytical methods developed collaboratively by several organisations and intended for regulatory analysis generally differ in their recommended replicate numbers to those stipulated by regulators. In view of these inconsistencies, we undertook an exercise to examine the most appropriate numbers of replicates required for regulatory analysis of cigarette smoke toxicants. A one-point-in-time sampling exercise was undertaken of the German cigarette market, with 161 brands sampled and analysed in a single laboratory using Canadian Intense smoking conditions. Seven replicate measurements were made for each analyte and product, other than nicotine, CO and nicotine-free dry particulate matter for which eight replicate measurements were made. After confirming the absence of order of analysis effects, a variety of statistical tests (such as group assessment, paired comparisons, linear regression models and ratio analysis) were conducted examining mean values, SDs and CVs to identify the role of numbers of analytical replicates on data quality. The statistical analysis showed no difference in mean values for any of the 18 toxicants irrespective of replicate numbers (between 3 and 7-8). The large majority of analytes showed no difference in data variability with replicate number; but some very small differences (much lower than within product variability) were observed for a minority of compounds. Similarly, paired analysis showed no significant differences between mean values obtained using different replicate numbers in most cases, apart from very low differences (<5%) for a small number. Linear regression analysis showed correlations around 96-98% (other than crotonaldehyde at 91%) between values obtained with 3 vs 7 replicates. Similarly, per product mean value ratio analysis showed 95% consistency between values obtained with 3 and 7 replicates. We therefore conclude that three replicates is sufficient for precise determination of cigarette mainstream smoke toxicant emissions, and that use of 7 replicates as stipulated in some regulator jurisdictions does not offer any greater accuracy or precision.",Versatile electrostatically assembled polymeric siRNA nanovectors: can they overcome the limits of siRNA tumor delivery?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199995,International journal of pharmaceutics,20190614,"The application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) cancer therapeutics is limited by several extra- and intracellular barriers including the presence of ribonucleases that degrade siRNA, the premature clearance, the impermeability of the cell membrane, or the difficulty to escape endo-lysosomal degradation.

This review is focused on polymer-based siRNA nanovectors which exploit the negative charge of siRNA, representing a major challenge for siRNA delivery, to their advantage by loading siRNA via electrostatic assembly. These nanovectors are easy to prepare and to adapt for an optimal gene silencing efficiency. The ability of electrostatically assembled polymeric siRNA nanovectors (EPSN) to improve the half-life of siRNA, to favor the specificity of the delivery and the accumulation in tumor and to enhance the cellular uptake and endosomal escape for an efficient siRNA delivery will be discussed. Finally, the influence of the versatility of the structure of these nanovectors on the protein down-regulation will be evaluated.",Four-year outcomes from a prospective phase II clinical trial of moderately hypofractionated proton therapy for localized prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199994,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",20190614,"Moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy represents an effective treatment for localized prostate cancer (PC).

There is limited information, however, on the effects of ivermectin in non-neural cell, such as adipocytes. The present work aimed to investigate the role of ivermectin in adipogenesis using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Ivermectin inhibited the differentiation of preadipocytes and triglyceride (TG) accumulation. In particular, the treatment of ivermectin at the middle to late adipogenic differentiation period (day 2-8) was correlated with the inhibition of fat accumulation. Ivermectin treatment also significantly modulated the mRNA expression of key markers in adipogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, uptake, and oxidation, and enhanced the gene expression of two subunits of the glycine receptor (GlyR). Specifically, the protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) were reduced. Interestingly, the suppression of TG accumulation by ivermectin was partially abolished by rosiglitazone, a specific PPARγ agonist, but Z-guggulsterone, a selective FXR antagonist, failed to rescue the ivermectin-induced effect on adipogenesis. Lastly, ivermectin prevented adipogenesis induced by permethrin and fipronil. In conclusion, ivermectin inhibits adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes partially via PPARγ & GlyR-dependent, but not FXR-dependent, pathway.",Macrophage-expressed CD51 promotes cancer stem cell properties via the TGF-β1/smad2/3 axis in pancreatic cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199988,Cancer letters,20190614,"Macrophage-targeted therapy offers new options for intractable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has a low 5-year survival rate. However, the factors regulating the biological function and phenotype of macrophages in PDAC are incompletely understood. Here, we found that CD51 was positively associated with the poor prognosis of PDAC patients and was highly expressed on macrophages but not on pancreatic cancer cells. Subsequently, we found that CD51 was a marker of macrophages, which promoted the stemness of pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, knockdown of CD51 in macrophages drove macrophages toward an M1-like phenotype. Mechanistically, macrophage-expressed CD51 contributed to the acquisition of stemness traits of pancreatic cancer cells by regulating the TGF-β1/smad2/3 pathway. Our data demonstrate the central role played by macrophage-expressed CD51 in the acquisition of stemness traits of pancreatic cancer cells through the paracrine induction of TGF-β1. We first show the connection between the CD51/TGF-β1/smad2/3 axis and PDAC cancer stem cell properties and then indicate that CD51-targeted therapy is a new therapeutic modality for PDAC."

However, extensive comparative and phylogenetic analyses of this group using complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenome) are limited particularly in the context of increasing macroheteroceran mitogenomes reported to date. In this study, complete mitogenome of the Epicopeia hainesii is determined as the first Epicopeiidae species with mitogenome available. The whole mitogenome is circular with 15,395 bp long, and is highly biased toward A + T nucleotides (80.6%) in nucleotide composition. Comparative analyses show that gene content and arrangement of macroheteroceran mitogenomes are generally conservative and are typical of Lepidoptera but exceptions exist. In newly sequenced mitogenome, the motif ""ATACTAA"" is putatively located at the end of gene nad1, rather than in intergenic sequences between trnS2 and nad1 genes routinely observed in Lepidoptera.

Therefore, we designed a brain glioma targeting redox-sensitive hyaluronic acid (HA)-ss-curcumin (CUR) micelles. HA was conjugated to CUR through a disulfide bond, which could form micelles independently in aqueous solution. And we further increased the drug loading by loading free CUR. Brain penetration was achieved with Tween 80, whereas glioma-targeting was inclined by CD44-mediated endocytosis. Compared to the disulfide-free group, the redox-sensitive micelles exhibited rapid in vitro drug release under high glutathione conditions, significantly enhanced cell apoptosis and cellular uptake in G422 glioma cells. Redox-sensitive micelles displayed about 4.70-fold higher area under the curve in rats after intravenous injection in comparison to the free CUR and effectively accumulated in the brain. These findings suggest that redox-sensitive micelles could be a promising candidate to achieve brain targeted CUR delivery.",Comparative proteomics of two citrus varieties in response to infection by the fungus Alternaria alternata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199975,International journal of biological macromolecules,20190614,"Alternaria brown spot (ABS) is a disease caused by the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria alternata, which induces necrotic lesions on fruits and young leaves due to the production of the host-specific ACT toxin by the fungus. To better understand the citrus-A. alternata interaction and to identify putative resistance proteins, as well as the receptor of the ACT toxin, citrus plants susceptible ('Minneola' mandarin) and resistant ('Clemenules' tangor) to A. alternata, infected or not (control) with the pathogen were analyzed by proteomics. Protein changes were observed between citrus genotypes after infection, and 150 candidate proteins were obtained. A general scheme of the metabolic processes involved in susceptible and resistant citrus-A. alternata interactions was designed. Susceptible plants presented a high level of proteins involved in stress response at the final stages of the infection, whereas resistant plants presented high level of ROS proteins, metabolic proteins, and proteins involved in the immune system process. Proteins like ferredoxin and cyclophilin are specific to the susceptible variety and may be good candidates as fungal effector-interacting proteins. This is the first citrus-A. alternata proteomics analysis, which has allowed a better understanding of the molecular bases of the citrus response to ABS disease.",Chitosan nanoparticles: Polyphosphates cross-linking and protein delivery properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199974,International journal of biological macromolecules,20190614,"Nanoparticles from chitosan, in general, can be prepared through ionotropic gelation, physical crosslinking, with anionic polyphosphates. Tripolyphosphate (TPP) is widely used for such purpose especially in drug delivery applications. TPP is a small ion with a triple negative charge throughout the physiologically acceptable pH range. However, the stability of size and surface charge of the particles still challenging. In the current work, the utilization of Hexametaphosphate (HMP) instead of Tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a cross-linking agent is being investigated. HMP is hexavalent molecule in the neutral and slightly basic medium which offers more binding sites readily available for interaction with chitosan. It is thought that increasing the availability of the binding sites in the HMP molecule would result in stronger ionic complexation with chitosan cationic charges. Consequently, such stronger binding improves particles' stability and lead to average size reduction. A comparative study between chitosan/TPP and chitosan/HMP nanoparticles under different complexation conditions was conducted to investigate the effect of HMP on nanoparticles formation. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was applied as a protein model drug to explore the drug loading efficiency, 96.3%, is higher than its TPP, 91.87%, counterparts. However, TPP cross-linked particles showed superior stability upon storage.","Microwave-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction of diverse polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes: Process optimization, structure characterization and antioxidant activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199973,International journal of biological macromolecules,20190614,"Microwave-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction (MAATPE) was applied to simultaneous extraction of diverse polysaccharides from Lentinus edodes with aqueous two-phase extraction system (ATPS) of ethanol/ammonium sulfate as the biphasic extractant. Key factors in MAATPE process were optimized by response surface methodology, and the optimum conditions were concluded as follows: the ATPS composition of ethanol concentration 26.0% (w/w) and (NH4)2SO4 concentration 19.28% (w/w), extraction temperature 78.7 °C, extraction time 19.55 min and solid-to-solvent ratio 1:50. The extraction yields of the polysaccharides from top the phase (PTP) and the bottom phase (PBP) were 2.12 ± 0.21% and 11.16 ± 0.28%, respectively. By means of FT-IR, HPGPC and HPLC analysis, PTP and PBP were different from each other in chemical structure, their average molecular weight (MW) were respectively 119,533 Da and 3906 Da. Also, the mechanism of MAATPE process was explored by composition analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Both polysaccharides exhibited stronger antioxidant activities, EC50 values of scavenging DPPH, hydroxyl and superoxide radicals for PBP achieved 580 ± 3, 83.1 ± 3.6 and 91.1 ± 0.5 μg/mL as against 560 ± 4, 76.3 ± 2.2 and 89.3 ± 2.4 μg/mL of PTP, respectively. Compared with conventional methods using a mono-phase solvent, MAATPE can not only greatly improve extraction efficiency, but also selectively extract diverse polysaccharides.",Disruption of R867 and Y613 interaction plays key roles in JAK2 R867Q mutation caused acute leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199972,International journal of biological macromolecules,20190614,"Janus tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK2) mediates downstream signaling of cytokine receptors in all hematological lineages, constitutively active somatic JAK2 mutations were important for the leukemogenesis of acute leukemia (AL). The JAK2 R867Q somatic mutation is detected in a subset of AL patients. However, roles of JAK2 R867Q mutation in the pathogenesis of AL remain unclear. In this study, homology modeling analysis showed that loss of interaction between R867 and Y613 disrupted the JAK2 JH1/JH2 domain's interactions was responsible for its activation. JAK2 R867Q and mutations (R867A and R867G) abolished this interaction caused JAK2 constitutive activation. While, mutations (R867K, Y613E, R867K/Y613E) repairing this interaction reduced JAK2 R867Q mutation's activity. Furthermore, our studies showed that abolished R867 and Y613 interaction disrupted JH1/JH2 domains' interactions and led to JAK2 constitutive activation. More importantly, mutations (R867Q, R867A and R867G) disrupted this interaction enhanced the activity of JAK2-STAT5 pathway and the proliferation of Ba/F3 and MV4-11 cells. Further study showed that JAK2 R867Q mutation promoted the expression of proliferation marker and inhibited the differentiation marker of Ba/F3 and MV4-11 cells. Thus our studies provide clues in understanding the pathogenesis of JAK2 R867Q mutation in AL.",Naja atra cardiotoxins enhance the protease activity of chymotrypsin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199971,International journal of biological macromolecules,20190614,"Snake venom cardiotoxins (CTXs) present diverse pharmacological functions. Previous studies have reported that CTXs affect the activity of some serine proteases, namely, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, trypsin, and acetylcholinesterase. To elucidate the mode of action of CTXs, the interaction of CTXs with chymotrypsin was thus investigated. It was found that Naja atra CTX isotoxins concentration-dependently enhanced chymotrypsin activity. The capability of CTX1 and CTX5 in increasing chymotrypsin activity was higher than that of CTX2, CTX3, and CTX4. Removal of the molecular beacon-bound CTXs by chymotrypsin, circular dichroism measurement, and acrylamide quenching of Trp fluorescence indicated that CTXs bound to chymotrypsin. Chemical modification of Lys, Arg, or Met residues of CTX1 attenuated its capability to enhance chymotrypsin activity without impairing their bond with chymotrypsin. Catalytically inactive chymotrypsin retained the binding affinity for native and modified CTX1. CTX1 and chemically modified CTX1 differently altered the global conformation of chymotrypsin and inactivated chymotrypsin. Moreover, CTX1 did not reduce the interaction of 2-(p-toluidino)-naphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) with chymotrypsin and inactivated chymotrypsin. Together with previous results revealing that TNS can bind at the hydrophobic region of active site in chymotrypsin, our data suggest that CTXs can enhance chymotrypsin activity by binding to the region outside the enzyme's active site.",Improving the cellobiose-hydrolysis activity and glucose-tolerance of a thermostable β-glucosidase through rational design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199970,International journal of biological macromolecules,20190614,"β-Glucosidase is the rate-limiting component of a cellulase-hydrolyzing reaction. Thermostability and glucose-tolerance are two critical criteria of the enzyme, which practically determine its performance in industrial applications. In this study, a thermostable and glucose-tolerant β-glucosidase (named Bgl1317) belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 1 was acquired from a metagenomic library of Turpan soil through functional screening. Bgl1317 showed excellent thermostability and glucose-tolerance and its crystal structure was subsequently determined at a high resolution. Rational design based on the structure was conducted, producing three beneficial mutations A397R, L188A and A262S. While A397R improved the cellobiose activity by 80%, L188A and A262S increased the IC50 value of glucose from 0.8 to 1.5 M. The residues that may play a role in glucose-tolerance of GH1 β-glucosidases were summarized and the performances of glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases reported in recent years were discussed and compared. This study provides insights into enzymatic properties of Bgl1317 for engineering it into a powerful catalyst and β-glucosidases in general.",Survival Benefit Persists with Delayed Initiation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy following Radical Cystectomy for Locally Advanced Bladder Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199968,Urology,20190614,To determine if delaying the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy following radical cystectomy for locally advanced bladder cancer worsens overall survival.,The Impact of Institutional Factors On Physician Burnout: A National Study of Urology Trainees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199967,Urology,20190614,"To determine the prevalence of burnout in urology trainees and examine the influence of personal, programmatic, and institutional factors on burnout rates."

However, the cell-type specific expression of GPR83, its functional impact in the reward pathway, and in drug reward-learning has not been fully explored. Using GPR83/eGFP mice, we show high GPR83 expression on cholinergic interneurons in the nucleus accumbens and moderate expression on ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. In GPR83 knockout mice, baseline dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is enhanced which disrupts the ratio of tonic vs phasic release. Additionally, GPR83 knockout leads to changes in the expression of dopamine-related genes. Using the morphine conditioned place preference model, we identify sex differences in morphine reward-learning, show that GPR83 is upregulated in the nucleus accumbens following morphine conditioned place preference, and show that shRNA-mediated knockdown of GPR83 in the nucleus accumbens leads to attenuation morphine reward. Together, these findings detect GPR83 expression in the reward-pathway, and show its involvement in dopamine release and morphine reward-learning.",Characterization of the Biosynthetic Pathway of Nucleotide Sugar Precursor UDP-glucose during Sphingan WL Gum Production in Sphingomonas sp. WG.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199955,Journal of biotechnology,20190614,"To elucidate the possible biosynthetic pathway of a precursor UDP-glucose of the sphingan WL gum produced by Sphingomonas sp. WG, two enzymes phosphoglucomutase (PGM) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) were bioinformatically analysed, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and characterized. PGM was in the phosphoglucomutase/phosphomannomutase subclass and UGPase was predicted to be a UDP-Glucose pyrophosphatase in a tetrameric structure. Both enzymes were expressed in soluble form, purified to near homogeneity with high activity at 1159 and 796 U/mg, exhibited folding with reasonable secondary structures, and existed as monomer and tetramer, respectively. The optimal pH and temperature of PGM were 9.0 and 50 °C, respectively, and this protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 40 to 50 °C. The optimal pH and temperature of UGPase were 9.0 and 45 °C, respectively, and the protein was stable at pH 8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 30 to 55 °C. A small-scale one-pot biosynthesis of UDP-glucose by combining PGM and UGPase using glucose-6-phosphate and UTP as substrates was also performed, and formation of UDP-glucose was observed by HPLC detection, which confirmed the biosynthetic pathway of UDP-glucose in vitro. PGM and UGPase will be ideal targets for the metabolic engineering to improve WL gum yields in industrial production.",Does the motor system contribute to the perception of changes in objects visual attributes? The neural dynamics of sensory binding by action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199954,Neuropsychologia,20190614,"The contribution of the motor system to perception has been highlighted in research investigating the effect of performing an action on the conscious processing of information received from the sensory systems. For example, the perceptual temporal asynchrony observed when passively reporting changes in visual object attributes (e.g., colour and position) was found to disappear virtually when the changes resulted from a voluntary motor action. Although the spatio-temporal constraints of sensory binding by action have been broadly investigated, the underlying neural correlates are still largely unknown. In the present study, participants performed temporal order judgments of changes in the colour and position of a visual stimulus, while adapting to a 750 ms delay between a sound (perceptual condition) or the end of a manual reaching action (motor condition), and the visual changes. Behavioural observations indicated that temporal asynchrony (-30.2 ms) decreased in the motor condition (2.7 ms), as a result of sensorimotor adaptation, but not in the perceptual condition (-29.6 ms). EEG-evoked potentials on posterior visual regions showed that early components were altered by sensorimotor adaptation, with in particular a broad reduction in the amplitude of the early P1 component. Furthermore, time-frequency analysis of EEG signals during the 350 ms period preceding the visual changes revealed an increase of the 15-25 Hz frequency band amplitude in the central region and a decrease of the 8-12 Hz frequency band amplitude in the posterior region. Overall the results suggest that sensory binding by action depends on an early top-down modulation of the visual regions by the motor system - in agreement with the pre-activation theory of action-perception coupling - associated with an increase of attentional resources.",Blood flow-restricted training enhances thigh glucose uptake during exercise and muscle antioxidant function in humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199953,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,20190614,"This study examined the effects of blood-flow-restricted (BFR)-training on thigh glucose uptake at rest and during exercise in humans and the muscular mechanisms involved. Ten active men (~25 y; VO2max ~50 mL/kg/min) completed six weeks of training, where one leg trained with BFR (cuff pressure: ~180 mmHg) and the other leg without BFR. Before and after training, thigh glucose uptake was determined at rest and during exercise at 25% and 90% of leg incremental peak power output by sampling of femoral arterial and venous blood and measurement of femoral arterial blood flow. Furthermore, resting muscle samples were collected. After training, thigh glucose uptake during exercise was higher than before training only in the BFR-trained leg (p<0.05) due to increased glucose extraction (p<0.05). Further, BFR-training substantially improved time to exhaustion during exhaustive exercise (11 ± 5% vs. CON-leg; p=0.001). After but not before training, NAC infusion attenuated (~50-100%) leg net glucose uptake and extraction during exercise only in the BFR-trained leg, which coincided with an increased muscle abundance of Cu/Zn-SOD (39%), GPX-1 (29%), GLUT4 (28%), and nNOS (18%) (p<0.05). Training did not affect Mn-SOD, catalase, and VEGF abundance in either leg (p>0.05), although Mn-SOD was higher in BFR-leg vs. CON-leg after training (p<0.05). The ratios of p-AMPK-Thr172/AMPK and p-ACC-Ser79/ACC, and p-ACC-Ser79, remained unchanged in both legs (p>0.05), despite a higher p-AMPK-Thr172 in BFR-leg after training (38%; p<0.05). In conclusion, BFR-training enhances glucose uptake by exercising muscles in humans probably due to an increase in antioxidant function, GLUT4 abundance, and/or NO availability.",SESN2 protects against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy via rescuing mitophagy and improving mitochondrial function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199952,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,20190614,"The clinical application of doxorubicin (Dox) in cancer therapy is limited by its serious cardiotoxicity. Our previous studies and others have recognized that mitochondrial dysfunction is the common feature of Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. However, mechanisms underlying mitochondrial disorders remained largely unknown. SESN2, a highly conserved and stress-inducible protein, is involved in mitochondrial function and autophagy in cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether SESN2 affects Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley rats and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with Dox. SESN2 expression was assessed. The effects of SESN2 on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity were assessed by functional gain and loss experiments. Echocardiographic parameters, morphological and histological analyses, transmission electron microscope and immunofluorescence assays were used to assess cardiac and mitochondrial function. The protein expression of SESN2 was significantly reduced following Dox stimulation. Both knockout of SESN2 by sgRNA and Dox treatment resulted in the inhibition of Parkin-mediated mitophagy, marked cardiomyocytes apoptosis and mitochondria dysfunction. Ectopic expression of SESN2 effectively protected against Dox-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, mitochondrial injury and cardiac dysfunction. Mechanistically, SESN2 interacted with Parkin and p62, promoted accumulation of Parkin to mitochondria and then alleviated Dox-caused inhibition of Parkin mediated mitophagy. Ultimately, the clearance of damaged mitochondria and mitochondrial function were improved following SESN2 overexpression. SESN2 protected against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity through improving mitochondria function and mitophagy. These results established SESN2 as a key player in mitochondrial function and provided a potential therapeutic approach to Dox-induced cardiomyopathy.",Associations between psychological distress and health-related behaviors among adults with chronic kidney disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199950,Preventive medicine,20190614,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 15% of the US general population, and this rate is projected to increase. A healthy lifestyle is important for individuals with CKD to reduce risk for CKD progression and adverse heath events. Adults with CKD also have high rates of psychological distress, which may be associated with unhealthy behaviors. Using the 2013-2017 public use data files of the US National Health Interview Survey, we compared health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity [PA]) and psychological distress (assessed with the Kessler-6 scale) between adults with a CKD diagnosis in the preceding year and a matched sample of adults without a CKD diagnosis. We then examined the association between psychological distress and health behaviors among adults with CKD (n = 3923) using multinomial logistic regression models. Compared to those without CKD, those with CKD had lower rates of smoking, heavy alcohol use, and engagement in any type of PA 3+ times a week and higher rates of psychological distress. In addition to the health concerns posed by the high smoking rate (17%) and low physical activity rate (34%) among those with CKD, smoking and lack of PA were associated with greater risk of mild-moderate and/or serious psychological distress. Compared to no unhealthy behaviors, 2-3 unhealthy behaviors were associated with 4.72 (95% CI = 2.97-7.48) times greater risk of serious psychological distress. Adults with CKD and unhealthy behaviors need help with lifestyle modifications and assessment and treatment of psychological distress to reduce CKD progression and prevent other health complications.","Superoxide anions mediate the effects of angiotensin (1-7) analog, alamandine, on blood pressure and sympathetic activity in the paraventricular nucleus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199949,Peptides,20190614,"Microinjection of alamandine into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) increased blood pressure and enhanced sympathetic activity. The aim of this study was to determine if superoxide anions modulate alamandine's effects in the PVN. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) were recorded in anaesthetized normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Microinjection of alamandine into the PVN increased MAP and RSNA in both WKY rats and SHRs, although to a greater extent in SHRs. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with an alamandine receptor (MrgD) antagonist D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7). Pretreatment with superoxide anion scavengers, tempol and tiron, and NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin (APO), also blocked the effects of alamandine on MAP and RSNA. In addition, pretreatment in the PVN with a superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DETC) potentiated the increases of MAP and RSNA induced by alamandine administration, with a greater response observed in SHRs. Superoxide anions and NADPH oxidase levels in the PVN were higher in SHRs than that in WKY rats. Alamandine treatment increased the levels of superoxide anions and NADPH oxidase in WKY and SHRs, however, with greater effect in SHRs. These alamandine-induced increases were inhibited by D-Pro7-Ang-(1-7) pretreatment in the PVN of both rats. These results demonstrate that superoxide anions in the PVN modulate alamandine-induced increases in blood pressure and sympathetic activity in both normotensive and hypertensive rats. Alamandine increases NADPH oxidase activity to induce superoxide anion production, which is mediated by the alamandine receptor.",Anxiolytic Impact of Apelin-13 in a Rat Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Involvement of Glucocorticoid Receptor and FKBP5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199948,Peptides,20190614,"Apelin-13 is known to be one of the predominant neuropeptides with marked protective role in circuits involved in mood disturbances. The most putative hypothesis in pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is Amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation which interrupt proper function of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and are associated with anxiety. Here, we assessed the potential anxiolytic effect of Apelin-13 in a rodent cognitive impairment model induced by intrahippocampal Aβ25-35 administration. We evaluated the memory impairment and anxiogenic behavior using shuttle box and Elevated plus maze apparatuses. We also measured the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP5) expression as important markers showing the proper feedback mechanism within the HPA axis. Our findings showed that Aβ25-35 administration induced memory impairment and anxiety behaviors. Apelin-13 exerted the anxiolytic effects and provided protection against Aβ25-35-induced passive avoidance memory impairment. Moreover, Apelin-13 caused an increase in GR and a decrease in FKBP5 expression levels in Aβ25-35 treated animals. Taken together, these findings showed the anxiolytic effect of Apelin-13. This effect at least in part, may be mediated through the regulation of GR and FKBP5 expression levels which have a pivotal role in the appropriate negative feedback mechanism within the HPA axis. These data suggest that Apelin-13 might be considered as a potential neuropeptide defense that reduces anxiety along with neuroprotective effect against the Aβ25-35-induced injury.","Maternal prenatal plasma oxytocin is positively associated with prenatal psychological symptoms, but method of immunoassay extraction may affect results.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199947,Biological psychology,20190614,"We examined associations between prenatal plasma oxytocin levels and depressive symptoms, state anxiety, and pregnancy anxiety in 75 women who visited the laboratory with their partners during mid-to-late pregnancy and engaged in relationship discussion tasks prior to a blood draw. Given controversy in the literature regarding oxytocin measurement, we compared two widely-used immunoassay approaches (with and without extraction prior to immunoassay). Levels of immunoreactive oxytocin measured with and without extraction were not correlated with each other. However, both extracted and unextracted oxytocin were positively associated with women's prenatal depressive symptoms in a model that controlled for pregnancy stage and body mass index. Only unextracted oxytocin was associated with state anxiety and pregnancy-specific anxiety. In summary, elevated plasma oxytocin levels in expectant mothers might indicate risk for mental health symptoms during the prenatal period, but results for anxiety are mixed and appear to depend on the immunoassay approach employed.",Resting Heart Rate Variability is Negatively Associated with Mirror Neuron and Limbic Response to Emotional Faces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199946,Biological psychology,20190614,"Whether neurovisceral integration, reflected by resting high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV), constrains or facilitates neural reactivity to other people's emotions is unclear. We assessed the relation between resting HRV and neural activation when observing and imitating emotional faces. We focused on brain regions implicated in sensorimotor resonance, salience detection and arousal. We used electrocardiogram data to compute resting HRV. Resting HRV measures were negatively correlated with activation in a portion of the inferior frontal gyrus showing mirror neuron properties, the insula and the amygdala in response to observation, but not imitation, of emotional faces. Thus, resting HRV appears to be linked to sensitivity to others' emotional cues, both in terms of the tendency to map others' emotional facial expressions onto one's own motor system and to rapidly detect and mark others' emotions as salient events. Resting HRV may reflect, in part, a threshold for increased processing of others' emotional cues."

Brain pathologies that involve the hippocampus like epilepsy, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, are commonly associated with cognitive impairments and mood disorders. These insults can affect the neural stem cells and the subsequent neurogenic cascade in the hippocampus, resulting in the induction of aberrant neurogenesis, which is thought to compromise hippocampal network function, thereby hampering hippocampus-dependent behavior. We here summarize recent preclinical literature on hippocampal insult-induced changes in neurogenesis and based on that, we propose that normalizing aberrant neurogenesis post-insult may help to prevent or rescue behavioral deficits which could help develop novel therapeutic strategies.",Behavioral cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol is accompanied by parallel changes in the activity of AMPK system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199934,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",20190614,"Behavioral sensitization is thought to be relevant to the psychopathology of drug addiction. A previous study from our research group demonstrated cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol. Although these findings suggest a common mechanism of action between these two drugs, little is known about the molecular or cellular aspects of this commonality. The AMPK pathway functions as an intracellular energy sensor and plays a critical role in maintaining cellular energy homeostasis. Thus, the present study examined AMPK signaling following reciprocal cross-sensitization between cocaine and ethanol in the rat prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were repeatedly treated with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, 5 times) or ethanol (0.5 g/kg, 15 times) and then challenged reciprocally with the other drug. When sensitized to either cocaine or ethanol, the phosphorylation in response to additional challenges with the same drug was enhanced, indicating the development of sensitization. However, responses to the cocaine challenge were enhanced in the ethanol-sensitized state, whereas the responses to the ethanol challenge were not apparently enhanced in the cocaine-sensitized state. This was likely due to the ceiling effect of cocaine sensitization, which suggested that cocaine had more robust effects than ethanol. Although the same changes were found for two upstream kinases of AMPK (LKB1 and CaMK4), TAK1 responded differently and was not affected by acute challenges from either cocaine or ethanol. In the prefrontal cortex, there was an increase in activity, whereas there was a decrease in activity in the dorsal striatum. This difference might be due to dopamine D1 receptor dominance in the prefrontal cortex and D2 receptor dominance in the dorsal striatum. Taken together, these results suggest that both cocaine and ethanol may share overlapping molecular pathways in the process of behavioral sensitization. However, the action of cocaine was stronger than that of ethanol.",Input of recombinant phenotyping for the characterization of a novel acyclovir-resistance mutation identified in a patient with recurrent herpetic keratitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199933,Antiviral research,20190614,"We report here a case of an immunocompetent patient suffering from recurrent epithelial herpetic keratitis associated with the emergence of antiviral resistance.

Its hydrolysate of intestinal microbiota, genipin, is thought to be responsible for the hepatotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanism that genipin contributes to the hepatotoxicity of geniposide is not well understood. In this study, we found that genipin spontaneously converted into a reactive dialdehyde intermediate and covalently bond to the primary amine group of free amino acids in both of the phosphate buffers and geniposide-treated rats. Furthermore, genipin dialdehyde can form the covalent linkage to the primary amino group (ε) of lysine side chains of the hepatic proteins in geniposide-treated rats. Pretreatment with β-glucosidase or antibiotics significantly modulated the genipin dialdehyde formation and protein modification, revealing the essential role of microbial glycosidases. The levels of protein adduct were that mapped onto the hepatotoxicity of geniposide. In summary, this study demonstrates that the intestinal microbiota mediated covalent modification of the hepatic protein by genipin dialdehyde may play a crucial role in the liver injury of geniposide. The study is also helpful for understanding the contribution of intestinal microbiota to the metabolic activation of xenobiotics.",DRG2 knockdown induces Golgi fragmentation via GSK3β phosphorylation and microtubule stabilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199931,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular cell research,20190614,"The perinuclear stacks of the Golgi apparatus maintained by dynamic microtubules are essential for cell migration. Activation of Akt (protein kinase B, PKB) negatively regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β)-mediated tau phosphorylation, which enhances tau binding to microtubules and microtubule stability. In this study, experiments were performed on developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein 2 (DRG2)-stably knockdown HeLa cells to determine whether knockdown of DRG2 in HeLa cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) affects microtubule dynamics, perinuclear Golgi stacking, and cell migration. Here, we show that DRG2 plays a key role in regulating microtubule stability, perinuclear Golgi stack formation, and cell migration. DRG2 knockdown prolonged the EGF receptor (EGFR) localization in endosome, enhanced Akt activity and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β. Tau, a target of GSK3β, was hypo-phosphorylated in DRG2-knockdown cells and showed greater association with microtubules, resulting in microtubule stabilization. DRG2-knockdown cells showed defects in microtubule growth and microtubule organizing centers (MTOC), Golgi fragmentation, and loss of directional cell migration. These results reveal a previously unappreciated role for DRG2 in the regulation of perinuclear Golgi stacking and cell migration via its effects on GSK3β phosphorylation, and microtubule stability.",Formic acid up-regulates vascular tension through nitric oxide-cGMP signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199930,Chemico-biological interactions,20190614,"Formic acid is a common organic acid used in many industrial processes. There is a paucity of research on the direct toxicity of formic acid and how it might affect the cardiovascular system. This study aimed to understand the effect of formic acid on vascular tension in an animal model and the underlying mechanism. Results found that the vasodilation induced by formic acid was related to the endothelium. When the dosage of formic acid was 1 mM or 5 mM, the vasodilation of endothelium-intact rings was partially suppressed by l-NAME, NS-2028 and nifedipine, and vasoconstriction caused by CaCl2 was inhibited, and the mRNA levels of eNOS, the activity of NOS (tNOS, iNOS and cNOS) and the level of NO and cGMP were significantly increased. Results also found that eNOS protein expression was significantly enhanced by 5 mM of formic acid. These results suggest formic acid can relax the aortic vessels of rats in a dose-dependent pattern. Further, the mechanism of the formic acid-induced vasodilatation likely involved the NO/cGMP pathway. Finally, the current study has revealed that vasodilation induced by high concentrations of formaldehyde may be the effect of the metabolite formic acid. This study will help further inform the etiologies of formic acid-related angiocardiopathies.",Downregulation of microRNA-302b-3p relieves oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation induced injury in murine hippocampal neurons through up-regulating Nrf2 signaling by targeting fibroblast growth factor 15/19.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199929,Chemico-biological interactions,20190614,"MicroRNAs have emerged as critical mediators of cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Recent studies have demonstrated that microRNA-302b-3p (miR-302b-3p) plays an important role in regulating apoptosis and oxidative stress in various cells. However, whether miR-302b-3p is involved in regulating cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury-induced neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress remains unknown. In the present study, we explored the potential function and molecular mechanism of miR-302b-3p in oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal injury, using an in vitro model of cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury. We found that miR-302b-3p expression was up-regulated by OGD/R treatment in neurons. The inhibition of miR-302b-3p improved cell viability, and reduced apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species, showing a protective effect against OGD/R-induced injury. Interestingly, miR-302b-3p was shown to target and modulate murine fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15). Moreover, our results showed that miR-302b-3p down-regulation contributed to the promotion of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated antioxidant signaling associated with the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β. However, the knockdown of FGF15 significantly reversed the miR-302b-3p inhibition-mediated protective effect in OGD/R-treated neurons. Overall, these results demonstrated that miR-302b-3p inhibition confers a neuroprotective effect in OGD/R-treated neurons by up-regulating Nrf2/ARE antioxidant signaling via targeting FGF15, providing a novel target for neuroprotection in cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion injury.",NO2 functionalized coumarin derivatives suppress cancer progression and facilitate apoptotic cell death in KRAS mutant colon cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199928,Chemico-biological interactions,20190614,"Colon cancer is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide even with the significant progress made in screening techniques and therapeutic agents. Genetic mutations in tumors complicated the treatments, and the survival rate remains low for patients at late or metastatic stages. KRAS gene mutation which leads to failure of the EGFR targeted therapies stands for an example of the challenges in clinical sites. Therefore, development of novel agents for colon cancer treatment is in need. Natural and synthetic coumarin derivatives have been suggested with various biological activities with pharmacologic potential including anti-cancer capacity. Here in this study, five coumarin derivatives, include trifluoromethyl-, dimethoxy-, and/or nitro-substitutions at different positions, were synthesized. Their cancer inhibition potential was investigated in various cancer cell lines. Our data demonstrated that one nitro-coumarin derivate, 5,7-Dimethoxy-4-methyl-6-nitro-chromen-2-one, exhibits cytotoxicity specifically towards colon cancer cells under competitive EC50. Our results showed that this compound can effectively suppress colon cancer cells harboring either wild type or mutant KRAS genes, and that it could inhibit short-term proliferation, long term proliferation, and migration capacities of cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrated that this coumarin derivate facilitates cancer cell death through activation of apoptosis pathway. Our results suggest that this coumarin derivate is a promising lead drug worth further investigation and development for future cancer treatment.","Validation of water-borne cortisol and corticosterone in tadpoles: Recovery rate from an acute stressor, repeatability, and evaluating rearing methods.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199927,General and comparative endocrinology,20190614,"Amphibian populations are declining globally, so understanding how individuals respond to anthropogenic and environmental stressors may aid conservation efforts. Using a non-invasive water-borne hormone assay, we measured the release rates of two glucocorticoid hormones, corticosterone and cortisol, in Rio Grande Leopard frog, Rana berlandieri, tadpoles. We validated this method pharmacologically and biologically using an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge, exposure to exogenous corticosterone, and an agitation test. We calculated the repeatability of hormone release rates, the recovery time from an acute stressor, and explored rearing methods for tadpoles. Tadpole corticosterone release rates increased following an ACTH challenge, exposure to exogenous corticosterone, and agitation, validating the use of water-borne hormone methods in this species. After exposure to an acute stressor via agitation, corticosterone release rates began to decline after 2h and were lowest after 6h, suggesting a relatively rapid recovery from an acute stressor. Tadpoles reared in groups had higher corticosterone release rates than tadpoles reared individually, and lost mass by Day 7, while tadpoles reared individually did not show a stress response, therefore either rearing method is viable, but have differing physiological costs for tadpoles. Repeatability of corticosterone release rates was moderate to high in R. berlandieri tadpoles, indicating that this species can show a response to selection and potentially respond to rapid environmental change. Our results show that the water-borne hormone assay is a viable way to measure glucocorticoids in this species and is useful in the field of conservation physiology for rare and endangered species.","Effects of high and low temperature on expression of GnIH, GnIH receptor, GH and PRL genes in the male grass puffer during breeding season.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31199926,General and comparative endocrinology,20190614,"Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is a multifunctional hypophysiotropic neurohormone and has a stimulatory role in the control of reproduction in the grass puffer. To clarify the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the effect of changes in water temperature on reproduction in fish, we previously revealed that, in parallel to gonadal regression, both low and high temperature significantly decreased the expressions of the genes encoding kisspeptin (kiss2), kisspeptin receptor (kiss2r), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh1) in the brain and gonadotropin (GTH) subunits (fshb and lhb) in the pituitary of sexually mature male grass puffer. In this study, we examined the changes in expression of gnih and GnIH receptor gene (gnihr) in the brain and pituitary along with the genes for growth hormone (gh) and prolactin (prl) in the pituitary of male grass puffer exposed to low temperature (14°C), normal temperature (21°C, as initial control) and high temperature (28°C) conditions for 7 days. The levels of gnih and gnihr mRNAs were significantly decreased in both low and high temperature conditions compared to normal temperature in the brain and pituitary. Similarly, the gh mRNA levels were significantly decreased in both low and high temperature conditions. The prl mRNAs showed no significant changes at high temperature, whereas drastically decreased at low temperature possibly by dysfunctional cold stress. Taken together, the present results suggest that, in addition to the inhibitory effect of temperature changes on the Kiss2/GnRH1/GTH system, the suppression of GnIH/GH system may also be involved in the termination of reproduction by high temperature at the end of breeding season."
