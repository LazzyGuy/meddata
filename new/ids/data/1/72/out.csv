As the difference between early MS [i.e. clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)] and RIS is the occurrence of a clinical event, it is logical to improve detection of the subclinical form without interfering with MRI as there are radiological diagnostic criteria for that. Our objective was to use machine-learning classification methods to identify morphometric measures that help to discriminate patients with RIS from those with CIS.",Effects of the influenza vaccine on pediatric kidney transplant outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714274,Pediatric transplantation,2019 03 20,"The influenza vaccine is critical for preventing influenza-related complications in transplant patients. Previous studies demonstrated de novo donor-specific antibody formation and rejection following the influenza vaccination. This risk has not been adequately assessed in the pediatric population. We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of 187 unique pediatric kidney transplant recipients, transplanted from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2015, assessing for an association of the influenza vaccination with various transplant outcomes. The influenza vaccine was received by 125 of 187 patients within the first year post-transplant. Using log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves, vaccinated patients had a significantly lower risk of mortality (P = 0.048). There were no differences in death-censored graft survival (P = 0.253), graft survival (P = 0.098), or rejection (P = 0.195) between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. To address the problem of multiple exposures for a yearly vaccine, Cox proportional hazards regression was utilized with post-transplant vaccination status considered as a time-dependent covariate; analyses were performed using both a 360- and 180-day vaccination period following any post-transplant influenza vaccination. In this model, being vaccinated did not result in a significant difference in mortality (HR 0.90 [0.16, 5.15], P = 0.91), death-censored graft survival (HR 0.70 [0.31, 1.58], P = 0.39), graft survival (HR 0.69 [0.32, 1.49], P = 0.34), or rejection (HR 0.67 [0.37, 1.19], P = 0.17). Eight patients developed de novo donor-specific antibodies following the first post-transplant influenza vaccination; three then developed biopsy-proven rejection. These results suggest influenza vaccination is safe in pediatric kidney transplant recipients, and larger prospective studies are required to conclusively confirm our findings.",Self-regulated learning strategies in world's first MOOC in implant dentistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714273,European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe,2019 02 25,"Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have been often described as a major innovation Higher Education, but their application in the teaching of clinical disciplines is still very limited, while there is a lack of scientific evaluations in this domain.

It consists of 18 amino acid residues and works as a part of innate immune system. In this study, we examined the intrinsic aggregation propensity of this AMP using multiple computational algorithms, namely, TANGO, AGGRESCAN, FOLDAMYLOID, AMYLPRED, and ZYGGREGATOR, and found that the peptide is predicted to have a high propensity for the β sheet formation that disposes this peptide to be amyloidogenic. Under in vitro conditions, PG-4 formed visible aggregates and displayed the hallmark properties of typical amyloids such as enhanced binding of Congo red, increased fluorescence with Thioflavin-T, and fibrillar morphology under transmission electron microscopy. Then we examined its antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis and found that the aggregated peptide retained its antimicrobial activity. Additionally, the aggregates remain non-toxic to the HEK293 and Caco2 cells. Our study suggests that the inherent aggregation properties of AMP can rationally be explored as a potential source of peptide-based antimicrobials with enhanced stability.",Cognitive mapping style relates to posterior-anterior hippocampal volume ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714271,Hippocampus,2019 02 04,"As London taxi drivers acquire ""the knowledge"" and develop a detailed cognitive map of London, their posterior hippocampi (pHPC) gradually increase in volume, reflecting an increasing pHPC/aHPC volume ratio. In the mnemonic domain, greater pHPC/aHPC volume ratios in young adults have been found to relate to better recollection ability, indicating that the balance between pHPC and aHPC volumes might be reflective of cross-domain individual differences. Here, we examined participants' self-reported use of cognitive map-based navigational strategies in relation to their pHPC/aHPC hippocampal volume ratio. We find that greater reported cognitive map use was related to significantly greater posterior, relative to anterior, hippocampal volume in two separate samples of young adults. Further, greater reported cognitive map usage correlated with better performance on a self-initiated navigation task. Together, these data help to advance our understanding of differences between aHPC and pHPC and the greater role of pHPC in spatial mapping.",Prodrome in relapsing-remitting and primary progressive multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714270,European journal of neurology,2019 06 05,The multiple sclerosis prodrome remains poorly understood.

Both of these variables are related to resource foraging and therefore can be expected to have effects on sensory capacity. However, such effects have remained poorly studied, let alone in phylogenetically explicit multi-species comparisons. We contribute to filling this gap in a study of 60 species of geometrid moths (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), using adult head measures (eye size, antennal length and shape, forehead width) as indices of sensory capacity. When controlled for body size, eyes of the more capital breeding species (i.e. those with low contribution of adult feeding to reproduction) were found to be smaller, and female antennae shorter, than in income breeders. Feathery (vs simple filiform) male antennae were more frequently present in the capital breeders and in larger species. Regarding diet breadth, generalist species were found to have relatively wider male foreheads than specialists. The results suggest that (a) breeding strategy rather than diet breadth predicts sensory capacity in geometrids, (b) capital breeding (vs income breeding) is related to low sensory capacity in females, and (c) in contrast, males of the capital breeding species have evolved towards elevated olfactory capacity.",Effect of different time intervals after feeding on plasma metabolites in growing pigs: an UPLC-MS-based metabolomics study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714268,Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,2019 05 17,"A diet consumed by pigs provides the nutrients for the production of a large number of metabolites that, after first-pass metabolism in the liver, circulate systemically where they may exert diverse physiologic influences on pigs. So far, little is known of how feeding elicits changes in metabolic profiles for growing pigs. This study investigated differences in plasma metabolites in growing pigs at several intervals after feeding using the technique of metabolomics. Ten barrows (22.5 ± 0.5 kg BW) were fed a corn-soybean meal basal diet and were kept in metabolism crates for a period of 11 days. An indwelling catheter was inserted into the jugular vein of each pig before the experimental period. Plasmas before and 1, 4, and 8 hr after feeding were collected at day 11 and differential metabolites were determined using a metabolomics approach. Direct comparison at several intervals after feeding revealed differences in 14 compounds. Identified signatures were enriched in metabolic pathways related to linoleic acid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, lysine degradation, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and lysine biosynthesis. These results suggest that plasma metabolites of growing pigs after feeding were modulated through changes in linoleic acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism.",Fecal urgency is common in constipated patients and is associated with anxiety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714267,Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,2019 03 29,Fecal urgency is a symptom generally associated with diarrhea but is also reported by patients with constipation.

However, it has been considered that doses of IR used to damage maternal chromosomes may also affect morphology of the eggs and decrease their developmental potential. Thus, the main goal of the present research was to assess alterations in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs caused by the high dose of IR administered during androgenesis. In the present research, rainbow trout eggs were irradiated with 350 Gy of X-rays, inseminated and exposed to the high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) shock to develop as androgenetic doubled haploids (DHs). The distribution of lipid droplets in the irradiated and non-irradiated rainbow trout eggs, survival rates and morphology of larvae from androgenetic and control groups were compared. It has been observed that non-irradiated and irradiated eggs exhibited altered distribution of lipid droplets. Most of the eggs before IR treatment displayed rather equal distribution of the oil droplets. In turn, majority of eggs studied after irradiation had coalesced lipid droplets, a pattern found in eggs with reduced quality. Incidences of abnormally developed larvae were more frequently observed among fish that hatched from the irradiated eggs. Observed changes suggest X-rays applied for the genetic inactivation of rainbow trout eggs may lead to decrease of their developmental competence.",Elevated diastolic wall shear stress in regurgitant semilunar valvular lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714251,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,2019 02 04,"Alterations in wall shear stress (WSS) assessed using 4D flow MRI have been shown to play a role in various vascular pathologies, such as bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy.

Despite its unparalleled biodiversity, regional comparative phylogeographic studies are still scarce, with most focusing on model clades (e.g. birds) and typically examining a handful of loci. Here, we apply a genome-wide comparative phylogeographic approach to test hypotheses of codiversification of freshwater fishes in the trans-Andean region. Using target capture methods, we examined exon data for over 1,000 loci combined with complete mitochondrial genomes to study the phylogeographic history of five primary fish species (>150 individuals) collected from eight major river basins in Northwestern South America and Lower Central America. To assess their patterns of genetic structure, we inferred genealogical concordance taking into account all major aspects of phylogeography (within loci, across multiple genes, across species and among biogeographic provinces). Based on phylogeographic concordance factors, we tested four a priori biogeographic hypotheses, finding support for three of them and uncovering a novel, unexpected pattern of codiversification. The four emerging inter-riverine patterns are as follows: (a) Tuira + Atrato, (b) Ranchería + Catatumbo, (c) Magdalena system and (d) Sinú + Atrato. These patterns are interpreted as shared responses to the complex uplifting and orogenic processes that modified or sundered watersheds, allowing codiversification and speciation over geological time. We also find evidence of cryptic speciation in one of the species examined and instances of mitochondrial introgression in others. These results help further our knowledge of the historical geographic factors shaping the outstanding biodiversity of the Neotropics.",Comparing opium tincture and methadone for medication-assisted treatment of patients with opioid use disorder: Protocol for a multicenter parallel group noninferiority double-blind randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714249,International journal of methods in psychiatric research,2019 03 07,This is the first study to compare the safety and efficacy of opium tincture (OT) with methadone for treatment of opioid use disorder.,"Evaluation of the carryover effect of antibiotic, bee pollen and propolis on growth performance, carcass traits and splenic and hepatic histology of growing rabbits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714248,Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,2019 04 25,"Sixty-four nulliparous female rabbits were distributed among eight groups (eight animals/group). Group one was the unsupplemented control group; the other seven groups were supplemented with zinc bacitracin (ZnB) at 100 mg, or bee pollen (BP) and/or propolis (Pro) at 150 and 300 mg in a capsulated form, three times a week, day after day, continuously all over the experimental period. The experiment was run for eight parties; at each parity, 28 kids of each doe group (a total of 224 rabbits) were divided into two subgroups weaned, respectively, at 24 and 30 days of age. Thus, for each parity, there were 16 groups (eight does treatments × two weaning age, 14 rabbits per group). The growing rabbits fed the standard diets without supplements. The growth performance, the carcass traits, the liver and the spleen histology of rabbits were checked up to 90 days of age to find possible carryover effects of the supplements. The supplements had no significant effect on most of the growth performance at 90 days of age, but BP150 and BP+Pro300 increased the growth rate in comparison with ZnB group. The liver weight in the control, BP300 and Pro300 groups was higher than the ZnB one. The spleen weight was higher in the groups ZnB, BP150, Pro300 and BP+Pro300, followed by the control, BP300 and BP+Pro150 and thus Pro150. The heart % in the BP150 and Pro300 groups was higher than ZnB and BP+Pro150 groups. A lymphoid hyperplasia of splenic white pulp was observed in the BP+Pro groups, while propolis alone showed a mild activation of lymphobiosis. The Pro and BP groups showed the same picture of the control group exhibiting a hydropic degeneration of mostly hepatic cells, while the ZnB group exhibited adverse effect on the bile ducts featuring portal periductal inflammatory cells infiltration with epithelial hyperplasia reflecting chronic cholangitis.","Genomics, environment and balancing selection in behaviourally bimodal populations: The caribou case.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714247,Molecular ecology,2019 05 17,"Selection forces that favour different phenotypes in different environments can change frequencies of genes between populations along environmental clines. Clines are also compatible with balancing forces, such as negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), which maintains phenotypic polymorphisms within populations. For example, NFDS is hypothesized to maintain partial migration, a dimorphic behavioural trait prominent in species where only a fraction of the population seasonally migrates. Overall, NFDS is believed to be a common phenomenon in nature, yet a scarcity of studies were published linking naturally occurring allelic variation with bimodal or multimodal phenotypes and balancing selection. We applied a Pool-seq approach and detected selection on alleles associated with environmental variables along a North-South gradient in western North American caribou, a species displaying partially migratory behaviour. On 51 loci, we found a signature of balancing selection, which could be related to NFDS and ultimately the maintenance of the phenotypic polymorphisms known within these populations. Yet, remarkably, we detected directional selection on a locus when our sample was divided into two behaviourally distinctive groups regardless of geographic provenance (a subset of GPS-collared migratory or sedentary individuals), indicating that, within populations, phenotypically homogeneous groups were genetically distinctive. Loci under selection were linked to functional genes involved in oxidative stress response, body development and taste perception. Overall, results indicated genetic differentiation along an environmental gradient of caribou populations, which we found characterized by genes potentially undergoing balancing selection. We suggest that the underlining balancing force, NFDS, plays a strong role within populations harbouring multiple haplotypes and phenotypes, as it is the norm in animals, plants and humans too.",Adaptive Identification of Cortical and Subcortical Imaging Markers of Early Life Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714246,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,2019 05 08,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition associated with a range of brain imaging abnormalities.

For the first time, we devised unique and innovative splenic devascularization (SDV) procedure to alleviated untoward effects of SSPX but to maintain its benefits for the indicated patients. From April 2013 to December 2014, 520 recipients underwent ALDLT, and the SSPX and SDV were simultaneously performed in 62 (11.9%) and 61 (11.7%) patients, respectively. The most common indication was hypersplenism-related pancytopenia (n = 101), small-for-size graft (n = 14), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (n = 7), and splenic artery aneurysm (n = 1). Postoperative small-for-size graft syndrome (SFSS) was absent in both SSPX and SDV, and preoperative pancytopenia was improved in both groups since postoperative 1 week, although SSPX was more substantial than SDV. Preoperative splenic volume (706.2 ± 282.9 ml) after SDV significantly decreased to 425.5 ± 204.4 ml on 1 month, respectively. In contrast to SDV, SSPX resulted in longer operation time and higher incidence of postoperative complications including mortality. In conclusion, SDV can replace SSPX during ALDLT without hampering its beneficial roles seriously, but get rid of splenectomy-related lethal complication.",Bone-derived biochar and magnetic biochar for effective removal of fluoride in groundwater: Effects of synthesis method and coexisting chromium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714244,Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,2019 02 21,"The presence of fluoride in groundwater in excess of 1.5 mg L-1 is a major environmental health concern, and biochar is a promising low-cost adsorbent for the treatment of such water. In the present study, pristine and magnetic biochars were synthesized by peanut hull and bovine bone for the adsorption of fluoride. The biochars were systematically characterized by SEM-EDS, BET, XRD, VSM, FT-IR, and XPS. The experiment results showed that the magnetic biochar prepared by soaking biomass in FeCl3 solution and then pyrolyzing (""prepyrolysis"") had a higher adsorption capacity than that prepared by mixing pristine biochar with Fe2+ /Fe3+ solution and then treating with NaOH (""postpyrolysis""). The bone-derived biochar and magnetic biochar exhibited high adsorption capacity of fluoride (>5 mg g-1 ) due to the presence of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and γ-Fe2 O3 . The 0.1 M NaOH solution could be optimal desorption agent, and the adsorption-desorption experiments indicated the bone biochars maintained the reasonable adsorption capacity after several cycles. Moreover, the coexisting Cr(VI) and fluoride could be removed simultaneously by bone-derived biochars. It is suggested that bovine bone-derived pristine and magnetic biochars can be used as preferential adsorbents for fluoride removal from contaminated groundwater. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Bone-derived pristine and magnetic biochars exhibit high adsorption capacity for fluoride in weakly alkaline solution. The presence of hydroxyapatite and γ-Fe2 O3 in bone-derived biochars plays an important role for fluoride adsorption. Magnetic biochars prepared by soaking biomass in FeCl3 solution and then pyrolyzing (""prepyrolysis"") perform better.

A cross-sectional study, including 45 professional dancers (15 flamenco dancers, 15 ballet dancers, and 15 contemporary dancers), was planned. We analyzed the ability to generate mental motor visual and kinesthetic images with the revised movement imagery questionnaire (MIQ-R) and mental chronometry (MC); the real movement execution (RME) chronometry was also measured, using arm and jump movement assessments. ANOVA revealed significant differences between groups regarding the jump movement assessments for the kinesthetic MIQ-R item (F = 5.29, P = 0.009), for the RME chronometry (F = 13.19, P = <0.001), and for the kinesthetic MC (F = 9.28, P < 0.001). The post-hoc analysis revealed significant differences between flamenco dancers compared with contemporary and ballet dancers for all the variables regarding the jump movement. Flamenco dancers used significantly greater visual than kinesthetic imagery modalities to generate mental motor imagery in the jump movement (P = 0.024, d = 0.63). No differences were found in the arm movement assessment between groups. Results reveal differences in the ability to generate motor images, specifically the kinesthetic ones, between flamenco dancers and ballet and contemporary dancers. When performing a non-familiar complex movement, dancers predominantly use a visual motor imagery modality, which leads to a longer execution time as well as a longer time for kinesthetic mental motor imagery.",Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and maintenance events in 2-implant-supported mandibular overdenture patients: A 5-year prospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714227,Clinical oral implants research,2019 03 13,To prospectively evaluate patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and treatment outcomes of mandibular two-implant retained overdentures (IOD) in an edentulous geriatric cohort with history of deficient complete dentures (CD).,Depression in carers of people with dementia from a minority ethnic background: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of psychosocial interventions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714226,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2019 04 29,Systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of interventions in reducing depressive symptoms in ethnic minority carers of people with dementia.,Bmp4 is an essential growth factor for the initiation of genital tubercle (GT) outgrowth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714224,Congenital anomalies,2019 02 18,"The external genitalia are appendage organs outgrowing from the posterior body trunk. Murine genital tubercle (GT), anlage of external genitalia, initiates its outgrowth from embryonic day (E) 10.5 as a bud structure. Several growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Wnt and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) are essential for the GT outgrowth. However, the mechanisms of initiation of GT outgrowth are poorly understood. We previously identified bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling as a negative regulator for GT outgrowth. We show here novel aspects of Bmp4 functions for GT outgrowth. We identified the Bmp4 was already expressed in cloaca region at E9.5, before GT outgrowth. To analyze the function of Bmp4 at early stage for the initiation of GT outgrowth, we utilized the Hoxa3-Cre driver and Bmp4 flox/flox mouse lines. Hoxa3 Cre/+ ; Bmp4 flox/flox mutant mice showed the hypoplasia of GT with reduced expression of outgrowth promoting genes such as Wnt5a, Hoxd13 and p63, whereas Shh expression was not affected. Formation of distal urethral epithelium (DUE) marked by the Fgf8 expression is essential for controlling mesenchymal genes expression in GT and subsequent its outgrowth. Furthermore, Fgf8 expression was dramatically reduced in such mutant mice indicating the defective DUE formation. Hence, current results indicate that Bmp4 is an essential growth factor for the initiation of GT outgrowth independent of Shh signaling. Thus, Bmp4 positively regulates for the formation of DUE. The current study provides new insights into the function of Bmp signaling at early stage for the initiation of GT outgrowth.",Few-Layer Bismuthene with Anisotropic Expansion for High-Areal-Capacity Sodium-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714223,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 03 19,"Bismuth is a promising anode material for state-of-the-art rechargeable batteries due to its high theoretical volumetric capacity and relatively low working potential. However, its charge storage mechanism is unclear, hindering further improvement of the cell performance. Here, using in situ transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques as well as theoretical analysis, it is found that a large anisotropic volume expansion of 142% occurs along the z-axis largely due to the alloy reaction during sodiation, significantly reducing the electrochemical performance of bismuth electrodes. To address this problem, ultrathin few-layer bismuthene with a large aspect ratio is rationally synthesized, and can relieve the expansion strain along the z-axis. A free-standing bismuthene/graphene composite electrode with tunable thickness achieves a strikingly stable and high areal sodium storage capacity of 12.1 mAh cm-2 , which greatly exceeds that of most reported electrode materials. The clarification of the charge storage mechanism and the superior areal capacity achieved should facilitate the development of bismuth-based high-performance anodes for practical electrochemical energy-storage applications.",Direct Conversion of Benzothiadiazole to Benzimidazole: New Benzimidazole-Derived Metal-Organic Frameworks with Adjustable Honeycomb-Like Cavities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714222,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 05,"Up to now, the direct conversion of the thiadiazole ring to other heterocyclic rings has been a very challenging task. Herein, a CdII -mediated alcohol-substitution strategy for direct conversion from benzothiadiazole to benzimidazole is reported. Experimental and molecular modeling studies on the role of the chelated metal ion in this in situ alcohol-substitution reaction revealed that it serves as an all-rounder that is involved in the insertion of alcohol, activation of the thiadiazole ring by coordinative interaction, and the sulfur-extrusion process. Interestingly, the insertion of alcohol occurs much earlier than the sulfur-extrusion process, supported by a water-mediated proton-transfer process. This strategy also is suitable for constructing new benzimidazole-derived MOFs [Cd2 (HMBIDC2- )2 ]⋅4 H2 O (Cd-BID-MOF-1, HMBIDC2- =2-methyl-1H-benzimidazole-4,7-dicarboxylate) and [Cd2 (HPBIDC2- )2 ]⋅1/3 H2 O (Cd-BID-MOF-2, HPBIDC2- =2-(3-hydroxypropyl)-2H-benzimidazole-4,7-dicarboxylate). Because the terminal hydroxyl group on the imidazole ring protrudes into the circular channel in rhombohedral Cd-BID-MOF-2, the cavity is closer to hydrophilic than the honeycomb-like cavity in Cd-BID-MOF-1 with similar 3D structure. This rare observation will provide a new strategy to develop in situ ligand-reaction synthesis of functional MOFs and useful chelation-assisted catalytic reactions in heteroaromatic chemistry.",Mechanical and Electric Control of Photonic Modes in Random Dielectrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714221,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 03 19,"Random dielectrics defines a class of non-absorbing materials where the index of refraction is randomly arranged in space. Whenever the transport mean free path is sufficiently small, light can be confined in modes with very small volume. Random photonic modes have been investigated for their basic physical insights, such as Anderson localization, and recently several applications have been envisioned in the field of renewable energies, telecommunications, and quantum electrodynamics. An advantage for optoelectronics and quantum source integration offered by random systems is their high density of photonic modes, which span a large range of spectral resonances and spatial distributions, thus increasing the probability to match randomly distributed emitters. Conversely, the main disadvantage is the lack of deterministic engineering of one or more of the many random photonic modes achieved. This issue is solved by demonstrating the capability to electrically and mechanically control the random modes at telecom wavelengths in a 2D double membrane system. Very large and reversible mode tuning (up to 50 nm), both toward shorter or longer wavelength, is obtained for random modes with modal volumes of the order of few tens of (λ/n)3 ."

In this study, we have applied CRISPR Cas9 nickase (D10A) to knockout (KO) the Fam83h gene in NMRI outbred mice. We generated homozygous Fam83h KO mice ( Fam83h Ko/Ko ) through a premature termination codon, which was validated by Sanger sequencing in F0 generation. Next, we also bred the FAM83H KO for two generations. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis approved the Fam83h KO mice. The Fam83h KO mice had evidence of normal morphology at the cervical loops, secretory and maturation stages, and mandibular molars. In comparison with the normal wild-type mice ( Fam83h W/W ), the F2 homozygous KO ( Fam83h Ko/Ko ) had sparse, scruffy coats with small body size and decreased general activity. Also, they had the natural reproductive ability and natural lifespan. In addition, delay in opening the eyes and dry eyes among infant mice were seen. The F1 heterozygous mice looked comparable to the normal wild-type mice ( Fam83h W/W ), which showed autosomal recessive inheritance of these phenotypes. The KO of FAM83H had controversial effects on the development of teeth and the formation of enamel. The phenotype defect in dental development and the enamel formation were seen in three mice among four generations. It can be concluded that null FAM83H in outbred mice not only showed the reported phenotypes in null inbred mouse but also showed normal lifespan and reproductive ability; dental deficiency in three homozygous mice; and the symptoms that were similar to the symptoms of dry eye syndrome and curly coat dog syndrome in all four evaluated KO generations.",Highly Efficient Blue Fluorescent OLEDs Based on Upper Level Triplet-Singlet Intersystem Crossing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714207,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 03 19,"Purely organic electroluminescent materials, such as thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) materials, basically harness triplet excitons from the lowest triplet excited state (T1 ) to realize high efficiency. Here, a fluorescent material that can convert triplet excitons into singlet excitons from the high-lying excited state (T2 ), referred to here as a ""hot exciton"" path, is reported. The energy levels of this compound are determined from the sensitization and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy measurements, i.e., small splitting energy between S1 and T2 and rather large T2 -T1 energy gap, which are expected to impede the internal conversion (IC) from T2 to T1 and facilitate the reverse intersystem crossing from the high-lying triplet state (hRISC). Through sensitizing the T2 state with ketones, the existence of the hRISC process with an ns-scale delayed lifetime is confirmed. Benefiting from this fast triplet-singlet conversion, the nondoped device based on this ""hot exciton"" material reaches a maximum external quantum efficiency exceeding 10%, with a small efficiency roll-off and CIE coordinates of (0.15, 0.13). These results reveal that the ""hot exciton"" path is a promising way to exploit high efficient, stable fluorescent emitters, especially for the pure-blue and deep-blue fluorescent organic light-emitting devices.",Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 is associated with tumor invasion and migration in endometrial carcinomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714206,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 02 04,"Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1), a member of the STEAP family, is a general tumor antigen. However, no information has been available to date regarding the function of STEAP1 in the progression of endometrial carcinoma. In this study, we used in vitro and in vivo strategies to prove that STEAP1 plays an important role in the progression of endometrial carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of STEAP1 in normal endometrial cells and endometrial cancer cell lines. The progression of the cell cycle, plate clone formation assay, and transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to examine the effects of STEAP1 on cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and their invasive capacity. In addition, we confirmed that STEAP1 was tightly correlated with the development of tumor in vivo. The relationship between epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and STEAP1 expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) zymography assay was used to detect the activities of MMP2 and MMP9. STEAP1 was restrictively expressed in endometrial carcinoma and downregulation of the STEAP1 gene increased proliferation and clonogenicity, as well as promoted cell migration, invasion, and the progress of EMT. STEAP1 is downregulated in endometrial carcinoma and can restrict migration and invasion of endometrial carcinoma cells. Overall, STEAP1 may be an ideal target for tumor therapy and diagnosis in the future.",Complications of nonionizing radiofrequency on divided attention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714205,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"Exposure to electromagnetic fields is considered as a potential hazard for biological systems. The objective of our investigation is the study of probable consequences of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from Wi-Fi router devices on the short-term memory, and attention's levels. A population consisting of 312 female college students (14 to 17 years old) was elected by cluster random sampling. Teenagers were divided into two groups of control group (Wi-Fi nonusers; n = 138), and experiment group (Wi-Fi users; n = 174). Both groups have been examined using short-term memory tests; selective attention, and also divided attention tests. According to the results, there was no significant difference between using Wi-Fi router devices on levels of selective attentions and short-term memory of the sample students with the control group. However, analyses revealed that there is a significant correlation between the use of Wi-Fi routers and declining levels of divided attentions. Our investigation has demonstrated the adverse consequences of 2.4-2.48 GHz radiofrequency electromagnetic fields of Wi-Fi router devices on divided attention levels of female university students that should be mentioned as a technological risk factor and taken into account by healthcare organizations.",Inhibition of apoptosis via CHIP-mediated proteasomal degradation of TAp73α.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714204,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 02 04,"TAp73, a homologous of tumor suppressor p53, regulates apoptosis in a p53-independent manner and its suppressive as well as stimulatory role in promoting angiogenesis has been reported. It exists in multiple isoforms which varies structurally in their N-terminus and C-terminus region and crucial interplay among them guides the decision of cell survival and death. As molecular chaperones control both stability and degradation of TAp73, selective regulation of p73 isoforms has implication upon developing new therapeutic for hypoxic tumor. We have discovered that under DNA damage carboxy terminus Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP's) antiapoptotic function is displayed via its E3 ligase activity that inhibits exclusively TAp73α-mediated apoptosis in cancer cell. The decrease in TAp73α level by CHIP as it is supported by increased ubiquitination pattern is reverted back by sh-CHIP. Further, the transactivation of p53-downstream apoptotic genes BAX, PUMA and PIG3 by TAp73α is also shown to be subsequently inhibited by CHIP. The tetratricopeptide TPR-domain of CHIP in its amino-terminus interacts with the carboxy-terminus of TAp73α and ΔNp73α and as a result, U-BOX domain of CHIP in the carboxy-terminus is able to ubiquitinate TAp73α for proteasomal degradation. Due to lack of C-terminus in TAp73β, CHIP fails to interact with and degrade it. In conclusion, we have thus uncovered for the first time a novel mechanism of chaperone-assisted regulation of p73 stability as well as its apoptotic functions by CHIP that might be utilized to develop new anticancer strategies.",Hastening death and respect for dignity: Kantianism at the end of life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714203,Bioethics,2019 05 28,"Suppose that a young athlete has just become quadriplegic. He expects to live several more decades, but out of self-interest he autonomously chooses to engage in physician-assisted suicide (PAS) or voluntary active euthanasia (VAE). Some of us are unsure whether he or his physician would be acting rightly in ending his life. One basis for such doubt is the notion that persons have dignity in a Kantian sense. This paper probes responses that David Velleman and Frances Kamm have suggested to the question of whether participating in PAS or VAE to benefit oneself, as the young man might, respects the dignity of persons, specified in an orthodox Kantian way. Velleman claims that it does not, while Kamm insists that, in certain circumstances, it does. I argue against Kamm's position. I go on to contend that while orthodox Kantianism might provide a basis for moral concern regarding the case of the young quadriplegic, it suffers from two serious shortcomings. First, it implies that terminally ill patients are wrong to request VAE or engage in PAS to avoid intense suffering, at least when this suffering has not yet overwhelmed their reason. Second, orthodox Kantianism implies that it is wrong for physicians to withdraw such patients from life-sustaining treatments, even if they request it. To remedy these shortcomings, I sketch an unorthodox Kantian account of respect for the dignity of persons. This account promises to capture the idea that it would be morally problematic for doctors to help the young quadriplegic to die, but to avoid the shortcomings of an orthodox Kantian account.",Cognitive behavioral therapy improves diverse profiles of depressive symptoms in Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714202,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2019 04 11,"Depression is among the most common and debilitating nonmotor complaints in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet there is a paucity of controlled research to guide treatment.

Because it is well established that lead induces oxidative stress, it is assumed that exposure to antioxidants may reduce the toxic impact of lead. In this study, we evaluated the impact of coadministration of the methanolic root extract of a plant Abutilon indicum (50, 100, 200 mg kg -1 b.wt.) in mitigating the toxic impact of lead on the reproductive system of rats. In brief, Wistar rats were exposed to lead acetate in drinking water with or without coadministration of plant root extract and compared with that of control animals. After 45 days of exposure as outlined above, the animals were killed and the reproductive toxicity was assessed by sperm parameters, hormone and antioxidant enzyme assays, and testis histopathology. Significant reduction in testis weight, sperm count, testosterone levels, and antioxidant enzymes levels such as Superoxide Dismutase, Catalase, and Glutathione peroxidase was seen in lead-treated animals, confirming the toxic impact. The coadministration of A. Indicum (100 and 200 mg kg -1 b.wt.) was found to bring the studied parameters close to the levels seen in untreated (control) animals. Our findings are indicative of the protective nature of A. Indicum against lead-induced reproductive toxicity in a dose-dependent manner.

We have shown that G6pc-deficient (G6pc-/-) mice treated with recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors expressing either wild-type (WT) (rAAV-hG6PC-WT) or codon-optimized (co) (rAAV-co-hG6PC) human (h) G6Pase-α maintain glucose homeostasis if they restore ≥3% of normal hepatic G6Pase-α activity. The co vector, which has a higher potency, is currently being used in a phase I/II clinical trial for human GSD-Ia (NCT03517085). While routinely used in clinical therapies, co vectors may not always be optimal. Codon-optimization can impact RNA secondary structure, change RNA/DNA protein-binding sites, affect protein conformation and function, and alter posttranscriptional modifications that may reduce potency or efficacy. We therefore sought to develop alternative approaches to increase the potency of the G6PC gene transfer vectors. Using an evolutionary sequence analysis, we identified a Ser-298 to Cys-298 substitution naturally found in canine, mouse, rat, and several primate G6Pase-α isozymes, that when incorporated into the WT hG6Pase-α sequence, markedly enhanced enzymatic activity. Using G6pc-/- mice, we show that the efficacy of the rAAV-hG6PC-S298C vector was 3-fold higher than that of the rAAV-hG6PC-WT vector. The rAAV-hG6PC-S298C vector with increased efficacy, that minimizes the potential problems associated with codon-optimization, offers a valuable vector for clinical translation in human GSD-Ia.",A case of simvastatin-induced myopathy with SLCO1B1 genetic predisposition and co-ingestion of linagliptin and Stevia rebaudiana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714173,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,2019 04 23,SLCO1B1 T521>C variant carriers are susceptible to simvastatin-induced myopathy.

The spf ash mouse model carries a variant (c.386G>A, p.Arg129His) that is also found in patients. Male spf ash mice have a mild biochemical phenotype with low OTC activity (5%-10% of wild-type), resulting in elevated urinary orotic acid but no hyperammonemia. We recently established a dried blood spot method for in vivo quantification of ureagenesis by Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using stable isotopes. Here, we applied this assay to wild-type and spf ash mice to assess ureagenesis at different ages. Unexpectedly, we found an age-dependency with a higher capacity for ammonia detoxification in young mice after weaning. A parallel pattern was observed for carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1 and OTC enzyme expression and activities, which may act as pacemaker of this ammonia detoxification pathway. Moreover, high ureagenesis in younger mice was accompanied by elevated periportal expression of hepatic glutamine synthetase, another main enzyme required for ammonia detoxification. These observations led us to perform a more extensive analysis of the spf ash mouse in comparison to the wild-type, including characterization of the corresponding metabolites, enzyme activities in the liver and plasma and the gut microbiota. In conclusion, the comprehensive enzymatic and metabolic analysis of ureagenesis performed in the presented depth was only possible in animals. Our findings suggest such analyses being essential when using the mouse as a model and revealed age-dependent activity of ammonia detoxification."

Here, we report that ZmCPK11, one of maize CDPKs, participates in salt stress response and tolerance. Salt stress induced expression and upregulated the activity of ZmCPK11 in maize roots and leaves. Activation of ZmCPK11 upon salt stress was also observed in roots and leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing ZmCPK11. The transgenic plants showed a long-root phenotype under control conditions and a short-root phenotype under NaCl, abscisic acid (ABA) or jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. Analysis of ABA and JA content in roots indicated that ZmCPK11 can mediate root growth by regulating the levels of these phytohormones. Moreover, 4-week-old transgenic plants were more tolerant to salinity than the wild-type plants. Their leaves were less chlorotic and showed weaker symptoms of senescence accompanied by higher chlorophyll content and higher quantum efficiency of photosystem II. The expression of Na+ /K+ transporters (HKT1, SOS1 and NHX1) and transcription factors (CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, ZAT6 and ZAT10) with known links to salinity tolerance was upregulated in roots of the transgenic plants upon salt stress. Furthermore, the transgenic plants accumulated less Na+ in roots and leaves under salinity, and showed a higher K+ /Na+ ratio in leaves. These results show that the improved salt tolerance in ZmCPK11-transgenic plants could be due to an upregulation of genes involved in the maintenance of intracellular Na+ and K+ homeostasis and a protection of photosystem II against damage.",Technical Note: Deriving ventilation imaging from 4DCT by deep convolutional neural network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714159,Medical physics,2019 05 10,"Ventilation images can be derived from four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) by analyzing the change in HU values and deformable vector fields between different respiration phases of computed tomography (CT). As deformable image registration (DIR) is involved, accuracy of 4DCT-derived ventilation image is sensitive to the choice of DIR algorithms. To overcome the uncertainty associated with DIR, we develop a method based on deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to derive ventilation images directly from the 4DCT without explicit image registration.",Interchangeability of radiomic features between [18F]-FDG PET/CT and [18F]-FDG PET/MR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714158,Medical physics,2019 04 08,"Radiomics is a promising tool for identification of new prognostic biomarkers. However, image reconstruction settings and test-retest variability may influence the absolute values of radiomic features. Unstable radiomic features cannot be used as reliable biomarkers. PET/MR is becoming increasingly available and often replaces PET/CT for different indications. The aim of this study was to quantify to what extend [18F]-FDG PET/CT radiomics models can be transferred to [18F]-FDG PET/MR and thereby to investigate the feasibility of combined PET/CT-PET/MR models. For this purpose, we compared PET radiomic features calculated on PET/MR and PET/CT and on a 4D-gated PET/MR dataset to select radiomic features that are robust to attenuation correction differences and test-retest variability, respectively.",Raman scattering for dosimetry using GAFCHROMIC EBT3 radiochromic dosimetry film.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714157,Medical physics,2019 04 08,"Raman scattering spectra can be thought of as the ""fingerprints"" of the investigated material.

However, the full mechanistic and molecular details underlying this phenomenon are incompletely understood. CaV 1.2 channel clusters decorate T-tubule sarcolemmas of ventricular myocytes. Within clusters, nanometer proximity between channels permits Ca2+ -dependent co-operative gating behaviour mediated by physical interactions between adjacent channel C-terminal tails. We report that stimulation of cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol, evokes dynamic, protein kinase A-dependent augmentation of CaV 1.2 channel abundance along cardiomyocyte T-tubules, resulting in the appearance of channel 'super-clusters', and enhanced channel co-operativity that amplifies Ca2+ influx. On the basis of these data, we suggest a new model in which a sub-sarcolemmal pool of pre-synthesized CaV 1.2 channels resides in cardiomyocytes and can be mobilized to the membrane in times of high haemodynamic or metabolic demand, to tune excitation-contraction coupling.",Functional characterization of various channel-expressing central airway epithelial cells from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714154,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 04,"Functional central airway epithelial cells (CAECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are an attractive potential cell source for central airway regeneration. The central airway epithelium, such as the tracheal epithelium, is composed of ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells and has physiologically important functions such as the regulation of water volume on the airway surface by Cl- and water channels and the elimination of particles inhaled from the external environment by ciliary movement. Previous work from our group and from other research groups has reported the generation of airway epithelial cells from iPSCs. However, it remains unclear whether iPSC-derived CAECs express the various channels that are required for the regulation of water volume on the airway surface and whether these channels function properly. In this study, we generated CAECs from iPSCs supplemented with activin and bFGF using air-liquid interface culture. We then evaluated the physiological functioning of the iPSC-derived CAECs by examining the gene expression and transport functions of Cl - channels using a halide ion-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein and ciliary movement. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry indicated that various channel markers such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and aquaporin (AQP) were present in iPSC-derived CAECs. Furthermore, the transport functions of Cl - channels and CFTR were successfully confirmed. Finally, ciliary movement was measured, and a ciliary beating frequency (CBF) of approximately 10 Hz was observed. These results demonstrate that CAECs generated by our method have physiological functions similar to those of native CAECs.",Sonic hedgehog pathway activation regulates cervical cancer stem cell characteristics during epithelial to mesenchymal transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714153,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 04,"Resistance to therapy and metastasis remains one of the leading causes of mortality due to cervical cancer despite advances in detection and treatment. The mechanism of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) provides conceptual explanation to the invasiveness and metastatic spread of cancer but it has not been fully understood in cervical cancer. This study aims to investigate the mechanism by which silencing of E-cadherin gene regulates EMT leading to proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance of cervical cancer cells through the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. We developed an in vitro EMT model by the knockdown of E-cadherin expression in cervical cancer cell lines. To understand the role of developmental pathway like Hh in the progression of cervical cancer, we investigated the expression of Hh pathway mediators by array in E-cadherin low cervical cancer cells and observed upregulation of Hh pathway. This was further validated on low passage patient-derived cell lines and cervical carcinoma tissue sections from cervical cancer patients. Further, we evaluated the role of two inhibitors (cyclopamine and GANT58) of the Hh pathway on invasiveness and apoptosis in E-cadherin low cervical cancer cells. In conclusion, we observed that inhibition of Hh pathway with GANT58 along with current therapeutic procedures could be more effective in targeting drug-resistant EMT cells and bulk tumor cells in cervical cancer.",Enhancement of tenogenic differentiation of rat tendon-derived stem cells by biglycan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714152,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 04,"Biglycan (BGN) has been identified as one of the critical components of the tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) niche and may be related to tendon formation. However, so far, no study has demonstrated whether the soluble BGN could induce the tenogenic differentiation of TDSCs in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of BGN on the tenogenic differentiation of TDSCs. The proliferation and tenogenic differentiation of TDSCs exposed to different concentrations of BGN (0, 50, 100, and 500 ng/ml) were determined by the live/dead cell staining assay, CCK-8 assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blot analysis. The BGN signaling pathway of TDSCs (with and without 50 ng/ml of BGN) was determined by western blot analysis and qRT-PCR analysis. At a concentration of 50 ng/ml, BGN increased the expression of the tenogenic markers THBS-4 and TNMD at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Meanwhile, 50 ng/ml of BGN inhibited the expression of the chondrogenic and osteogenic markers SOX9, ACN, and RUNX2 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, BGN (50 ng/ml) affected the expression of the components of the extracellular matrix of TDSCs. Additionally, BGN activated the Smad1/5/8 pathway as indicated by an increase in phosphorylation and demonstrated by inhibition experiments. Upregulation in the gene expression of BMP-associated receptors (BMPRII, ActR-IIa, and BMPR-Ib) and Smad pathway components (Smad4 and 8) was observed. Taken together, BGN regulates tenogenic differentiation of TDSCs via BMP7/Smad1/5/8 pathway and this regulation may provide a basic insight into treating tendon injury.",LncRNA TUSC7 suppresses pancreatic carcinoma progression by modulating miR-371a-5p expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714151,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 04,"Pancreatic carcinoma is one of the most common and lethal human malignancies worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a well-known type of nonprotein-coding transcripts implicated in cancer development and progression. Increasing evidence has indicated that lncRNA tumor suppressor candidate 7 (TUSC7) is a novel cancer suppressor gene in various cancers. Nevertheless, the function of TUSC7 in pancreatic carcinoma is urgent to be clarified. We found that TUSC7 was notably decreased in tissues and cell lines of pancreatic carcinoma. Moreover, the low expression of TUSC7 was correlated with advanced clinical grades and poorer overall survival. Our findings revealed that TUSC7 repressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and stemness whereas facilitated cell apoptosis of pancreatic carcinoma cells. Further investigations demonstrated that miR-371a-5p directly bound with TUSC7 and negatively regulated by TUSC7. MiR-371a-5p rescued the inhibitory effects of TUSC7 on the development of pancreatic carcinoma. We conclude that lncRNA TUSC7 suppresses pancreatic carcinoma progression by modulating miR-371a-5p expression, indicating an innovative therapeutic strategy for pancreatic carcinoma.",RN181 is a tumour suppressor in gastric cancer by regulation of the ERK/MAPK-cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714150,The Journal of pathology,2019 05 15,"RN181, a RING finger domain-containing protein, is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, its biological function and clinical significance in cancer biology are obscure. Here, we report that RN181 expression is significantly down-regulated in 165 tumour tissues of gastric carcinoma (GC) versus adjacent non-tumour tissues, and inversely associated with tumour differentiation, tumour size, clinical stage, and patient's overall survival. Alterations of RN181 expression in GC cells by retrovirus-transduced up-regulation and down-regulation demonstrated that RN181 functions as a tumour suppressor to inhibit growth of GC in both in vitro culture and in vivo animal models by decreasing tumour cell proliferation and increasing tumour cell apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that RN181 controls the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that RN181 inhibits ERK/MAPK signalling, thereby regulating the activity of cyclin D1-CDK4, and consequently controlling progression in the cell cycle from G1 to S phase. Restoring CDK4 in GC cells rescued the inhibitory phenotype produced by RN181 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a dominant role of CDK4 in control of the tumour growth by RN181. Importantly, RN181 expression is inversely correlated with the expression of cyclin D1 and CDK4 in GC clinical samples, substantiating the role of the RN181-cyclin D1/CDK4 pathway in control of the tumour growth of GC. Our results provide new insights into the pathogenesis and development of GC and rationale for developing novel intervention strategies against GC by disruption of ERK/MAPK-cyclin D1/CDK4 signalling. In addition, RN181 may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting clinical outcome of GC. © 2019 The Authors.

Recently, the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to be involved in the development of various renal diseases. Here, we aim to determine whether paeonol (PAE) affects RIF with involvement of the lncRNA HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR)/microRNA-124 (miR-124)/Notch1 axis. RIF rat models were established by performing unilateral ureteral occlusion (UUO), in which interactions between HOTAIR, Notch1, and miR-124 were determined. To identify the roles of PAE and HOTAIR in RIF, rats were injected with HOTAIR or PAE. Subsequently, to further investigate the underlying mechanism of PAE in RIF, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)- and migration-related genes in NRK-49F cells were measured. Next, rats were further treated with IMR-1 (inhibitor of the Notch1/Jagged1 signaling pathway) to determine how PAE influences the Notch1/Jagged1 signaling pathway. HOTAIR interacted with miR-124, and miR-124 directly targeted Notch1, and HOTAIR was observed to be upregulated in RIF rats. PAE was found to decrease HOTAIR and Notch1 expression but to increase the miR-124 expression in RIF rats. PAE inhibited EMT and migration of NRK-49F cells facilitated by HOTAIR. HOTAIR activated the Notch1/Jagged1 signaling pathway by downregulating miR-124, while PAE reversed these effects of HOTAIR on the Notch1/Jagged1 signaling pathway. Overall, our study demonstrates the contributory effect of lncRNA HOTAIR on RIF by activating the Notch1/Jagged1 signaling pathway via inhibition of miR-124, whereas administration of PAE can alleviate the effects of HOTAIR on RIF.",Tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714137,Journal of neurochemistry,2019 03 21,"Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the catecholamines dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. One of the major mechanisms for controlling the activity of TH is protein phosphorylation. TH is phosphorylated at serine residues 8, 19, 31 and 40. There have been a number of previous reviews focused on TH phosphorylation in vitro and in situ. This review on TH phosphorylation in vivo has three main sections focusing on: (1) the methods used to investigate TH phosphorylation in vivo, including the animals used, the sacrifice procedures, the tissue preparation, the measurement of TH protein levels and TH phosphorylation and the measurement of TH activation. (2) The regulation of TH phosphorylation and its consequences in vivo, including the kinases and phosphatases acting on TH, the stoichiometry of TH phosphorylation, the proteins that bind TH and TH subcellular location.

For the most part these proteins have been studied separate from each other. Here, I argue that the OMA1 mechanism of action represents the missing link between p53 and cytochrome c release. The mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 is cleaved by OMA1 in a stress-dependent manner generating S-OPA1. Excessive S-OPA1 can facilitate outer membrane permeabilization upon BAX/BAK1 activation through its membrane shaping properties. p53 helps outer membrane permeabilization in a 2-step process. First, cytosolic p53 activates BAX/BAK1 at the mitochondrial surface. Then, in a second step, p53 binds to prohibitin thereby releasing the restraint on OMA1. This activates OMA1, which cleaves OPA1 and promotes cytochrome c release. Clearly, OMA1 and OPA1 are not root causes for cancer. Yet many cancer cells rely on this pathway for survival, which can explain why loss of p53 function promotes tumor growth and confers resistance to chemotherapies.",Long noncoding RNA LINC00483/microRNA-144 regulates radiosensitivity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung adenocarcinoma by interacting with HOXA10.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714135,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important regulatory role in cancer biology, including that of LAD. The aim of this experiment was to explore the interaction of LINC00483, microRNA-144 (miR-144), and homeobox A10 (HOXA10), and their effects on radio sensitivity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of LAD. Initially, microarray analysis was used to screen out miRNAs and lncRNAs, as well as the differentially expressed genes related to LAD. Following the screening process, the targeting relationship of LINC00483, miR-144, and that of miR-144 and HOXA10 was determined. Following that, the expression of LINC00483, miR-144, messenger RNA (mRNA), as well as protein expression of HOXA10, MMP-2, MMP-9, E-cadherin, vimentin, and N-cadherin that followed in cells was determined. Also, the effect of LINC00483 on cell migration and invasion ability, and cell tumorigenic ability was detected. LINC00483 and HOXA10 were found to be upregulated whereas miR-144 was downregulated in LAD. Silencing of LINC00483 could competitively bind to miR-144, thereby upregulating HOXA10. LINC00483 or HOXA10 silencing led to decreased HOXA10, MMP-2, MMP-9, vimentin, and N-cadherin but elevated miR-144 and E-cadherin. Moreover, after being transfected with silenced LINC00483, the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were inhibited with enhanced radiosensitivity. Consequently, the data of the study indicates that interference of LINC00483 weakens its competitive binding ability to miR-144, thus reducing HOXA10 expression, and enhancing radiosensitivity in LAD.",MMP2/3 promote the growth and migration of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma via PI3K/Akt-NF-κB-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714134,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 04,"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is an aggressive malignancy with metastatic potential and high mortality worldwide. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of extracellular proteolytic enzymes. Although MMPs have been proved to be essential in the process of tumor migration and metastasis in most types of carcinomas, the expression and function of MMP2/3 in LSCC remain unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of MMP2/3 in LSCC and elucidated the underlying mechanism. We found that levels of MMP2/3 were significantly higher in clinical LSCC samples than in paired normal sample examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. Moreover, overexpression of MMP2/3 promoted the proliferation and migration of LSCC cells by Cell Counting Kit-8, transwell, and scratch wound-healing assays in vitro. Furthermore, levels of epithelial cell markers (E-cadherin and occludin) were decreased following MMP2/3 overexpression, with increased levels of mesenchymal cell markers (N-cadherin and vimentin), suggesting the involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) process in MMP2/3-mediated LSCC cell migration. By using short hairpin RNA, knockdown of MMP2/3 expression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and EMT process in LSCC cells in vitro. More importantly, we confirmed that MMP2/3 promoted LSCC in the PI3K/Akt-NF-κB-dependent manner. This study provides insight into MMP2/3-mediated LSCC development and lays a foundation for potential pharmacological targets to LSCC.",Involvement of the synapse-specific zinc transporter ZnT3 in cadmium-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714133,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 04,"The present study examined the involvement of zinc (Zn)-transporters (ZnT3) in cadmium (Cd)-induced alterations of Zn homeostasis in rat hippocampal neurons. We treated primary rat hippocampal neurons for 24 or 48 hr with various concentrations of CdCl2 (0, 0.5, 5, 10, 25, or 50 μM) and/or ZnCl 2 (0, 10, 30, 50, 70, or 90 μM), using normal neuronal medium as control. By The CellTiter 96 ® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS; Promega, Madison, WI) assay and immunohistochemistry for cell death markers, 10 and 25 μM of Cd were found to be noncytotoxic doses, and both 30 and 90 μM of Zn as the best concentrations for cell proliferation. We tested these selected doses. Cd, at concentrations of 10 or 25 μM (and depending on the absence or presence of Zn), decreased the percentage of surviving cells. Cd-induced neuronal death was either apoptotic or necrotic depending on dose, as indicated by 7-AAD and/or annexin V labeling. At the molecular level, Cd exposure induced a decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tropomyosin receptor kinase B (BDNF-TrkB) and Erk1/2 signaling, a significant downregulation of the expression of learning- and memory-related receptors and synaptic proteins such as the NMDAR NR2A subunit and PSD-95, as well as the expression of the synapse-specific vesicular Zn transporter ZnT3 in cultured hippocampal neurons. Zn supplementation, especially at the 30 μM concentration, led to partial or total protection against Cd neurotoxicity both with respect to the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of several genes. Interestingly, after knockdown of ZnT3 by small interfering RNA transfection, we did not find the restoration of the expression of this gene following Zn supplementation at 30 μM concentration. These data indicate the involvement of ZnT3 in the mechanism of Cd-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity.",Autophagic regulation of platelet biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714132,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 04,"Platelets, developed from megakaryocytes, are characterized by anucleate and short-life span hemocyte in mammal vessel. Platelets are very important in the cardiovascular system. Studies indicate the occurrence of autophagy platelets and megakaryocytes. Moreover, abnormal autophagy decreases the number of platelets and suppresses platelet aggregation. In addition, mitophagy, as a kind of selective autophagy, could inhibit platelet aggregation under oxidative stress or hypoxic, whereas promote platelet aggregation after reperfusion. Finally, autophagy regulates hemorrhagic and thrombosis diseases by influencing the number and function of platelets. In this paper, the role of autophagy in platelets and megakaryocytes, as well as coupled with the promotive or inhibitory role of hemorrhagic and thrombosis diseases are elucidated. Therefore, autophagy may be a potentially therapeutic target in modulating the platelet-related diseases.",Will like replace like? Linking thermal performance to ecological function across predator and herbivore populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714131,Ecology,2019 04 01,"The inability of species to adapt to changing climate may cause ecological communities to disassemble and lose ecological functioning. However, theory suggests that communities may be resilient whenever populations within species exhibit variation in thermal plasticity or adaptation whereby thermally tolerant populations replace thermally sensitive ones. But will they maintain the functional roles of the populations being replaced? This study evaluated whether ""like replaces like"" functionally by measuring how four populations of a grasshopper herbivore and its co-occurring spider predator cope with environmental warming. The study occurred across a latitudinal gradient bounded by southerly, warmer Connecticut and northerly, cooler New Hampshire, USA. The study compared the survival rates, thermal performance, habitat usage, and food chain interactions of each grasshopper and spider population between its home field site (field of origin) and a Connecticut transplant site, and the native Connecticut population. Three grasshopper populations exhibited physiological plasticity by adjusting metabolic rates. The fourth population selected cooler habitat locations. Spider populations did not alter their metabolism and instead selected cooler habitat locations, thereby altering spatial overlap with their prey and food chain interactions. Grasshopper populations that coped physiologically consumed plants in different ratios than the fourth population and the Connecticut population. Hence, ""like may not replace like"" whenever populations adapt physiologically to warming.",Independent role of neonatal seizures in subsequent neurological outcomes: a population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714130,Developmental medicine and child neurology,2019 05 03,"This population-based study aimed to estimate the impact of neonatal seizures on subsequent neurological outcomes, regardless of underlying etiology."

A major concern over the use of response-adaptive designs in practice, particularly from a regulatory viewpoint, is controlling the type I error rate. In particular, we show that the naïve z-test can have an inflated type I error rate even after applying a Bonferroni correction. Simulation studies have often been used to demonstrate error control but do not provide a guarantee. In this article, we present adaptive testing procedures for normally distributed outcomes that ensure strong familywise error control by iteratively applying the conditional invariance principle. Our approach can be used for fully sequential and block randomized trials and for a large class of adaptive randomization rules found in the literature. We show there is a high price to pay in terms of power to guarantee familywise error control for randomization schemes with extreme allocation probabilities. However, for proposed Bayesian adaptive randomization schemes in the literature, our adaptive tests maintain or increase the power of the trial compared to the z-test.

Therefore, examining the link between autoimmunity and hypertension can be informative for understanding primary hypertension.

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a classical tool that explores the dependency of two multivariate random variables and extracts canonical pairs of highly correlated linear combinations. Driven by applications in genomics, text mining, and imaging research, among others, many recent studies generalize CCA to high-dimensional settings. However, most of them either rely on strong assumptions on covariance matrices, or do not produce nested solutions. We propose a new sparse CCA (SCCA) method that recasts high-dimensional CCA as an iterative penalized least squares problem. Thanks to the new iterative penalized least squares formulation, our method directly estimates the sparse CCA directions with efficient algorithms. Therefore, in contrast to some existing methods, the new SCCA does not impose any sparsity assumptions on the covariance matrices. The proposed SCCA is also very flexible in the sense that it can be easily combined with properly chosen penalty functions to perform structured variable selection and incorporate prior information. Moreover, our proposal of SCCA produces nested solutions and thus provides great convenient in practice. Theoretical results show that SCCA can consistently estimate the true canonical pairs with an overwhelming probability in ultra-high dimensions. Numerical results also demonstrate the competitive performance of SCCA.",Aneuploidy in children with relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: clinical importance of detecting a hypodiploid origin of relapse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714092,British journal of haematology,2019 04 05,"Aneuploidy is common in paediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Specific subgroups, such as high hyperdiploidy (>50 chromosomes or DNA Index ≥1·16) and hypodiploidy (<45 chromosomes), predict outcome of patients after primary treatment. Whether aneuploidy has a prognostic value for relapsed disease is yet to be determined. Using DNA index and centromere screening by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, we investigated aneuploidy in 413 children treated for first relapse of B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol. Ten-year event-free survival of patients with high hyperdiploid relapses approached 70%, whereas it was only 40% in low hyperdiploid relapses. Three patients with apparent hyperdiploid relapse had TP53 mutations. In these cases, array-based allelotyping revealed a hypodiploid origin with absence of the hypodiploid founder clone (masked hypodiploidy). Collectively, patients with evident or masked hypodiploid relapses showed an extremely low event-free survival rate of 9%. Importantly, the current relapse risk stratification did not identify cases with masked hypodiploidy as high-risk patients, due to their favourable clinical presentation. In multivariate analysis, hypodiploidy proved to be an independent prognostic factor. This finding supports stratification of relapses with hypodiploid origin into high-risk arms in future trials or allocation of patients to alternative treatment approaches.",Similar burden of type 2 diabetes among adult patients with sickle cell disease relative to African Americans in the U.S. population: a six-year population-based cohort analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714090,British journal of haematology,2019 06 10,"Conflicting evidence exists on the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study measured the prevalence, incidence and clinical outcomes associated with T2DM in a large US population of commercially-insured adults aged ≥20 years with SCD between 2009 and 2014. Among 7070 patients with SCD, the mean age (median) was 39 (37) years and 60·8% were female. The standardized prevalence of T2DM among patients with SCD showed a modest increase, from 15·7% to 16·5% (P trend = 0·026), and was comparable to African-American respondents to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (18·2%). Over 17 024 person-years, the crude incidence rate for T2DM was 25·4 per 1000 person-years. Incident T2DM was associated with comorbid hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] = 1·45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1·14-1·83), and dyslipidaemia (HR = 1·43, 95%CI 1·04-1·96). Compared to SCD patients without T2DM, more SCD patients with T2DM had diagnoses of nephropathy (28·0% vs. 9·5%; P < 0·001), neuropathy (17·7% vs. 5·2%; P < 0·001) and stroke (24·1% vs. 9·2%; P < 0·001). Prevalence of T2DM in SCD patients is similar to the general African American population with an increasing trend in recent years. These trends support routine screening for T2DM in aging patients with SCD, especially those with comorbid hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia.",Management of women with atypical polypoid adenomyoma of the uterus: A quantitative systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714089,Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,2019 02 25,"Atypical polypoid adenomyoma is an uncommon uterine lesion which can coexist with endometrial atypical hyperplasia and/or cancer. Atypical polypoid adenomyoma affects premenopausal women in most cases, but it shows high recurrence rate if conservatively treated. To date, the management of patients is based on low-quality evidence and is not standardized.

Many guidelines recommend LDL-C as a primary treatment target, and statins represent the cornerstone of treatment for lipid management. Recently revised guidelines recommend even more intense management of LDL-C, especially in patients at moderate and high risk. However, LDL-C levels in the Chinese population differ from those in Western populations, and the benefits and safety of the maximum allowable dose of statins have yet to be determined. Furthermore, in practice, many patients do not achieve the increasingly stringent LDL-C goals. Consequently, alternative approaches to lipid management are required. Combination therapy with ezetimibe and a statin, which have complementary mechanisms of action, is more effective than statin monotherapies, even at high doses. Several clinical studies have consistently shown that combination therapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin lowers LDL-C more potently than statin monotherapies. Moreover, the safety and tolerability profile of the combination therapy appears to be similar to that of low-dose statin monotherapies. This review discusses the role of simvastatin in combination with ezetimibe in controlling dyslipidemia in Chinese patients, particularly the efficacy and safety of combination therapy in light of recently published clinical data.",Potential Protective Role of Blood Pressure-Lowering Drugs on the Balance between Hemostasis and Fibrinolysis in Hypertensive Patients at Rest and During Exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714087,"American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",2019 03 07,"In patients with hypertension, the triad represented by endothelial dysfunction, platelet hyperactivity, and altered fibrinolytic function disturbs the equilibrium between hemostasis and fibrinolysis and translates into a hypercoagulable state, which underlies the risk of thrombotic complications.

LK11 and ameliorative effects on growth of Cucumis sativus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714085,Archives of microbiology,2019 02 04,"Plant endophytes play vital role in plant growth promotion as well as in abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. They also mediate biotransformation of complex organic materials to simpler and useful by-product. Therefore, the role of plant endophyte in plant growth promotion and stress tolerance has gained considerable attention in recent days. Sphingomonas sp. LK11 is an important plant endophyte that actively regulates plant growth. However, the biotransformation and stress tolerance potential of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 was yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we studied the biotransformation of benzoin by Sphingomonas sp. LK11. We found that, Sphingomonans sp. LK11 biotransformed benzoin to benzamide. Further application of benzamide to Cucumis sativus led to decrease in agronomic potential of C. sativus as benzamide acts as an abiotic stress agent. However, the application of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 inoculums with benzamide reverted back the agronomic trait of the plants, suggesting the role of Sphingomonas sp. LK11 in biotransformation and abiotic stress tolerance in plants."

We examined differences between nearest-in-age older siblings (age 5-15) of MCS children (likely mainly with mild to moderate ID) identified with ID (n = 257 siblings) or not (n = 7246 siblings). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) measured all children's adjustment. For SDQ total problems, 13.9% of siblings of children with ID and 8.9% of siblings of children without had elevated scores (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.04, 2.62; p = 0.031). Similar group differences were found for SDQ peer and conduct problems. In logistic regression models, variables consistently associated with older sibling adjustment were: adjustment of the MCS cohort child, older sibling being male, family socio-economic position, primary carer psychological distress, and being from a single parent household. The ID grouping variable was no longer associated with adjustment for all SDQ domains, except siblings of children with ID were less likely to be identified as hyperactive (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10, 0.87; p = 0.027). Some older siblings of children with ID may be at additional risk for behavioral and emotional problems. Group differences were related mainly to social and family contextual factors. Future longitudinal research should address developmental pathways by which children with ID may affect sibling adjustment.",The measurement of physical functioning among patients with Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT) using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714073,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2019 02 28,"Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT), a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm of the synovium of joints and tendon sheaths, is associated with joint destruction, pain and swelling.

However, decentralized planning, the absence of well defined decision rules, delayed decisions and lack of interactive tools typically lead towards low satisfaction level among all the stakeholders of the HHC system. In order to address these issues, we propose an integrated three phase decision support methodology for the HHC system. More specifically, the proposed methodology exploits the structure of the HHC problem and logistic regression based approaches to identify the decision rules for patient acceptance, staff hiring, and staff utilization. In the first phase, a mathematical model is constructed for the HHC scheduling and routing problem using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The mathematical model is solved with the MILP solver CPLEX and a Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) based method is used to find the heuristic solution for the HHC problem. The model considers the planning concerns related to compatibility, time restrictions, distance, and cost. In the second phase, Bender's method and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are implemented to identify the thresholds based on the CPLEX and VNS solution. While the third phase creates a fresh solution for the HHC problem with a new data set and validates the thresholds predicted in the second phase. The effectiveness of these thresholds is evaluated by utilizing performance measures of the widely-used confusion matrix. The evaluation of the thresholds shows that the ROC curves based thresholds of the first two parameters achieved 67% to 71% accuracy against the two considered solution methods. While the Bender's method based thresholds for the same parameters attained more than 70% accuracy in cases where probability value is small (p ≤ 0.5). The promising results indicate that the proposed methodology is applicable to define the decision rules for the HHC problem and beneficial to all the concerned stakeholders in making relevant decisions.",Structural and Biomechanical Adaptations of Right Ventricular Remodeling - in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - Reduces Left Ventricular Rotation During Contraction: A Computational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714069,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 06 12,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a degenerative disease characterized by progressively increased right ventricular (RV) afterload that leads to ultimate functional decline [1]. Recent observational studies have documented a decrease in left ventricular (LV) torsion during ejection, with preserved LV ejection fraction (EF) in pediatric and adult PH patients [2-4]. The objective of this study was to develop a computational model of the bi-ventricular heart and use it to evaluate changes in LV torsion mechanics in response to mechanical, structural, and hemodynamic changes in the RV free-wall. The heart model revealed that LV apex rotation and torsion were decreased when increasing RV mechanical rigidity and during re-orientation of RV myocardial fibers. Furthermore, structural changes to the RV appear to have a notable impact on RV EF, but little influence on LV EF. Finally, RV pressure overload exponentially increased LV myocardial stress. The computational results found in this study are consistent with clinical observations in adult and pediatric PH patients, which reveal a decrease in LV torsion with preserved LV EF [3, 4]. Furthermore, discovered causes of decreased LV torsion are consistent with RV structural adaptations seen in PH rodent studies [5], which might also explain suspected stress-induced changes in LV myocardial gene/protein expression.",Model-based analysis of the stiffness of the wrist joint in active and passive conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714068,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 02 04,"The control of joint stiffness is a fundamental mechanism used to control human movements. While many studies have observed how stiffness is modulated for tasks involving shoulder and elbow motion, a limited amount of knowledge is available for wrist movements, though the wrist plays a crucial role in manipulation. We have developed a computational framework based on a realistic musculoskeletal model, which al to calculate the passive and active components of the wrist joint stiffness. We first used the framework to validate the musculoskeletal model against experimental measurements of the wrist joint stiffness, and then to study the contribution of different muscle groups to the passive joint stiffness. We finally used the framework to study the effect of muscle co-contraction on the active joint stiffness. The results show that thumb and finger muscles play a crucial role in determining the passive wrist joint stiff- ness: in the neutral posture, the direction of maximum stiffness aligns with the experimental measurements, and the magnitude increases by 113% when they are included. Moreover, the analysis of the controllability of joint stiffness showed that muscle co-contraction positively correlates with the stiffness magnitude and negatively correlates with the variability of the stiffness orientation (p < 0.01 in both cases). Finally, an exhaustive search showed that with appropriate selection of a muscle activation strategy, the joint stiffness orientation can be arbitrarily modulated. This observation suggests the absence of biomechanical constraints on the controllability of the orientation of the wrist joint stiffness.",Erratum: The mechanical role of the radial fibers network within the annulus fibrosus of the lumbar intervertebral disc: a finite elements study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714067,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 02 04,"The annulus fibrosus (AF) of the intervertebral disc (IVD) consists of a set of concentric layers composed of a primary circumferential collagen fibers arranged in an alternating oblique orientation. Moreover, there exists an additional secondary set of radial translamellar collagen fibers which connects the concentric layers, creating an entangled fiber network. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanical role of the radial fiber network. Towards that goal, a three-dimensional finite-element model of the L3-L4 spinal segment was generated, and calibrated to axial compression and pure moment loading. The AF model explicitly recognizes the two heterogeneous networks of fibers. The presence of radial fibers demonstrated a pronounced effect on the local disc responses under lateral bending, flexion and extension modes. In these modes, the radial fibers, in the disc region with axial compression stress, were in a tensile state. In addition, the circumferential fibers, on the opposite side of the IVD, were also under tension. The local stress in the matrix was decreased in up to 9% in the radial fibers presence. This implies an active fiber network acting collectively to reduce the stresses and strains in the AF lamellae. Moreover, the radial fibers reduce the sideways expansion in the matrix in 26.6% near the neutral bending axis of the disc. The proposed biomechanical model provided a new insight into the mechanical role of the radial collagen fibers in the AF structure. This model can be used in the design of future IVD substitutes.",Balance-Keeping Control of a Human Being Upon a Sudden External Perturbation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714066,Journal of biomechanical engineering,2019 02 04,"This study aims to estimate the control law employed by the CNS (Central Nervous System) to keep a person in balance after a sudden disturbance. For this aim, several experiments were carried out, in which the subjects were perturbed sagittally by using a single-axis tilt-platform and their motions were recorded with appropriate sensors. The analysis of the experimental results leads to the conjecture that the CNS commands the muscular actuators of the human joints according to a PD control law but it updates the control gains and the set points continuously. This conjecture is accompanied with a major assumption that the CNS is able to acquire perfect and instantaneous position and velocity feedback by means of an appropriate fusion of the signals coming from the proprioceptive, somatosensory, vestibular, and visual sensory systems. In order to verify the conjectured control law, an approximate biomechanical model was developed and several simulations were carried out to imitate the experimentally observed motions. The time variations of the set points and the control gains were estimated out of the experimental data. The simulated motions were observed to be considerably close to the experimental motions. Thus, it is concluded that the CNS indeed uses an adaptive PD control law as conjectured here. However, the experiments also indicate that the mentioned adaptation scheme is quite variable even for the same subject tested repeatedly with the same perturbation. In other words, the decisions of the CNS on the variations of the control parameters are hardly predictable.",Novel Na2TiSiO5 anode material for lithium ion batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714065,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 02 15,"Na2TiSiO5 is investigated as a novel anode of the lithium ion battery for the first time.

The catalytic mechanisms of palladium acetate toward the conversion of HMF to furfuryl alcohol (FFA), 5-methylfurfural (5-MF) and 2,5-dihydroxymethyl furan (DHMF) have been theoretically investigated. The decarbonylation of HMF to FFA includes (i) migratory extrusion, (ii) metal-acetate-co-assisted deprotonation, (iii) decarbonylation, (iv) metal-assisted deprotonation, and (v) migratory extrusion and catalyst regeneration. Both hydrogenation and deoxidation of HMF with HCOOH as the H-source involve (i) migratory extrusion, (ii) oxidative addition, (iii) reductive elimination, (iv) metal-assisted deprotonation, and (v) migratory extrusion and catalyst regeneration. The C-H bond cleavage is the crucial reaction step, in which the metal-acetate-co-assisted deprotonation is kinetically more preferable than the oxidative addition. Both FFA and DHMF are kinetically superior to 5-MF. In terms of selectivity, increasing the temperature is beneficial to decarbonylation and decreasing the temperature is advantageous to hydrogenation. The present finding provides molecular-level insight into the functions of both the metal-center and coordinated-ligand in the Pd(OAc)2 catalyst, which may drive the novel design of catalytic systems toward both decarbonylation and hydrogenation reactions."

International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications. International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications,2019 02 07,"Document retrieval (DR) forms an important component in end-to-end question-answering (QA) systems where particular answers are sought for well-formed questions. DR in the QA scenario is also useful by itself even without a more involved natural language processing component to extract exact answers from the retrieved documents. This latter step may simply be done by humans like in traditional search engines granted the retrieved documents contain the answer. In this paper, we take advantage of datasets made available through the BioASQ end-to-end QA shared task series and build an effective biomedical DR system that relies on relevant answer snippets in the BioASQ training datasets. At the core of our approach is a question-answer sentence matching neural network that learns a measure of relevance of a sentence to an input question in the form of a matching score. In addition to this matching score feature, we also exploit two auxiliary features for scoring document relevance: the name of the journal in which a document is published and the presence/absence of semantic relations (subject-predicate-object triples) in a candidate answer sentence connecting entities mentioned in the question. We rerank our baseline sequential dependence model scores using these three additional features weighted via adaptive random research and other learning-to-rank methods.

International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention,2019 04 19,"Cross subject functional studies of cerebral cortex require cortical registration that aligns functional brain regions. While cortical folding patterns are approximate indicators of the underlying cytoarchitecture, coregistration based on these features alone does not accurately align functional regions in cerebral cortex. This paper presents a method for cortical surface registration (rfDemons) based on resting fMRI (rfMRI) data that uses curvature-based anatomical registration as an initialization. In contrast to existing techniques that use connectivity-based features derived from rfMRI, the proposed method uses 'synchronized' resting rfMRI time series directly. The synchronization of rfMRI data is performed using the BrainSync transform which applies an orthogonal transform to the rfMRI time series to temporally align them across subjects. The rfDemons method was applied to rfMRI from the Human Connectome Project and evaluated using task fMRI data to explore the impact of cortical registration performed using resting fMRI data on functional alignment of the cerebral cortex.",Correlation of Prostate Cancer CHD1 Status with Response to Androgen Deprivation Therapy: a Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714046,Journal of genitourinary disorders,2019 02 07,"CHD1 has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer.

Knowledge of PZC is important to predict the ionization of functional groups and their interaction with metal species in solution. This study utilized the Pb- and As-contaminated soils to determine the combined effect of pH with respect to PZC and different rates of P-application on pyromorphite formation, and Pb and arsenic (As) bioaccessibility as impacted by speciation changes. Solution chemistry analysis along with synchrotron-based Pb- and As-speciation, and bioaccessibility treatment effect ratios (TERs) were conducted. Results indicated no significant effect of PZC on pyromorphite formation in P-amended soils; however, the TERPb appeared significantly lower at pH>pHPZC and higher at pH<pHPZC (α = 0.05). In contrast, the TERAs was significantly higher at pH>pHPZC, compared to the other two treatments, for the tested soils. The lack of conversion of soil Pb to pyromorphite may be attributed to presence of stable minerals limiting soluble-Pb availability and high organic matter content of the tested soils.",Model framework for governance of genomic research and biobanking in Africa - a content description.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714023,AAS open research,2019 02 07,"Genomic research and biobanking are expanding globally, with a promise to fast-track the research needed to improve approaches to disease treatment and prevention through scientific collaborations such as the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. Integral to this type of research is the availability of samples and data for research. The need for broad access brings along a host of ethical concerns, including those related to privacy and confidentiality, as well as fairness and equity in access and capacity to utilise these samples between scientists from the high income and low income countries. Addressing these concerns while promoting genomic research, especially in Africa, requires the implementation of a sound governance framework. In this paper, we describe the contents of a Framework for Best Practice for Genomics Research and biobanking in Africa that was developed, under the auspices of the H3Africa initiative.

Here, we describe how the Collaborative African Genomics Network (CAfGEN) of the H3Africa consortium is using genomics to probe host genetic factors important to the progression of HIV and HIV-tuberculosis (TB) coinfection in sub-Saharan Africa.          Methods: CAfGEN is an H3Africa collaborative centre comprising expertise from the University of Botswana; Makerere University; Baylor College of Medicine Children's Clinical Centers of Excellence (COEs) in Botswana, Uganda, and Swaziland; as well as Baylor College of Medicine, Texas. The COEs provide clinical expertise for community engagement, participant recruitment and sample collection while the three University settings facilitate processing and management of genomic samples and provide infrastructure and training opportunities to sustain genomics research. Results: The project has focused on utilizing whole-exome sequencing to identify genetic variants contributing to extreme HIV disease progression phenotypes in children, as well as RNA sequencing and integrated genomics to identify host genetic factors associated with TB disease progression among HIV-positive children. These cohorts, developed using the COEs' electronic medical records, are exceptionally well-phenotyped and present an unprecedented opportunity to assess genetic factors in individuals whose HIV was acquired by a different route than their adult counterparts in the context of a unique clinical course and disease pathophysiology. Conclusions: Our approach offers the prospect of developing a critical mass of well-trained, highly-skilled, continent-based African genomic scientists. To ensure long term genomics research sustainability in Africa, CAfGEN contributes to a wide range of genomics capacity and infrastructure development on the continent, has laid a foundation for genomics graduate programs at its institutions, and continues to actively promote genomics research through innovative forms of community engagement brokered by partnerships with governments and academia to support genomics policy formulation.","Ethical and scientific considerations on the establishment of a controlled human infection model for schistosomiasis in Uganda: report of a stakeholders' meeting held in Entebbe, Uganda.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714021,AAS open research,2019 02 07,"Controlled human infection (CHI) models are gaining recognition as an approach to accelerating vaccine development, for use in both non-endemic and endemic populations: they can facilitate identification of the most promising candidate vaccines for further trials and advance understanding of protective immunity. Helminths present a continuing health burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccine development for these complex organisms is particularly challenging, partly because protective responses are akin to mechanisms of allergy. A CHI model for Schistosoma mansoni (CHI-S) has been developed at Leiden University Medical Centre, the Netherlands. However, responses to schistosome infections, and candidate vaccines, are likely to be different among people from endemic settings compared to schistosome-naïve Dutch volunteers. Furthermore, among volunteers from endemic regions who have acquired immune responses through prior exposure, schistosome challenge can be used to define responses associated with clinical protection, and thus to guide vaccine development.  To explore the possibility of establishing the CHI-S in Uganda, a Stakeholders' Meeting was held in Entebbe in 2017. Regulators, community members, researchers and policy-makers discussed implementation challenges and recommended preparatory steps: risk assessment; development of infrastructure and technical capacity to produce the infectious challenge material in Uganda; community engagement from Parliamentary to grass-roots level; pilot studies to establish approaches to assuring fully informed consent and true voluntariness, and strategies for selection of volunteers who can avoid natural infection during the 12-week CHI-S; the building of regulatory capacity; and the development of study protocols and a product dossier in close consultation with ethical and regulatory partners. It was recommended that, on completion, the protocol and product dossier be reviewed for approval in a joint meeting combining ethical, regulatory and environment management authorities.

Our theoretical study demonstrates that the redox signaling cannot be accomplished exclusively by DNA-mediated charge transport because part of the charge transfer chain has an unfavorable free energy profile. We show that hole or excess electron transfer between a [4Fe4S] cluster and a nucleic acid duplex through a protein medium can occur within microseconds in one direction, while it is kinetically hindered in the opposite direction. We present a set of signaling mechanisms that may occur with the assistance of oxidants or reductants, using the allowed charge transfer processes. These mechanisms would enable the coordinated action of [4Fe4S] proteins on DNA, engaging the [4Fe4S] oxidation state dependence of the protein-DNA binding affinity.",An endoscopic surgical technique for treating radiculopathy secondary to S1 nerve compression from a pedicle screw: technical note.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30714011,Journal of spine surgery (Hong Kong),2019 02 06,"Pedicle screw instrumentation is a widely used technique for fixating the spine in fusion surgery.

However, the pattern of brain activity that leads to the behavioral effects of antipsychotics is poorly understood. To address this question, we used the transgenic 'FosTRAP' mice (Mus musculus), where a fluorescent reporter marks the cells responsive to the stimulus of interest. Here, the stimulus was an administration of various antipsychotic drugs. In case of typical antipsychotics such as Haloperidol, the c-fos active cells were predominantly found in the striatum, whereas in case of the atypical antipsychotics (Clozapine and Olanzapine), c-fos-induced cells were more numerous in the cortical regions, e.g., orbital cortex, piriform cortex. Curiously, we also observed ependymal cells to be a novel cellular target of atypical antipsychotics. 5-HT2A is considered to be a major target for atypical antipsychotics. Therefore, we bred 'FosTRAP' mice with 5-HT2A knock-out (KO) mice and tested their response to the prototype of atypical antipsychotics, Clozapine. Interestingly, the absence of 5-HT2A did not significantly affect the number of c-fos-induced cells in the cortical regions. However, the ependymal cells showed a dramatically reduced response to Clozapine in the absence of 5-HT2A. In summary, the TRAP system has allowed us to identify various region-specific activity induced by antipsychotics and novel cellular targets of the antipsychotics. These results serve as a ""proof of principle"" study that can be extended to explore the biochemical and physiological changes brought about by antipsychotics and specifically identify antipsychotic-responsive cells in the live tissue.",Gas Anesthesia Impairs Peripheral Auditory Sensitivity in Barn Owls (Tyto alba).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713995,eNeuro,2019 04 19,"Auditory nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls (age, between posthatching days 11 and 86) in terminal experiments under two different anesthetic regimes: ketamine (6-11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (∼2 mg/kg); or isoflurane (1-1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (Tyto alba; age, between 5 and 32 months) under three different anesthetic protocols: ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1-1.5%), and sevoflurane (2-3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve (i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system). The effect was drastic in the young animals that experienced threshold elevations in auditory nerve single-unit responses of ≥20 dB. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared with ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours, which suggested oxygen toxicity.",Cell Type- and Layer-Specific Muscarinic Potentiation of Excitatory Synaptic Drive onto Parvalbumin Neurons in Mouse Prefrontal Cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713994,eNeuro,2019 05 01,"Cholinergic neuromodulation is thought to shape network activity in the PFC, and thus PFC-dependent cognitive functions. ACh may modulate the activity of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) neurons, which critically regulate cortical network function. However, the mechanisms of cholinergic regulation of PV+ neuron activity, and particularly of the basket cell (BC) versus chandelier cell (ChC) subtypes, are unclear. Using patch clamp recordings in acute slices, we examined the effects of the ACh receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol on the excitatory synaptic drive onto BCs or ChCs in layers 2 to 6 of mouse PFC. Carbachol increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) recorded from PV+ BCs in layers 3-6, but not in BCs from layer 2. Moreover, carbachol did not change the sEPSCs in ChCs, which were located exclusively in layer 2. The potentiation of sEPSCs in layers 3-6 BCs was prevented by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin and was abolished by the M1-selective muscarinic AChR antagonist pirenzepine. Thus, carbachol potentiates the activity-dependent excitatory drive onto PV+ neurons via M1-muscarinic AChR activation in a cell type- and layer-specific manner. In current clamp recordings with synaptic transmission blocked, carbachol directly evoked firing in deep layer pyramidal neurons (PNs). In contrast, carbachol elicited deep layer BC firing indirectly, via glutamate-mediated synaptic drive. Our data suggest that ACh powerfully regulates PFC microcircuit function by facilitating the firing of PNs that synaptically recruit deep layer PV+ BC activity, possibly shaping the patterns of network activity that contribute to cognitive function.",Motor Responses to Noxious Stimuli Shape Pain Perception in Chronic Pain Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713993,eNeuro,2019 04 19,"Pain serves vital protective functions, which crucially depend on appropriate motor responses to noxious stimuli. Such responses not only depend on but can themselves shape the perception of pain. In chronic pain, perception is often decoupled from noxious stimuli and motor responses are no longer protective, which suggests that the relationships between noxious stimuli, pain perception, and behavior might be changed. We here performed a simple experiment to quantitatively assess the relationships between noxious stimuli, perception and behavior in 22 chronic pain patients and 22 age-matched healthy human participants. Brief noxious and tactile stimuli were applied to the participants' hands and participants performed speeded motor responses and provided perceptual ratings of the stimuli. Multi-level moderated mediation analyses assessed the relationships between stimulus intensity, perceptual ratings and reaction times for both stimulus types. The results revealed a significantly stronger involvement of motor responses in the translation of noxious stimuli into perception than in the translation of tactile stimuli into perception. This significant influence of motor responses on pain perception was found for both chronic pain patients and healthy participants. Thus, stimulus-perception-behavior relationships appear to be at least partially preserved in chronic pain patients and motor-related as well as behavioral interventions might harness these functional relationships to modulate pain perception.",Carriage of Supernumerary Sex Chromosomes Decreases the Volume and Alters the Shape of Limbic Structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713992,eNeuro,2019 04 19,"Sex chromosome aneuploidy (SCA) increases risk for several psychiatric disorders associated with the limbic system, including mood and autism spectrum disorders. Thus, SCA offers a genetics-first model for understanding the biological basis of psychopathology. Additionally, the sex-biased prevalence of many psychiatric disorders could potentially reflect sex chromosome dosage effects on brain development. To clarify how limbic anatomy varies across sex and sex chromosome complement, we characterized amygdala and hippocampus structure in a uniquely large sample of patients carrying supernumerary sex chromosomes (n = 132) and typically developing controls (n = 166). After adjustment for sex-differences in brain size, karyotypically normal males (XY) and females (XX) did not differ in volume or shape of either structure. In contrast, all SCAs were associated with lowered amygdala volume relative to gonadally-matched controls. This effect was robust to three different methods for total brain volume adjustment, including an allometric analysis that derived normative scaling rules for these structures in a separate, typically developing population (n = 79). Hippocampal volume was insensitive to SCA after adjustment for total brain volume. However, surface-based analysis revealed that SCA, regardless of specific karyotype, was consistently associated with a spatially specific pattern of shape change in both amygdala and hippocampus. In particular, SCA was accompanied by contraction around the basomedial nucleus of the amygdala and an area crossing the hippocampal tail. These results demonstrate the power of SCA as a model to understand how copy number variation can precipitate changes in brain systems relevant to psychiatric disease.",The growing role of precision and personalized medicine for cancer treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713991,Technology,2019 02 07,"Cancer is a devastating disease that takes the lives of hundreds of thousands of people every year.

This inherent variability of cancer lends itself to the growing field of precision and personalized medicine (PPM). There are many ongoing efforts to acquire PPM data in order to characterize molecular differences between tumors. Some PPM products are already available to link these differences to an effective drug. It is clear that PPM cancer treatments can result in immense patient benefits, and companies and regulatory agencies have begun to recognize this.

However, the mechanism of how SNPs lead to phenotype variations is still unclear. In this work, we connected SNPs and base pair stacking by a 3-mer base pair stacking free energy matrix. The SNPs with large base pair stacking free energy differences led to phenotype variations. A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was then applied. Our results showed that base pair stacking played an important role in the transcription factor (TF)-DNA interaction. Changes in DNA structure mainly originate from TF-DNA interactions, and with the increased base pair stacking free energy, the structure of DNA approaches its free type, although its binding affinity was increased by the SNP. In addition, quantitative models using base pair stacking features revealed that base pair stacking can be used to predict TF binding specificity. As such, our work combined knowledge from bioinformatics and structural biology and provided a new understanding of the relationship between SNPs and phenotype variations. The 3-mer base pair stacking free energy matrix is useful in high-throughput screening of SNPs and predicting TF-DNA binding affinity.","Global Advances in Value-Based Payment and Their Implications for Global Health Management Education, Development, and Practice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713838,Frontiers in public health,2019 02 06,"Global advances in health policy reform, health system improvement and health management education and practice need to be closely aligned to successfully change national health policies and improve the performance of health care delivery organizations.

The MD numerical simulation shows the water permeability of the human AQP5 is in the nominal range for other members of human aquaporins family. In addition, we have considered the effect of the osmotic water diffusion and the diffusion occurred by pressure gradient on the protein membrane. The water permeability grows monotonically as the applied pressure on the solvent increases. Furthermore, the forced diffusion increases the minimum radius of Selectivity Filter (SF) region of region AQP5 up to 20% and consequently the permeability coefficients enhance enormously compared to osmotic self-diffusion in AQP5 tetramer. Finally, it is revealed that the MD simulation of human AQP5 provides useful insights into the mechanisms of water regulation through alveolar cells under the different physical conditions; osmotic self-diffusion and forced diffusion condition.",Crystallographic analysis of the overlapping dinucleosome as a novel chromatin unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713825,Biophysics and physicobiology,2019 02 06,"Recent evidence has suggested that chromatin is not simply repeats of the canonical nucleosome, called the ""octasome"", but may include diverse repertoires of basic structural units. During the transcription process, a nucleosome is repositioned by a chromatin remodeler and collides with a neighboring nucleosome, thus creating an unusual nucleosome substructure termed the ""overlapping dinucleosome"". We previously developed a method for the large-scale preparation of the overlapping dinucleosome. This method enabled us to solve the crystal structure of the overlapping dinucleosome, which revealed an unexpected structure composed of an octameric histone core associated with a hexameric histone core lacking one H2A-H2B dimer.",Data analytic study of the homothermal maintenance mechanism of Skunk Cabbage: Capturing pre-equilibrium characteristics using extended poisson model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713824,Biophysics and physicobiology,2019 02 06,"A wild plant called Skunk Cabbage is known to heat itself and keep its body warm before spring. We study its homothermal maintenance mechanism from a mesoscopic point of view. We take the increment process of the temperature time series and consider it as 'elastic' force that always tries to backlash its temperature to an intrinsic target temperature. We then propose a kind of extended Poisson distribution for the model of the 'elastic' force. The hypothesis testing result by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test suggests that the proposed distribution is a plausible candidate of the model for the 'elastic' force, on the temperature range in which the system is in equillibrium. In addition, it turns out that the parameters in the model captures well the linear behaviour of the expectations of the 'elastic' force at each of the present temperatures and similarly, the constancy of the variances of the force. Especially, the linearity of the expected increments over displacements of tempertures indicates that the backlash might be considered to be like the elastic force of a spring as described by Fuch's law."

This could represent a paradigm shift in clinical science with far-reaching implications. Clinical science might see a decline of named therapies defined by set technologies, a decline of broad schools, a rise of testable models, a rise of mediation and moderation studies, the emergence of new forms of diagnosis based on functional analysis, a move from nomothetic to idiographic approaches, and a move toward processes that specify modifiable elements.

Previously we showed that Pomalidomide (Pom) increases surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-infected latent and lytic cells and restores ICAM-1 and B7-2 in latent cells. We explored the ability of Pom to increase immune surface marker expression in cells infected by other chronic viruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human papilloma virus (HPV), Merkel cell polyoma virus (MCV), and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Pom increased MHC-1, ICAM-1, and B7-2/CD86 in immortalized T-cell lines productively infected with HTLV-1 and also significantly increased their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Pom enhancement of MHC-I and ICAM-1 in primary cells infected with HTLV-1 was abrogated by knockout of HTLV-1 orf-1. Pom increased expression of ICAM-1, B7-2 and MHC class I polypeptide related sequence A (MICA) surface expression in the EBV-infected Daudi cells and increased their T-cell activation and susceptibility to NK cells. Moreover, Pom increased expression of certain of these surface markers on Akata, Raji, and EBV lymphoblastic cell lines. The increased expression of immune surface markers in these virus-infected lines was generally associated with a decrease in IRF4 expression. By contrast, Pom treatment of HPV, MCV and HIV-1 infected cells did not increase these immune surface markers. Pom and related drugs may be clinically beneficial for the treatment of HTLV-1 and EBV-induced tumors by rendering infected cells more susceptible to both innate and adaptive host immune responses.",The novel agonistic iNKT-cell antibody NKT14m induces a therapeutic antitumor response against B-cell lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713807,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a small population of T lymphocytes that expresses an invariant T cell receptor with a unique specificity for glycolipid antigens. Their activation using the glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) triggers innate and adaptive immune responses. The use of α-GalCer in preclinical models as a single antitumor treatment showed moderate effect, but its efficacy in cancer patients was less effective. In addition, this glycolipid induces long-term iNKT-cell anergy precluding the possibility of retreatment. Recently, the first murine iNKT-cell agonistic antibody, NKT14m, has been developed. Here, we analyzed, for the first time, the antitumor efficacy of NKT14m in a B-cell lymphoma model. In a therapeutic setting, a single dose of NKT14m had a moderate antitumor efficacy that was associated with an increase of IFN-γ producing iNKT cells even after a second dose of the NKT14m antibody. Importantly, the combination of a single dose of NKT14m with cyclophosphamide had a potent antitumor efficacy and long-lasting immunity in vivo. Our findings provide the first evidence of the in vivo antitumor efficacy of NKT14m antibody, showing that, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, induces an effective antitumor response. These results open new opportunities for iNKT-cell mediated immunotherapy to treat B-cell lymphoma.",Batf3+ DCs and type I IFN are critical for the efficacy of neoadjuvant cancer immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713806,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"New clinical trials are now evaluating the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in the context of primary tumor surgery. Using the orthotopic 4T1.2 mouse model of spontaneously metastatic mammary cancer, we have shown that neoadjuvant immunotherapy and surgery was superior in the generation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and eradication of lethal metastases compared to surgery followed by adjuvant immunotherapy. However, the importance of host Batf3 and type I interferon (IFN) for long-term survival of mice following neoadjuvant immunotherapy is unknown. Here we demonstrated that loss of Batf3+ DCs or type I IFN receptor blockade in 4T1.2 tumor-bearing mice treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1+anti-CD137 immunotherapy reduced long-term survival with a corresponding reduction in tumor-specific CD8+ T cells producing effector cytokines in the primary tumor and in the periphery. Interestingly, we found all high-risk stage III melanoma patients relapsing after adjuvant or neoadjuvant ipilimumab+nivolumab within the OpACIN trial (NCT02437279) displayed low expression of Batf3+ DC-associated genes in pre-treatment tumor biopsies. Further focus should now be placed on validating the requirement of an intratumoral Batf3+ DC gene signature for response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy.",Beneficial effects of sunitinib on tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy targeting death receptor5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713805,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Tumor-associated blood vessels and lymphatics are abnormal and dysfunctional. These are hallmarks of the tumor microenvironment, which has an immunosuppressive nature, such as through hypoxia. Treatment with anti-death receptor5 (DR5) monoclonal antibody MD5-1, which induces tumor cell death, is a potent anti-tumor immunotherapy. Generally, MD5-1 induces cell death mainly via antigen presenting cells (APCs) and generates tumor-specific effector T cells. To date, the effects of a simultaneous functional improvement of abnormal blood vessels and lymphatics on the immune microenvironment are largely unknown. A combination therapy using sunitinib, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitor, and MD5-1 substantially inhibited tumor growth. Sunitinib improved pericyte coverage on endothelial cells and the expression levels of regulator of G-protein signaling 5, suggesting blood vessel normalization. Sunitinib also increased lymph flow from tumors to central lymph nodes, suggesting improved lymphatic function. In concordance with improved vasculature functions, sunitinib alleviated the tumor hypoxia, suggesting an improved tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the combination therapy induced strong activation of CD8+ T cells and dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes. The combination therapy reduced the ratio of immune-suppressive T regulatory cells in the tumors and draining lymph nodes. The combination therapy enhanced the numbers and activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. CD4 and/or CD8 depletion, or APC inhibiting experiments showed the contribution of CD8+ T cells and APCs to the combination therapy. These findings suggest that targeting blood vessels and lymphatics may have potential benefits for immunotherapy mediated by CD8+ T cells and APCs.",DNA methylation of immune checkpoints in the peripheral blood of breast and colorectal cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713804,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Aberrant expression of immune checkpoints (ICs) in cancer creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which supports immune evasion of tumor cells. We have recently reported that epigenetic modifications are critical for ICs expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of primary breast cancer (PBC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we investigated transcriptomic expression of ICs (PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3, TIGIT) and PD-L1 in peripheral blood of PBC and CRC patients, compared to healthy donors (HD). We found that expressions of TIM-3, TIGIT, PD-L1 were significantly upregulated, while LAG-3 expression was downregulated in peripheral blood of PBC and CRC patients. Demethylation enzymes TET2 and TET3 were also upregulated. In addition, promoter DNA methylation status of PD-1 was significantly hypermethylated, while PD-L1 was hypomethylated in PBC and CRC patients. Furthermore, TIGIT was significantly hypomethylated only in CRC patients. Remarkably, promoter methylation status of LAG-3, TIGIT and PD-L1 was in concordance with transcriptomic expression in CRC: the more the hypomethylation, the higher the expression. In comparison, we found that CTLA-4, TIM-3, TIGIT and PD-L1 in PBC, and CTLA-4 in CRC patients were significantly upregulated in peripheral blood, compared with tumor tissues of the same patients. However, demethylation status of all ICs was higher in TT, except for TIGIT in PBC, and CTLA-4 in CRC patients. These data indicate that the underlying mechanisms behind peripheral upregulation of PD-L1 and TIGIT in cancer patients could be due to aberrant promoter methylation profile. Moreover, demethylation inhibitors together with anti-PD-L1/anti-TIGIT could be a more efficient therapeutic strategy in cancer patients.",Tumor-infiltrating T cells and PD-L1 expression in childhood malignant extracranial germ-cell tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713803,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Although pediatric malignant extracranial germ-cell tumors (meGCTs) are among the most chemosensitive solid tumors, a group of patients relapse and die of disease. To identify new markers predicting clinical outcome, we examined the prognostic relevance of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in a cohort of pediatric meGCTs by in situ immunohistochemistry. MeGCTs were variously infiltrated by T cell-subtypes according to the tumor subtype, tumor location and age at diagnosis. We distinguished three different phenotypes: i) tumors not infiltrated by T cells (immature teratomas and half of the yolk sac tumors), ii) tumors highly infiltrated by CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1, which identifies activated tumor-reactive T cells (seminomas and dysgerminomas), iii) tumors highly infiltrated by CD8+ T cells within an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment characterized by CD4+FOXP3+ Treg cells and PD-L1-expressing tumor cells (embryonal carcinomas, choriocarcinomas and the remaining yolk sac tumors). Tumor subtypes belonging mixed meGCTs were variously infiltrated, suggesting the coexistence of multiple immune microenvironments either facilitating or precluding the entry of T cells. These findings support the hypothesis that TILs influence the development of meGCTs and might be of clinical relevance to improve risk stratification and the treatment of pediatric patients.","PD-L2 expression is correlated with the molecular and clinical features of glioma, and acts as an unfavorable prognostic factor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713802,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Background: Gliomas are aggressive tumors with various molecular and clinical characteristics and exhibit strongly resistance to radio-chemotherapy. Programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2) is a cell surface protein, which was reported in many cancers, modulating cancer-associated immune responses, while the role of PD-L2 in gliomas remained unclear. Herein, we aimed to investigate the biological behaviors and clinical prognostic values of PD-L2 in gliomas. Methods: Totally, we enrolled RNA sequencing data of 325 glioma samples from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) as training cohort and RNA expression data of 1032 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset as validation cohort in this research. Then, the clinical and molecular characteristics, and the prognostic value of PD-L2 were analyzed. Results: We found that PD-L2 expression level was significantly upregulated in higher grade glioma and IDH wild-type glioma. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that PD-L2 was a potential indicator of mesenchymal subtype. PD-L2 exhibited tight relationship with immune response and immune-modulating process in glioma. Moreover, PD-L2 expression level could predict unfavorable prognoses of patients independent of age, grade, IDH status and 1p/19q status. Conclusions: Our study revealed that PD-L2 was closely related with inflammation and immune response. Patients with lower PD-L2 expression level tended to experience improved survival. Targeting PD-L2 may become a valuable approach for the treatment of gliomas in clinical practice."

Recent data indicate that MM cells can evade bortezomib-induced cell death by undergoing autophagy as a consequence of endoplasmatic reticulum (ER)-stress induced by proteasome inhibition. Here we show that bortezomib sensitizes MM cells to NK cell killing via two distinct mechanisms: a) upregulation of the TRAIL death receptor DR5 on the surface of MM cells and b) ER-stress induced reduction of cell surface HLA-E. The latter mechanism is completely novel and was found to be exclusively controlled by the inhibitory receptor NKG2A, with NKG2A single-positive (NKG2ASP) NK cells developing a selective augmentation in tumor killing as a consequence of bortezomib-induced loss of HLA-E on the non-apoptotic MM cells. In contrast, the expression of classical HLA class I molecules remained unchanged following bortezomib exposure, diminishing the augmentation of MM killing by NK cells expressing KIR. Further, we found that feeder cell-based ex vivo expansion of NK cells increased both NK cell TRAIL surface expression and the percentage of NKG2ASP NK cells compared to unexpanded controls, substantially augmenting their capacity to kill bortezomib-treated MM cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that infusion of ex vivo expanded NK cells following treatment with bortezomib could eradicate MM cells that would normally evade killing through proteasome inhibition alone, potentially improving long-term survival among MM patients.",ISG20 promotes local tumor immunity and contributes to poor survival in human glioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713788,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Recent evidence has confirmed that a mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene occurs early in gliomagenesis and contributes to suppressed immunity. The present study aimed to determine the candidate genes associated with IDH mutation status that could serve as biomarkers of immune suppression for improved prognosis prediction. Clinical information and RNA-seq gene expression data were collected for 932 glioma samples from the CGGA and TCGA databases, and differentially expressed genes in both lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) samples were identified according to IDH mutation status. Only one gene, interferon-stimulated exonuclease gene 20 (ISG20), with reduced expression in IDH mutant tumors, demonstrated significant prognostic value. ISG20 expression level significantly increased with increasing tumor grade, and its high expression was associated with a poor clinical outcome. Moreover, increased ISG20 expression was associated with increased infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils, and suppressed adaptive immune response. ISG20 expression was also positively correlated with PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 expression, along with the levels of several chemokines. We conclude that ISG20 is a useful biomarker to identify IDH-mediated immune processes in glioma and may serve as a potential therapeutic target.","The multi-functionality of N-809, a novel fusion protein encompassing anti-PD-L1 and the IL-15 superagonist fusion complex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713787,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Here we describe a novel bifunctional fusion protein, designated N-809. This molecule comprises the IL-15/IL15Rα superagonist complex containing the Fc-domain of IgG1 (N-803, formerly designated as ALT-803) fused to two single chain anti-PD-L1 domains. The fully human IgG1 portion of the N-809 molecule was designed to potentially mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The studies reported here show that N-809 has the same ability to bind PD-L1 as an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. RNAseq studies show the ability of N-809 to alter the expression of an array of genes of both CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells, and to enhance their proliferation; CD8+ T cells exposed to N-809 also have enhanced ability to lyse human tumor cells. An array of genes was differentially expressed in human natural killer (NK) cells following N-809 treatment, and there was increased expression of several surface activating receptors; there was, however, no increase in the expression of inhibitory receptors known to be upregulated in exhausted NK cells. N-809 also increased the cytotoxic potential of NK cells, as shown by increased expression of granzyme B and perforin. The lysis of several tumor cell types was increased when either NK cells or tumor cells were exposed to N-809. Similarly, the highest level of ADCC was seen when both NK cells (from donors or cancer patients) and tumor cells were exposed to N-809. These studies thus demonstrate the multi-functionality of this novel agent.",Critical role of post-transcriptional regulation for IFN-γ in tumor-infiltrating T cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713785,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Protective T cell responses against tumors require the production of Interferon gamma (IFN-γ). However, tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) gradually lose their capacity to produce IFN-γ and therefore fail to clear malignant cells. Dissecting the underlying mechanisms that block cytokine production is thus key for improving T cell products. Here we show that although TILs express substantial levels of Ifng mRNA, post-transcriptional mechanisms impede the production of IFN-γ protein due to loss of mRNA stability. CD28 triggering, but not PD1 blocking antibodies, effectively restores the stability of Ifng mRNA. Intriguingly, TILs devoid of AU-rich elements within the 3'untranslated region maintain stabilized Ifng mRNA and produce more IFN-γ protein than wild-type TILs. This sustained IFN-γ production translates into effective suppression of tumor outgrowth, which is almost exclusively mediated by direct effects on the tumor cells. We therefore conclude that post-transcriptional mechanisms could be modulated to potentiate effective T cell therapies in cancer.",Affinity-enhanced T-cell receptors for adoptive T-cell therapy targeting MAGE-A10: strategy for selection of an optimal candidate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713784,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Circulating T-cells that have passed thymic selection generally bear T-cell receptors (TCRs) with sub-optimal affinity for cancer-associated antigens, resulting in a limited ability to detect and eliminate tumor cells. Engineering TCRs to increase their affinity for cancer targets is a promising strategy for generating T-cells with enhanced potency for adoptive immunotherapy in cancer patients. However, this manipulation also risks generating cross-reactivity to antigens expressed by normal tissue, with potentially serious consequences. Testing in animal models might not detect such cross-reactivity due to species differences in the antigenic repertoire. To mitigate the risk of off-target toxicities in future clinical trials, we therefore developed an extensive in vitro testing strategy. This approach involved systematic substitution at each position of the antigenic peptide sequence using all natural amino acids to generate a profile of peptide specificity (""X-scan""). The likelihood of off-target reactivity was investigated by searching the human proteome for sequences matching this profile, and testing against a panel of primary cell lines. Starting from a diverse panel of parental TCRs, we engineered several affinity-enhanced TCRs specific for the cancer-testis antigen MAGE-A10. Two of these TCRs had affinities and specificities which appeared to be equally optimal when tested in conventional biochemical and cellular assays. The X-scan method, however, permitted us to select the most specific and potent candidate for further pre-clinical and clinical testing.",Retrospective analysis of the efficacy of adjuvant CIK cell therapy in epithelial ovarian cancer patients who received postoperative chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713783,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are demonstrated to possess potent cytolytic effect against ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the clinical efficacy of maintenance therapy of CIK cells in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) after first-line treatment remains unclear. This retrospective study included 646 cases of postoperative EOC patients, 72 of which received chemotherapy and sequential immunotherapy (CIT group), and 574 of which received only chemotherapy (Control group). Patients in the CIT group received at least four cycles of CIK cell (range 8.0 × 109 - 1.3 × 1010 cells) transfusion, with the interval of each cycle being 2 weeks. Survival analysis showed a significantly higher overall survival (OS) rate in the CIT group compared with the control group, as well as a favorable progression-free survival (PFS). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that adjuvant CIT was an independent prognostic factor for the OS of patients with EOC. Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed that adjuvant CIT significantly improved the OS of patients older than 45 years, with CA125 ≤ 1000, or with moderate or poorly differentiated tumors, and prolonged the PFS of patients with residual disease > 1 cm. Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that a higher fraction of CD3+CD8+/CD3+CD56+ phenotypes or lower percentage of CD3+CD4+/CD3-CD56+ phenotypes in the infused CIK cells significantly associated with better survival of patients with EOC. Furthermore, across all processes of CIK cell immunotherapy in the CIT group, 12.5% (9/72) of patients developed self-limiting light fevers and shivering at grade 1 or 2. No immunotherapy-related serious reactions were recorded. These data indicate that adjuvant CIT with CIK cells is an effective therapeutic approach to prolonging the survival of EOC patients.",Mannan-binding lectin suppresses growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating hepatic stellate cell activation via the ERK/COX-2/PGE2 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713782,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Mannan binding lectin (MBL), initially known to activate the complement lectin pathway and defend against infection, was recently shown to be potentially involved in the development of several types of cancer; however, its exact role in cancers, especially its effect on tumor microenvironment remain largely unknown. Here, using a murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model, we showed that MBL was a component of liver microenvironment and MBL-deficient (MBL-/-) mice exhibited an enhanced tumor growth compared with wild-type (WT) mice. This phenomenon was associated with elevation of myeloid derived suppressed cells (MDSCs) in tumor tissue of MBL-/- mice. MBL deficiency also resulted in an increase of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which showed enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 in vivo partially abrogated the MBL deficiency-promoted tumor growth and MDSC accumulation. Mechanistic studies revealed that MBL could interact directly with HSCs and inhibit HCC-induced HSCs activation via downregulating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, MBL-mediated suppression of HCC is validated by administration of MBL-expressing, liver-specific adeno-associated virus (AAV), which significantly inhibited HCC progression in MBL-/- mice. Taken together, these data reveal that MBL may impact on tumor development by shaping the tumor microenvironment via its interaction with the local stromal cells, and also suggests its potential therapeutic use for the treatment of HCC.",Circulating NKp46+ Natural Killer cells have a potential regulatory property and predict distinct survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713781,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes widely involved in cancer immunosurveillance. In this study, we described three circulating NK cell subsets in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Compared to healthy donors (HD), lower rate of the cytotoxic CD56dim CD16+ NK cells was found in NSCLC patients (76.1% vs 82.4%, P = 0.0041). In contrast, the rate of CD56bright NK cells was similar between patients and HD. We showed in NSCLC patients a higher rate of a NK cell subset with CD56dim CD16- phenotype (16.7% vs 9.9% P = 0.0001). The degranulation property and cytokines production were mainly drive by CD56dim CD16- NK cell subset in patients. Analysis of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) expression identified four distinct clusters of patients with distinct NK cell subset profiles as compared to one major cluster in HD. Notably the cluster characterized by a low circulating level of NKp46+ NK cell subsets was absent in HD. We showed that the rate of circulating NKp46+ CD56dim CD16+ NK cells influenced the patients' survival. Indeed, the median overall survival in patients exhibiting high versus low level of this NK cell subset was 16 and 27 months respectively (P = 0.02). Finally, we demonstrated that blocking NKp46 receptor in vitro was able to restore spontaneous tumor specific T cell responses in NSCLC patients. In conclusion, this study showed a distinct distribution and phenotype of circulating NK cell subsets in NSCLC. It also supports the regulatory role of NKp46+ NK cell subset in NSCLC patients.",IL-33 increases ST2+ Tregs and promotes metastatic tumour growth in the lungs in an amphiregulin-dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713780,Oncoimmunology,2019 02 06,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) facilitate primary and metastatic tumour growth through the suppression of anti-tumour immunity. Emerging evidence suggests a distinct role for Tregs in mediating tissue repair and barrier integrity in the lungs by IL-33 mediated production of the growth factor amphiregulin (AREG). Dependent on the type of cancer and local microenvironment, AREG may induce tumour cell proliferation, invasion, migration or resistance to apoptosis by signaling through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We have found that IL-33 is dramatically increased in and around metastatic tumour foci in the lungs of mice bearing orthotopic murine mammary tumours. We observed that Tregs express significantly more of the IL-33 receptor, ST2, relative to conventional T cells, that ST2+ Tregs accumulate in the lungs of metastatic tumour-bearing mice, and that ST2+ Tregs produce significantly more AREG than ST2- Tregs. The intranasal administration of recombinant IL-33 increased the proportion of AREG producing ST2+ Tregs and enhanced the level of phosphorylated EGFR in the metastatic lungs. While recombinant AREG did not impact mammary tumour cell proliferation in vitro despite inducing a dose-dependent increase in phosphorylated EGFR, intranasal administration of AREG resulted in a ten-fold increase in pulmonary metastatic tumour burden in vivo. Further, the intranasal administration of recombinant IL-33 significantly increased metastatic tumour burden in the lungs in an amphiregulin-dependent manner. These data identify ST2+ Tregs as a microenvironmental source of AREG in the lungs of mice with orthotopic metastatic mammary tumours and highlight an important role for AREG in promoting metastatic tumour growth in the lungs.",The Role of Additional K-Wires on AO Type C Distal Radius Fracture Treatment with External Fixator in Young Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713776,Advances in orthopedics,2019 02 06,Several methods have been proposed to treat AO type C distal radius fracture.

Bacterial enzymes play a key role in the emergence of resistance. Classification of these enzymes is based on their participation in various biochemical mechanisms: modification of the enzymes that act as antibiotic targets, enzymatic modification of intracellular targets, enzymatic transformation of antibiotics, and the implementation of cellular metabolism reactions. The main mechanisms of resistance development are associated with the evolution of superfamilies of bacterial enzymes due to the variability of the genes encoding them. The collection of all antibiotic resistance genes is known as the resistome. Tens of thousands of enzymes and their mutants that implement various mechanisms of resistance form a new community that is called ""the enzystome.""

The screening was extremely successful; at least two new single-crystal structures could be obtained for each particular compound and many more salts as single crystals were formed compared with our previous vapour-diffusion method.",A jumping crystal predicted with molecular dynamics and analysed with TLS refinement against powder diffraction data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713711,IUCrJ,2019 02 06,"By running a temperature series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from the known low-temperature phase, the experimentally observed phase transition in a 'jumping crystal' was captured, thereby providing a prediction of the unknown crystal structure of the high-temperature phase and clarifying the phase-transition mechanism. The phase transition is accompanied by a discontinuity in two of the unit-cell parameters. The structure of the high-temperature phase is very similar to that of the low-temperature phase. The anisotropic displacement parameters calculated from the MD simulations readily identified libration as the driving force behind the phase transition. Both the predicted crystal structure and the phase-transition mechanism were verified experimentally using TLS (translation, libration, screw) refinement against X-ray powder diffraction data.","Synthesis of new Ln4(Al2O6F2)O2 (Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd) phases with a cuspidine-related structure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713710,IUCrJ,2019 02 06,"The first fluorination of the cuspidine-related phases of Ln4(Al2O7□)O2 (where Ln = Sm, Eu, Gd) is reported. A low-temperature reaction with poly(vinyl-idene difluoride) lead to the fluorine being substituted in place of oxygen and inserted into the vacant position between the dialuminate groups. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the presence of the F 1s photoelectron together with an increase in Al 2p and rare-earth 4d binding energies supporting F incorporation. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses are consistent with the formula Ln4(Al2O6F2)O2, confirming that substitution of one oxygen by two fluoride atoms has been achieved. Rietveld refinements show an expansion in the cell upon fluorination and confirm that the incorporation of fluoride in the Ln4(Al2O7□)O2 structure results in changes in Al coordination from four to five. Thus, the isolated tetrahedral dialuminate Al2O7 groups are converted to chains of distorted square-based pyramids. These structural results are also discussed based on Raman spectra.",Structure model of γ-Al2O3 based on planar defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713709,IUCrJ,2019 02 06,"The defect structure of γ-Al2O3 derived from boehmite was investigated using a combination of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both methods confirmed a strong dependence of the diffraction line broadening on the diffraction indices known from literature. The analysis of the SAED patterns revealed that the dominant structure defects in the spinel-type γ-Al2O3 are antiphase boundaries located on the lattice planes , which produce the sublattice shifts . Quantitative information about the defect structure of γ-Al2O3 was obtained from the powder XRD patterns. This includes mainly the size of γ-Al2O3 crystallites and the density of planar defects. The correlation between the density of the planar defects and the presence of structural vacancies, which maintain the stoichiometry of the spinel-type γ-Al2O3, is discussed. A computer routine running on a fast graphical processing unit was written for simulation of the XRD patterns. This routine calculates the atomic positions for a given kind and density of planar defect, and simulates the diffracted intensities with the aid of the Debye scattering equation.",Incommensurate structures of the [CH3NH3][Co(COOH)3] compound.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713708,IUCrJ,2019 02 06,"The present article is devoted to the characterization of the structural phase transitions of the [CH3NH3][Co(COOH)3] (1) perovskite-like metal-organic compound through variable-temperature single-crystal neutron diffraction. At room temperature, compound 1 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma (phase I). A decrease in temperature gives rise to a first phase transition from the space group Pnma to an incommensurate phase (phase II) at approximately 128 K. At about 96 K, this incommensurate phase evolves into a second phase with a sharp change in the modulation vector (phase III). At lower temperatures (ca 78 K), the crystal structure again becomes commensurate and can be described in the monoclinic space group P21/n (phase IV). Although phases I and IV have been reported previously [Boča et al. (2004). Acta Cryst. C60, m631-m633; Gómez-Aguirre et al. (2016). J. Am. Chem. Soc.138, 1122-1125; Mazzuca et al. (2018). Chem. Eur. J.24, 388-399], phases III and IV corresponding to the Pnma(00γ)0s0 space group have not yet been described. These phase transitions involve not only the occurrence of small distortions in the three-dimensional anionic [Co(HCOO)3]- framework, but also the reorganization of the [CH3NH3]+ counter-ions in the cavities of the structure, which gives rise to an alteration of the hydrogen-bonded network, modifying the electrical properties of compound 1.",Deformation pathway and defect generation in crystals: a combined group theory and graph theory description.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713707,IUCrJ,2019 02 06,"The generation and motion of crystalline defects during plastic deformation are critical processes that determine the mechanical properties of a crystal. The types of defect generated are not only related to the symmetry of a crystal but also associated with the symmetry-breaking process during deformation. Proposed here is a new mathematical framework to capture the intrinsic coupling between crystal symmetry and deformation-induced symmetry breaking. Using a combination of group theory and graph theory, a general approach is demonstrated for the systematic determination of the types of crystalline defect induced by plastic deformation, through the construction of a crystal deformation group and a deformation pathway graph. The types of defect generated in the deformation of a face-centered cubic crystal are analyzed through the deformation pathway graph and compared with experimental observations.",Framework disorder and its effect on selective hysteretic sorption of a T-shaped azole-based metal-organic framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713706,IUCrJ,2019 02 06,"Metal-organic frameworks with highly ordered porosity have been studied extensively. In this paper, the effect of framework (pore) disorder on the gas sorption of azole-based isoreticular Cu(II) MOFs with rtl topology and characteristic 1D tubular pore channels is investigated for the first time. In contrast to other isoreticular rtl metal-organic frameworks, the Cu(II) metal-organic framework based on 5-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)isophthalate acid has a crystallographically identifiable disordered framework without open N-donor sites. The framework provides a unique example for investigating the effect of pore disorder on gas sorption that can be systematically evaluated. It exhibits remarkable temperature-dependent hysteretic CO2 sorption up to room temperature, and shows selectivity of CO2 over H2, CH4 and N2 at ambient temperature. The unique property of the framework is its disordered structure featuring distorted 1D tubular channels and DMF-guest-remediated defects. The results imply that structural disorder (defects) may play an important role in the modification of the performance of the material."

C,2019 03 04,"New complexes of Zn(ii), Pd(ii) and Pt(ii) with Schiff bases are prepared in a one-step condensation of 4-(dibutylamino)-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4,5-diaminophthalonitrile in the presence of a metal salt. The complexes possess efficient absorption in the blue-green part of the spectrum with molar absorption coefficients up to 98 000 M-1 cm-1. The Pt(ii) complex shows very strong red phosphorescence in anoxic solutions at room temperature with a quantum yield of 65% in toluene which places it among the brightest emitters available for this spectral range. The phosphorescence of the Pd(ii) complex under the same conditions is very weak (Φ < 1%) but is enhanced to Φ > 10% upon immobilization into polymers. Optical thermometers based on self-referenced lifetime read-out are prepared upon immobilization of the dyes into gas-blocking poly(vinylidene chloride-co-acrylonitrile). At 25 °C, the materials based on Pd(ii) and Pt(ii) complexes show sensitivities of -2.1 and -0.52%τ/K, respectively. Application of the sensors for imaging of temperature on surfaces (planar optode) and for monitoring of fast temperature fluctuations (fiber-optic microsensor) is demonstrated. Immobilized into a gas-permeable matrix, the Pt(ii) complex also performs as a promising oxygen-sensing material. The new systems are also attractive for imaging of oxygen or temperature with the help of multi-photon microscopy, due to a good match with the biological optical window and much better brightness under two photon excitation compared to that of the conventional Pt(ii) meso-tetra-(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin.",Highly stable doping of a polar polythiophene through co-processing with sulfonic acids and bistriflimide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713690,Journal of materials chemistry. C,2019 03 04,"Doping of organic semiconductors is currently an intensely studied field, since it is a powerful tool to optimize the performance of various organic electronic devices, ranging from organic solar cells, to thermoelectric modules, and bio-medical sensors. Despite recent advances, there is still a need for the development of highly conducting polymer:dopant systems with excellent long term stability and a high resistance to elevated temperatures. In this work we study the doping of the polar polythiophene derivative p(g42T-T) by various sulfonic acids and bistriflimide via different processing techniques. We demonstrate that simple co-processing of p(g42T-T) with an acid dopant yields conductivities of up to 120 S cm-1, which remain stable for more than six months under ambient conditions. Notably, a high conductivity is only achieved if the doping is carried out in air, which can be explained with a doping process that involves an acid mediated oxidation of the polymer through O2. P(g42T-T) doped with the non-toxic and inexpensive 1,3-propanedisulfonic acid was found to retain its electrical conductivity for at least 20 hours upon annealing at 120 °C, which allowed the bulk processing of the doped polymer into conducting, free-standing and flexible films and renders the di-acid a promising alternative to commonly used redox dopants.",Effects of fluorination and thermal annealing on charge recombination processes in polymer bulk-heterojunction solar cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713689,Journal of materials chemistry.

The unsubstituted and fluorinated polymers afford very similar open-circuit voltages and fill factor values, but the fluorinated polymer performed better due to enhanced aggregation which provides a higher photocurrent. The photovoltaic performance of both materials improved upon thermal annealing at 150-200 °C as a result of a significantly increased fill factor and open-circuit voltage, counteracted by a slight loss in photocurrent. Detailed studies of the morphology, light intensity dependence, external quantum efficiency and electroluminescence allowed the exploration of the effects of fluorination and thermal annealing on the charge recombination and the nature of the donor-acceptor interfacial charge transfer states in these films.",Novel multifunctional polymethylsilsesquioxane-silk fibroin aerogel hybrids for environmental and thermal insulation applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713688,Journal of materials chemistry. A,2019 02 06,"The development of aerogels with improved mechanical properties, to expand their utility in high-performance applications, is still a big challenge. Besides fossil-fuel based polymers that have been extensively utilized as platforms to enhance the mechanical strength of silsesquioxane and silica-based aerogels, using green biopolymers from various sustainable renewable resources are currently drawing significant attention. In this work, we process silk fibroin (SF) proteins, extracted from silkworm cocoons, with organically substituted alkoxysilanes in an entirely aqueous based solution via a successive sol-gel approach, and show for the first time that it is possible to produce homogeneous interpenetrated (IPN) polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ)-SF hybrid aerogel monoliths with significantly improved mechanical properties. Emphasis is given to an improvement of the molecular interaction of the two components (SF biopolymer and PMSQ) using a silane coupling agent and to the design of pore structure. We succeeded in developing a novel class of compressible, light-weight, and hierarchically organized meso-macroporous PMSQ-SF IPN hybrid aerogels by carefully controlling the sol-gel parameters at a molecular level. Typically, these aerogels have a compressive strength (δmax) of up to 14 MPa, together with high flexibility in both compression and bending, compressibility up to 80% strain with very low bulk density (ρb) of 0.08-0.23 g cm-3. By considering these promising properties, the superhydrophobic/oleophilic PMSQ-SF aerogel hybrids exhibited a high competency for selective absorption of a variety of organic pollutants (absorption capacities ∼500-2600 g g-1 %) from water and acted as a high-performance filter for continuous water/oil separation. Moreover, they have demonstrated impressive thermal insulation performance (λ = 0.032-0.044 W m-1 K-1) with excellent fire retardancy and self-extinguishing capabilities. Therefore, the PMSQ-SF aerogel hybrids would be a new class of open porous material and are expected to further extend the practical applications of this class of porous compounds.",Racemic vs. enantiopure inert Ti(iv) complex of a single diaminotetrakis(phenolato) ligand in anticancer activity toward human drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713687,RSC advances,2019 02 06,"A tetrakis(phenolato) Ti(iv) complex was synthesized in racemic and optically pure form, exhibiting high hydrolytic stability, and similar cytotoxicity for all stereochemical forms on HT-29 and A2780 cancer cells.

However, while several nanoparticle systems have been shown to interact with blood platelets, many questions remain concerning the mechanisms of platelet activation and the role that the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles play in inducing platelet aggregation. Here, using negatively charged polystyrene nanoparticles with sizes of 25, 50, 119, 151, 201 nm and negatively charged platinum nanoparticles with sizes of 7 and 73 nm, we show that it is not the size of the nanoparticles but rather the nanoparticle surface area that is critical in mediating the effects on platelet activation. The nanoparticles stimulate platelet aggregation through passive (agglutination) and activation of integrin αIIbβ3 through a pathway regulated by Src and Syk tyrosine kinase.",Speciation of lanthanide ions in the organic phase after extraction from nitrate media by basic extractants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713684,RSC advances,2019 02 06,"A speciation study was carried out for lanthanide complexes formed in the organic phase after solvent extraction with quaternary ammonium and phosphonium nitrate extractants. These extractants are liquid at room temperature and were applied in their undiluted form. A comparison was made between the quaternary compound trihexyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium nitrate, the nitrate form of the commercial extractant Cyphos IL 101, and Aliquat 336 nitrate, the nitrate form of the commercial trialkylmethylammonium chloride extractant Aliquat 336 (alkyl = mixture of C8 and C10 chains). The structures of the lanthanide complexes across the entire lanthanide series (with the exception of promethium) were determined by a combination of solvent extraction techniques, FTIR, NMR, high-resolution steady-state luminescence spectroscopy, luminescence life time measurements, elemental analysis and EXAFS spectroscopy. The results suggest that the lanthanide ions form an anionic nitrate complex in the organic phase by coordinating with five bidentate nitrate ligands. Charge neutralization is provided by two counter cations of the extractant present in the outer coordination sphere of the complex. Furthermore, it is suggested that the pentanitrato complex is the sole lanthanide species that is formed in significant concentrations in the organic phase.",Linear dichroism of visible-region chromophores using M13 bacteriophage as an alignment scaffold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713683,RSC advances,2019 02 06,"It is a challenge within the field of biomimetics to recreate the properties of light-harvesting antennae found in plants and photosynthetic bacteria. Attempts to recreate these biological structures typically rely on the alignment of fluorescent moieties via attachment to an inert linear scaffold, e.g. DNA, RNA or amyloid fibrils, to enable Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between attached chromophores. While there has been some success in this approach, refinement of the alignment of the chromophores is often limited, which may limit the efficiency of energy transfer achieved. Here we demonstrate how linear dichroism spectroscopy may be used to ascertain the overall alignment of chromophores bound to the M13 bacteriophage, a model linear scaffold, and demonstrate how this may be used to distinguish between lack of FRET efficiency due to chromophore separation, and chromophore misalignment. This approach will allow the refinement of artificial light-harvesting antennae in a directed fashion."

The benefits of hydrogen water on motor deficits have been reported in animal PD models and PD patients, but the effects of hydrogen gas on PD patients have not been studied. We evaluated the effect of inhalation of hydrogen gas on olfactory function, non-motor symptoms, activities of daily living, and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) levels by a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with an 8-week washout period in 20 patients with PD. Patients inhaled either ~1.2-1.4% hydrogen-air mixture or placebo for 10 minutes twice a day for 4 weeks. Inhalation of low dose hydrogen did not significantly influence the PD clinical parameters, but it did increase urinary 8-OHdG levels by 16%. This increase in 8-OHdG is markedly less than the over 300% increase in diabetes, and is more comparable to the increase after a bout of strenuous exercise. Although increased reactive oxygen species is often associated with toxicity and disease, they also play essential roles in mediating cytoprotective cellular adaptations in a process known as hormesis. Increases of oxidative stress by hydrogen have been previously reported, along with its ability to activate the Nrf2, NF-κB pathways, and heat shock responses. Although we did not observe any beneficial effect of hydrogen in our short trial, we propose that the increased 8-OHdG and other reported stress responses from hydrogen may indicate that its beneficial effects are partly or largely mediated by hormetic mechanisms. The study was approved by the ethics review committee of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine (approval number 2015-0295). The clinical trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network (identifier UMIN000019082).","Effects of the long-term consumption of hydrogen-rich water on the antioxidant activity and the gut flora in female juvenile soccer players from Suzhou, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713665,Medical gas research,2019 02 06,"Expending a considerable amount of physical energy inevitably leads to fatigue during both training and competition in football. An increasing number of experimental findings have confirmed the relationship between the generation and clearance of free radicals, fatigue, and exercise injury. Recently, hydrogen was identified as a new selective antioxidant with potential beneficial applications in sports. The present study evaluated the effect of 2-month consumption of hydrogen-rich water on the gut flora in juvenile female soccer players from Suzhou. As demonstrated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and 16S rDNA sequence analysis of stool samples, the consumption of hydrogen-rich water for two months significantly reduced serum malondialdehyde, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α levels; then significantly increased serum superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity levels and haemoglobin levels of whole blood. Furthermore, the consumption of hydrogen-rich water improved the diversity and abundance of the gut flora in athletes. All examined indices, including the shannon, sobs, ace, and chao indices, were higher in the control group than those proposed to result from hydrogen-rich water consumption prior to the trial, but these indices were all reversed and were higher than those in the controls after the 2-month intervention. Nevertheless, there were some differences in the gut flora components of these two groups before the trial, whereas there were no significant changes in the gut flora composition during the trial period. Thus, the consumption of hydrogen-rich water for two months might play a role modulating in the gut flora of athletes based on its selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Suzhou Sports School (approved number: SSS-EC150903).",A survey of anaphylaxis etiology and treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713664,Medical gas research,2019 02 06,"Identifying the causes of anaphylaxis which is an acute, potentially fatal systemic reaction is very important in every community. Treatment strategies and pitfalls should also be determined. We sought to determine the most common triggers of anaphylaxis, clinical manifestations and treatment strategies in Mashhad, northeast of Iran. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate all patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction who were referred to University Allergy Clinics between 2006 and 2016 in Mashhad Iran. We used a combination of patient's clinical history and allergy diagnostic testing including radioallergosorbant test and skin prick test in order to determine the etiology of anaphylaxis. We identified 172 anaphylactic reactions in 70 patients. Median age was 15 years with a range from 6 months to 48 years. The triggers included: foods, 61.4%; drugs, 15.7%; hymenoptera venom, 8.6%; idiopathic, 5.7%; immunotherapy, 4.3% and other etiologies: 5.7%. Nuts and seeds were the most important triggers of food induced anaphylaxis, especially in school children, adolescents and young adults, followed by fruits. However, Cow's milk and hen's egg were the main triggers of anaphylaxis in children aged under 2 years. The most common symptoms were cutaneous and cardiovascular. Corticosteroids (94.3%) and/or antihistamines (85.7%) were used most frequently for treatment followed by intravenous fluids (54.3%), whereas epinephrine was only used in 17.1% of the cases. Food related anaphylaxis and other typical triggers of anaphylaxis are age dependent and the risks and triggers change with age. Epinephrine injection should be increased by improving the awareness of physician and medical teams. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (approved number: IR.MUMS.REC.1393.960).",Arsenite-induced apoptosis can be attenuated via depletion of mTOR activity to restore autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713663,Toxicology research,2019 02 06,"Arsenic and its compounds are toxic environmental pollutants and known carcinogens. We investigated here the mechanism of arsenite-induced damage in renal cells. Treating human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) with sodium arsenite reduces cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The decline of cell viability is due to apoptotic death since arsenite treatment reduces Akt activity and the Bcl2 level but increases caspase 3 activity and the cytochrome c level. These effects can be reverted by the addition of an apoptosis inhibitor. PTEN, the upstream negative regulator of Akt activity, was also reduced with arsenite treatment. Noticeably, PTEN markedly increased in the insoluble fraction of the cells, suggesting a cell failure in removing the damaged proteins. Arsenite treatment activates a variety of signaling factors. Among them, ERK and JNK are associated with autophagy via regulating the levels of LC3 and p62. With arsenite administration, the LC3 and p62 levels increased. However, lysosomal activity was decreased and led to the decline of autophagic activity. The addition of rapamycin, the mTOR inhibitor, activated the autophagic pathway that accelerated the removal of damaged proteins. The recovery of autophagy increased the viability of arsenite-treated cells. Similar to rapamycin treatment, the knockdown of mTOR expression also enhanced the viability of arsenite-treated cells. Both rapamycin treatment and mTOR knockdown enhanced ERK activity further, but reduced JNK activity and the p62 level in arsenite-treated cells. Lysosomal activity increased with the depletion of mTOR, indicating an increase of autophagic activity. These results reveal the critical role of mTOR in regulating the cell fate of arsenite-exposed renal cells.","Diallyl sulfide treatment protects against acetaminophen-/carbon tetrachloride-induced acute liver injury by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713662,Toxicology research,2019 02 06,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of diallyl sulfide (DAS), an organosulfur compound extracted from garlic, on drug-induced or chemical-induced liver injury caused by acetaminophen (APAP) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in mice. DAS (100, 200, or 400 μmol kg-1) was orally administered 1 hour before APAP or CCl4 intraperitoneal injection, and the serum and liver tissue were collected 24 hours after APAP or CCl4 exposure. The serum aminotransferase activities and liver histopathological examination showed that DAS exhibited obvious hepatoprotective effects against acute liver injury induced by APAP or CCl4. In addition, exposure to APAP or CCl4 resulted in an increased content of malonaldehyde as well as a decreased ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione, and a decreased level of superoxide dismutase and catalase activity in the liver (p < 0.05); however, pretreatment with DAS restored the perturbations of the antioxidant system in the liver. Beyond that, DAS pretreatment reduced the APAP-/CCl4-induced increase in phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκBα) and p65 subunit of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus in the liver. DAS pretreatment also decreased the excessive level of TNF-α caused by APAP or CCl4 in serum (p < 0.05). Moreover, DAS pretreatment regulated the expression of cleaved caspase 3, Bax and Bcl-2 in the liver and suppressed APAP-/CCl4-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, DAS exhibits hepatoprotective effects against drug-induced and chemical-induced liver injuries induced by APAP or CCl4 in mice, probably due to its ability to reduce hepatic oxidative stress and inhibit inflammatory injury and hepatocyte apoptosis.",Effects of indoor coal fine particulate matter on the expression levels of inflammatory factors in ovalbumin-induced mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713661,Toxicology research,2019 02 06,"Objective: Cooking and heating with coal is the main source of household air pollution in acid rain-plagued areas of China and is a leading contributor to disease burden. In this study, we investigated the adverse effects of exposure to indoor fine particulate matter emission from coal combustion on the expression levels of inflammatory factors in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced mice. Methods: Forty BALB/c male mice were randomly divided into four groups (control group, PM2.5 group, OVA group, and OVA + PM2.5 group; n = 10) and treated with ovalbumin (OVA) or PM2.5, alone or together. Interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-7 (IL-7), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-17 (IL-17), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and interferon γ (IFN-γ) protein expression levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Additionally, serum immunoglobulin (Ig) IgE and IgG1 levels were measured. The mRNA expression levels of IL-7 and IFN-γ in pulmonary tissue were also analyzed. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), inflammatory cell counts, and histopathological examinations were also performed. Results: Exposure to PM2.5 + OVA induced abnormal pathological changes and inflammatory responses in lungs compared to the control. The levels of IL-4, IL-7, IL-8 and IL-17 in BALF from the OVA + PM2.5 group were higher than those in BALF from the control group, OVA group, and PM2.5 group (P < 0.05). PM2.5 plus OVA significantly raised the serum IgE and IgG1 levels compared with the control group. An increasing IL-7 mRNA trend was found among the treatment groups (P < 0.05). The expression level of IFN-γ mRNA was significantly higher in the control group than in the other 3 groups (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Indoor coal PM2.5 was sufficient by itself to cause inflammatory cellular infiltration of pulmonary tissue, leading to organelle injury and physiological structure change. Additionally, it promoted the occurrence and development of asthma by influencing the expression levels of IL-7 and various relevant inflammatory factors (such as IL-4 and IL-8) and changing the equilibrium between Treg and Th17 cells.",Reliability and relevance evaluations of REACH data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713660,Toxicology research,2019 02 06,"Regulatory authorities rely on hazard and risk assessments performed under REACH for identifying chemicals of concern and to take action. Therefore, these assessments must be systematic and transparent. This study investigates how registrants evaluate and report data evaluations under REACH and the procedures established by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to support these data evaluations. Data on the endpoint repeated dose toxicity were retrieved from the REACH registration database for 60 substances. An analysis of these data shows that the system for registrants to evaluate data and report these evaluations is neither systematic nor transparent. First, the current framework focuses on reliability, but overlooks the equally important aspect of relevance, as well as how reliability and relevance are combined for determining the adequacy of individual studies. Reliability and relevance aspects are also confused in the ECHA guidance for read-across. Second, justifications for reliability evaluations were mainly based on studies complying with GLP and test guidelines, following the Klimisch method. This may result in GLP and guideline studies being considered reliable by default and discounting non-GLP and non-test guideline data. Third, the reported rationales for reliability were frequently vague, confusing and lacking information necessary for transparency. Fourth, insufficient documentation of a study was sometimes used as a reason for judging data unreliable. Poor reporting merely affects the possibility to evaluate reliability and should be distinguished from methodological deficiencies. Consequently, ECHA is urged to improve the procedures and guidance for registrants to evaluate data under REACH to achieve systematic and transparent risk assessments.",Comparison of hepatotoxicity and mechanisms induced by triclosan (TCS) and methyl-triclosan (MTCS) in human liver hepatocellular HepG2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713659,Toxicology research,2019 02 06,"Triclosan (TCS) is used as an antimicrobial agent and has been widely dispersed and detected in the environment and organisms including human samples. Methyl-triclosan (MTCS) is the predominant bacterial TCS metabolite. At present, the toxicological effects and mechanism of TCS and MTCS are still not fully understood. In this study, the cytotoxic effects of TCS and MTCS in HepG2 cells were investigated in terms of cell proliferation, comet assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis. In addition, the expressions of related proteins were detected with western blotting analysis. The results showed that TCS could significantly inhibit cell proliferation, while MTCS had no obvious effect on cell growth. Both TCS and MTCS caused oxidative injury associated with HO-1 induction and increased DNA strand breaks, which consequently initiated the damage repair process via up-regulation of DNA-PKcs. In addition, TCS blocked the HepG2 cells in S and G2/M phases of cell cycle through down-regulation of cyclin A2 and CDK; while MTCS induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase through up-regulation of cyclin A2 and CDK. Furthermore, TCS activated p53 mediated apoptosis in HepG2 cells in a caspase-independent manner, while MTCS induced apoptosis was dependent on caspase. Moreover, TCS exposure exhibited more severe toxicity in HepG2 cells as compared with MTCS exposure, indicating that the replacement of the ionizable proton in TCS by the methyl group in MTCS is correlated with the cellular toxicity and the molecular mechanism.","Biocompatibility studies on cerium oxide nanoparticles - combined study for local effects, systemic toxicity and genotoxicity via implantation route.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713658,Toxicology research,2019 02 06,"An implantation study of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2-NP) combined with 28-day systemic toxicity and genotoxicity studies aligned to current regulatory standards was conducted. The results suggested that local tissue reactions caused by CeO2-NP was minimal (implantation irritation index of less than 3) and was better tolerated than most other implant materials tested in our laboratory. Furthermore, CeO2-NP showed virtually no systemic toxicity or in vivo micronucleus induction in bone marrow via implantation route. Chemical analysis showed that CeO2-NP migrated from the implant sites (250 mg per site) in low levels and was deposited predominantly in liver (191.8 ± 35.1 ng g-1 of tissue; P < 0.01), lungs (263.4 ± 30.9 ng g-1 of tissue; P < 0.001), spleen (211.2 ± 6.5 ng g-1 of tissue; P < 0.001) and kidneys (272.8 ± 20.4 ng g-1 of tissue; P < 0.001). These observations provide a base line biocompatibility and toxicity data on CeO2-NP. The current findings will also be useful in defining standards for nanoparticle containing biomaterials and devices.",Clusterin increases mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I activity and protects against hexavalent chromium-induced cytotoxicity in L-02 hepatocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713657,Toxicology research,2019 02 06,"Previous evidence revealed significant elevated liver cancer mortality in the areas where water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium [Cr(vi)], which highlighted that we should pay more attention to Cr(vi)-induced cytotoxicity in hepatocytes. We found that Clusterin (CLU) was up-regulated in Cr(vi)-exposed L-02 hepatocytes, but the role CLU played in Cr(vi)-induced cytotoxicity has never been explored. In the present study, we demonstrate Cr(vi) targeted mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (MRCC I) activity and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which caused mitochondrial damage that was characterized by the increase of permeability transition pore (PTP) open rate, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and Cytochrome C (Cyt C) from mitochondria to cytoplasm, which then induced cell viability loss and increased aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) leakage. We reveal that Cr(vi) may regulate CLU expression through the ROS-ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM)-insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis, and CLU expression was positively correlated to MRCC I activity. We further confirmed that CLU may regulate MRCC I activity via modulating its subunit nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 3 (NDUFS3) expression. By the establishment of CLU over-expression cells, we found that over-expression of CLU alleviated Cr(vi)-induced MRCC I inhibition and further rescued cell viability loss and reduced AST and ALT leakage. Thus, we reached the conclusion that the CLU-induced increase of MRCC I activity protected against Cr(vi)-induced cytotoxicity. The present research will provide new experimental evidence for thoroughly clarifying the cytotoxicity and the carcinogenic mechanism of Cr(vi)."

Here we demonstrate that MoS2-QDs exhibit a promising capability for the generation of reactive oxygen species, which leads to enhanced chemiluminescence. We discovered that the unique performance is due to hydroxyl radical activation increasing the active catalytic sites on molybdenum sulphide quantum dots (MoS2-QDs). The reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), superoxide radicals (˙O2-) and singlet oxygen (1O2) have been efficiently generated from H2O2 solution in alkaline conditions. In particular, the maximum ˙OH yield was enhanced significantly (9.18 times) compared to the Fe(ii)/H2O2 Fenton system under neutral conditions. These findings not only enrich our understanding of the fascinating performance of MoS2 QDs, but also provide a new pathway for ROS generation in all kinds of pH environment.","The effect of particle size, morphology and support on the formation of palladium hydride in commercial catalysts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713645,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"The relative amounts of hydrogen retained by a range of supported palladium catalysts have been investigated by a combination of electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, including incoherent inelastic neutron scattering. Contrary to expectation, the hydrogen capacity is not determined solely by the metal particle size, but it is a complex interaction between the particle size and its state of aggregation. The nature of the support is not only integral to the amount of hydrogen held by the catalyst, it also causes a marked difference in the rate of release of stored hydrogen from palladium. It is more difficult to fully dehydrogenate palladium on/in the porous activated carbon than on the non-porous carbon black based catalyst. The type of support also results in differences in the form of the residual hydrogen: whether it is α- or β-hydride phase, subsurface or in the threefold surface site. Our data on the supported catalysts reinforces what has only been seen previously with palladium black and our computational study provides confirmation of the empirical assignments. We also report the first vibrational spectroscopic study of hydrogen adsorbed at the surface of β-PdH and have observed for the first time hydrogen in the on-top site. This has enabled the relative proportion of bulk- to surface-H occupation in calculated model and in industrial nanoparticles to be estimated.",Carved nanoframes of cobalt-iron bimetal phosphide as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713644,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Water electrolysis for hydrogen production has long been regarded as an ideal tactic for renewable energy conversion and storage, but is impeded by the sluggish kinetics of both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, which are therefore in urgent need for high-performance but low-cost electrocatalysts. Herein, nanoframes of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) with the 3D framework carved open have been demonstrated as highly potent bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting, reaching the benchmark performance of the Pt/C‖RuO2 couple, and are much superior to their nanocubic counterparts. This excellent water splitting behavior can be attributed to the enlarged active surface area, less obstructed electrolyte infiltration, promoted charge transfer, and facilitated gas release. Further through in-depth activity analysis and post-electrocatalysis characterization, special attention has been paid to the fate and role of phosphorus in the electrocatalytic process, suggesting that despite the chemical instability of the TMPs (especially under OER conditions), excellent electrocatalytic stability can still be achieved through the amorphous bimetallic hydroxides/oxides formed in situ.",Reversibility and reactivity in an acid catalyzed cyclocondensation to give furanochromanes - a reaction at the 'oxonium-Prins' vs. 'ortho-quinone methide cycloaddition' mechanistic nexus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713643,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Herein we report a combined experimental and computational investigation of the acid catalyzed cyclocondensation reaction between styrenyl homoallylic alcohols and salicylaldehyde to form furanochromanes. We disclose a previously unreported isomerisation of the 'unnatural' trans-fused products to the diastereomeric 'natural' cis-fused congeners. Notwithstanding the appeal of assuming this corresponds to endo to exo isomerisation of Diels-Alder (D-A) adducts via concerted retro-cycloaddition/cycloaddition reactions of an in situ generated ortho-quinone methide with the styrenyl alkene, our combined Hammett/DFT study reveals a stepwise Prins-like process via discrete benzylic carbocation intermediates for all but the most electron deficient styrenes. As these reactions fortuitously lie at the intersection of these two mechanistic manifolds, it allows us to propose an experimentally determined indicative ρ+ value of ca. -3 as marking this nexus between a stepwise Prins-type pathway and a concerted cycloaddition reaction. This value should prove useful for categorising other reactions formally involving 'ortho-quinomethides', without the need for the extensive computation performed here. Logical optimisation of the reaction based upon the mechanistic insight led to the use of HFIP as an additive which enables exclusive formation of 'natural' cis-fused products with a ∼100-fold reaction rate increase and improved scope.",Structural control of polyelectrolyte/microemulsion droplet complexes (PEMECs) with different polyacrylates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713642,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"The ionic assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes (PESCs) is often done with the aim of constructing more functional colloids, for instance as advanced delivery systems. However, PESCs are often not easily loaded with a solubilisate due to intrinsic restrictions of such complexes. This question was addressed from a different starting point: by employing microemulsion droplets as heavily loaded surfactant systems and thereby avoiding potential solubilisation limitations from the beginning. We investigated mixtures of cationic oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsion droplets and oppositely charged sodium polyacrylate (NaPA) and determined structure and phase behaviour as a function of the mixing ratio for different droplet sizes and different Mw (NaPA). Around an equimolar charge ratio an extended precipitate region is present, which becomes wider for larger droplets and with increasing Mw of the NaPA. Static and dynamic light scattering (SLS and DLS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) show the formation of one-dimensional arrangements of microemulsion droplets for polyelectrolyte excess, which become more elongated with increasing Mw (NaPA) and less so with increasing NaPA excess. What is interesting is a marked sensitivity to ionic strength, where already a modest increase to ∼20 mM leads to a dissolution of the complexes. This work shows that polyelectrolyte/microemulsion complexes (PEMECs) are structurally very versatile hybrid systems, combining the high solubilisate loading of microemulsions with the larger-scale structuring induced by the polymer, thereby markedly extending the concept of conventional PESCs. This type of system has not been described before and is highly promising for future applications where high payloads are to be formulated.",Rational design of a super-contrast NIR-II fluorophore affords high-performance NIR-II molecular imaging guided microsurgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713641,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"In vivo molecular imaging in the ""transparent"" near-infrared II (NIR-II) window has demonstrated impressive benefits in reaching millimeter penetration depths with high specificity and imaging quality. Previous NIR-II molecular imaging generally relied on high hepatic uptake fluorophores with an unclear mechanism and antibody-derived conjugates, suffering from inevitable nonspecific retention in the main organs/skin with a relatively low signal-to-background ratio. It is still challenging to synthesize a NIR-II fluorophore with both high quantum yield and minimal liver-retention feature. Herein, we identified the structural design and excretion mechanism of novel NIR-II fluorophores for NIR-II molecular imaging with an extremely clean background. With the optimized renally excreted fluorophore-peptide conjugates, superior NIR-II targeting imaging was accompanied by the improved signal-to-background ratio during tumor detection with reducing off-target tissue exposure. An unprecedented NIR-II imaging-guided microsurgery was achieved using such an imaging platform, which provides us with a great preclinical example to accelerate the potential clinical translation of NIR-II imaging.",A cell membrane-anchored fluorescent probe for monitoring carbon monoxide release from living cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713640,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Carbon monoxide (CO) acts as an important gasotransmitter in delivering intramolecular and intermolecular signals to regulate a variety of physiological processes. This lipid-soluble gas can freely pass through the cell membrane and then diffuse to adjacent cells acting as a messenger. Although many fluorescent probes have been reported to detect intracellular CO, it is still a challenge to visualize the release behavior of endogenous CO. The main obstacle is the lack of a probe that can anchor onto the cell membrane while having the ability to image CO in real time. In this work, by grafting a polar head onto a long and linear hydrophobic Nile Red molecule, a cell membrane-anchored fluorophore ANR was developed. This design strategy of a cell membrane-anchored probe is simpler than the traditional one of using a long hydrophobic alkyl chain as a membrane-anchoring group, and endows the probe with better water solubility. ANR could rapidly bind to the cell membrane (within 1 min) and displayed a long retention time. ANR was then converted to a CO-responsive fluorescent probe (ANRP) by complexation with palladium based on a metal palladium-catalyzed reaction. ANRP exhibited a fast response to CO with a 25-fold fluorescence enhancement in vitro. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.23 μM, indicating that ANRP is sensitive enough to image endogenous CO. Notably, ANRP showed excellent cell membrane-anchoring ability. With ANRP, the release of CO from HepG2 cells under LPS- and heme-stimulated conditions was visualized and the cell self-protection effect during a drug-induced hepatotoxicity process was also studied. Moreover, ANRP was successfully applied to the detection of intracellular CO in several cell lines and tissues, and the results demonstrated that the liver is the main organ for CO production, and that cancer cells release more CO from their cells than normal cells. ANRP is the first membrane-anchored CO fluorescent probe that has the ability to reveal the relationship between CO release and diseases. It also has prospects for the studying of intercellular signaling functions of CO.",Streptavidin interfacing as a general strategy to localize fluorescent membrane tension probes in cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713639,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"To image the mechanical properties of biological membranes, twisted push-pull mechanophores that respond to membrane tension by planarization in the ground state have been introduced recently. For their application in biological systems, these so-called fluorescent flippers will have to be localized to specific environments of cellular membranes. In this report, we explore streptavidin as a versatile connector between biotinylated flipper probes and biotinylated targets. Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy with LUVs and GUVs reveal the specific conditions needed for desthiobiotin-loaded streptavidin to deliver biotinylated flippers selectively to biotinylated membranes. Selectivity for biotinylated plasma membranes is also observed in HeLa cells, confirming the compatibility of this strategy with biological systems. Streptavidin interfacing does not affect the mechanosensitivity of the flipper probes, red shift in the excitation maximum and fluorescence lifetime increase with membrane order and tension, as demonstrated, inter alia, using FLIM.",Highly efficient gene release in spatiotemporal precision approached by light and pH dual responsive copolymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713638,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Triblock copolymer of poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-b-poly(pyrenylmethyl methacrylate) (PEG-b-PDMAEMA-b-PPy) has been developed for use as an ideal gene delivery system, which showed both high stability under physiological conditions and efficient gene release in a mimetic cancer environment. The siRNA release from this system without external stimulation was 16% in 1 h and then remained steady. However, the photo-triggered siRNA release was 78% within 1 h and was higher than 91% after 24 h. The remarkable contrast between the stability and release efficiency of these siRNA-condensed micelleplexes before and after photo-irradiation has been rationalized by the light- and pH-induced structural transitions of the triblock copolymer micelles. The negligible cytotoxicity, high cellular uptake efficiency, and remarkable knockdown efficiency shown in in vitro tests further revealed the promising potential of these triblock copolymer micelleplexes for use in stimuli-responsive gene therapy.",Penetration depth tunable BODIPY derivatives for pH triggered enhanced photothermal/photodynamic synergistic therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713637,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Improving the deep-tissue phototherapy (PDT) efficiency in the near-infrared (NIR) region has become one of the major challenges in clinics for cancer treatment. Developing intelligent photosensitizers (PSs) responding to tumor-specific signals sensitively to minimize side effects is another major challenge for tumor phototherapy. Herein, three phenyl-based boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) compounds with different numbers of diethylaminophenyl groups introduced onto the BODIPY core have been designed and synthesized by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The absorbance of these compounds (BDPmPh, BDPbiPh, and BDPtriPh) can be controlled easily for realizing the tunable penetration depth. Moreover, the diethylamino groups in these designed PSs can serve as proton acceptors triggered by the low pH in lysosomes which can enhance the efficacy of photodynamic and photothermal therapy. The corresponding nanoparticles (NPs) of the compounds are prepared through a nanoprecipitation method and in vitro studies demonstrate that the ultra-low drug dosage of BDPtriPh NPs (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 = 4.16 μM) is much lower than that of BDPmPh NPs (50.09 μM) and BDPbiPh NPs (22.4 μM). In vivo fluorescence imaging shows that these NPs can be passively targeted to tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and BDPtriPh NPs exhibit the fastest accumulation (about 4 hours). In vivo phototherapy indicates that BDPtriPh NPs with the longest NIR absorbance (813 nm) and highest photothermal conversion efficiency (60.5%) can effectively inhibit tumor growth and reduce side effects to normal tissues. This study provides a strategy to modulate the photoconversion characteristics of PSs for both penetration-depth-tunable and pH-dependent PDT/PTT synergistic cancer therapy in clinics."

When most MOFs are exposed to water or humid air, the MOF structure, in particular at the surface, is destroyed, creating surface defects. These surface defects are surface barriers which tremendously hinder the uptake and release of guest molecules and, thus, massively decrease the performance in any application of MOFs. Here, the destruction by exposure to water vapor is investigated by using well-defined MOF films of type HKUST-1 as a model system for uptake experiments with different-sized probe molecules as well as for spectroscopic investigations, complemented by density functional theory calculations of the defect structure. In addition to the characterization of the surface defects, it is found that the pristine MOF structure can be regenerated. We show that the surface defects can be dissolved by exposure to the synthesis solvent, here ethanol, enabling fast uptake and release of guest molecules. These findings show that the storage of MOF materials in a synthesis solvent results in healing of surface defects and enables ideal performance of MOF materials.",Aromatic secondary amine-functionalized fluorescent NO probes: improved detection sensitivity for NO and potential applications in cancer immunotherapy studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713625,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), constituting up to 50% of the solid tumor mass and commonly having a pro-tumoral M2 phenotype, are closely associated with decreased survival in patients. Based on the highly dynamic properties of macrophages, in recent years the repolarization of TAMs from pro-tumoral M2 phenotype to anti-tumoral M1 phenotype by various strategies has emerged as a promising cancer immunotherapy approach for improving cancer therapy. Herein, we present an aromatic secondary amine-functionalized Bodipy dye 1 and its mitochondria-targetable derivative Mito1 as fluorescent NO probes for discriminating M1 macrophages from M2 macrophages in terms of their difference in inducible NO synthase (iNOS) levels. The two probes possess the unique ability to simultaneously respond to two secondary oxides of NO, i.e., N2O3 and ONOO-, thus being more sensitive and reliable for reflecting intracellular NO than most of the existing fluorescent NO probes that usually respond to N2O3 only. With 1 as a representative, the discrimination between M1 and M2 macrophages, evaluation of the repolarization of TAMs from pro-tumoral M2 phenotype to anti-tumoral M1 phenotype, and visualization of NO communication during the immune-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells by M1 macrophages have been realized. These results indicate that our probes should hold great potential for imaging applications in cancer immunotherapy studies and relevant anti-cancer drug screening.",The biosynthetic implications of late-stage condensation domain selectivity during glycopeptide antibiotic biosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713624,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Non-ribosomal peptide synthesis is a highly important biosynthetic pathway for the formation of many secondary metabolites of medical relevance. Due to the challenges associated with the chemical synthesis of many of the products of these assembly lines, understanding the activity and selectivity of non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) machineries is an essential step towards the redesign of such machineries to produce new bioactive peptides. Whilst the selectivity of the adenylation domains responsible for amino acid activation during NRPS synthesis has been widely studied, the selectivity of the essential peptide bond forming domains - known as condensation domains - is not well understood. Here, we present the results of a combination of in vitro and in vivo investigations into the final condensation domain from the NRPS machinery that produces the glycopeptide antibiotics (GPAs). Our results show that this condensation domain is tolerant for a range of peptide substrates and even those with unnatural stereochemistry of the peptide C-terminus, which is in contrast to the widely ascribed role of these domains as a stereochemical gatekeeper during NRPS synthesis. Furthermore, we show that this condensation domain has a significant preference for linear peptide substrates over crosslinked peptides, which indicates that the GPA crosslinking cascade targets the heptapeptide bound to the final module of the NRPS machinery and reinforces the role of the unique GPA X-domain in this process. Finally, we demonstrate that the peptide bond forming activity of this condensation domain is coupled to the rate of amino acid activation performed by the subsequent adenylation domain. This is a significant result with implications for NRPS redesign, as it indicates that the rate of amino acid activation of modified adenylation domains must be maintained to prevent unwanted peptide hydrolysis from the NRPS due to a loss of the productive coupling of amino acid selection and peptide bond formation. Taken together, our results indicate that assessing condensation domain activity is a vital step in not only understanding the biosynthetic logic and timing of NRPS-mediated peptide assembly, but also the rules which redesign efforts must obey in order to successfully produce functional, modified NRPS assembly lines.",Direct observation of the intermediate in an ultrafast isomerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713623,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"Using a combination of two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) and variable temperature Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies the rapid structural isomerization of a five-coordinate ruthenium complex is investigated.

The trigonal bipyramidal complex was found to be an intermediate, with an activation barrier of 2.2 (0.2) kcal mol-1 and 2.4 (0.2) kcal mol-1 relative to the equatorial and apical square pyramidal isomers respectively. This study provides direct validation of the mechanism of Berry pseudorotation - the pairwise exchange of ligands in a five-coordinate complex - a process that was first described over fifty years ago. This study also clearly demonstrates that the rate of pseudorotation approaches the frequency of molecular vibrations.",Photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution from integrated photocatalysts adsorbed on NiO.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713622,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"A new approach to increasing the faradaic efficiency of dye-sensitised photocathodes for H2 evolution from water, using integrated photocatalysts, furnished with ester groups on the peripheral ligands, [Ru(decb)2(bpt)PdCl(H2O)](PF6)2 (1) and [Ru(decb)2(2,5-bpp)PtI(CH3CN)](PF6)2 (2), (decb = 4,4'-diethylcarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine, bpp = 2,2':5',2''-terpyridine, bpt = 3,5-bis(2-pyridyl)-1,2,4-triazole) is described. Overall, 1|NiO is superior to previously reported photocathodes, producing photocurrent densities of 30-35 μA cm-2 at an applied bias of -0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl over 1 hour of continuous white light irradiation, resulting in the generation of 0.41 μmol h-1 cm-2 of H2 with faradaic efficiencies of up to 90%. Furthermore, surface analysis of the photocathodes before and after photoelectrocatalysis revealed that the ruthenium bipyridyl chromophore and Pd catalytic centre (1) were photochemically stable, highlighting the benefits of the approach towards robust, hybrid solar-to-fuel devices.",Multiple adaptation of constitutional dynamic networks and information storage in constitutional distributions of acylhydrazones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713621,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"We report a study of the behavior of four dynamic covalent libraries (DCLs) based on acylhydrazones aAbB and of the corresponding square constitutional dynamic networks (CDNs) NA-ND under the effect of three agents, namely, metal cations, base + metal cations and light irradiation; in particular, the successful switching of the CDN NB between two orthogonal distributions results, respectively, from metallo-selection and photo-selection. The four DCLs undergo triple adaptation when subjected to the three agents with the generation of specific CDN distributions characteristic of each of the four DCLs. The ternary outputs displayed by the DCLs present three states (-1, 0 and 1) related to three different constitutional distributions expressed in response to the triple inputs applied. This latter process amounts to the storage of molecular information in dynamic distributions rather than in selective interactions between complementary entities undergoing molecular recognition.",Mechanistic investigation into the C(sp3)-H acetoxylation of morpholinones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713620,Chemical science,2019 02 06,"The study of a selective palladium(ii)-catalyzed C(sp3)-H acetoxylation reaction on a class of cyclic alkyl amines is reported. Computational modelling and kinetic studies were used to provide support for a mechanism involving selective C-O bond formation from a γ-aminoalkyl-Pd(iv) intermediate. The C-O bond forming step was computed to occur by a dissociative ionization mechanism followed by an SN2 process involving external acetate attack at the C-Pd(iv) bond. This pathway was computed to be of lowest energy with no competing C-N products observed. Additionally, with a few modifications to reaction conditions, preliminary studies showed that this process could be rendered enantioselective in the presence of a non-racemic BINOL-phosphoric acid.","Isolation and characterization of mycoflora of chicken hatcheries in Mazandaran province, north of Iran.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713618,Veterinary research forum : an international quarterly journal,2019 02 06,"Fungal infections cause significant economic losses in the poultry industry either due to their direct infectious nature or due to mycotoxins production. Hatchery contamination with fungi can threaten chicken health. In this regard, geographical and seasonal distributions of airborne fungal contamination of 25 hatcheries in Mazandaran province, northern Iran, were investigated using an open plate method. The results of this study showed that hatcheries have various fungal contaminations, among which the most common were respectively Cladosporium (31.07%), Penicillium (24.00%), Aspergillus (20.63%), sterile hyphae (14.70%) and Alternaria (6.20%) from different regions. The results revealed that the highest level of fungal isolation was in spring and autumn. This study also showed that the concentration of fungal air spora in forest and seaside locations was significantly greater than mountainous ones. In spite of the regular disinfection in commercial hatcheries, fungal contamination was found in different parts.","First molecular report of Hydatigera krepkogorski (Schulz and Landa, 1934) in abdominal cavity of gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) in Iran.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713617,Veterinary research forum : an international quarterly journal,2019 02 06,"A polycephalic larva of Taeniidae family isolated from abdominal cavity of a great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) from Golestan province, northern Iran, was subjected to molecular analysis.

This fruit is also used as a food additive (flavoring and colorant) in soup and rice dishes. In present study, antioxidant activities of acetone, ethanol and water (infusion and decoction) extracts of barberry (Berberis vulgaris) fruit were investigated using 2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and reducing power methods. Total phenolic contents of the extracts were also estimated using Folin-Ciocalteu assay. In ABTS assay, acetone and ethanol extracts showed the highest radical scavenging activity, while in DPPH and reducing power methods, acetone extract and decoction exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity. Meanwhile, the antioxidant potential of water extracts increased with increasing heating time (antioxidant activity of decoction was higher than that of infusion). The highest total phenolic content was found in the acetone extract (92.75 mg GAE per g). It was concluded that the acetone extract and decoction of barberry fruit can be used as an effective natural antioxidant in food industry."

This comprehensive literature review of the topic suggests a trend towards an increasing incidence of breast cancer in the HIV-infected population, and the rationale for such a tendency is hypothesized, especially in the context of the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Besides the age at diagnosis, all other clinical characteristics appear to be similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative breast cancer populations. Outcomes of the different treatment modalities for breast cancer in HIV-positive patients are also appraised and finally innovative areas of future research are suggested along with plausible recommendations.",Prospective clinical trial of 12-fraction carbon-ion radiotherapy for primary renal cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713604,Oncotarget,2019 02 06,"The aims of this study were to clarify the safety and efficacy of 12-fraction carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and to confirm the recommended dose in a prospective clinical trial. This clinical trial was planned as a non-randomized, open-label, single-center phase I/II study of CIRT monotherapy. The incidence of acute adverse events was the primary endpoint. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were defined as grade ≥3 skin, gastrointestinal tract, or urologic adverse events. Based on the eligibility criteria, 8 patients with primary RCC, including 3 medically inoperable patients and 5 patients with tumors >4 cm, were enrolled. Of the 8 patients, 5 were treated with 66 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]), and subsequently, the dose was escalated to 72 Gy (RBE) for the remaining 3 patients. The median follow-up time was 43.1 months. No DLTs were observed at any dose level though the end of follow-up. Although 1 patient died of pneumonia 3 months after CIRT, which was determined to be unrelated to CIRT, no grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed, and both local control and cancer-specific survival rates were 100%. In conclusion, the safety and efficacy of CIRT hypofractionation using 12-fractions for the treatment of eligible RCC patients, including those with inoperable or tumor size >4 cm, were confirmed in this prospective trial, and a recommended dose of 72 Gy (RBE) was established.",Role of long non-coding RNAs in disease progression of early stage unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713603,Oncotarget,2019 02 07,"Predicting disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains challenging particularly in patients with Rai Stage 0/I disease that have an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (UM IGHV). Even though patients with UM IGHV have a poor prognosis and generally require earlier treatment, not all UM IGHV patients experience more rapid disease progression with some remaining treatment free for many years. This observation suggests biologic characteristics other than known prognostic factors influence disease progression. Alterations in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression levels have been implicated in diagnosis and prognosis of various cancers, however, their role in disease progression of early Rai stage UM CLL is unknown. Here we use microarray analysis to compare lncRNA and mRNA profiles of Rai 0/I UM IGHV patients who progressed in <2 years relative to patients who had not progressed for >5 years. Over 1,300 lncRNAs and 940 mRNAs were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2.0; p-value ≤ 0.05). Of interest, the differentially expressed lncRNAs T204050, NR_002947, and uc.436+, have known associated genes that have been linked to CLL. Thus, our study reveals differentially expressed lncRNAs in progressive early stage CLL requiring therapy versus indolent early Rai stage UM CLL. These lncRNAs have the potential to impact relevant biological processes and pathways that influence clinical outcome in CLL.",Role of miRNA in the regulation of cannabidiol-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713602,Oncotarget,2019 02 07,"Neuroblastoma (NBL) is one of the most common childhood cancers that originate from the immature nerve cells of the sympathetic system. Studies with NBL cancers have also shown that miRNAs are dysregulated and may play a critical role in pathogenesis. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive compound found in marijuana which has been previously shown by our laboratory and others to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, there are no studies reported to test if CBD mediates these effects through regulation of miRNA. In the current study, therefore, we investigated if CBD induces apoptosis in human NBL cell lines, SH SY5Y and IMR-32, and if it is regulated by miRNA. Our data demonstrated that CBD induces apoptosis in NBL cells through activation of serotonin and vanilloid receptors. We also found that caspase-2 and -3 played an important role in the induction of apoptosis. CBD also significantly reduced NBL cell migration and invasion in vitro. Furthermore, CBD blocked mitochondrial respiration and caused a shift in metabolism towards glycolysis. CBD altered the expression of miRNA specifically, down-regulating hsa-let-7a and upregulating hsa-mir-1972. Downregulation of let-7a increased expression of target caspase-3, and growth arrest specific-7 (GAS-7) genes. Upregulation of hsa-mir-1972 caused decreased expression of BCL2L1 and SIRT2 genes. Together, our studies suggest that CBD-mediated apoptosis in NBL cells is regulated by miRNA.",FGFR1β is a driver isoform of FGFR1 alternative splicing in breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713601,Oncotarget,2019 02 07,"Abnormal FGFR1 alternative splicing is correlated with tumorigenicity and poor prognosis in several tumor types. We sought to determine the roles of FGFR1α and FGFR1β variants in breast cancer. TCGA samples and cell lines were analyzed for FGFR1α/FGFR1β expression. MCF-10A cells were used to overexpress these variants. Cell growth and transformation were assessed by SRB, colony formation, 3D-Matrigel, soft agar, cell motility assays. In TCGA, compared to FGFR1 non-amplified samples, FGFR1-amplified samples had significantly higher FGFR1α but not FGFR1β levels. FGFR1β expression levels and FGFR1β/FGFR1α ratio were higher in basal subtype samples than in ER-positive/luminal samples in both TCGA and breast cancer cell lines. Both FGFR1α and FGFR1β induced transformation of MCF-10A cells. However, only FGFR1β-expressing cells, not FGFR1α, enhanced cell growth and cell motility. Cells with higher FGFR1β levels and FGFR1β/FGFR1α ratio were more sensitive to FGFR inhibitor BGJ-398. Interestingly, in ER-negative cells, FGFR inhibitors decreased FGFR1β levels, likely by increasing expression of splicing repressor PTBP1. In ER-positive cells, estrogen treatment increased FGFR1β levels by decreasing PTBP1 expression, which was blocked by 4-OHT. Lastly, combination treatment with BGJ-398 and 4-OHT synergistically inhibited cell survival. These findings suggest that FGFR1 alternative FGFR1α/FGFR1β splicing plays an important role in breast cancer.","Clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes and potential novel therapeutic options for patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713600,Oncotarget,2019 02 06,"Neuroendocrine carcinomas of the prostate (NEPCs) are rare tumors with poor prognosis.

For this, mixed solutions of nonionic tetraethyleneglycol-monodecylether (C10E4) and cationic hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TAB) surfactants were investigated using SFG spectroscopy and a thin-film pressure balance (TFPB). Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek analysis of disjoining pressure isotherms obtained with the TFPB technique provides complementary information on ϕ0, which we apply to validate the results from SFG spectroscopy. By using a single ϕ0 value, we can disentangle χ(2) and χ(3) contributions to the O-H stretching modes of interfacial water molecules in the SFG spectra. Having established the latter, we show that unknown double-layer potentials at the liquid-gas interface from solutions with different C16TAB/C10E4 mixing ratios can be obtained from an analysis of SFG spectra and are in excellent agreement with the complementary results from the TFPB technique.",Ligand Migration from Cluster to Support: A Crucial Factor for Catalysis by Thiolate-protected Gold Clusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713589,ChemCatChem,2019 02 06,"Thiolate protected metal clusters are valuable precursors for the design of tailored nanosized catalysts. Their performance can be tuned precisely at atomic level, e. g. by the configuration/type of ligands or by partial/complete removal of the ligand shell through controlled pre-treatment steps. However, the interaction between the ligand shell and the oxide support, as well as ligand removal by oxidative pre-treatment, are still poorly understood. Typically, it was assumed that the thiolate ligands are simply converted into SO2, CO2 and H2O. Herein, we report the first detailed observation of sulfur ligand migration from Au to the oxide support upon deposition and oxidative pre-treatment, employing mainly S K-edge XANES. Consequently, thiolate ligand migration not only produces clean Au cluster surfaces but also the surrounding oxide support is modified by sulfur-containing species, with pronounced effects on catalytic properties."

Renal fibrosis is a common characteristic of progressive chronic kidney diseases (CKD). The formation of renal fibrosis is caused by kidney trauma, infection, and immune response. The pathophysiological mechanism of renal fibrosis was mainly due to increased collagen synthesis in the kidney, decreased degradation, and a large amount of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. The purpose of this study was intended to evaluate the effect of Kangxianling decoction on expression of TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway in renal fibrosis rats. 50 specific pathogen-free Sprague Dawley (SPF SD) rats were randomly divided into five groups: control group, sham group, 5/6 nephrectomy model group, 5/6 nephrectomy model plus KXL decoction (21g /kg) group, and 5/6 nephrectomy model plus Losartan Potassium (LP) (33.3 g/kg) group. The rats were all sacrificed after two months and the left kidney tissue was sampled. HE staining was used to observe the renal pathological changes and the score of kidney damage was made. Masson staining was used to observe the degree of renal fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining, western blot, and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression levels of related molecules in TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. The results suggested that KXL could lighten renal histopathology damage, downregulate the expression of TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1), Smad2/3, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor), Collagen I, and Collagen III, and upregulate the expression level of Smad7.",Shuang-Huang-Lian Attenuates Airway Hyperresponsiveness and Inflammation in a Shrimp Protein-Induced Murine Asthma Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713573,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 06,"Shuang-Huang-Lian (SHL), an herbal formula of traditional Chinese medicine, is clinically used for bronchial asthma treatment. Our previous study found that SHL prevented basophil activation to suppress Th2 immunity and stabilized mast cells through activating its mitochondrial calcium uniporter. Sporadic clinical reports that SHL was used for the treatment of bronchial asthma can be found. Thus, in this study, we systematically investigated the effects of SHL on asthmatic responses using a shrimp protein (SP)- induced mouse model. SHL significantly inhibited airway inspiratory and expiratory resistance, and histological studies suggested it reduced thickness of airway smooth muscle and infiltration of inflammation cells. It also could alleviate eosinophilic airway inflammation (EAI), including reducing the number of eosinophils and decreasing eotaxin and eosinophil peroxidase levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Further studies indicated that SHL suppressed SP-elevated mouse mast cell protease-1 and IgE levels, prevented Th2 differentiation in mediastinal lymph nodes, and lowered Th2 cytokine (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) production in BALF. In conclusion, SHL attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness and EAI mainly via the inhibition of mast cell activation and Th2 immunity, which may help to elucidate the underlying mechanism of SHL on asthma treatment and support its clinical use.",Ginsenoside Re Improves Isoproterenol-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis and Heart Failure in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713572,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 06,"Objective. Panax ginseng is used widely for treatment of cardiovascular disorders in China. Ginsenoside Re is the main chemical component of P. ginseng. We aimed to investigate the protective effect of ginsenoside Re on isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis and heart failure in rats. Methods. A model of myocardial fibrosis and heart failure was established by once-daily subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (5 mg/kg/day) to rats for 7 days. Simultaneously, rats were orally administrated ginsenoside Re (5 or 20 mg/kg) or vehicle daily for 4 weeks. Results. Isoproterenol enhanced the heart weight, myocardial fibrosis, and hydroxyproline content in rat hearts. Ginsenoside Re inhibited (at least in part) the isoproterenol-induced increase in heart weight, myocardial fibrosis, and hydroxyproline content. Compared with the isoproterenol group, treatment with ginsenoside Re ameliorated changes in left ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and the positive and negative maximal values of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure. Ginsenoside Re administration also resulted in decreased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 in serum and decreased expression of Smad3 and collagen I in heart tissue. Conclusion. Ginsenoside Re can improve isoproterenol-induced myocardial fibrosis and heart failure by regulation of the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway.",Water Extract of Acori Graminei Rhizoma Attenuates Features of Rheumatoid Arthritis in DBA/1 Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713571,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 06,"The dry rhizome of Acorus gramineus Solander, known as Acori Graminei Rhizoma, is used to treat dementia, stroke, eczema, and indigestion in traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Korean medicine, and traditional Japanese Kampo medicine.

Male DBA/1 mice were separated into five groups (NOR; n=10, CON; n=10, CIA + methotrexate (MTX); n=10, CIA + 100 mg/kg WAG; n=10, CIA + 500 mg/kg WAG; n=10). CIA was induced by injecting the mice with bovine type II collagen, after which the mice were treated with WAG and/or MTX. Hematological parameters and liver and kidney serum toxicity markers were analyzed. Further, serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, and type II collagen IgG were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment with 500 mg/kg WAG decreased serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and collagen IgG in a CIA model. Moreover, WAG treatment decreased CIA-induced swelling of mouse hind legs, infiltration of inflammatory cells into the synovial membrane, and blood neutrophil levels. WAG administration did not influence hematological parameters or kidneys and liver toxicity markers. WAG may be used to treat arthritis by reducing the inflammation indicators. However, further experiments are required to determine how WAG affects inflammation mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.",Yangyin Qingre Huoxue Method in Traditional Chinese Medicine Ameliorates Atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- Mice Suffering from High-Fat Diet and HSP65 Aggression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713570,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 06,"Atherosclerosis (AS) is a complicated arterial disease resulting from abnormal lipid deposition and inflammatory injury, which is attributed to Yin deficiency, accumulation of heat materials, and stasis of blood flow in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory. Thus, according to TCM theory, the method of nourishing Yin (Yangyin), clearing away heat (Qingre), and promoting blood circulation (Huoxue) is a reasonable strategy, which has achieved remarkable clinical efficacy in the treatment of AS, but the mechanisms remain to be known. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Yangyin Qingre Huoxue Prescription (YQHP) on AS in ApoE-/- mice suffering from a high-fat diet and heat shock protein (HSP65) attack. YQHP regulated levels of blood lipids and inflammation-linked cytokines as well as Th17/Treg ratio in peripheral blood. Suppressed IL-6-p-STAT3 signaling and restored IL-2-p-STAT5 signaling in the presence of YQHP may partake in the regulation of Th17 and Treg differentiation. Moreover, YQHP modulated transcriptional levels of costimulator CD80 in aortas as well corresponding to the downregulation of GM-CSF in serum and CD3 expression in CD4+ T cells, which might indicate the potential of YQHP to regulate antigen presenting cells. All these effects eventually promoted the improvement of atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, YQHP promoted less monocyte infiltration in the liver and lower levels of AST, ALT, and AKP production than simvastatin. Conclusively, lipid-regulating and anti-inflammatory functions mediated by YQHP with lower hepatotoxicity than simvastatin hindered the progression of HSP65 aggravated AS in ApoE-/- mice, indicating the effectiveness of Yangyin Qingre Huoxue Method in the treatment of AS.",Hypoglycemic Activity of Medicinal Plants Used among the Cakchiquels in Guatemala for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713569,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 06,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major health problem worldwide. In this condition, the organism can produce insulin but becomes resistant to it; thus the insulin is ineffective. High blood glucose levels are a result of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency; they produce diabetes-associated complications such as kidney failure, blindness, cardiovascular disease, and lower-limb amputation. In Guatemala, there were over 752.700 cases of the disease in 2017 with prevalence of 8.4 (IDF, 2017). The use of plants for medicinal purposes has been practiced in the country since pre-Hispanic times. Among the Cakchiquels, the aerial parts of Hamelia patens Jacq., Neurolaena lobata (L.) R.Br. ex Cass., and Solanum americanum Mill. and the cortex of Croton guatemalensis Lotsy are used to treat type 2 diabetes. The aim of the present study was to confirm the hypoglycemic effect of the plants under normal conditions and under maltose and sucrose tolerance tests, as well as to test the activity of the plant extracts in vitro against alpha-glucosidases types I and II. In agreement with the traditional usage of the plants, in normal conditions without a sugar load, the extracts produced a statistically significant hypoglycemic effect similar to the control drug glibenclamide. When the sugar load was maltose, only Croton and Solanum produced a statistically significant (p < 0.05) hypoglycemic effect compared to the control drug, but when the sugar was sucrose, Croton and Hamelia produced a statistically significant effect (p < 0.05) beginning at 30 min compared to the control group, while Solanum did so at 60 min and Neurolaena at 90 min. In vitro assays showed that the extracts inhibited yeast alpha-glucosidases but not the rat intestinal ones. Of the tested plants, Croton exert an effect both under sugars' tests and under a normal tolerance test; these results suggest the potential use of this plant. The results presented here provided evidence based on the use of these plants as hypoglycemic agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",Brown and Red Seaweeds Serve as Potential Efflux Pump Inhibitors for Drug-Resistant Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713568,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 06,"Multidrug-resistant pathogens are a significant clinical problem. Efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) can restore the activities of existing antibiotics by interfering with drug efflux pumps located in bacterial cell membranes. Seaweeds are important sources of biologically active metabolites of natural origin; however, their potential as EPIs remains uninvestigated. Here, functional extracts from the brown seaweeds Laminaria japonica and Sargassum horneri and the red seaweeds Gracilaria sp. and Porphyra dentata were evaluated as potential EPIs against drug-resistant Escherichia coli. All these extracts were found to potentiate the activities of drugs in modulation tests, although not to the same extent. Synergistic effects of the extracts and the drug clarithromycin were observed from the onset of Time-kill assays, with no evidence of bacterial regrowth. Ethidium bromide accumulation studies revealed that the efflux decreased in the presence of each extract, as indicated by the presence of EPIs. Most identified EPIs that have been discovered to date have aromatic structures, and the seaweed extracts were found to contain various terpenes, terpenoids, phenolic compounds, indoles, pyrrole derivatives, alkaloids, and halogenated aromatic compounds. Our study highlights the potential of these compounds of the seaweeds as drug EPIs.",Manual Acupuncture for Optic Atrophy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713567,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 06,"Objectives. This systematic review aims to critically evaluate the efficacy of manual acupuncture for optic atrophy. Eight English and Chinese databases, including Cochrane Library, EMbase, PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP), and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), as well as ongoing trials registered with the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, were searched to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying manual acupuncture for optic atrophy compared to medication alone. The quality of evidence was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.3. Nine studies were identified and included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed significant differences in favor of manual acupuncture or manual acupuncture plus medication compared with medication alone in the following outcome measures: visual acuity (MD = 0.18, 95% CI [0.17, 0.20], P < 0.00001), mean sensitivity of visual field (MD = 2.11, 95% CI [1.90, 2.32], P < 0.00001), the latent period of P-VEP100 (MD = -6.80, 95% CI [-8.94, -4.66], P < 0.00001), the total effectiveness (264 eyes) (OR = 3.22, 95% CI [1.88, 5.51], P<0.0001), and the total effectiveness (344 participants) (OR = 4.29, 95% CI [2.56, 7.19], P < 0.00001). Despite statistical advantages of manual acupuncture in the literature, due to serious methodological flaws in study design, it cannot be concluded that manual acupuncture is more effective than medicine alone. It is essential that a properly controlled clinical trial is designed and controls are established to exclude placebo effects."

Nevertheless, the effect of the subboiling parameters on the purity of the distilled acids has never been methodically investigated. Aim of the present research is a systematic evaluation of the subboiling distillation protocol for the production of pure hydrochloric and nitric acid. In particular, the effect of the subboiling temperature and the number of subsequent distillations was investigated as these parameters were recognised as the most important factors controlling acid purity, acid concentration, and distillation yield. The concentration of twenty elements in the purified acids was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. As a result, the subboiling temperature (up to 82°C) and the number of subsequent distillations (up to four) were demonstrated not to affect the purity of the distilled nitric and hydrochloric acids. Under normal laboratory conditions, the residual elemental concentrations were in most cases below 10 ng/L in both nitric (2.75% w/w) and hydrochloric (0.1 M) blanks. Ultrapure nitric and hydrochloric acids could accordingly be produced under the most favorable conditions, i.e., the highest temperature and one distillation process only.",A Community-Based Assessment of Knowledge and Practice of Breast Self-Examination and Prevalence of Breast Disease in Southwest Cameroon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713554,Journal of cancer epidemiology,2019 02 06,"Despite the rising trend in breast cancer incidence and mortality across Sub-Saharan Africa, there remains a critical knowledge gap about the burden and patterns of breast disease and breast cancer screening practices at the population level.

Overutilization of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) both in ambulatory care and in the inpatient setting possesses economic implications and increases the risk for adverse drug reactions. This study was undertaken to identify factors associated with inappropriate PPI use among consecutively unplanned admissions of elderly patients at the time of admission. Materials and Methods. In 758 patients (54.2% women), mean age 80.3±8.0 (M±1SD), demographic characteristics, and medical and medication history were recorded. Parametric tests and multiple logistic regression analysis were applied to identify the predictors of inappropriate PPI use. Results. 232 patients (30.6%) were receiving PPIs. 37 (4.9%) were receiving PPIs appropriately and 195 (25.7%) were receiving PPIs without a proper indication. Consequently, PPIs prescribing was inappropriate in 195/232 (84%). Moreover, 512 patients (67.5%) were not receiving PPIs appropriately and 14 patients (1.8%) were not receiving PPIs but they had a proper indication. When we compared patients receiving PPIs without a proper indication with those who were not receiving PPIs, a statistical difference was found according to Charlson Comorbidity Index (p≤0.001, U=37922.00), number of diseases (p≤0.001, U=33269.00) and medications (p≤0.001, U=31218.50), Katz Index score (p=0.01, U=45328.00), and the use of blood thinners (p≤0.001, χ2=21.15). In multivariate analysis the only independent predictor of inappropriate PPI use was the number of medications (p=0.001, OR=1.16, 95%CI 1.06-1.27). Conclusions. The main predictor of inappropriate PPI use was the number of received medications. Εfforts needed to apply the predefined criteria for PPI prescription and to deprescribe PPIs received inappropriately.",A Novel Protein Subcellular Localization Method With CNN-XGBoost Model for Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713552,Frontiers in genetics,2019 02 06,"The disorder distribution of protein in the compartment or organelle leads to many human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The prediction of protein subcellular localization play important roles in the understanding of the mechanism of protein function, pathogenes and disease therapy. This paper proposes a novel subcellular localization method by integrating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), where CNN acts as a feature extractor to automatically obtain features from the original sequence information and a XGBoost classifier as a recognizer to identify the protein subcellular localization based on the output of the CNN. Experiments are implemented on three protein datasets. The results prove that the CNN-XGBoost method performs better than the general protein subcellular localization methods.",The Gene Toolkit Implicated in Functional Sex in Sparidae Hermaphrodites: Inferences From Comparative Transcriptomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713551,Frontiers in genetics,2019 02 06,"Sex-biased gene expression is the mode through which sex dimorphism arises from a nearly identical genome, especially in organisms without genetic sex determination. Teleost fishes show great variations in the way the sex phenotype forms. Among them, Sparidae, that might be considered as a model family displays a remarkable diversity of reproductive modes. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the sex-biased transcriptome in gonads and brain (the tissues with the most profound role in sexual development and reproduction) of two sparids with different reproductive modes: the gonochoristic common dentex, Dentex dentex, and the protandrous hermaphrodite gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata. Through comparative analysis with other protogynous and rudimentary protandrous sparid transcriptomes already available, we put forward common male and female-specific genes and pathways that are probably implicated in sex-maintenance in this fish family. Our results contribute to the understanding of the complex processes behind the establishment of the functional sex, especially in hermaphrodite species and set the groundwork for future experiments by providing a gene toolkit that can improve efforts to control phenotypic sex in finfish in the ever-increasingly important field of aquaculture.",Conserved Disease Modules Extracted From Multilayer Heterogeneous Disease and Gene Networks for Understanding Disease Mechanisms and Predicting Disease Treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713550,Frontiers in genetics,2019 02 06,"Disease relationship studies for understanding the pathogenesis of complex diseases, diagnosis, prognosis, and drug development are important. Traditional approaches consider one type of disease data or aggregating multiple types of disease data into a single network, which results in important temporal- or context-related information loss and may distort the actual organization. Therefore, it is necessary to apply multilayer network model to consider multiple types of relationships between diseases and the important interplays between different relationships. Further, modules extracted from multilayer networks are smaller and have more overlap that better capture the actual organization. Here, we constructed a weighted four-layer disease-disease similarity network to characterize the associations at different levels between diseases. Then, a tensor-based computational framework was used to extract Conserved Disease Modules (CDMs) from the four-layer disease network. After filtering, nine significant CDMs were reserved. The statistical significance test proved the significance of the nine CDMs. Comparing with modules got from four single layer networks, CMDs are smaller, better represent the actual relationships, and contain potential disease-disease relationships. KEGG pathways enrichment analysis and literature mining further contributed to confirm that these CDMs are highly reliable. Furthermore, the CDMs can be applied to predict potential drugs for diseases. The molecular docking techniques were used to provide the direct evidence for drugs to treat related disease. Taking Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) as a case, we found its three potential drugs Carvedilol, Metoprolol, and Ramipril. And many studies have pointed out that Carvedilol and Ramipril have an effect on RA. Overall, the CMDs extracted from multilayer networks provide us with an impressive understanding disease mechanisms from the perspective of multi-layer network and also provide an effective way to predict potential drugs for diseases based on its neighbors in a same CDM.","Imprinted MicroRNA Gene Clusters in the Evolution, Development, and Functions of Mammalian Placenta.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713549,Frontiers in genetics,2019 02 06,"In mammals, the expression of a subset of microRNA (miRNA) genes is governed by genomic imprinting, an epigenetic mechanism that confers monoallelic expression in a parent-of-origin manner. Three evolutionarily distinct genomic intervals contain the vast majority of imprinted miRNA genes: the rodent-specific, paternally expressed C2MC located in intron 10 of the Sfmbt2 gene, the primate-specific, paternally expressed C19MC positioned at human Chr.19q13.4 and the eutherian-specific, maternally expressed miRNAs embedded within the imprinted Dlk1-Dio3 domains at human 14q32 (also named C14MC in humans). Interestingly, these imprinted miRNA genes form large clusters composed of many related gene copies that are co-expressed with a marked, or even exclusive, localization in the placenta. Here, we summarize our knowledge on the evolutionary, molecular, and physiological relevance of these epigenetically-regulated, recently-evolved miRNAs, by focusing on their roles in placentation and possibly also in pregnancy diseases (e.g., preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth).",A Sex-Stratified Genome-Wide Association Study of Tuberculosis Using a Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713548,Frontiers in genetics,2019 02 06,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a complex disease with a known human genetic component. Males seem to be more affected than females and in most countries the TB notification rate is twice as high in males than in females. While socio-economic status, behavior and sex hormones influence the male bias they do not fully account for it. Males have only one copy of the X chromosome, while diploid females are subject to X chromosome inactivation. In addition, the X chromosome codes for many immune-related genes, supporting the hypothesis that X-linked genes could contribute to TB susceptibility in a sex-biased manner. We report the first TB susceptibility genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a specific focus on sex-stratified autosomal analysis and the X chromosome. A total of 810 individuals (410 cases and 405 controls) from an admixed South African population were genotyped using the Illumina Multi Ethnic Genotyping Array, specifically designed as a suitable platform for diverse and admixed populations. Association testing was done on the autosome (8,27,386 variants) and X chromosome (20,939 variants) in a sex stratified and combined manner. SNP association testing was not statistically significant using a stringent cut-off for significance but revealed likely candidate genes that warrant further investigation. A genome wide interaction analysis detected 16 significant interactions. Finally, the results highlight the importance of sex-stratified analysis as strong sex-specific effects were identified on both the autosome and X chromosome.",Phospholipidase Dδ Negatively Regulates the Function of Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. Maculicola 1 (RPM1).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713545,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 06,"RPM1 is a plant immune receptor that specially recognizes pathogen-released effectors to activate effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in Arabidopsis thaliana. RPM1 triggers ETI and hypersensitive response (HR) for disease resistance. Previous reports indicated that Phospholipase D (PLD) positively regulated RPM1-mediated HR. However, single, double, and triple pld knock-out mutants of 12 members of the PLD family in A. thaliana did not show suppressed RPM1-mediated HR, indicating the functional redundancy among PLD members. In this study, we revealed that PLD could negatively regulate the function of RPM1. We found that RPM1 interacted with PLDδ, but did not interact with PLDβ1, PLDβ2, and PLDγ3. Overexpression of PLDδ conducted to a reduction of protein level and corresponding activity of RPM1. We found that abscisic acid (ABA) reduced the protein level of RPM1, and the ABA-induced RPM1 reduction required PLD activity and PLD-derived phosphatidic acid (PA). Our study shows that PLD plays both negative and positive roles regulating the protein level and activity of RPM1 during stress responses in plants. PLD proteins are regulating points to integrate the abiotic and biotic responses of plants.",Early-Warning Signals of Individual Tree Mortality Based on Annual Radial Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713543,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 06,"Tree mortality is a key driver of forest dynamics and its occurrence is projected to increase in the future due to climate change. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms leading to death, we still lack robust indicators of mortality risk that could be applied at the individual tree scale. Here, we build on a previous contribution exploring the differences in growth level between trees that died and survived a given mortality event to assess whether changes in temporal autocorrelation, variance, and synchrony in time-series of annual radial growth data can be used as early warning signals of mortality risk. Taking advantage of a unique global ring-width database of 3065 dead trees and 4389 living trees growing together at 198 sites (belonging to 36 gymnosperm and angiosperm species), we analyzed temporal changes in autocorrelation, variance, and synchrony before tree death (diachronic analysis), and also compared these metrics between trees that died and trees that survived a given mortality event (synchronic analysis). Changes in autocorrelation were a poor indicator of mortality risk. However, we found a gradual increase in inter-annual growth variability and a decrease in growth synchrony in the last ∼20 years before mortality of gymnosperms, irrespective of the cause of mortality. These changes could be associated with drought-induced alterations in carbon economy and allocation patterns. In angiosperms, we did not find any consistent changes in any metric. Such lack of any signal might be explained by the relatively high capacity of angiosperms to recover after a stress-induced growth decline. Our analysis provides a robust method for estimating early-warning signals of tree mortality based on annual growth data. In addition to the frequently reported decrease in growth rates, an increase in inter-annual growth variability and a decrease in growth synchrony may be powerful predictors of gymnosperm mortality risk, but not necessarily so for angiosperms."

Examples include the pseudoruminant alpaca. To better understand how body site and diet influence the alpaca microbiota, we performed three 16S rRNA gene surveys. First, we surveyed the compartment 1 (C1), duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and large intestine (LI) of alpacas fed a grass hay (GH; tall fescue) or alfalfa hay (AH) diet for 30 days. Second, we performed a C1 survey of alpacas fed a series of 2-week mixed grass hay (MGH) diets supplemented with ∼25% dry weight barley, quinoa, amaranth, or soybean meal. Third, we examined the microbial differences of alpacas with normal versus poor body condition. Samples from GH- and AH-fed alpacas grouped by diet and body site but none of the four supplements significantly altered C1 microbiota composition, relative to each other, and none of the OTUs were differentially abundant between alpacas with normal versus poor body conditions. Taken together, the findings of a diet- and body-site specific alpaca microbiota are consistent with previous findings in ruminants and other mammals, but we provide no evidence to link changes in alpaca body condition with variation in microbiota relative abundance or identity.",C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ Mice Are Differentially Susceptible to Inflammation-Associated Disease Caused by Influenza A Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713529,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 07,"Influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics, and are a major burden on human health. To develop better countermeasures and improve influenza disease outcomes, a clearer understanding of influenza pathogenesis is necessary. Host genetic factors have emerged as potential regulators of human influenza disease susceptibility, and in the mouse model, genetic background has been clearly linked to influenza pathogenicity. Here, we show that C57BL/6J mice are significantly more susceptible to disease caused by a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, an H7N9 virus, and a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus compared to the closely related substrain, C57BL/6NJ. Mechanistically, influenza virus infection in C57BL/6J mice results in earlier presentation of edema, increased immune cell infiltration, higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, greater tissue damage, and delayed activation of regenerative processes in infected lung tissues compared to C57BL/6NJ mice. These differences are not dependent on virus replication levels. Six genes with known coding region differences between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ strains exhibit increased transcript levels in influenza virus-infected mouse lungs, suggesting potential contributions to regulation of disease susceptibility. This work uncovers a previously unappreciated difference in disease susceptibility between the closely related C57BL/6J and C57BL/6NJ mice, which may be exploited in future studies to identify host factors and/or specific genetic elements that regulate host-dependent inflammatory mechanisms involved in influenza virus pathogenicity.",The Ability of Lytic Staphylococcal Podovirus vB_SauP_phiAGO1.3 to Coexist in Equilibrium With Its Host Facilitates the Selection of Host Mutants of Attenuated Virulence but Does Not Preclude the Phage Antistaphylococcal Activity in a Nematode Infection Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713528,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 06,"Phage vB_SauP_phiAGO1.3 (phiAGO1.3) is a polyvalent Staphylococcus lytic podovirus with a 17.6-kb genome (Gozdek et al., 2018). It can infect most of the Staphylococcus aureus human isolates of dominant clonal complexes. We show that a major factor contributing to the wide host range of phiAGO1.3 is a lack or sparcity of target sites for certain restriction-modification systems of types I and II in its genome. Phage phiAGO1.3 requires for adsorption β-O-GlcNAcylated cell wall teichoic acid, which is also essential for the expression of methicillin resistance. Under certain conditions an exposure of S. aureus to phiAGO1.3 can lead to the establishment of a mixed population in which the bacteria and phages remain in equilibrium over multiple generations. This is reminiscent of the so called phage carrier state enabling the co-existence of phage-resistant and phage-sensitive cells supporting a continuous growth of the bacterial and phage populations. The stable co-existence of bacteria and phage favors the emergence of phage-resistant variants of the bacterium. All phiAGO1.3-resistant cells isolated from the phage-carrier-state cultures contained a mutation inactivating the two-component regulatory system ArlRS, essential for efficient expression of numerous S. aureus virulence-associated traits. Moreover, the mutants were unaffected in their susceptibility to infection with an unrelated, polyvalent S. aureus phage of the genus Kayvirus. The ability of phiAGO1.3 to establish phage-carrier-state cultures did not preclude its antistaphylococcal activity in vivo in an S. aureus nematode infection model. Taken together our results suggest that phiAGO1.3 could be suitable for the therapeutic application in humans and animals, alone or in cocktails with Kayvirus phages. It might be especially useful in the treatment of infections with the majority of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains.",Recognition of Peptidoglycan Fragments by the Transpeptidase PBP4 From Staphylococcus aureus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713527,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 07,"Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential component of the cell envelope, maintaining bacterial cell shape and protecting it from bursting due to turgor pressure. The monoderm bacterium Staphylococcus aureus has a highly cross-linked PG, with ~90% of peptide stems participating in DD-cross-links and up to 15 peptide stems connected with each other. These cross-links are formed in transpeptidation reactions catalyzed by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of classes A and B. Most S. aureus strains have three housekeeping PBPs with this function (PBP1, PBP2, and PBP3) but MRSA strains have acquired a third class B PBP, PBP2a, which is encoded by the mecA gene and required for the expression of high-level resistance to β-lactams. Another housekeeping PBP of S. aureus is PBP4, which belongs to the class C PBPs, and hence would be expected to have PG hydrolase (DD-carboxypeptidase or DD-endopeptidase) activity. However, previous works showed that, unexpectedly, PBP4 has transpeptidase activity that significantly contributes to both the high level of cross-linking in the PG of S. aureus and to the low level of β-lactam resistance in the absence of PBP2a. To gain insights into this unusual activity of PBP4, we studied by NMR spectroscopy its interaction in vitro with different substrates, including intact peptidoglycan, synthetic peptide stems, muropeptides, and long glycan chains with uncross-linked peptide stems. PBP4 showed no affinity for the complex, intact peptidoglycan or the smallest isolated peptide stems. Transpeptidase activity of PBP4 was verified with the disaccharide peptide subunits (muropeptides) in vitro, producing cyclic dimer and multimer products; these assays also showed a designed PBP4(S75C) nucleophile mutant to be inactive. Using this inactive but structurally highly similar variant, liquid-state NMR identified two interaction surfaces in close proximity to the central nucleophile position that can accommodate the potential donor and acceptor stems for the transpeptidation reaction. A PBP4:muropeptide model structure was built from these experimental restraints, which provides new mechanistic insights into mecA independent resistance to β-lactams in S. aureus.",The Effect of Density-Dependent Phase on the Locust Gut Bacterial Composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713526,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 06,"The desert locust demonstrates density-dependent phase polyphenism: For extended periods it appears in a non-aggregating, non-migrating phenotype, known as the solitary phase. When circumstances change, solitary individuals may aggregate and transform to the gregarious phenotype, which have a strong propensity for generating large swarms. Previous reports have suggested a role for gut-bacteria derived volatiles in the swarming phenomenon, and suggested that locusts are capable of manipulating their gut microbiome according to their density-dependent phases. Here, we directly tested this hypothesis for the first time. Using locusts of both phases from well-controlled laboratory cultures as well as gregarious field-collected individuals; and high-throughput sequencing. We characterized the hindgut bacterial community composition in the two phases of the desert locust. Our findings demonstrate that laboratory-reared gregarious and solitary locusts maintain a stable core of Enterobacter. However, while different generations of gregarious locust experience shifts in their Enterobacter's relative abundance; the solitary locusts maintain a stable gut microbiome, highly similar to that of the field-collected locusts. Tentative phase differences in wild populations' microbiome may thus be an indirect effect of environmental or other factors that push the swarming individuals to homogenous gut bacteria. We therefore conclude that there are phase-related differences in the population dynamics of the locust hindgut bacterial composition, but there is no intrinsic density-dependent mechanism directly affecting the gut microbiome.",Structural Characterization of the Xi Class Glutathione Transferase From the Haloalkaliphilic Archaeon Natrialba magadii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713525,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 06,"Xi class glutathione transferases (GSTs) are a recently identified group, within this large superfamily of enzymes, specifically endowed with glutathione-dependent reductase activity on glutathionyl-hydroquinone. Enzymes belonging to this group are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, and plants but not in higher eukaryotes. Xi class GSTs are also frequently found in archaea and here we focus on the enzyme produced by the extreme haloalkaliphilic archaeon Natrialba magadii (NmGHR). We investigated its function and stability and determined its 3D structure in the apo form by X-ray crystallography. NmGHR displays the same fold of its mesophilic counterparts, is enriched in negatively charged residues, which are evenly distributed along the surface of the protein, and is characterized by a peculiar distribution of hydrophobic residues. A distinctive feature of haloalkaliphilic archaea is their preference for γ-glutamyl-cysteine over glutathione as a reducing thiol. Indeed we found that the N. magadii genome lacks a gene coding for glutathione synthase. Analysis of NmGHR structure suggests that the thiol binding site (G-site) of the enzyme is well suited for hosting γ-glutamyl-cysteine.",The Benefits and Limits of Technological Advances in Glucose Management Around Physical Activity in Patients Type 1 Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713524,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 02 06,"Physical activity is highly recommended for patients living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) due to its varied health benefits. Nevertheless, glucose management, during and in the hours following exercise, represents a great challenge for these patients who most often end up leading a sedentary life style. Important technological advances in insulin delivery devices and glucose monitoring are now available and continue to progress. These technologies could be used to alleviate glucose management related to physical activity in T1D. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) helps patients observe the trends of glycemic fluctuations when exercising and in the following night to deal pre-emptively with hypoglycemic risks and treat hypoglycemic episodes in a timely manner. Insulin pumps offer the flexibility of adjusting insulin basal rates and boluses according to patient's specific needs around exercise. The artificial pancreas links CGM to pump through an intelligent hormone dosing algorithm to close the loop of glucose control and has thus the potential to ease the burden of exercise in T1D. This review will examine and discuss the literature related to physical activity practice using each of these technologies. The aim is to discuss their benefits as well as their limitations and finally the additional research needed in the future to optimize their use in T1D.",Plasticity in the Glucagon Interactome Reveals Novel Proteins That Regulate Glucagon Secretion in α-TC1-6 Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713523,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 02 06,"Glucagon is stored within the secretory granules of pancreatic alpha cells until stimuli trigger its release. The alpha cell secretory responses to the stimuli vary widely, possibly due to differences in experimental models or microenvironmental conditions. We hypothesized that the response of the alpha cell to various stimuli could be due to plasticity in the network of proteins that interact with glucagon within alpha cell secretory granules. We used tagged glucagon with Fc to pull out glucagon from the enriched preparation of secretory granules in α-TC1-6 cells. Isolation of secretory granules was validated by immunoisolation with Fc-glucagon and immunoblotting for organelle-specific proteins. Isolated enriched secretory granules were then used for affinity purification with Fc-glucagon followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry to identify secretory granule proteins that interact with glucagon. Proteomic analyses revealed a network of proteins containing glucose regulated protein 78 KDa (GRP78) and histone H4. The interaction between glucagon and the ER stress protein GRP78 and histone H4 was confirmed through co-immunoprecipitation of secretory granule lysates, and colocalization immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Composition of the protein networks was altered at different glucose levels (25 vs. 5.5 mM) and in response to the paracrine inhibitors of glucagon secretion, GABA and insulin. siRNA-mediated silencing of a subset of these proteins revealed their involvement in glucagon secretion in α-TC1-6 cells. Therefore, our results show a novel and dynamic glucagon interactome within α-TC1-6 cell secretory granules. We suggest that variations in the alpha cell secretory response to stimuli may be governed by plasticity in the glucagon ""interactome.""",Association Between Net Vertebral Artery Flow Volume and Non-AF Stroke: A Retrospective 2-Year Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713522,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 06,"Objectives: Association between net vertebral artery flow volume (NVAFV) and stroke types remains unclear. We hypothesize NVAFV is low in patients with posterior circulation infarction (PCI) and an ideal cut-off value for discriminating PCI from anterior circulation infarction (ACI) and controls may be present. Materials and Methods: As study candidates, we retrospectively enrolled hospitalized patients with first-time non-AF stroke within 2-years period. Consecutive non-AF, non-stroke subjects were enrolled as the control group. We compared NVAFV values among the PCI, ACI, and control groups. Results: Overall, 866 candidates-213, 418, and 235 candidates in the PCI, ACI, and control groups, respectively-were enrolled. NVAFV (mean ± SD) values were 134.8 ± 52.7, 152.3 ± 59.2, and 172.0 ± 54.7 mL/min in the PCI, ACI, and control groups, respectively. Statistics revealed significant difference (p < 0.001) among three groups. To use NVAFV as a diagnostic parameter, the AUC of any two groups should be between 0.58 and 0.69. Most (93.6%) of the controls had NVAFV above 100 mL/min. The odds ratio of any non-AF stroke is 3.48 if the NVAFV is below 100 mL/min. Conclusions: NVAFV is lowest in non-AF PCI group. Low NVAFV is associated with both non-AF ACI and PCI. No ideal cut-off value is available to discriminate PCI from other two conditions. We agree that an NVAFV of 100 mL/min is the lower limit of a normal value. Any value below 100 mL/min indicates high stroke risk and implies diffuse cerebral atherosclerosis and impaired cerebral perfusion.",Efficacy and Safety of Repeated Percutaneous Radiofrequency Thermocoagulation for Recurrent Trigeminal Neuralgia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713521,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 06,"Background: Percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation (PRT) is used to treat trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with a satisfactory pain relief but a high recurrence rate. Objective: To explore the efficacy and safety of repeated PRT for recurrent TN as compared to patients who received the first PRT. Methods: Between January 2013 to May 2013, 31 patients with recurrent TN who have been treated with PRT previously were recruited and underwent repeated PRT (group A), and compared with 41 TN patients received the first initial PRT (group B). Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was assessed preoperatively and postoperatively after 2 years of follow-up, and compared in terms of initial pain relief, complications, and recurrence rate between the two groups. Results: In group A, 27 patients (87.0%) were pain free immediately, and 30 patients (96.8%) experienced pain relief at 48 h, whereas that was 37 patients (90.0%) and 40 patients (97.6%) in group B (p ≧ 0.05). Patients in group A who remained an ""excellent"" or ""good"" pain relief condition (VAS score ≦ 1) were 96.8% at 6 months, 83.9% at 1 year, 74.2% at 2 years, whereas the percentage in group B was 97.6, 85.4, and 73.2% (p ≧ 0.05). Conclusion: For patients with recurrent TN after PRT, repeated PRT might be considered as a useful treatment option when other treatments fail. In addition, the frequency and severity of adverse events for repeated PRT were similar as compared to initial PRT."

In the present study, we examined Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus counts for association with bipolar disorder and serum cortisol levels. Methods: Bacterial counts in fecal samples were examined in 39 patients with bipolar disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edn. and 58 healthy controls using bacterial rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: No significant difference was found in either bacterial counts between the two groups. However, we found a significantly negative correlation between Lactobacillus counts and sleep (ρ = -0.45, P = 0.01). Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was found between Bifidobacterium counts and cortisol levels (ρ = -0.39, P = 0.02) in the patients, although such a correlation was not found for Lactobacillus counts. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus counts may not play a major role in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder in our sample. However, the observed negative correlation between Lactobacillus counts and sleep and that between Bifidobacterium counts and serum cortisol levels point to the possible roles of these bacteria in sleep and stress response of the patients.",Quality of Life in Patients With a Major Mental Disorder in Singapore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713508,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 02 06,"Background: There has been a paradigm shift in mental health service delivery, from a focus on reducing symptoms to a more holistic approach, which considers Quality of Life (QoL). Method: This study aimed to explore prediction of Quality of Life (QoL) in Asian patients with a major mental disorder i.e., depression or schizophrenia in Singapore. In the current study, there were 43 patients (65.1% females) with depression. Their ages ranged from 18 to 65 (M = 44.63, SD = 12.22). The data were combined with the data on patients with schizophrenia, where there were 43 patients (65.1% females) with schizophrenia, their ages ranging from 18 to 65 (M = 44.60, SD = 12.19). Results: The components of QoL were examined i.e., Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). For all patients, social support and age accounted for 17.3% of the variance in PCS, F(2, 83) = 8.66, p < 0.001. For patients with depression, disorder severity, age, and duration of treatment accounted for 48.3% of the variance in PCS, F(3, 39) = 12.15, p < 0.001. For patients with schizophrenia, education (Primary or Lower vs. Post-Secondary or Higher) and emotional coping accounted for 21.3% of the variance in PCS, F(2, 40) = 5.40, p < 0.01. For all patients, self-efficacy and age accounted for 27.0% of the variance in MCS, F(2, 83) = 15.37, p < 0.001. For patients with depression, disorder severity accounted for 45.6% of the variance in MCS, F(1, 41) = 34.33, p < 0.001. For patients with schizophrenia, number of hospitalizations accounted for 18.5% of the variance in MCS, F(1, 41) = 9.29, p < 0.01. Conclusion: The findings were discussed in regards to implications in interventions to enhance QoL of patients with schizophrenia and depression in Singapore.",An Investigation on the Clinical Features and Neurochemical Changes in Parkinson's Disease With Depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713507,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 02 06,"Objective: To investigate the clinical features and neurochemical changes in Parkinson's disease with depression (PD-D). Methods: A total of 478 PD patients were divided into PD-D and PD patients without depression (PD-ND) groups according to the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score. Demographic variables, motor and non-motor symptoms and activities of daily living were evaluated. The independent influencing factors of PD-D were investigated via binary logistic regression analysis. The levels of neurotransmitters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured and their correlations with HAMD score were analyzed. Results: The proportion of PD-D was 59.0%, of which 76.95, 20.92, and 2.13% had mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively. Anxiety/somatization was the most prevalent sub-factor of HAMD in PD-D. The scores of UPDRS III, postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD) type and the scores of 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and 14-item Chalder Fatigue Scale (FS) were independently associated with PD-D. The levels of dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were all significantly reduced in PD-D group compared with those in PD-ND group. HAMD scores were negatively correlated with the DA levels in CSF. Conclusions: PD patients have a high proportion of depression, mainly of mild and moderate levels. The profile of depression in PD population is subtly different from that of the general population. Motor symptoms, PIGD type, anxiety and fatigue are the significant influencing factors of PD-D. Compared to 5-HT, DA may play a more important role in PD-D.",Postural Control Follows a Bi-Phasic Alteration Pattern During Mountain Ultra-Marathon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713506,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 06,"It is well knows that postural control (PC) is deteriorated with neuromuscular fatigue, altitude or sleep deprivation induced by a mountain ultra-marathon (MUM). Several regulatory mechanisms have also been reported during this type of event and the changes in PC at different points of MUM remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the time course of PC during an extreme MUM. We tested the hypothesis that PC alteration would not increase linearly. Methods: 16 participants (age 45.1 ± 9.6 years) were tested bipedaly on a posturographic platform for 51.2 s with eyes open every ∼50 km. Both traditional and stabilogram diffusion analyses (SDA) were performed. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for a subjective evaluation of global fatigue, sleep feeling and pain. Results: The main parameters (center of pressure trajectory analysis) increased significantly (p < 0.001, d = 1.56, very large) until km 100. This was confirmed by SDA in the antero-posterior plane. Short term effective diffusion coefficient significantly increased (p < 0.001, d = 1.07, very large) as critical point (p < 0.01, d = 1.57, very large). From km 100 to 200, a different response was observed with a continuous decrease in most of the PC parameters. This was confirmed by SDA in the antero-posterior plane. Short term effective diffusion coefficient significantly increased (p < 0.001, d = 1.39, very large) as critical point (p < 0.01, d = 1.51, very large). Conclusion: Posture alteration is progressively increased until 100 km. After this point, compensatory mechanisms appear to limit the posture degradation. This bi-phasic response is of interest for better understanding the coping with extreme fatigue.",Arterial Network Geometric Characteristics and Regulation of Capillary Blood Flow in Hamster Skeletal Muscle Microcirculation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713505,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 06,"This study was aimed to characterize the geometric arrangement of hamster skeletal muscle arteriolar networks and to assess the in vivo rhythmic diameter changes of arterioles to clarify regulatory mechanisms of the capillary perfusion. The experimental study was carried out in male Syrian hamsters implanted with a plastic chamber in the dorsum skin under pentobarbital anesthesia. The skeletal muscle microvessels were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The vessel diameters, lengths and the rhythmic diameter changes of arterioles were analyzed with computer-assisted techniques. The arterioles were classified according to a centripetal ordering scheme. In hamster skeletal muscle microvasculature the terminal branchings, differentiated in long and short terminal arteriolar trees (TATs), originated from anastomotic vessels, defined ""arcading"" arterioles. The long TATs presented different frequencies along the branching vessels; order 4 arterioles had frequencies lower than those observed in the order 3, 2, and 1 vessels. The short TAT order 3 arterioles, directly originating from ""arcading"" parent vessels, showed a frequency dominating all daughter arterioles. The amplitude of diameter variations in larger vessels was in the range 30-40% of mean diameter, while it was 80-100% in order 3, 2, and 1 vessels. Therefore, the complete constriction of arterioles, caused an intermittent capillary blood perfusion. L-arginine or papaverine infusion caused dilation of arterioles and transient disappearing of vasomotion waves and induced perfusion of all capillaries spreading from short and long TAT arrangements. Therefore, the capillary blood flow was modulated by changes in diameter of terminal arterioles penetrating within the skeletal muscle fibers, facilitating redistribution of blood flow according to the metabolic demands of tissues.",Acidosis Maintains the Function of Brain Mitochondria in Hypoxia-Tolerant Triplefin Fish: A Strategy to Survive Acute Hypoxic Exposure?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713504,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 06,"The vertebrate brain is generally very sensitive to acidosis, so a hypoxia-induced decrease in pH is likely to have an effect on brain mitochondria (mt). Mitochondrial respiration (JO2) is required to generate an electrical gradient (ΔΨm) and a pH gradient to power ATP synthesis, yet the impact of pH modulation on brain mt function remains largely unexplored. As intertidal fishes within rock pools routinely experience hypoxia and reoxygenation, they would most likely experience changes in cellular pH. We hence compared four New Zealand triplefin fish species ranging from intertidal hypoxia-tolerant species (HTS) to subtidal hypoxia-sensitive species (HSS). We predicted that HTS would tolerate acidosis better than HSS in terms of sustaining mt structure and function. Using respirometers coupled to fluorimeters and pH electrodes, we titrated lactic-acid to decrease the pH of the media, and simultaneously recorded JO2, ΔΨm, and H+ buffering capacities within permeabilized brain and swelling of mt isolated from non-permeabilized brains. We then measured ATP synthesis rates in the most HTS (Bellapiscus medius) and the HSS (Forsterygion varium) at pH 7.25 and 6.65. Mitochondria from HTS brain did have greater H+ buffering capacities than HSS mt (∼10 mU pH.mgprotein-1). HTS mt swelled by 40% when exposed to a decrease of 1.5 pH units, and JO2 was depressed by up to 15% in HTS. However, HTS were able to maintain ΔΨm near -120 mV. Estimates of work, in terms of charges moved across the mt inner-membrane, suggested that with acidosis, HTS mt may in part harness extra-mt H+ to maintain ΔΨm, and could therefore support ATP production. This was confirmed with elevated ATP synthesis rates and enhanced P:O ratios at pH 6.65 relative to pH 7.25. In contrast, mt volumes and ΔΨm decreased downward pH 6.9 in HSS mt and paradoxically, JO2 increased (∼25%) but ATP synthesis and P:O ratios were depressed at pH 6.65. This indicates a loss of coupling in the HSS with acidosis. Overall, the mt of these intertidal fish have adaptations that enhance ATP synthesis efficiency under acidic conditions such as those that occur in hypoxic or reoxygenated brain.",Dietary Supplementation With High Fiber Alleviates Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Responses Caused by Severe Sepsis in Mice Without Altering Microbiome Diversity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713502,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 06,"In this study, we demonstrated the effects of a high-fiber diet on intestinal lesions, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation in a murine model of endotoxemia. C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to four groups: the control group (CONTROL), which received a commercial normal-fiber rodent diet comprising normal fiber; a CLP group, which received a commercial normal-fiber rodent diet and underwent caecal ligation puncture (CLP); a high-fiber group (HFG), which received a commercial high-fiber rodent diet; and a high fiber + CLP group (HFCLP) which received a commercial high-fiber rodent diet and underwent CLP (30%). The sepsis model was created via CLP after 2 weeks of dietary intervention. Notably, dietary high-fiber supplementation in HFCLP group improved survival rates and reduced bacterial loads, compared with CLP alone. In the HFCLP group, dietary fiber supplementation decreased the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and high-mobility group protein 1 (HMG-1) but raised the concentration of interleukin 10 (IL-10), compared with the levels in CLP mice. Meanwhile, high-fiber supplementation increased the relative proportions of Akkermansia and Lachnospiraceae. These data show that dietary high-fiber supplementation may be therapeutic for sepsis-induced lesions.",Cardiac Biomarkers Predicting MACE in Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713501,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 06,"Objective: The present meta-analysis was aimed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin (cTn), high sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and CRP for predicting postoperative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Methods: A total of 26 relevant studies with 7,877 participants were collected from five databases, namely PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), CQVIP and the Wanfang Database until August 10, 2018. And the Review Manager Version 5.3 and Stata/SE 12 software were used for data syntheses in the meta-analysis. Results: Strong relationships of BNP/NT-proBNP, cTnI/cTnT and hs-CRP with MACE were detected in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, and the five biomarkers all increased the risk of MACE. Compared to normal levels, elevated BNP/NT-proBNP could increase the MACE risk by almost 4-fold [RR:3.92, 95%CI: 3.23-4.75, P < 0.001]; elevated BNP corresponded to a 4.5-fold risk [RR:4.57, 95%CI: 3.37-6.20, P < 0.001]; elevated NT-proBNP led to a 3-fold higher risk [RR:3.48, 95%CI: 2.71-4.46, P < 0.001]. Comparing with normal levels of cTnI/cTnT, increased cTnI/cTnT was associated with nearly 5-fold more higher risk of MACE [RR:5.52, 95%CI: 4.62-6.58, P < 0.001]; elevated cTnI faced a 5-fold risk [RR:5.21, 95%CI: 3.96-6.86, P < 0.001]; elevated cTnT resulted in nearly 6-fold higher risk [RR:5.73, 95%CI: 4.55-7.22, P < 0.001]. The elevation of hs-CRP was associated with nearly 4-fold higher risk of MACE in comparison with normal concentration [RR:3.73, 95%CI: 2.63-5.30, P < 0.001]. Conclusion: According to the results of our meta-analysis, the elevations of BNP/NT-proBNP, cTnI/cTnT, and hs-CRP, pre-operation or post-operation immediately, can predict much higher risk of postoperative MACE in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.",Activin Receptor Ligand Blocking and Cancer Have Distinct Effects on Protein and Redox Homeostasis in Skeletal Muscle and Liver.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713500,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 06,"Muscle wasting in cancer cachexia can be alleviated by blocking activin receptor type 2 (ACVR2) ligands through changes in protein synthesis/degradation. These changes in cellular and protein metabolism may alter protein homeostasis. First, we elucidated the acute (1-2 days) and 2-week effects of blocking ACVR2 ligands by soluble activin receptor 2B (sACVR2B-Fc) on unfolded protein response (UPR), heat shock proteins (HSPs) and redox balance in a healthy mouse skeletal muscle. Second, we examined UPR, autophagy and redox balance with or without sACVR2B-Fc administration in muscle and liver of C26 tumor-bearing mice. The indicators of UPR and HSPs were not altered 1-2 days after a single sACVR2B-Fc administration in healthy muscles, but protein carbonyls increased (p < 0.05). Two weeks of sACVR2B-Fc administration increased muscle size, which was accompanied by increased UPR markers: GRP78 (p < 0.05), phosphorylated eIF2α (p < 0.01) and HSP47 (p < 0.01). Additionally, protein carbonyls and reduced form of glutathione increased (GSH) (p < 0.05). On the other hand, C26 cancer cachexia manifested decreased UPR markers (p-eIF2α, HSP47, p-JNK; p < 0.05) and antioxidant GSH (p < 0.001) in muscle, whereas the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione increased (GSSG/GSH; p < 0.001). Administration of sACVR2B-Fc prevented the decline in GSH and increased some of the UPR indicators in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, autophagy markers LC3II/I (p < 0.05), Beclin-1 (p < 0.01), and P62 (p < 0.05) increased in the skeletal muscle of tumor-bearing mice. Finally, indicators of UPR, PERK, p-eIF2α and GRP78, increased (p < 0.05), whereas ATF4 was strongly decreased (p < 0.01) in the liver of tumor-bearing mice while sACVR2B-Fc had no effect. Muscle GSH and many of the altered UPR indicators correlated with tumor mass, fat mass and body mass loss. In conclusion, experimental cancer cachexia is accompanied by distinct and tissue-specific changes in proteostasis. Muscle hypertrophy induced by blocking ACVR2B ligands may be accompanied by the induction of UPR and increased protein carbonyls but blocking ACVR2B ligands may upregulate antioxidant protection."

This framework enables access to well-established event-related potential (ERP) markers, which are specific to sensory, attention, and cognitive functions in both healthy and patient populations. However, all our applications to-date have used auditory stimulation, which have highlighted application challenges in persons with hearing impairments (e.g., aging, seniors, dementia). Consequently, it has become important to translate brain vital signs into a visual sensory modality. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of visual brain vital signs; and 2) compare and normalize results from visual and auditory brain vital signs. Data were collected from 34 healthy adults (33 ± 13 years) using a 64-channel EEG system. Visual and auditory sequences were kept as comparable as possible to elicit the N100, P300, and N400 responses. Visual brain vital signs were elicited successfully for all three responses across the group (N100: F = 29.8380, p < 0.001; P300: F = 138.8442, p < 0.0001; N400: F = 6.8476, p = 0.01). Initial auditory-visual comparisons across the three components showed attention processing (P300) was found to be the most transferrable across modalities, with no group-level differences and correlated peak amplitudes (rho = 0.7, p = 0.0001) across individuals. Auditory P300 latencies were shorter than visual (p < 0.0001) but normalization and correlation (r = 0.5, p = 0.0033) implied a potential systematic difference across modalities. Reduced auditory N400 amplitudes compared to visual (p = 0.0061) paired with normalization and correlation across individuals (r = 0.6, p = 0.0012), also revealed potential systematic modality differences between reading and listening language comprehension. This study provides an initial understanding of the relationship between the visual and auditory sequences, while importantly establishing a visual sequence within the brain vital signs framework. With both auditory and visual stimulation capabilities available, it is possible to broaden applications across the lifespan.",Towards Automated Pain Detection in Children using Facial and Electrodermal Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713486,CEUR workshop proceedings,2019 02 07,"Accurately determining pain levels in children is difficult, even for trained professionals and parents. Facial activity and electro- dermal activity (EDA) provide rich information about pain, and both have been used in automated pain detection. In this paper, we discuss preliminary steps towards fusing models trained on video and EDA features respectively. We compare fusion models using original video features and those using transferred video features which are less sensitive to environmental changes. We demonstrate the benefit of the fusion and the transferred video features with a special test case involving domain adaptation and improved performance relative to using EDA and video features alone.",Automated Pain Detection in Facial Videos of Children using Human-Assisted Transfer Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713485,CEUR workshop proceedings,2019 02 07,"Accurately determining pain levels in children is difficult, even for trained professionals and parents. Facial activity provides sensitive and specific information about pain, and computer vision algorithms have been developed to automatically detect Facial Action Units (AUs) defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Our prior work utilized information from computer vision, i.e., automatically detected facial AUs, to develop classifiers to distinguish between pain and no-pain conditions. However, application of pain/no-pain classifiers based on automated AU codings across different environmental domains results in diminished performance. In contrast, classifiers based on manually coded AUs demonstrate reduced environmentally-based variability in performance. In this paper, we train a machine learning model to recognize pain using AUs coded by a computer vision system embedded in a software package called iMotions. We also study the relationship between iMotions (automatically) and human (manually) coded AUs. We find that AUs coded automatically are different from those coded by a human trained in the FACS system, and that the human coder is less sensitive to environmental changes. To improve classification performance in the current work, we applied transfer learning by training another machine learning model to map automated AU codings to a subspace of manual AU codings to enable more robust pain recognition performance when only automatically coded AUs are available for the test data. With this transfer learning method, we improved the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) on independent data from new participants in our target domain from 0.67 to 0.72.",Development of competitive lateral flow immunoassay coupled with silver enhancement for simple and sensitive salivary cortisol detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713483,EXCLI journal,2019 02 06,"Cortisol is known as a stress biomarker. The measurement of cortisol levels is an early warning indicator for health conditions and diagnosis of stress-related diseases. Herein, a lateral flow immunoassay using a gold nanoparticle label with a silver enhancement system was developed for the simple, sensitive and rapid detection of cortisol. The developed assay was based on a competitive platform of which cortisol-BSA conjugate was immobilized at the test zone to compete with an analyte. The quantitative analysis was performed using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as signal labeling. Sequentially, the silver enhancement solution was applied in order to enhance the sensitivity of the assay with the results easily seen by the naked eye. Using this system, the limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 0.5 ng/mL with a 3.6 fold more sensitive detection than without the enhancement system (LOD = 1.8 ng/mL). The salivary cortisol analysis was in the range of 0.5-150 ng/mL (R2 = 0.9984), which is in the clinical acceptable range. For the semi-quantitative analysis, the intensity color of the results was analyzed using an image processing program. The proposed method was successfully applied to detect cortisol in saliva. In addition, the results from our method also complied with the ones of those obtained by using the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This developed assay offers great promise for a non-invasive screening test of salivary cortisol.",A haplotype of the phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene is associated with myocardial infarction and with cardiometabolic parameters: the GEA study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713479,EXCLI journal,2019 02 06,"The phosphodiesterase family is involved in a wide spectrum of diseases, including ischemic stroke. However, few studies have analyzed the relationship between phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) and myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, the aim of this research was to evaluate the association of the PDE4D gene polymorphisms with MI, and with cardiometabolic parameters in the Mexican population. Six polymorphisms (rs2910829, rs1423246, rs966221, rs4502776, rs13172481, and rs6869495) were genotyped in 1023 MI patients and 1105 healthy controls. A similar distribution of the six polymorphisms was observed in both studied groups. However, after evaluating the linkage disequilibrium, we detected a risk haplotype for MI (AGAGAA; OR = 1.148; P = 0.025). In addition, the polymorphisms were associated with the presence of some clinical and metabolic parameters (central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Aspartate transaminase >p75, Lipoprotein (a) >30 mg/dL, TAT >p75, fatty liver, and vitamin D <30 ng/dL) in healthy controls. The results suggest that in the Mexican population, a PDE4D haplotype is associated with increased risk of developing MI, and that PDE4D polymorphisms are independently associated with the presence of cardiometabolic parameters.",Androgen receptor (AR)-CAG trinucleotide repeat length and idiopathic male infertility: a case-control trial and a meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713477,EXCLI journal,2019 02 06,"CAG trinucleotide repeats in androgen receptor (AR) gene encode a polyglutamine tract in AR N-terminal transactivation domain. Studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of CAG repeat length on male infertility, which have yielded contradictory results. This study aimed to explore the number of AR-CAG repeats in 150 fertile controls and 150 idiopathic infertile men, divided into four azoospermia, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, and teratozoospermia subgroups. In addition, a meta-analysis was conducted based on previous studies to assess the association of the mentioned variation with male infertility in recent years. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting followed by an electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel was used for AR-CAG genotype detecting. Moreover, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases to collect eligible studies for meta-analysis purpose. According to the results, a significant association was observed between increased length of AR-CAG polymorphism and male infertility (p< 0.0001). Furthermore, there were similar significant associations in the azoospermia (p= 0.048), asthenozoospermia (p= 0.013) and teratozoospermia (p= 0.002) subgroups. In addition, meta-analysis on forty studies showed a significant association between AR-CAG polymorphism in the overall analysis (SMD= 0.199, 95 % CI= 0.112-0.287, p<0.001) and the Caucasian subgroup (SMD= 0.151, 95 % CI= 0.040-0.263, p= 0.008). Our results elucidated that long stretches of CAG repeat might lead to AR dysfunction, contributing to male infertility especially in the Caucasian population.",Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 promotes bladder cancer growth through inhibiting NF-kB dependent apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713476,EXCLI journal,2019 02 06,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) has emerged as a key regulator of tumorigenesis. However, how PRMT5 functions in bladder cancer, the most common malignancy of the urological system, is unknown. We described here that PRMT5 is highly expressed in bladder cancer cell lines and primary human bladder cancer tissues. PRMT5 enhances the proliferation and colony formation of bladder cancer cells. PRMT5 knockdown induces bladder cancer cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, PRMT5 enhances NF-kB activation by targeting crucial anti-apoptotic genes such as BCLXL and c-IAP1, thereby inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis and sustaining proliferation. Importantly, PRMT5 inhibitor opposed tumor growth and BCLXL and c-IAP1 transcription in the bladder cancer xenograft model. Collectively, the current suggests the crucial role of PRMT5 as a promising therapeutic target in bladder cancers.",Cyclosporin A attenuating morphine tolerance through inhibiting NO/ERK signaling pathway in human glioblastoma cell line: the involvement of calcineurin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713473,EXCLI journal,2019 02 06,"Cyclosporin A (CsA) is known to have an immunosuppressive action. However, it is also attracting attention due to its effects on the nervous system, such as inhibiting the development and expression of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence through unknown mechanisms. It has been shown that CsA modulates the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation, which are potentially involved in signaling pathways in morphine-induced tolerance in cellular models. Therefore, the current study was designed to evaluate the modulatory role of CsA on the MOR tolerance, by targeting the downstream signaling pathway of NO and ERK using an in vitro model. For this purpose, T98G cells were pretreated with CsA, calcineurin autoinhibitory peptide (CAIP), and NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 30 min before 18 h exposure to MOR. Then, we analyzed the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and also the expression of phosphorylated ERK and nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) proteins. Our results showed that CsA (1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM) and CAIP (50 µM) have significantly reduced cAMP and nitrite levels as compared to MOR-treated (2.5 µM) T98G cells. This clearly revealed the attenuation of MOR tolerance by CsA. The expression of nNOS and p-ERK proteins were down-regulated when the T98G cells were pretreated with CsA (1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM), CAIP (50 µM), and L-NAME (0.1 mM) as compared to MOR. In conclusion, the CsA pretreatment had a modulatory role in MOR-induced tolerance, which was possibly mediated through NO/ERK signaling pathway.",Early Childhood Teachers' Perspectives on Social-Emotional Competence and Learning in Urban Classrooms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713472,Journal of applied school psychology,2019 02 07,"The promotion of social emotional competence (SEC) and implementation of social emotional learning (SEL) programs have increased substantially in schools, however little is known about teachers' perceptions of such programs. This qualitative study explored early childhood (three- to eight-year-old) teachers' perceptions of classroom-based social-emotional programs for young, urban-dwelling children. A focus of the study included learning what teachers believe were the critical components and challenges of such programs. Five themes emerged from the content analysis: Responsibility, Curricula/Program Design, Contextual Relevance, Support, and Barriers.

Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the interactions of the methylated ILs with CuBTC were weaker compared to those of its non-methylated counterpart. Gas uptake measurements illustrated that this difference in the interactions influences the gas separation performance of the composites. Accordingly, the CO2/N2: 15/85 and CH4/N2: 50/50 selectivities increased by 37% and 60% for [BMMIM][PF6]/CuBTC and 34% and 50% for [BMIM][PF6]/CuBTC, respectively, compared to the corresponding selectivities of pristine CuBTC at 1000 mbar. The results revealed another structural parameter controlling the performance of the IL/MOF composites, a novel type of material with rapidly expanding application areas."

Twenty years later, although significant progress had been made in survey efforts in some regions, Canada's spider inventory had only increased by approximately 7% to roughly 1500 species known or expected to occur. The family count had increased to 38 but only two additions were truly novel (five family additions and one family deletion were the result of advances in family-level systematics). The first comprehensive taxonomic checklist of Canadian spider species was published in 2010 documenting the regional distributions of 1376 species representing 42 families (three novel since 1999). From 2010 through 2017 new national records steadily accumulated resulting in the current (2018) Canadian inventory of 1477 species classified in 45 families (one novel since 2010). Although there has been close to a 20% increase in the number of spider species recorded in Canada since 1979, much greater increases have occurred in some of the regional species checklists, indicating increasing knowledge of the regional distribution of species previously recorded elsewhere in Canada. For example the regional checklists for Newfoundland, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island have increased by 69%, 339%, and 520%, respectively.

An example is the migration and leakage of greenhouse gases in the context of geologic carbon sequestration. This study has generated new understanding about how acids erode carbonate fracture surfaces and the positive feedback between reaction and flow. A two-dimensional reactive transport model was developed and used to investigate the extent to which geochemical factors influence fracture permeability and transmissivity evolution in carbonate rocks. The only mineral modeled as reactive is calcite, a fast-reacting mineral that is abundant in subsurface formations. The X-ray computed tomography dataset from a previous experimental study of fractured cores exposed to carbonic acid served as a testbed to benchmark the model simulation results. The model was able to capture not only erosion of fracture surfaces but also the specific phenomenon of channelization, which produces accelerating transmissivity increase. Results corroborated experimental findings that higher reactivity of the influent solution leads to strong channelization without substantial mineral dissolution. Simulations using mineral maps of calcite in a specimen of Amherstburg limestone demonstrated that mineral heterogeneity can either facilitate or suppress the development of flow channels depending on the spatial patterns of reactive mineral. In these cases, fracture transmissivity may increase rapidly, increase slowly, or stay constant, and for all these possibilities, the calcite mineral continues to dissolve. Collectively, these results illustrate that fluid chemistry and mineral spatial patterns need to be considered in predictions of reaction-induced fracture alteration and risks of fluid migration.",Micromorphology analysis of the anterior human lens capsule.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713427,Molecular vision,2019 05 30,This study aimed to quantify the three-dimensional micromorphology of the surface of the human lens capsule as a function of age.,Age-related aqueous humor (AH) and lens epithelial cell/capsule protein carbonylation and AH protein concentration in cataract patients who have pseudoexfoliative diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713426,Molecular vision,2019 05 30,"The aim of this study is to investigate the age-correlation of oxidative stress (OS, assessed by the accumulative OS damage marker protein carbonyls) in aqueous humour (AH; together with protein concentration) and lens epithelial cells plus capsule (LECs/capsule) in patients with cataract (CAT), and also suffering from pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PEX), primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PXG).",Comprehensive characterization of the adult ND4 Swiss Webster mouse retina: Using discovery-based mass spectrometry to decipher the total proteome and phosphoproteome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713425,Molecular vision,2019 05 30,"Diverse groups of proteins play integral roles in both the physiology and pathophysiology of the retina.

Two overpass events during the passage of TC Carlos and eleven non-TC overpass events are used in this study and the GR is taken as the reference. It is shown that the correspondence is dependent on the precipitation type whereby events with more (less) stratiform rainfall usually have a positive (negative) bias in the reflectivity and the rainfall rate whereas in the Do the bias is generally positive but small (large). The COM reflectivity estimates are similar to the PR but it has a smaller bias in the Do for most of the greater stratiform events. This suggests that combining the TMI with the PR adjusts the Do towards the ""correct"" direction if the GR is taken as the reference. Moreover, the association between the TRMM estimates and the GR for the two TC events, which are highly stratiform in nature, is similar to that observed for the highly stratiform non-TC events (there is no significant difference) but it differs largely from that observed for the majority of the highly convective non-TC events.",Physical Layer Cryptographic Key Generation by Exploiting PMD of an Optical Fiber Link.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713365,Journal of lightwave technology : a joint IEEE/OSA publication,2019 02 07,"We present a symmetric physical layer based secret key generation scheme for Point-to-Point Optical Link (PPOL) communication by exploiting Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD) as a random and inimitable channel characteristic.

Furthermore, we considered an attack model of a non-invasive adversary intercepting at 10km into the link and found that the generated keys have high average key bit mismatch rates (>40%).",Synthesis and Complexation of a Free Germanide Bearing a Tridentate N-Heterocyclic Substituent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713362,Organometallics,2019 02 06,"The tris-N-heterocycle germanide (tmim)Ge- (1) (tmimH3 = tris(3-methylindol-2-yl)methane) was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution for the tmim3- trianion on GeCl2·dioxane. In combination with the previously reported (tmim)Si- and (tmim)P analogues, it provides a convenient model for investigating the influence of the central atom on the properties of isoelectronic ligands. Complexation of the germanide (tmim)Ge- to CuCl resulted in the dimeric chloro cuprate [(tmim)GeCu(μ-Cl)]22-, which is prone to dissociation in MeCN to form the neutral, solvated germylcopper (tmim)GeCu(NCMe)3. The reaction of 1 with Fe2(CO)9 afforded the germyl iron tetracarbonyl [(tmim)GeFe(CO)4]-. Analysis of the ν̃(CO) infrared absorption bands in this complex indicates that the combined electron donating and accepting properties of 1 are found in between those of (tmim)P and (tmim)Si-. In contrast to (tmim)Si-, (tmim)Ge- is reluctant to coordinate to FeCl2, likely because of its softer Lewis base character. Key structural features of the ligands and complexes reflect changes in their electronic properties. In particular, the N-Ge-N angles increase upon coordination to a metal fragment, suggesting increasing hybridization of the Ge s- and p-orbitals.

To help address this challenge, we use Hierarchical Bayesian Regression (HBR) with partial pooling to develop six centuries long (1394-2008 C.E.) streamflow reconstructions at three UIB gauges (Doyian, Gilgit, and Kachora), concurrently demonstrating that HBR can be used to reconstruct short records with interspersed missing data. At one gauge (Partab Bridge), with a longer instrumental record (47 years), we develop reconstructions using both Bayesian Regression (BR) and the more conventionally used Principal Components Regression (PCR). The reconstructions produced by PCR and BR at Partab Bridge are nearly identical and yield comparable reconstruction skill statistics, highlighting that the resulting tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow is not dependent on the choice of statistical method. Reconstructions at all four reconstructions indicate flow levels in the 1990s were higher than mean flow for the past six centuries. While streamflow appears most sensitive to accumulated winter (January-March) precipitation and summer (MJJAS) temperature, with warm summers contributing to high flow through increased melt of snow and glaciers, shifts in winter precipitation and summer temperatures cannot explain the anomalously high flow during the 1990s. Regardless, the sensitivity of streamflow to summer temperatures suggests that projected warming may increase streamflow in coming decades, though long-term water risk will additionally depend on changes in snowfall and glacial mass balance.",Due deference to denialism: explaining ordinary people's rejection of established scientific findings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713358,Synthese,2019 02 16,"There is a robust scientific consensus concerning climate change and evolution. But many people reject these expert views, in favour of beliefs that are strongly at variance with the evidence. It is tempting to try to explain these beliefs by reference to ignorance or irrationality, but those who reject the expert view seem often to be no worse informed or any less rational than the majority of those who accept it. It is also tempting to try to explain these beliefs by reference to epistemic overconfidence. However, this kind of overconfidence is apparently ubiquitous, so by itself it cannot explain the difference between those who accept and those who reject expert views. Instead, I will suggest that the difference is in important part explained by differential patterns of epistemic deference, and these patterns, in turn, are explained by the cues that we use to filter testimony. We rely on cues of benevolence and competence to distinguish reliable from unreliable testifiers, but when debates become deeply politicized, asserting a claim may itself constitute signalling lack of reliability.",OSIRIS-REx Contamination Control Strategy and Implementation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713357,Space science reviews,2019 02 14,"OSIRIS-REx will return pristine samples of carbonaceous asteroid Bennu.

This study utilizes experimental results for vertical upflow boiling of FC-72 in a rectangular channel with finite inlet quality to investigate Density Wave Oscillations (DWOs) and assess their potential impact on design of two-phase systems for future space missions. High-speed flow visualization image sequences are presented and used to directly relate the cyclical passage of High and Low Density Fronts (HDFs and LDFs) to dominant low-frequency oscillations present in transient pressure signals commonly attributed to DWOs. A methodology is presented to determine frequency and amplitude of DWO induced pressure oscillations, which are then plotted for a wide range of relevant operating conditions. Mass velocity (flow inertia) is seen to be the dominant parameter influencing frequency and amplitude of DWOs. Amplitude of pressure oscillations is at most 7% of the time-averaged pressure level for current operating conditions, meaning there is little risk to space missions. Reconstruction of experimental pressure signals using a waveform defined by frequency and amplitude of DWO induced pressure fluctuations is seen to have only moderate agreement with the original signal due to the oversimplifications of treating DWO induced fluctuations as perfectly sinusoidal in nature, assuming they occur at a constant frequency value, and neglecting other transient flow features. This approach is nonetheless determined to have potential value for use as a boundary condition to introduce DWOs in two-phase flow simulations should a model be capable of accurately predicting frequency and amplitude of oscillation.",Mechanistic model to predict frequency and amplitude of Density Wave Oscillations in vertical upflow boiling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713350,International journal of heat and mass transfer,2019 02 07,"Modeling of two-phase flow transient behavior and instabilities has traditionally been one of the more challenging endeavors in heat transfer research due to the need to distinguish between a wide range of instability modes systems can manifest depending on differences in operating conditions, as well as the difficulty in experimentally determining key characteristics of these phenomena. This study presents a new mechanistic model for Density Wave Oscillations (DWOs) in vertical upflow boiling using conclusions drawn from analysis of flow visualization images and transient experimental results as a basis from which to begin modeling. Counter to many prior studies attributing DWOs to feedback effects between flow rate, pressure drop, and flow enthalpy causing oscillations in position of the bulk boiling boundary, the present instability mode stems primarily from body force acting on liquid and vapor phases in a separated flow regime leading to liquid accumulation in the near-inlet region of the test section, which eventually departs and moves along the channel, acting to re-wet liquid film along the channel walls and re-establish annular, co-current flow. This process was modeled by dividing the test section into three distinct control volumes and solving transient conservation equations for each, yielding predictions of frequencies at which this process occurs as well as amplitude of associated pressure oscillations. Values for these parameters were validated against an experimental database of 236 FC-72 points and show the model provides good predictive accuracy and capably captures the influence of parametric changes to operating conditions.",Oxygen isotope systematics of chondrules in the Murchison CM2 chondrite and implications for the CO-CM relationship.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713349,Geochimica et cosmochimica acta,2019 05 01,"High-precision oxygen three-isotope measurements of olivine and pyroxene were performed on 29 chondrules in the Murchison CM2 chondrite by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The oxygen isotope ratios of analyzed chondrules all plot very close to the primitive chondrule minerals (PCM) line. In each of 24 chondrules, the olivine and/or pyroxene grains analyzed show indistinguishable oxygen isotope ratios. Exceptions are minor occurrences of isotopically distinguished relict olivine grains, which were found in nine chondrules. The isotope homogeneity of these phenocrysts is consistent with a co-magmatic crystallization of olivine and pyroxene from the final chondrule melts and a significant oxygen isotope exchange between the ambient gas and the melts. Homogeneous type I chondrules with Mg#'s of 98.9-99.5 have host chondrule Δ17O values ranging from -6.0‰ to -4.1‰, with one exception (Δ17O: -1.2‰; Mg#: 99.6). Homogeneous chondrules with Mg#'s <96, including four type II chondrules (Mg# ~65-70), have Δ17O values of around -2.5%. Five type I chondrules (Mg# ≥99) have internally heterogeneous oxygen isotope ratios with Δ17O values ranging from -6.5% to -4.0%, similar to those of host chondrule values. These heterogeneous chondrules have granular or porphyritic textures, convoluted outlines, and contain numerous metal grains dispersed within fine-grained silicates. This is consistent with a low degree of melting of the chondrule precursors, possibly because of a low temperature of the melting event and/or a shorter duration of melting. The Δ17O values of relict olivine grains in nine chondrules range from -17.9% to -3.4%, while most of them overlap the range of the host chondrule values. Similar to those reported from multiple carbonaceous chondrites (Acfer 094, Y-82094, CO, CR, and CV), the Δ17O ~-5% and high Mg# (≥99) chondrules, which might derive from a reduced reservoir with limited dust enrichments (~50× Solar System), dominate the population of chondrules in Murchison. Other chondrules in Murchison formed in more oxidizing environment (Mg#<96) with higher Δ17O values of -2.5%, in agreement with the low Mg# chondrules in Acfer 094 and CO chondrites and some chondrules in CV and CR chondrites. They might form in environments containing the same anhydrous precursors as for the Δ17O ~-5% and Mg# ~99 chondrules, but enriched in 16O-poor H2O ice (~0.3-0.4× the CI dust; Δ170>0%) and at dust enrichments of ~300-2000×. Regarding the Mg# and oxygen isotope ratios, the chondrule populations sampled by CM and CO chondrites are similar and indistinguishable. The similarity of these 16O-rich components in CO and CM chondrites is also supported by the common Fe/Mn ratio of olivine in type II chondrules. Although they accreted similar high-temperature silicates, CO chondrites are anhydrous compared to CM chondrites, suggesting they derived from different parent bodies formed inside and outside the snow line, respectively. If chondrules in CO and CM chondrites formed at the same disk locations but the CM parent body accreted later than the CO parent body, the snow line might have crossed the the common chondrule-forming region towards the Sun between the time of the CO and CM parent bodies accretion."

Here, we studied magnitude and evolution of autophagy in patients with intractable heart failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS Myocardial samples were obtained from 22 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who were undergoing cardiac transplantation. Hearts from 11 patients who died from non-cardiac causes were used as control samples. Autophagy was evaluated by immunostaining with a monoclonal microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II antibody, while the relationship of autophagy with apoptosis and oncosis was assessed by double staining with TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling) assay and complement 9 (C9) immunological staining, respectively. In addition, several necroptotic markers, including RIP1 and RIP3 (receptor interacting protein kinase 1 and 3), anti-C3 (cleaved-caspase-3), and anti-NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Anti-LC3-II staining was detected in 8.7±1.6% of the heart failure patient heart samples and in 1.2±0.3% of control patient heart samples. Vacuole formation started at one nuclear pole, before becoming bipolar and involving the cytosol. Subsequently, the autophagic process extended also to the nuclei, which underwent a progressive vacuolization and disintegration, assuming a peculiar ""strawberry like appearance"". Myocytes with extensive vacuole formation exhibited nuclear degeneration, which was associated with TUNEL, C3, C9, RIP1, and RIP3 positive staining. Conversely, myocytes with less extensive vacuole formation showed RIP1 and NF-κB positive staining, though not positivity for other cell death markers. CONCLUSIONS Autophagy was extensively detected in end-stage heart failure and its progression, resulted in secondary cell death, with occurrence of oncosis and necroptosis exceeding that of apoptosis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The cloud-based platform was created by professional software engineers to educate and manage patients with psoriasis in a single hospital, where patients and research staff had a network platform for sharing data. A total of 79 patients with psoriasis were included in this study and were randomly divided into the control group (n=39) and the intervention group (n=40). Patients in the control group were given a psoriasis nursing manual and underwent regular follow-up. Patients in the intervention group were managed using the cloud platform, with the same management as the control group. The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) were used. RESULTS Cloud-based interactive patient and physician management resulted in clinical improvement, and reduced the degree of anxiety in patients with psoriasis and improved their physical and mental health. Patients in the intervention group had an improved understanding of psoriasis treatment, resulting in an improved relationship with the medical staff and improved treatment compliance. CONCLUSIONS Cloud-based interactive patient and physician management improved the mental health and quality of life for patients with psoriasis and allowed patients to manage their disease more effectively.",New-Onset Diabetes After Renal Transplantation (NODAT): Is It a Risk Factor for Renal Cell Carcinoma or Renal Failure?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713333,Annals of transplantation,2019 06 04,"BACKGROUND Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for renal failure and possibly for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Post-transplantation DM occurs frequently after solid organ transplantation. We investigated whether new-onset diabetes after renal transplantation (NODAT) is a risk factor for RCC or renal failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data of 96,699 discharged patients with and without NODAT were extracted from the 2005-2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, after excluding patients with DM diagnosed at least 1 year prior to renal transplantation. Main outcomes were RCC diagnosis less than 1-year post-transplantation, RCC stage, and renal failure. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with post-transplantation RCC or renal failure. RESULTS Significant differences were found in age and race between patients with and without NODAT (both P<0.001). The renal failure rate was 0.8% (n=1) in NODAT patients and 0.3% (n=314) in those without NODAT. Older age (OR, 1.030; 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.036), male (OR, 1.872; 95% CI: 1.409 to 2.486), Black (OR, 2.199; 95% CI: 1.574 to 3.071) and hospitalization in urban teaching hospitals were associated with increased risk of RCC. CONCLUSIONS Analysis of over 90,000 NIS hospitalizations with diagnosis-coded kidney transplantation suggested that NODAT may not be an independent risk factor for RCC and renal failure.",A Catastrophic Case of Idiopathic Cholesterol Crystal Embolism with Multiple Lethal Complications: A Labyrinth Underneath the Diagnosis of Skin Ulcers in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713332,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 02 04,"A 66-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of multiple refractory skin ulcers. Based on his severe systemic arterial calcification and severe calcium-phosphate imbalance due to severe kidney dysfunction, we initially considered calciphylaxis. However, a skin biopsy provided a diagnosis of cholesterol crystal embolization. Although we initiated hemodialysis, steroid treatment, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol apheresis, he died of multiple intestinal perforation. An autopsy showed cholesterol crystals occluding multiple organ arterioles. This case suggests that skin ulcers in patients with chronic kidney disease may be an important diagnostic hallmark and may be associated with several serious diseases.",Effect of Age on Effectiveness of Vonoprazan in Triple Therapy for Helicobacter pylori Eradication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713328,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"Objective We evaluated the efficacy of vonoprazan-based eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), including the effects of age, gender, and grade of atrophy in comparison to proton pump inhibitor-based therapy. Method We retrospectively reviewed the records of 1,172 patients who received first-line triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and vonoprazan or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for H. pylori eradication, as well as 157 patients treated with second-line therapy consisting of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and vonoprazan or a PPI. Results The eradication rate of all cases treated with first-line triple therapy was 86.9% (1,019/1,172), while that in those treated with vonoprazan-based therapy was 92.5% (384/415). Our analysis showed that the use of vonoprazan resulted in a significantly improved success rate of first-line eradication therapy in comparison to proton pump inhibitor-based therapy [odds ratio (OR), 2.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.55 to 3.56]. The superiority of vonoprazan was remarkable in non-elderly patients, while its effect was unclear in elderly patients. When used as second-line eradication therapy, the advantage of vonoprazan over PPI administration was not clear. Conclusion The inclusion of vonoprazan increased the success rate of first-line eradication therapy; however, the advantage was reduced with aging and remained unclear in elderly patients.",Recent Updates on the Relationship between Cancer and Autoimmune Pancreatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713326,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is now considered a pancreatic manifestation of a newly proposed disease condition, IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IgG4-RD is characterized by enhanced IgG4 antibody responses and multiple organ involvements. Recent epidemiological studies have addressed the incidence of cancer in patients with AIP and/or IgG4-RD. Surprisingly, a significant number of AIP patients were detected with cancer at or within one year of the diagnosis of AIP. Furthermore, around 50% of all cancers detected in AIP patients comprised mainly 3 types (gastric, lung, and prostate cancer). Thus, AIP appears to be associated with cancer of other organs rather than the pancreas itself, which suggests that AIP is not a pre-cancerous condition of the pancreas. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of cancer and AIP in many patients has led to the establishment of an attractive concept that AIP might sometimes arise from co-existing cancers as a paraneoplastic syndrome.",Identification of Everyday Sounds Perceived as Noise by Migraine Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713324,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"Objective Sound hypersensitivity is highly comorbid with migraine headaches. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of migraine attacks, we must first identify the types of everyday environmental sounds they perceive as unpleasant and clarify the acoustic properties of such sounds. This study aimed to clarify the true nature of ""noise,"" i.e. everyday sounds perceived as unpleasant by migraineurs, by evaluating their subjective comfort/discomfort in response to several sounds commonly heard in everyday life. Methods Participants were presented with 20 environmental sounds they would likely hear daily. Subjects rated the pleasantness/unpleasantness of each stimulus using a nine-step scale. Patients We recruited 50 adults with migraine headaches (46 women, 4 men) and 50 healthy controls (35 women, 15 men). Results Migraineurs provided statistically significantly lower (more unpleasant) ratings to ambulance sirens, police car sirens, and railroad crossing bells than did controls. Our analysis also investigated the acoustic characteristics associated with higher rating gaps between the two groups. Greater divergence in ratings for the same stimulus was associated with less power (smaller amplitude envelope) and slower temporal variation in signals in the 400-Hz band. Conclusion We identified specific signal components associated with different subjective (un) pleasantness scores between migraineurs and healthy adults, which may lead to the elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism underlying migraine attacks triggered by sound.",Pulmonary Nocardiosis Caused by Nocardia exalbida in a Patient with Lung Cancer and Radiation Pneumonitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713323,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"We report a case of Nocardia exalbida (N.exalbida)-induced pneumonia in a 70-year old Japanese man with lung cancer and radiation pneumonitis. He initially received doripenem (1.5 g/day) for pneumonia treatment, and N.exalbida was identified by a clone library analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the pneumonia lesion. The doripenem dosage was therefore increased to 3.0 g/day with adjunctive trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and his pneumonia improved. N. exalbida is susceptible to antibiotics; thus, in nocardiosis, N. exalbida infection might be associated with a good response to treatment, although its clinical findings are non-specific and similar to those of other Nocardia infections.",Different Effects on Fluid Distribution between Tolvaptan and Furosemide in a Liver Cirrhosis Patient with Chronic Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713322,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"A 73-year-old man with liver cirrhosis and advanced chronic kidney disease was admitted to our hospital due to bilateral lower leg edema and appetite loss. Furosemide to treat fluid retention markedly decreased extracellular water compared with intracellular water, but the addition of tolvaptan equally decreased both with a greater diuretic response than furosemide alone. Furthermore, tolvaptan administration increased the plasma colloid osmotic pressure, which might facilitate the shift of fluid from the extravascular space to the intravascular space. This is the first case showing different effects on the fluid distribution between furosemide and additional tolvaptan in the same patient.",Clinically Infrequent Arcanobacterium haemolyticum Bacteremia Complicated by Foot Decubitus Ulcer: An Educational Reminder for Primary Care Physicians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713320,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,An 81-year-old Japanese man with no history of diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital for a fever with a new ulcerative lesion on the left heel. Blood cultures on admission grew Arcanobacterium haemolyticum in aerobic bottles. He was therefore diagnosed with A. haemolyticum bacteremia and osteomyelitis complicated with foot decubitus ulcer. He was successfully treated with intravenous antibiotic therapy and debridement of the left heel. Our case and literature review show that it is important to recognize that A. haemolyticum is a systemic causative pathogen in immunocompetent patients in primary care practice.

Following an ileum and colon biopsy, he was diagnosed with gastrointestinal amyloidosis. We suspected familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) based on his history and administered colchicine; his symptoms subsequently improved. Thus, he was diagnosed with atypical FMF. After tocilizumab administration, the amyloid deposits disappeared. This case suggests that physicians should consider FMF even in cases with atypical symptoms in order to prevent the progression of amyloidosis and that amyloid deposits can be eliminated by IL-6 inhibition.",Successful Treatment of Acute Chest Syndrome with Manual Exchange Transfusion in a Patient with Sickle Beta+-thalassemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713307,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"Acute chest syndrome (ACS), characterized by fever, respiratory symptoms, and new pulmonary infiltration, is a serious complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Regardless of the etiology, the conventional treatment options for ACS include empirical antibiotic therapy, the administration of analgesics, and red cell transfusion. The indications and methods of red cell transfusion are critical. We herein report the case of a 26-year-old African-American man with SCD who developed ACS and who was successfully treated with manual exchange transfusion. Despite increasing globalization, SCD remains extremely rare in Japan. Manual exchange transfusion can be performed easily anywhere and should be considered for treating SCD patients presenting with ACS.",Bronchial Thermoplasty for Severe Asthma with Mucus Hypersecretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713306,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"Bronchial thermoplasty (BT), which delivers thermal radiofrequency to the bronchial wall, is an effective therapy for patients with severe persistent uncontrolled asthma. We herein report the case of a 47-year-old man who underwent BT for uncontrolled severe asthma. After BT, his asthma control, asthma-related quality of life, and pulmonary function improved. Furthermore, a histologic examination of transbronchial biopsy specimens revealed a decrease in goblet cell hyperplasia and the smooth muscle mass as well as in the subepithelial basement membrane thickness. BT can be effective for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma and mucus hypersecretion.",Levofloxacin-associated Encephalopathy with Severe Hyperventilation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713304,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 05 16,"A 64-year-old woman with no previous mental illness took a single 500 mg tablet of levofloxacin for cystitis. Two hours later, she developed psychosis with involuntary movement and severe hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging findings were unremarkable, and an electroencephalogram revealed no epileptiform discharge. Her symptoms improved on the third day after levofloxacin was discontinued. Levofloxacin-associated encephalopathy with psychotic features is a rare adverse event. Disturbance of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) interneurons by levofloxacin may lead to hyperventilation via dysfunction of the brainstem respiratory network. Physicians should be aware of hyperventilation as an additional serious symptom of levofloxacin-associated encephalopathy in acute settings.",The Incidence of Nonmalignant Diseases among Patients with Suspected Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Site.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713301,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 05 16,"Objective Few reports have analyzed the diagnostic process of carcinoma of unknown primary site (CUP) or have focused on the frequency of nonmalignant lesions among patients with suspected malignant diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and characteristics of nonmalignant diseases that tend to be mistaken for malignant diseases. Patients We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with suspected CUP who were referred to the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between April 2007 and December 2014. All patients underwent a thorough history and physical examination as well as radiological and ultrasonography imaging tests for the CUP diagnostic work up. Results Among 830 patients with suspected CUP, 46 were diagnosed with nonmalignant diseases, and 780 were diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm (409 neoplasms with detected primary site and 371 CUP neoplasms). Four patients discontinued the diagnostic workup because they refused further examinations or had a poor general status. The final diagnosis of the 46 patients with nonmalignant disease comprised 10 benign tumors, 10 benign diseases, and 26 with no evidence of disease. The nonmalignant tumors comprised three hemangiomas, two schwannomas, two uterine myomas, two pseudomyxoma peritonei, one lymphangioma, one meningioma, and one poroma. Conclusion The incidence of nonmalignant diseases among patients with suspected CUP was 46 out of 830 patients in our institution. It is important to perform a thorough pathological examination in the CUP diagnostic workup. To confirm a diagnosis, some patients may need to visit specialized institutions, especially those with liver and bone lesions.",Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhaging with Hypertensive Emergency: A Rare but Important Cause of Hemoptysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713300,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 05 16,"Hypertensive emergency, which occurs even in young adults, induces systemic organ damage and results in a poor prognosis. We herein report the case of a 27-year-old man who developed alveolar hemorrhaging with hypertensive emergency. He presented with bloody sputum, renal failure, and extremely high blood pressure (200/128 mmHg). Chest computed tomography revealed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhaging. After intensive therapy with anti-hypertensive drugs, the alveolar hemorrhaging disappeared. Renal impairment was partially reversed. Therefore, we conclude that hypertensive emergency should be considered as a possible cause of hemoptysis, even in young adults.",The Early Initiation of Extracorporeal Life Support May Improve the Neurological Outcome in Adults with Cardiac Arrest due to Cardiac Events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713299,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 05 16,"Objective Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is effective for improving the survival rate of patients with refractory cardiac arrest (rCA). As little data are available regarding the impact of ECLS on a favorable neurological outcome, the predictors of a favorable neurological outcome were evaluated in this study. Methods Between January 2007 and August 2016, we retrospectively recruited patients with rCA caused by cardiac events treated with ECLS in our institute. A favorable neurological outcome was defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh cerebral performance category score 1 at discharge. The study endpoint was the clinical outcomes and predictors of favorable neurologic patients at discharge. Results During the study period, 67 patients with CA caused by cardiac events (acute coronary syndrome, 57 patients; idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, 10 patients) were included. Of these, 20 patients (29.9%) were classified into the favorable neurological group. No marked difference was observed in the patient characteristics between those with and without a favorable outcome except for in the time from CA to starting ECLS (ECLS initiation time). A short ECLS initiation time resulted in a favorable outcome (37.8±28.1 minutes vs. 53.6±30.7 minutes, p=0.05). The cut-off time of ECLS initiation was 46 minutes, which was prolonged by the temporary return of spontaneous circulation before ECLS [odds ratio (OR), 3.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.34-10.19; p=0.01] and transfer to the angiographic room (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 1.44-11.53, p=0.008). Conclusion The early initiation of ECLS (within 46 minutes) might be associated with a favorable neurological outcome for patients with rCA caused by cardiac events.",Spontaneous Regression of Recurrent Undifferentiated Carcinoma of the Endometrium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713298,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 03,"We herein report a very rare case of spontaneous regression of recurrent undifferentiated carcinoma of the endometrium. An 80-year-old woman had undergone total hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy for undifferentiated carcinoma of the endometrium. The cancer recurred locally 10 months after surgery and then metastasized to the lung and liver. After she and her family elected to receive supportive care without active treatment, the local recurrences dramatically decreased, and the metastases of the lung, liver, and peritoneum also disappeared. This case showed that spontaneous regression can occur even with malignant tumors showing an extremely poor prognosis, such as undifferentiated carcinoma of the endometrium.",A Phase II Study of Tailored-dose S-1 Plus Carboplatin Followed by Maintenance S-1 for Advanced Squamous Cell Lung Cancer: OSAKA-LCSG 1102.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713297,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 05 16,"Objective A subset analysis of the LETS study suggested that S-1 plus carboplatin was more beneficial than paclitaxel plus carboplatin in terms of the overall survival (OS) in squamous cell lung cancer. However, the benefit of maintenance therapy for squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is still unknown. We herein report a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a tailored dose of S-1 plus carboplatin followed by maintenance S-1 in chemotherapy-naive advanced squamous cell NSCLC. Methods Patients received carboplatin on day 1 plus S-1 on days 1 to 14 every 21 days. The dose of S-1 was determined by the body surface area and creatinine clearance. After four cycles of induction, non-progressive patients continued to receive S-1 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The primary endpoint was an objective response rate (RR) with a threshold value of 15%. The secondary endpoints were the progression-free survival (PFS) and OS from enrollment, the PFS in the maintenance phase, and safety. Results In the 33 patients analyzed, the rate of patients who met the primary endpoint was 30.3% (95% confidence interval: 15.6-48.7%), and the disease control rate was 75.8%. The median PFS and OS were 3.5 and 11.3 months, respectively. Ten patients received maintenance S-1, and the median PFS from the beginning of induction treatment was 5.3 months. Grade 3/4 toxicities with a frequency of more than 5% were all controllable.

Ninety-five dentin discs were ground flat with diamond burs and divided into 5 groups; no treatment (control), brushing with a custom-made brush for 10 and 30 s without and with ultrasonic application. The smear layer thickness was evaluated using SEM. The 24 h µSBS of Clearfil SE Bond (CSE) and Clearfil Tri S Bond (CTS) to these dentin surfaces were evaluated. Smear layer thickness decreased significantly from control, brushing without, and brushing with ultrasonic groups, respectively. The µSBS of CSE were higher than CTS in all groups. The µSBS were improved with ultrasonic brushing for 30 s for both adhesives.

These two groups were further divided based on the treatment received: Group A: Icon®, Group B: Opalustre®+Clinpro White Varnish®, and Group C: Opalustre®+Tooth Mousse®. The spectrophotometric values were recorded. Furthermore, the L* and ΔE values were evaluated by repeated measures of ANOVA. The largest increase in L* values over time after treatment was in Group 1A, followed by Group 1C and Group 1B. The largest increase in ΔE values over time after treatment was in Group 1A.

Artificial enamel caries at various stages of demineralization were created in bovine tooth enamel using a modified lactic acid gel system. Untreated enamel served as a control. OCT images from cross-sections of enamel were collected. Mineral density, distribution, and histological changes were analyzed using an electron probe microanalyzer, scanning electron microscopy, and contact microradiography. The Raman spectrum and X-ray structural analysis of the enamel surfaces were determined. SS-OCT detected significant differences in mineral loss among the samples. A high-brightness image was confirmed, along with changes in the respective brightness graphs proportionate to the degree of demineralization. SS-OCT can potentially be used to evaluate the progression of incipient enamel carious lesions.",Long-term water sorption and solubility of experimental bioactive composites based on amorphous calcium phosphate and bioactive glass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713282,Dental materials journal,2019 02 04,"The aim of this study was to evaluate water sorption and solubility of two series of experimental composites containing amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) or bioactive glass (BG).

The ACP-series showed higher water sorption (223-568 µg/mm3) than the BG-series (40-232 µg/mm3). In contrast, the ACP-series had generally lower solubility (37-106 µg/mm3) than the BG-series (1-506 µg/mm3). The constant specimen mass for the ACP-series was attained after 14 days of water immersion, while the mass decrease due to long-term solubility in the BG-series lasted beyond 287 days. Calcium phosphates precipitated in composites with the BG filler loading of 10 wt% or more, as well as in all of the ACP-containing composites.

However, BPs could cause osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), known as bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). ONJ is associated with severe pain and deteriorated quality of life. ONJ is also caused by administration of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL), that functions as a powerful antiresorptive agent. Accordingly, antiresorptive agent-related ONJ (ARONJ) has been advocated, the incidence of which is continuing to increase in Japan as a super-aging society. Importantly, the jawbone is more susceptible to infection compared with bones in other parts of the body, due to the unique anatomical and physiological characteristics; for example, the jawbone with a high remodeling rate is stimulated by teeth during mastication. The risk factors of ARONJ include dental infection, poor occlusal or oral hygiene status, and bone-invasive dental treatment, such as tooth extraction, dental implants, and dentures. Proper collaboration between doctors and dentists is of utmost importance to understand the current status of ARONJ and prevent developing ARONJ. It is also important to ensure that the patients treated with BPs or denosumab can receive appropriate dental treatment. More recently, angiogenesis inhibitors were reported to cause ONJ; thus, medication-related ONJ (MRONJ) has been advocated. This article overviews the concept of MRONJ by focusing on antiresorptive agents and the status of BRONJ in Japan.",Design and Synthesis of Triazole-Phthalimide Hybrids with Anti-inflammatory Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713279,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 02 04,"Phthalimido-alkyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole derivatives 3a-d and 4a-d were efficiently synthesized using 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. Anti-inflammatory activity and toxicity studies were performed. The results demonstrated that all the tested compounds reduced carrageenan-induced paw edema and indicated no lethality for toxicity against Artemia salina and acute toxicity in vivo (LD50 up to 1 g kg -1). Furthermore, the structure of phthalimide linked to phenyl group proved to be more active than the compounds containing benzothiazole moiety. Structural modifications such as removal of the phthalimide group and subsequent acetylation, to exemplify a non-cyclic amide, demonstrate that the phthalimide and triazole moieties are important for design of potent candidates with anti-inflammatory drug proprieties. Docking into the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) confirms the importance of the phthalimide and triazole groups in the anti-inflammatory activity.

The metabolites were extracted using acetonitrile-methanol-0.1% formic acid (60 : 20 : 20 (v/v)) and analyzed on an Acclaim C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm i.d., 3 µm) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The method was linear in the range of 10-80 ng/mL. Limit of detection and limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method were 5 and 10 ng/mL respectively. Extensive stability studies demonstrated the analytes to be stable in stock and matrix with a percent change within the acceptable range of ±15%. Comparison of the newly developed HPLC-DBS method with the reported LC-MS-DBS and electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) methods followed by Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated a bias of 0.08 and -0.14, respectively proving the methods are comparable. Application of the developed method to a pediatric seizure cohort depicted 46.6% of cases as deficient and 26.6% as insufficient for 25-(OH)D. Among deficient cases 8 samples were below 10 ng/mL and exact amount was not calculated since these were below the LOQ levels. The mean  ±  standard deviation (S.D.) in the remaining 6 deficient cases was 13.22 ± 2.80 ng/mL. The levels in healthy infants were 33.9 ± 6.11 ng/mL. The method can be used routinely for assessing 25-(OH)D deficiency in newborn.",Two New Triterpene Glycosides in the Roots of Uraria crinita.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713277,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 02 04,"Two new triterpene glycosides, 24-deoxyoxytrogenin 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1→2)[β-D-glucopyranosyl]-β-D-galactopyranosyl (1→2)-β-D-glucuronopyranoside and sophoradiol 3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl (1→2)-β-D-glucuronopyranosyl (1→2)-β-D-glucuronopyranoside with four known glycosides were isolated from a Chinese natural medicine, the roots of Uraria crinita (L.)

CD13 is involved in inflammatory diseases and cancers. A convenient and reliable laboratory test method for detecting the suppressing effects of enzyme activity would be useful for study of CD13 inhibitors. Porcine CD13 (pCD13) was traditionally considered an enzyme source but has significant practical disadvantages. pCD13 is not a human source, and the accuracy and reliability of experimental results are greatly reduced. In this study, a modified detection method with K562-CD13 monoclonal cells, a human-derived cell line, was established to detect the suppressing effects of enzyme activity by the CD13 inhibitor. In this method, K562-CD13 monoclonal cells were used as enzyme source and L-leucine p-nitroaniline hydrochloride as substrate. Using CD13 enzyme activity analyses, we found that the ability of the catalytic substrate was weaker in K562 cells than in the other cell lines, and K562-CD13 cells expressed significantly higher levels of CD13 enzyme activity than parental K562 cells. The enzyme activity of CD13 was detected with the new method after ubenimex treatment. The enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by ubenimex in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, this study proposes a sensitive, stable, and objective laboratory method for detecting the inhibitory effect of the CD13 inhibitor.",Synthesis of the Non Reducing End Oligosaccharides of Glycosphingolipids from Ascaris suum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713275,Chemical & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 02 04,"Stereocontrolled syntheses of biotin-labeled oligosaccharide portions containing the non reducing end oligosaccharides of glycosphingolipids from Ascaris suum have been accomplished.

To produce experimental tooth movement in rats, orthodontic force was applied to the upper first molars with a nickel-titanium closed coil. The right molars were irradiated with an Er:YAG laser while the non-irradiated left molars were used as controls. The rats were sacrificed at 4 weeks after the start of tooth movement and the distance between the mesial side of the second molar and the distal side of the upper first molar was measured on CT images. The amount of tooth movement was significantly greater in the irradiation group than in the control group. The TRAP-positive nuclei count at the pressure site was higher in the laser-irradiation group than in the control group. Expression of RANKL and ALP was higher at the mesial-coronal pressure site in the laser-irradiation group than in the control group. In addition, expression of OPG was higher at the pressure site in the control group than in the laser-irradiation group. These results suggest that a fiberotomy-like procedure using an Er:YAG laser stimulates osteoclasts and osteoblasts and may promote bone metabolism in the context of experimental tooth movement.",Effect of mechanical strain-induced PGE2 production on bone nodule formation by rat calvarial progenitor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713263,Journal of oral science,2019 03 28,"High-magnitude mechanical strain inhibits bone nodule formation by reducing expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and muscle segment homeobox 2 (Msx2). Mechanical strain also induces production of proinflammatory factor prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by osteoblasts. We measured the effect of mechanical strain-induced PGE2 production on bone nodule formation and expression levels of bone formation-related factors. Osteoblast-like cells isolated from fetal rat calvariae were loaded with 18% cyclic tension force (TF) for 48 h in the presence or absence of NS-398, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2. To investigate the effect of TF-induced PGE2 on bone formation, bone nodule area on day 21 was measured by von Kossa staining. BMP-2, Runx2, and Msx2 expression levels were examined at 1 day after TF loading. Bone nodule formation was significantly inhibited by TF but was restored to control level by PGE2 inhibition. Furthermore, TF loading-induced reductions in expressions of these factors were restored to control level by PGE2 suppression. These results indicate that PGE2 production induced by high-magnitude mechanical strain inhibits bone nodule formation by reducing expression levels of bone formation-related factors.",The Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study for the Next Generation (JPHC-NEXT): Study design and participants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713262,Journal of epidemiology,2019 02 04,"Lifestyle and life-environment factors have undergone drastic changes in Japan over the last few decades.

This immunological defense mechanism suppresses cellular translation process and can reduce transfection efficiency to a considerable extent. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro effects of Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor (ISRIB), and dexamethasone, a steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, on the transfection activity of a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that was composed of ionizable lipids and IVT-mRNA. In the case of transfection to mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, ISRIB mainly enhanced the transfection activity at an early stage of transfection (0-6 h). In contrast, dexamethasone caused an increase in transfection activity at intermediate-late stages of transfection (4-48 h). We also investigated the in vivo effects of dexamethasone using an LNP on that the IVT-mRNA and lipid-conjugated dexamethasone (Dex-Pal) were co-loaded. The intravenous administration of the LNP successfully enhanced the protein expression in a mouse liver by up to 6.6-fold. Collectively, the co-delivery of an anti-inflammatory drug is a promising approach for enhancing transfection efficiency of IVT-mRNA.",Assessment of Inhibitory Effects of Hypnotics on Acetylcholine-Induced Contractions in Isolated Rat Urinary Bladder Smooth Muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713259,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 02 04,"The present study aimed to investigate the potential inhibitory effects of 21 clinically available hypnotics on acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contractions in rat urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM) in order to predict whether these hypnotics could induce voiding impairment. ACh-induced contraction in rat UBSM was inhibited only by diphenhydramine (a histamine H1 receptor antagonist) at a concentration that was clinically relevant. ACh-induced contraction was also significantly inhibited by flurazepam (a benzodiazepine hypnotic) and suvorexant (an orexin receptor antagonist), albeit at concentrations that substantially exceeded clinically achievable blood levels. These three drugs (at 10-5 M) also inhibited high-KCl (80 mM) Locke-Ringer solution-induced contractions. In contrast to the effects of the abovementioned hypnotics, ACh-induced contractions were not significantly affected by triazolam, etizolam, brotizolam, lormetazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam (benzodiazepine hypnotics), thiopental, thiamylal, pentobarbital, amobarbital, secobarbital, phenobarbital (barbiturate hypnotics), zolpidem (an imidazopyridine hypnotic), zopiclone (a cyclopyrrolone hypnotic), ramelteon (a melatonin receptor agonist), bromovalerylurea, and chloral hydrate. These findings suggest that most clinically used hypnotics are not likely to result in anticholinergic-induced dysuria within their clinically achievable blood concentration ranges. Diphenhydramine may, however, induce voiding impairment, an action attributable to diminished UBSM contractility within its clinical dose range.",Hepatic and Intrahepatic Targeting of Hydrogen Sulfide Prodrug by Bioconjugation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713258,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 02 04,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gaseous transmitter known to play an important role in biological functions. For the hepatic and intrahepatic targeting of H2S prodrug at the cellular level, we developed two types of sulfo-albumins, in which five sulfide groups (source of H2S) were covalently bound to succinylated (Suc) or galactosylated (Gal) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Sulfo-BSA-Suc and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-Sulfo-BSA-Gal, both released H2S in the 5 mM glutathione solution, but not in the plasma. Sulfo-BSA-Suc and PEG-Sulfo-BSA-Gal were taken up by RAW264.7 cells (mouse macrophage-like cells) and Hep G2 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cells), respectively, and H2S was released. These results indicate that Sulfo-BSA-Suc and PEG -Sulfo-BSA-Gal selectively released H2S intracellularly. In a biodistribution study, up to 80% of 111In-labeled Sulfo-BSA-Suc and PEG-Sulfo-BSA-Gal rapidly accumulated in the liver, 30 min after intravenous injection in mice. Furthermore, 111In-labeled Sulfo-BSA-Suc and PEG-Sulfo-BSA-Gal predominantly accumulated in liver nonparenchymal (endothelial cells and Kupffer cells) and parenchymal cells (hepatocytes), respectively. These findings suggest that targeted delivery of H2S prodrug to a specific type of liver cells was successfully achieved by bioconjugation.",Resistance of Fetal Guinea Pig Ventricular Myocardium to Hypoxia: Maintained Intracellular ATP Prevents the Opening of ATP-Sensitive Potassium Channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713257,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 02 04,"The presence and function of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel current (IKATP) were examined in the guinea pig myocardium to clarify the mechanisms for the resistance of the fetal myocardium to hypoxia. Experimental hypoxia markedly reduced the action potential duration and contractile force in isolated ventricular myocardium from the adult, but only moderately in those from the fetus. In isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes, the density of the IKATP activated by cromakalim, as well as their sensitivity to intracellular ATP concentration, were not different between the fetus and adult. The tissue ATP content was similar between the fetal and adult myocardium under normal condition, but the hypoxia-induced decrease was smaller in the fetus. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that the mitochondria in the fetal cardiomyocyte is less in quantity than that in the adult and is more localized to the cell center. These results indicate that IKATP in the fetal guinea pig myocardium has a current density and ATP sensitivity similar to those of the adult, but is not activated under hypoxic conditions because the energy metabolism of the fetal myocardium is less dependent on oxidative phosphorylation.","Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 3,9-Dioxatetraasteranes as C2-Symmetric HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors and Docking Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713256,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 02 04,"A series of tetraethyl 2,4,8,10-tetramethyl-6,12-diaryl-3,9-dioxahexacyclo[6.4.0.02,7.04,11.05,10]dodecane-1,5,7,11-tetracarboxylates (simplified as 3,9-dioxatetraasteranes) with C2-symmetric structural characteristics were synthesized through the [2 + 2] photocycloaddition of the diethyl 2,6-dimethyl-4-aryl-4H-pyran-3,5-dicarboxylates. Besides, their anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 activities were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay against HIV-1 (IIIB) replication in MT-4 cell culture. The result showed that the tested compounds exhibited potential activates with IC50 values less than 110 nM. Furthermore, docking study was carried out to study the binding mode of these compounds. The results indicated that the overall orientation of the inhibitors in the active site were similar to that of the cyclic urea AHA001 and a hydrogen bond with the protein residues might play a crucial role in their anti-HIV-1 activities.

Multiple clinical studies using natural compounds such as flavonoids have been conducted to treat NAFLD. In the present study, the pharmacological effect of Citrus aurantium L. (Rutaceae) peel extract (CAE), which contains over 27% of polymethoxyflavone nobiletin, on NAFLD was evaluated using a high-fat diet (HFD) animal model susceptible to developing NAFLD. C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD (60% kcal of energy derived from fat) for 8 weeks to induce obesity. Obese mice were randomly allocated to four groups of eight mice each (HFD alone, HFD with silymarin, HFD with 50 mg/kg CAE, and HFD with 100 mg/kg CAE). After 8 weeks of treatment, all mice were euthanized, and plasma and liver tissues were analyzed biochemically and histopathologically. The results indicate that CAE treatment significantly reduced HFD-induced NAFLD, as shown by decreased serum lipid index and prevented liver histopathology. The expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis including free fatty acid (FFA), peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), sterol receptor element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), and fatty acid synthesis enzyme was suppressed by CAE treatment. Moreover, compared to untreated mice, CAE-treated HFD mice showed decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. These results demonstrated that CAE prevented HFD-induced NAFLD by reducing plasma levels of triglyceride and cholesterol and de novo lipid synthesis."

The reactor comprised a polytetrafluoroethylene tube, a quartz container, and a low-pressure mercury lamp that predominantly emitted radiation at around 185 nm. When the hydroxyl radical and Ru(bpy)33+ were in contact, chemiluminescence was generated as background emission. The background emission decreased when antioxidant samples were injected to the system. The antioxidant property of the naturally occurring antioxidants tested are listed herein, starting with the highest: gallic acid>ascorbic acid>quercetin. Moreover, our method allowed a sample throughput of approximately 100 samples/h.

Tipepidine hibenzate is prescribed in the pediatric field in combination with ambroxol hydrochloride and l-carbocysteine. The volumes of water needed to achieve the paste state of ambroxol hydrochloride between the original and generic drugs were similar. However, the volumes of water needed for l-carbocysteine markedly differed between the original and generic drugs due to differences in their additives. The spreadability of the mixture when water was added to the powders was evaluated using a spread meter. Among the powders tested in the present study, the yield value to achieve a paste state with the addition of water was approximately 1000 dyne/cm2. The optimum volume of water estimated from this yield value using the linear proportional relationship for the amount of powder may be applied to the mixture of each pediatric power for dosage/body weight.",[Transition of the Field from Biochemical Engineering to Pharmaceutical Sciences during 40 Years of the Research].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713241,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"This review reflects back over almost 40 years of the author's basic research conducted at Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Japan.

At that time, the main research purpose was to solve global environmental issues for maintaining human health. The author's achievements included novel useful material production system under inorganic conditions and genetically engineered whole-cell bacterial sensors detecting arsenite by naked eye without a detecting device. Another theme in the lab was to construct bioartificial liver support system. Various scaffolds for hepatocytes were newly prepared for constructing the compact reactor. Besides the bioreactor study, the author conducted cell transplantation research for the treatment of chronic liver diseases. It was shown that mesenchymal stem cells derived from third molars (wisdom teeth) could differentiate into hepatocytes and exhibit therapeutic effects in liver-damaged animals. After 2006, the lab started research on drug delivery systems, including noninvasive delivery of drugs such as peptides and nucleic acids by regulating epithelial tight junctions. Many substances enabling drug delivery through ""paracellular"" route were newly prepared. The author started basic research on Biochemical Engineering in the 1970s.

Recently, novel far-red to near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes have been developed: Si-rhodamines (SiRs), in which the O atom of conventional rhodamine dyes at the 10 position of the xanthene moiety is replaced with a Si atom. These SiRs are excellent long-wavelength fluorophores for bioimaging, as they retain the advantageous photophysical properties of conventional rhodamine dyes. Further, we focused on the QSY dark quenchers, which contain the rhodamine scaffold bearing aromatic rings at the N atoms at the 3,6-positions of the xanthene moiety; these show no fluorescence, irrespective of solvent polarity and pH. NIR fluorescent probes based on the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism have various practical advantages, and their molecular design is generally based on the use of NIR dark quenchers as cleavable FRET acceptors. However, few NIR dark quenchers can quench fluorescence in the Cy7 region (over 780 nm). We successfully developed SiR-based NIR dark quenchers (SiNQs) which show broad absorption covering this region. To demonstrate their usefulness, we designed and synthesized a NIR fluorescence probe for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity using SiNQs. The developed probe was able to detect MMP activity in terms of NIR fluorescence, not only in vitro, but also in cultured cells and in a tumor-bearing mouse, in which the tumor was clearly visualized.",[Fluorescent Peptide Tools for Studying the Self-association of Membrane Proteins].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713239,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"Detecting the behaviors of proteins in membranes is often challenging; we need to develop new methods to better understand the mechanisms involved.

One of the long-standing problems of most reported photolabile protecting groups is the requirement for one-photon activation, of ultraviolet light (250-400 nm), that is harmful to living cells and has low tissue penetration power. An attractive approach to overcome this would be the use of longer-wavelength light for one-photon activation; advantages would include both lower phototoxicity and higher tissue penetration power than UV irradiation. As part of our research aimed at developing new photochemical tools, we have developed the N-methyl-7-hydroxyquinolinium (N-Me-7-HQm) caging chromophore as a novel photocage, sensitive to visible light. A key to the success of the development of the N-Me-7-HQm photocage was simple N-methylation of the 7-hydroxyquinoline chromophore. This modification allows access to visible light absorbance, facile photoactivation by blue-LED light (458 nm) with high photolytic efficiency, excellent water solubility, and high resistance to spontaneous hydrolysis. The success of the late stage upgrading of a chromophore in the synthetic sequence suggests that further functionalization of the caging chromophore will be possible, and should aid in the rapid generation of structurally diverse libraries of visible light-sensitive photocages.",[Overview of Analytical Techniques for Evaluation of Nano-DDS Formulations].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713236,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,2019 04 22,"Nanotechnology-based formulations have attracted much attention as delivery tools for a variety of payloads.

These documents include the concept of quality by design (QbD) approach, as described in the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines. The quality attributes that affect efficacy and safety of nanotechnology-based drug products should be identified to establish the entire picture of the drug products. Hence it is essential to develop analytical methods for characterizing these attributes. Furthermore, to evaluate the comparability of nano-drug delivery system (DDS) formulations before and after changes to their manufacturing process, it is desirable to characterize the key attributes using more than one analytical method for each. Standardization of these analytical methods is underway.

At this memorable and nostalgic phase of my life, I am sharing here a personal account of the research I conducted and the researchers I met during my stay in San Diego."

The metal mesh devices with hole diameters of 1.7 and 0.3 μm transmitted electromagnetic waves with frequencies of approximately 100 and 285 THz, respectively. These spectral frequencies shifted depending on the adsorption amount of protein. The slope in the linear relationship between the adsorption amount and spectral shift (i.e. sensitivity) of the metal mesh device with a hole diameter of 0.3 μm was seven times as great as that of the device with a hole diameter of 1.7 μm. These results agreed with the theoretical concept of the sensitivity for the metal mesh device sensor being proportional to the square of the transmittance frequency. As biosensors, the structurally refined metal mesh devices amplified the output signals.",A Conjugated Polymer Fluorescent Sensor for Continuous Identification of Copper(II) and Pyrophosphate in Blood Serum and Synovial Fluid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713218,Analytical sciences : the international journal of the Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry,2019 06 10,"A novel ""on-off-on"" super-sensitive conjugated polymer fluorescence sensor (PPE-DPA) was developed and it was applied to realize the continuous recognition of Cu2+ and pyrophosphate (PPi).

This study aimed to provide a comprehensive profile of the mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in rats treated with 6-OHDA as a model of PD. Female SPF Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups: a PD model group and a control group. The PD model was induced by 6-OHDA injection. RNA-seq analysis was performed on 6-OHDA-treated rats and corresponding controls. Novel lncRNAs were identified. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in the PD group compared with controls. Gene Ontology function and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted on the DEGs, followed by construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In addition, prediction of lncRNA target genes and function prediction of lncRNAs were performed. Moreover, microRNAs (miRNAs) that interacted with the DEGs and differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted to construct a miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA regulatory network. A total of 536 DEGs and 512 differentially expressed lncRNAs (44 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated known lncRNAs; 407 up-regulated and 51 down-regulated novel lncRNAs) were identified in the PD rat model compared with controls. The DEGs and target genes of lncRNAs were mainly associated with the innate immune response, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity, GTPase activity, GTP binding and the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway. IRF7 and ISG15 were hub proteins in the PPI network. Many mRNAs and lncRNAs interacted with other molecules in a competing endogenous RNA network, such as MAS1, TMPRSS2, NPTX1, XLOC_016191, XLOC_026924 and XLOC_005439. We conclude that IRF7, ISG15, MAS1, TMPRSS2, NPTX1, XLOC_016191, XLOC_026924 and XLOC_005439 may contribute critical roles in the pathogenesis of PD.",Common Genetic Variants on Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor Type IB (BMPR1B) Gene Are Predictive for Carotid Intima-Media Thickness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713213,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2019 03 25,"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) 2 and 4 are implicated in the development of atherosclerosis.

It explores what a genealogy of secular modernity can and cannot accomplish, asking how to build on Blumenberg's legacy without repeating his errors. Blumenberg absorbed the skepticism of a genealogy of secularism and responded with an unrealistic image of disconnected modernity, while also understanding that modernity might contain normative resources of its own not requiring the redemptive efforts of secularizing translation. The legitimacy of the modern age involves not only the secularizing redemption of religious norms but also a search for sources of profane hope beyond the confines of tradition.","Archives, Thresholds, Discontinuities: Blumenberg and Foucault on Historical Substantialism and the Phenomenology of History.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713209,Journal of the history of ideas,2019 03 29,"Blumenberg's The Legitimacy of the Modern Age was published in the same year as Foucault's The Order of Things (1966). Both books attempt to grasp certain not altogether self-evident changes in the Western history of knowledge and attempt new methods of considering these discontinuities and the so-called ""thresholds"" between epochs. Beyond such general points of shared interest, one must ask if Blumenberg and Foucault share other intellectual features, for they both developed strong philosophical critiques of Husserlian and Heideggerian approaches to history, critiques that arose from their shared hostility to a kind of ""historicism,"" alongside their refusal of any ""substance.""",Modernity as Theodicy: Odo Marquard Reads Hans Blumenberg's <i>The Legitimacy of the Modern Age</i>.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713208,Journal of the history of ideas,2019 03 29,"Especially in the second part of The Legitimacy of the Modern Age, Hans Blumenberg considered philosophical modernity through a reflection on theodicy. Theodicy even appeared here as constitutive for modernity, although this philosophical project of defending God against the existence of evil had been challenged several times in the past centuries. This role of theodicy in Legitimacy has been emphasized by Blumenberg's readers, particularly Odo Marquard. This article shows how debates on modernity and theodicy actually played a more central role in the early reception of Blumenberg's book than his debates with Karl Löwith or Carl Schmitt on secularization.",Life without Toothache: Hans Blumenberg's <i>Zettelkasten</i> and History of Science as Theoretical Attitude.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713207,Journal of the history of ideas,2019 03 29,"The notion of a ""theoretical attitude"" [theoretische Einstellung or Haltung] is of central importance to Blumenberg's work, and particularly so in his writings on the history of science. From The Legitimacy of the Modern Age onwards, Blumenberg used this notion to insist on a continuity between scientific and humanistic modes of inquiry despite their different methodologies, and he attached a strong moral significance to the theoretical attitude he sees them as sharing. This essay traces the emphasis on such an attitude in Blumenberg's work on the sciences and technology, and it historicizes Blumenberg's focus on the concept."

This results in several challenges: First, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) struggle to interpret and apply the regulations because they are often vague and inconsistent. Second, applying the regulations to subjects who fit within multiple categories of vulnerability can lead to contradictions and the rejection of research that would be permissible if only one category were applicable. Finally, some potential subjects have social and other context-based vulnerabilities that are not described in the federal regulations and therefore not considered in IRB deliberations. IRBs and investigators lack guidance on how to address the problem of multiple vulnerabilities in a way that strikes a balance between protection and respect for persons. In this essay, we evaluate the acceptability of the existing federal regulations with respect to research participants with multiple vulnerabilities, offer strategies for rethinking the concept of vulnerability, and outline a context-based normative framework to account for the compounding effects of multiple vulnerabilities.",Microaggressions in Clinical Medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713193,Kennedy Institute of Ethics journal,2019 05 02,"This paper proposes a victim-centered account of microaggressions within the context of clinical medicine.

Section F, Structural biology communications",2019 05 28,"Experiments were carried out on 15 different protein crystals with the objective of estimating the rates of penetration of dye molecules into the crystals. The dyes were in the molecular-weight range 250-1000 Da and the protein crystals were of dimensions of 0.7 mm or greater. Experiments were also conducted on protein crystals grown between glass cover slips (separation 200 µm) that restricted the direction of diffusion. The rate of penetration of dyes into protein crystals depends very much on the degree of association between the dye and protein molecules. Dye penetration was not consistent with pure diffusion when the affinity of the protein for the dye was significant, and this was frequent. Penetration rates were less dependent on factors such as the molecular weight of the dye or the diffusion direction. For weakly interacting protein crystal/dye combinations, penetration was a fair measure of diffusivity and the observed rates were in the range 60-100 µm h-1. For strongly interacting combinations, the rates of penetration were of the order of 15-30 µm h-1.",Iterative screen optimization maximizes the efficiency of macromolecular crystallization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713164,"Acta crystallographica.

After designing a novel high-throughput crystallization screen to take full advantage of this method, the value of ISO is demonstrated by using it to successfully crystallize a panel of six diverse proteins.

Section F, Structural biology communications",2019 05 28,"Neutron protein crystallography (NPC) reveals the three-dimensional structures of proteins, including the positions of H atoms. The technique is particularly suited to elucidate ambiguous catalytic steps in complex biochemical reactions. While NPC uniquely complements biochemical assays and X-ray structural analyses by revealing the protonation states of ionizable groups at and around the active site of enzymes, the technique suffers from a major drawback: large single crystals must be grown to compensate for the relatively low flux of neutron beams. However, in addition to revealing the positions of hydrogens involved in enzyme catalysis, NPC has the advantage over X-ray crystallography that the crystals do not suffer radiation damage. The lack of radiation damage can be exploited to conduct in crystallo parametric studies. Here, the use of a single crystal of the small GTPase Ras to collect three neutron data sets at pD 8.4, 9.0 and 9.4 is reported, enabling an in crystallo titration study using NPC. In addition to revealing the behavior of titratable groups in the active site, the data sets will allow the analysis of allosteric water-mediated communication networks across the molecule, particularly regarding Cys118 and three tyrosine residues central to these networks, Tyr32, Tyr96 and Tyr137, with pKa values expected to be in the range sampled in our experiments.",Crystallization and X-ray analysis of monodisperse human properdin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713161,"Acta crystallographica.

The first published structure of the apo ligand-binding domain (LBD) of RXRα, which is still used as a reference today, contained inaccuracies. In the present work, these inaccuracies were corrected using modern crystallographic tools. The most important correction concerns the presence of a π-bulge in helix H7, which was originally built as a regular α-helix. The presence of several CHAPS molecules, which are visible for the first time in the electron-density map and which stabilize the H1-H3 loop, which contains helix H2, are also revealed. The apo RXR structure has played an essential role in deciphering the molecular mode of action of NR ligands and is still used in numerous biophysical studies. This refined structure should be used preferentially in the future in interpreting experiments as well as for modelling and structural dynamics studies of the apo RXRα LBD.",Structure of an Influenza A virus N9 neuraminidase with a tetrabrachion-domain stalk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713159,"Acta crystallographica.

The diet plays a pivotal role in maintaining healthy gut microbiota composition and its fermentation leads to production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate. During pancreatic dysfunction, insulin mediated suppression of glucagon is impaired leading to uncontrolled glucose production by liver and state of hyperglycemia. Insulin and glucagon balance is as important as insulin sensitivity which is reduced during Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP1) produced by Intestinal epithelial cells regulates insulin and glucagon secretion directly via GLP1 receptor on pancreatic cells or via nervous system. But half-life period of GLP1 is very short i.e. about 2 min, after which it is cleaved and inactivated. SCFAs are well documented to induce GLP1 but its direct effect on pancreatic dysfunction has not been reported. This review opens a new avenue to study the role of SCFAs as treatment to pancreatic dysfunction and T2D."

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) enables multiplexed assessment of the abundance and localization of more than 30 proteins on the same tissue section at 1-μm resolution. Herein, we have developed a panel of 33 antibodies that allows for the quantification of key cell types including pancreatic exocrine cells, islet cells, immune cells, and stromal components. We employed this panel to analyze 12 pancreata obtained from donors with clinically diagnosed T1D and 6 pancreata from non-diabetic controls. In the pancreata from donors with T1D, we simultaneously visualized significant alterations in islet architecture, endocrine cell composition, and immune cell presentation.

IMC enabled simultaneous measurement of 35 biomarkers with single-cell and spatial resolution. We performed pseudotime analysis of islets through T1D progression from snapshot data to reconstruct the evolution of β cell loss and insulitis. Our analyses revealed that β cell destruction is preceded by a β cell marker loss and by recruitment of cytotoxic and helper T cells. The approaches described herein demonstrate the value of IMC for improving our understanding of T1D pathogenesis, and our data lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and follow-on experiments.",Diet Evolution and Habitat Contraction of Giant Pandas via Stable Isotope Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713107,Current biology : CB,2019 02 19,"The ancestral panda Ailurarctos lufengensis, excavated from the late Miocene, is thought to be carnivorous or omnivorous [1]. Today, giant pandas exclusively consume bamboo and have distinctive tooth, skull, and muscle characteristics adapted to a tough and fibrous bamboo diet during their long evolution [1, 2]. A special feature, the pseudo-thumb, has evolved to permit the precise and efficient grasping of bamboo [3, 4]. Unlike those of extant pandas, little is known about the diet and habitat preferences of extinct pandas. Prevailing studies suggest that the panda shifted to specialized bamboo feeding in the Pleistocene [5, 6]; however, this remains questionable. Pandas now survive in a fraction of their historical habitat [7], but no specific information has been reported. Stable isotope analyses can be used to understand diet- and habitat-related changes in animals [8]. Isotopic signals in bone collagen reflect dietary compositions of ancient human diets [9, 10] and dietary changes between historical and modern animal populations [11, 12]. Here, we conduct stable isotope analyses of bone and tooth samples from ancient and modern pandas and from sympatric fauna. We show that pandas have had a diet dominated by C3 resources over time and space and that trophic niches of ancient and modern pandas are distinctly different. The isotopic trophic and ecological niche widths of ancient pandas are approximately three times larger than those of modern pandas, suggesting that ancient pandas possibly had more complex diets and habitats than do their modern counterparts. Our findings provide insight into the dietary evolution and habitat contraction of pandas.",Inverse Control of Turning Behavior by Dopamine D1 Receptor Signaling in Columnar and Ring Neurons of the Central Complex in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713106,Current biology : CB,2019 03 29,"Action selection is a prerequisite for decision-making and a fundamental aspect to any goal-directed locomotion; it requires integration of sensory signals and internal states to translate them into action sequences. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral analysis to study neural circuits and mechanisms underlying action selection and decision-making in freely moving Drosophila. We discovered preferred patterns of motor activity and turning behavior. These patterns are impaired in FoxP mutant flies, which present an altered temporal organization of motor actions and turning behavior, reminiscent of indecisiveness. Then, focusing on central complex (CX) circuits known to integrate different sensory modalities and controlling premotor regions, we show that action sequences and turning behavior are regulated by dopamine D1-like receptor (Dop1R1) signaling. Dop1R1 inputs onto CX columnar ellipsoid body-protocerebral bridge gall (E-PG) neuron and ellipsoid body (EB) R2/R4m ring neuron circuits both negatively gate motor activity but inversely control turning behavior. Although flies deficient of D1 receptor signaling present normal turning behavior despite decreased activity, restoring Dop1R1 level in R2/R4m-specific circuitry affects the temporal organization of motor actions and turning. We finally show EB R2/R4m neurons are in contact with E-PG neurons that are thought to encode body orientation and heading direction of the fly. These findings suggest that Dop1R1 signaling in E-PG and EB R2/4 m circuits are compared against each other, thereby modulating patterns of activity and turning behavior for goal-directed locomotion.",Female Social Feedback Reveals Non-imitative Mechanisms of Vocal Learning in Zebra Finches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713105,Current biology : CB,2019 02 19,"Learning of song in birds provides a powerful model for human speech development [1-3]. However, the degree to which songbirds and humans share social mechanisms of vocal learning is unknown. Although it has been demonstrated as a vocal learning mechanism in human infants [3-6], learning via active social feedback is considered rare and atypical among non-human animals [7]. We report here the first evidence that song learning in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), the most common model species of vocal learning and development, utilizes socially guided vocal learning. We demonstrate experimentally that the songs of juvenile zebra finches are guided toward mature vocal forms by real-time visual feedback from adult females that is contingent on their early, immature vocalizations. Using a video playback paradigm, we found that juvenile birds that received non-vocal female feedback contingently on their immature song learned significantly better and more accurate song than did yoked controls that received identical but non-contingent feedback. Both contingent and non-contingent groups sang at similar rates. Thus, we have provided the first evidence suggesting that non-imitative social learning is a crucial, potentially widespread mechanism of vocal development and have established a foundational parallel between humans and our most ubiquitous animal model of vocal learning: the crucial role of social feedback to immature vocalizations in the development of communication.",Superior Colliculus GABAergic Neurons Are Essential for Acute Dark Induction of Wakefulness in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713103,Current biology : CB,2019 02 19,"Sleep is regulated by homeostatic process and circadian clock. Light indirectly modulates sleep by entraining the circadian clock to the solar day. Light can also influence sleep independent of photo-entrainment [1]. An acute light exposure could induce sleep, and an acute dark pulse could increase wakefulness in nocturnal animals [1, 2]. The photoreceptors and cell types in the retina that mediate light and dark effects on sleep are well characterized [1-4]. A few studies have explored the brain region involved in acute light induction of sleep. Fos expression and nonspecific lesions suggest that the superior colliculus (SC) may play a role in acute light induction of sleep [2, 5]. In contrast, the brain area and neural circuits mediating acute dark induction of wakefulness are unknown. Here, we demonstrated that retina ganglion cells (RGCs) had direct innervations on the GABAergic neurons in the mouse SC, and the activities of these cells were inhibited by an acute dark pulse, but not influenced by a light pulse. Moreover, ablating SC GABAergic neurons abolished the acute dark induction of wakefulness, but not light induction of sleep. Based on optogenetic and electrophysiological experiments, we found that SC GABAergic neurons formed monosynaptic functional connections with dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Selective lesions of VTA dopaminergic cells totally abolished acute dark induction of wakefulness without affecting the light induction of sleep. Collectively, our findings uncover a fundamental role for a retinal-SC GABAergic-VTA dopaminergic circuit in acute dark induction of wakefulness and indicate that the dark and light signals affect sleep-wake behaviors through distinct pathways.",Oxytocin receptor knockout prairie voles generated by CRISPR/Cas9 editing show reduced preference for social novelty and exaggerated repetitive behaviors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713102,Hormones and behavior,2019 05 22,"Behavioral neuroendocrinology has benefited tremendously from the use of a wide range of model organisms that are ideally suited for particular questions. However, in recent years the ability to manipulate the genomes of laboratory strains of mice has led to rapid advances in our understanding of the role of specific genes, circuits and neural populations in regulating behavior. While genome manipulation in mice has been a boon for behavioral neuroscience, the intensive focus on the mouse restricts the diversity in behavioral questions that can be investigated using state-of-the-art techniques. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has great potential for efficiently generating mutants in non-traditional animal models and consequently to reinvigorate comparative behavioral neuroendocrinology. Here we describe the efficient generation of oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) mutant prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and describe initial behavioral phenotyping focusing on behaviors relevant to autism. Oxtr mutant male voles show no disruption in pup ultrasonic vocalization, anxiety as measured by the open field test, alloparental behavior, or sociability in the three chamber test. Mutants did however show a modest elevation in repetitive behavior in the marble burying test, and an impairment in preference for social novelty. The ability to efficiently generate targeted mutations in the prairie vole genome will greatly expand the utility of this model organism for discovering the genetic and circuit mechanisms underlying complex social behaviors, and serves as a proof of principle for expanding this approach to other non-traditional model organisms.",Sex hormones and stroke: Beyond estrogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713101,Hormones and behavior,2019 05 22,"Stroke risk and poor stroke outcomes in postmenopausal women have usually beeen attributed to decreased levels of estrogen. However, two lines of evidence suggest that this hormone may not be solely responsible for elevated stroke risk in this population. First, the increased risk for CVD and stroke occurs much earlier than menopause at a time when estrogen levels are not yet reduced. Second, estrogen therapy has not successfully reduced stroke risk in all studies. Other sex hormones may therefore also contribute to stroke risk. Prior to menopause, levels of the gonadotrophin Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) are elevated while levels of the gonadal peptide inhibin are lowered, indicating an overall decrease in ovarian reserve. Similarly, reduced estrogen levels at menopause significantly increase the ratio of androgens to estrogens. In view of the evidence that androgens may be unfavorable for CVD and stroke, this elevated ratio of testosterone to estrogen may also contribute to the postmenopause-associated stroke risk. This review synthesizes evidence from different clinical populations including natural menopause, surgical menopause, women on chemotherapy, and preclinical stroke models to dissect the role of ovarian hormones and stroke risk and outcomes."

Here, we investigated whether RNA-binding to cationic domains influences the immunogenicity of endogenously expressed antigens delivered by DNA vaccination. We initially evaluated induction of HBV-C (Kb/C93)-specific CD8+ T cell responses in C57BL/6J (B6) and 1.4HBV-Smut transgenic (tg) mice that harbor a replicating HBV genome in hepatocytes by DNA immunization. RNA-binding HBV-C and HBV-C149tat antigens moderately enhanced Kb/C93-specific CD8+ T cells in B6 mice as compared with RNA-free HBV-C149 antigen (lacking cationic domains). However, only the RNA-binding antigens elicited Kb/C93-specific CD8+ T cells that inhibited HBV replication in 1.4HBV-Smut tg mice. Moreover, RNA-binding to designer antigens, which express a Kb/p15E epitope from an endogenous murine leukemia virus-derived tumor-specific gp70 protein, was crucial to prime tumor-rejecting effector CD8+ T cells in B6 mice. Antigen-bound endogenous RNAs function as a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7) ligand and stimulated priming of Kb/p15E-specific CD8+ T cells in B6, but not TLR-7-/-, mice. Antigen-bound cellular RNAs thus function as an endogenous natural adjuvant in in vivo vector-transfected cells, and thus are an attractive tool to induce and/or enhance effector CD8+ T cell responses directed against chronic viral infections or tumor self-antigens by DNA vaccination.",Network meta-analysis of nine large cardiovascular outcome trials of new antidiabetic drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713085,Primary care diabetes,2019 04 29,"The aim of this network meta-analysis (NMA) was to indirectly compare the cardiovascular (CV) safety of new antidiabetic medications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DATA SYNTHESIS: A search of the Embase and MEDLINE databases was conducted systematically to identify cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of new antidiabetic medications (DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors) in patients with T2DM. The primary outcomes were the composite endpoint of CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke (MACE), death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and death from any cause. Hospitalization for HF and unstable angina were evaluated as secondary endpoints. A total of 9 trials, including 87,162 patients, met the eligibility criteria and were retained for the analysis. The NMA results showed no significant differences among the DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, alogliptin, and saxagliptin) in any of the CV endpoints. Similarly, no significant changes were seen in the NMA among the GLP-1 receptor agonists nor the SGLT-2 inhibitors. The pairwise meta-analysis showed that DPP-4 inhibitors have a CV safety profiled comparable to placebo. GLP-1 agonists on the other hand, showed significant reduction in MACE (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.97), death from CV causes (RR=0.88; 95% CI 0.80-0.97), and death from any cause (RR=0.89; 95% CI 0.82-0.96). SGLT-2 inhibitors showed significant reduction in hospitalization for heart failure events (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.6-0.86) compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis has shown that new antidiabetic medications do not impose any additional CV risk. The indirect comparison among the medications of each class resulted in no significant changes regarding CV endpoints and death from any cause.",Variations of sex development: The first German interdisciplinary consensus paper.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713084,Journal of pediatric urology,2019 05 19,"The term variations of sex development subsumes a large number of congenital conditions including chromosomal mosaics and variations of chromosomal, gonadal, and phenotypic sex. A situation of this nature may cause severe distress to both, parents and affected persons. One of the reasons for this is the binary form of gender classification in the society. In the past, because of a fear of possible stigmatization and an inability to cope with complex situations, it has been medical policy and practice for newborns to undergo early, mostly 'feminizing' elective surgery with the aim of achieving an outer genital appearance that is unambiguously male or female. Protests by advocacy groups for the most part as well as the results of outcome studies have shown that the development of affected persons may be very different to what has been expected and often does not result in the intended clear female or male gender identity as had been intended. It, therefore, seemed a matter of urgency to implement this new awareness as well as the ethical and personal human rights perspectives in the recommendations for the medical and psychosocial management of diverse sex development (DSD) in the future.",De novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression profile of thermally challenged green abalone (Haliotis fulgens: Gastropoda) under acute hypoxia and hypercapnia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713083,Marine genomics,2019 05 21,"Transcriptional regulation constitutes a rapid response of marine organisms facing stressful environmental conditions, such as the concomitant exposure to warming, ocean acidification and hypoxia under climate change. In previous studies, we investigated whole-organism physiological patterns and cellular metabolism in gill and muscle of the marine gastropod Haliotis fulgens in response to increasing temperature (18 °C to 32 °C at +3 °C per day) under hypoxia (50% air saturation), hypercapnia (1000 μatm pCO2) and both factors combined. Here, we report investigations of the molecular responses of H. fulgens to temperature and identify mechanisms concomitantly affected by hypoxia and hypercapnia. A de novo transcriptome assembly with subsequent quantitative PCR and correlation network analysis of genes involved in the molecular response were used to unravel the correlations between gene expression patterns under the different experimental conditions. The correlation networks identified a shift from the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism (down-regulated) to the up-regulation of Hsp70 during warming under all experimental conditions in gill and muscle, indicating a strong up-regulation of damage prevention and repair systems at sustained cellular energy production. However, a higher capacity for anaerobic succinate production was evicted in gill, matching with observations from our previous studies indicating succinate accumulation in gill but not in muscle. Additionally, warming under hypoxia and hypercapnia kept mRNA levels of citrate synthase in both tissues unchanged following a similar pattern as muscle enzyme capacity from a previous study, suggesting an emphasis on maintaining rather than down-regulating mitochondrial activity.",From ideation to practice: How pharmacists and students can leverage hackathons and innovation labs to accelerate innovation in pharmacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713082,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,2019 03 11,"To describe novel methods regarding innovation for pharmacists and student pharmacists to leverage local and national events, such as hackathons and innovation labs, that provide guidance and resources for developing novel products and solutions in health care.",Why and how community pharmacies should better use Facebook.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713080,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,2019 03 11,To describe how independent and community pharmacies can better utilize Facebook to advertise their business and optimize health care communications with patients.,Clinical dashboard development and use for academic detailing in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713078,Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,2019 03 11,To describe the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Academic Detailing Service's (ADS) experience with the development and use of clinical dashboards across the VA's national clinical campaigns.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNA loci are clustered within two 3-Mb regions on chromosome IV. Each piRNA locus possesses an upstream motif that recruits RNA polymerase II to produce an ∼28 nt primary transcript. We used comparative epigenomics across nematodes to gain insight into the origin, evolution, and mechanism of nematode piRNA biogenesis. We show that the piRNA upstream motif is derived from core promoter elements controlling snRNA transcription. We describe two alternative modes of piRNA organization in nematodes: in C. elegans and closely related nematodes, piRNAs are clustered within repressive H3K27me3 chromatin, while in other species, typified by Pristionchus pacificus, piRNAs are found within introns of active genes. Additionally, we discover that piRNA production depends on sequence signals associated with RNA polymerase II pausing. We show that pausing signals synergize with chromatin to control piRNA transcription.",Dynamic Interactions of Plant CNGC Subunits and Calmodulins Drive Oscillatory Ca2+ Channel Activities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713075,Developmental cell,2019 03 12,"Calcium is a universal signal in all eukaryotes, but the mechanism for encoding calcium signatures remains largely unknown. Calcium oscillations control pollen tube growth and fertilization in flowering plants, serving as a model for dissecting the molecular machines that mediate calcium fluctuations. We report that pollen-tube-specific cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGC18, CNGC8, and CNGC7) together with calmodulin 2 (CaM2) constitute a molecular switch that either opens or closes the calcium channel depending on cellular calcium levels. Under low calcium, calcium-free calmodulin 2 (Apo-CaM2) interacts with CNGC18-CNGC8 complex, leading to activation of the influx channel and consequently increasing cytosolic calcium levels. Calcium-bound CaM2 dissociates from CNGC18/8 heterotetramer, closing the channel and initiating a downturn of cellular calcium levels. We further reconstituted the calcium oscillator in HEK293 cells, supporting the model that Ca2+-CaM-dependent regulation of CNGC channel activity provides an auto-regulatory feedback mechanism for calcium oscillations during pollen tube growth.",Heat Oscillations Driven by the Embryonic Cell Cycle Reveal the Energetic Costs of Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713074,Developmental cell,2019 03 29,"All living systems function out of equilibrium and exchange energy in the form of heat with their environment. Thus, heat flow can inform on the energetic costs of cellular processes, which are largely unknown. Here, we have repurposed an isothermal calorimeter to measure heat flow between developing zebrafish embryos and the surrounding medium. Heat flow increased over time with cell number. Unexpectedly, a prominent oscillatory component of the heat flow, with periods matching the synchronous early reductive cleavage divisions, persisted even when DNA synthesis and mitosis were blocked by inhibitors. Instead, the heat flow oscillations were driven by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions catalyzed by the cell-cycle oscillator, the biochemical network controlling mitotic entry and exit. We propose that the high energetic cost of cell-cycle signaling reflects the significant thermodynamic burden of imposing accurate and robust timing on cell proliferation during development."

Here, we describe a role for the ZIKV protease NS2B-NS3 heterodimer in mediating neurotoxicity through cleavage of a host protein required for neurogenesis. Similar to ZIKV infection, NS2B-NS3 expression led to cytokinesis defects and cell death in a protease activity-dependent fashion. Among binding partners, NS2B-NS3 cleaved Septin-2, a cytoskeletal factor involved in cytokinesis. Cleavage of Septin-2 occurred at residue 306 and forced expression of a non-cleavable Septin-2 restored cytokinesis, suggesting a direct mechanism of ZIKV-induced neural toxicity.

We developed ubiquitin variants (UbVs) that targeted either the catalytic domain or each of three adaptor domains in USP15, including the N-terminal DUSP domain. We also designed a linear dimer (diUbV), which targeted the DUSP and catalytic domains, and exhibited enhanced specificity and more potent inhibition of catalytic activity than either UbV alone. In cells, the UbVs inhibited the deubiquitination of two USP15 substrates, SMURF2 and TRIM25, and the diUbV inhibited the effects of USP15 on the transforming growth factor β pathway. Structural analyses revealed that three distinct UbVs bound to the catalytic domain and locked the active site in a closed, inactive conformation, and one UbV formed an unusual strand-swapped dimer and bound two DUSP domains simultaneously. These inhibitors will enable the study of USP15 function in oncology, neurology, immunology, and inflammation.",Binding from Both Sides: TolR and Full-Length OmpA Bind and Maintain the Local Structure of the E. coli Cell Wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713026,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 04 03,"We present a molecular modeling and simulation study of the E. coli cell envelope, with a particular focus on the role of TolR, a native protein of the E. coli inner membrane, in interactions with the cell wall. TolR has been proposed to bind to peptidoglycan, but the only structure of this protein thus far is in a conformation in which the putative peptidoglycan binding domain is not accessible. We show that a model of the extended conformation of the protein in which this domain is exposed binds peptidoglycan largely through electrostatic interactions. Non-covalent interactions of TolR and OmpA with the cell wall, from the inner membrane and outer membrane sides, respectively, maintain the position of the cell wall even in the absence of Braun's lipoprotein. The charged residues that mediate the cell-wall interactions of TolR in our simulations are conserved across a number of species of gram-negative bacteria.",Dynamic Role of the G Protein in Stabilizing the Active State of the Adenosine A2A Receptor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713025,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 06 10,"Agonist binding in the extracellular region of the G protein-coupled adenosine A2A receptor increases its affinity to the G proteins in the intracellular region, and vice versa. The structural basis for this effect is not evident from the crystal structures of A2AR in various conformational states since it stems from the receptor dynamics. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on four different conformational states of the adenosine A2A receptor, we observed that the agonists show decreased ligand mobility, lower entropy of the extracellular loops in the active-intermediate state compared with the inactive state. In contrast, the entropy of the intracellular region increases to prime the receptor for coupling the G protein. Coupling of the G protein to A2AR shrinks the agonist binding site, making tighter receptor agonist contacts with an increase in the strength of allosteric communication compared with the active-intermediate state. These insights provide a strong basis for structure-based ligand design studies."

Lynch syndrome represents one of the most frequent conditions of cancer predisposition in human, thus requiring specific care and genetic counseling. Moreover, research has recently focused increasingly on MMR deficiency due to its positive predictive value for the efficacy of immune checkpoints inhibitors (ICKi) in metastatic tumors, regardless of their primary origin. MSI has also been demonstrated to constitute an independent prognostic factor in several tumor types, being also associated with alternative response to chemotherapy. These observations have led many professional medical organizations to recommend universal screening of all newly diagnosed colorectal cancers for dMMR/MSI status and increasing evidence support the evaluation of MSI in all human tumors regardless of the cancer tissue of origin. Currently, two standard reference methods, namely immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction, are recommended for the detection of dMMR/MSI status. These methods are equally valid as the initial screening test for dMMR/MSI in colorectal cancer. To date, there is no recommendation for the detection of dMMR/MSI in other primary tumors. In this review, we will present a comprehensive overview of the methods used for evaluation of tumor dMMR/MSI status in colorectal cancer, as well as in other tumor sites. We will see that the evaluation of this status remains challenging in some clinical settings, with the need to improve the above methods in these specific contexts.",Identification of a novel protein in the genome sequences of Leptospira interrogans with the ability to interact with host's components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30713004,"Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",2019 02 04,Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that affects humans and animals worldwide.

However, it requires the generation of a synthetic CT (SCT) from MRIs for patient setup and dose calculation. In this study, we aim to investigate the accuracy of dose calculation in prostate cancer radiotherapy using SCTs generated from MRIs using our learning-based method. We retrospectively investigated a total of 17 treatment plans from 10 patients, each having both planning CTs (pCT) and MRIs acquired before treatment. The SCT was registered to the pCT for generating SCT-based treatment plans. The original pCT-based plans served as ground truth. Clinically-relevant dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics were extracted from both ground truth and SCT-based plans for comparison and evaluation. Gamma analysis was performed for the comparison of absorbed dose distributions between SCT- and pCT-based plans of each patient. Gamma analysis of dose distribution on pCT and SCT within 1%/1 mm at 10% dose threshold showed greater than 99% pass rate. The average differences in DVH metrics for planning target volumes (PTVs) were less than 1%, and similar metrics for organs at risk (OAR) were not statistically different. The SCT images created from MR images using our proposed machine learning method are accurate for dose calculation in prostate cancer radiation treatment planning. This study also demonstrates the great potential for MRI to completely replace CT scans in the process of simulation and treatment planning. However, MR images are needed to further analyze geometric distortion effects. Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) can be generated within our method, and their accuracy in patient setup needs further analysis.",Risk of venous thromboembolism and implementation of preventive measures in medical patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712999,Enfermeria clinica,2019 05 19,To identify the frequency of risk factors for venous thromboembolism in hospitalized medical patients and the use preventive measures by healthcare professionals.

Two-jaw surgery for the correction of open bite led to different directions and amounts of condylar rotational displacement in patients with skeletal class II compared to class III malocclusion, with greater rotational than translational displacements.",Implant treatment of two failing or missing central incisors in the aesthetic region: a treatment protocol and 1-year prospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712987,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 02 04,"Implant treatment for two central incisors in the maxillary aesthetic region is complex due to concerns regarding inter-implant hard and soft tissue stability. A treatment protocol was therefore developed and implemented in a 1-year prospective case series study involving 16 patients with two failing or missing central incisors in the maxillary aesthetic region. The protocol consists of five options depending on whether teeth are still present (options 1-3) or not (options 4 and 5) and on the amount of bone available at the start of treatment: (1) extraction followed by immediate implant placement and provisionalization, (2) extraction followed by immediate implant placement and delayed provisionalization, (3) extraction followed by ridge preservation, delayed implant placement and immediate provisionalization, (4) delayed implant placement and guided bone regeneration with delayed provisionalization, (5) guided bone regeneration (extensive bone augmentation of the alveolar ridge), delayed implant placement, and delayed provisionalization.

However, it does not perform well in terms of Rician noise removal for MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Allowing for the characteristics of squared-magnitude MR (Magnetic Resonance) images, which follow a non-central chi-square distribution, the CURE (Chi-Square Unbiased Risk Estimation) is used to determine an optimal threshold for NeighShrink. Therefore, we propose the NeighShrinkCURE denoising algorithm. Bilateral filtering and cycle spinning are used to further improve denoising performance. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is simple and efficient, and provides good noise reduction while preserving edges and details well. Compared with some similar MRI denoising algorithms, the proposed algorithm has improvements in PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity). Although running time of the proposed algorithm has some increment compared with some current MRI denoising algorithms, the comprehensive performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to several current MRI denoising algorithms.",[Pathologist versus social media: A survival guide].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712984,Annales de pathologie,2019 04 10,"Social networks have changed the communication tools among healthcare professionals, enabling instantaneous and globalized sharing and monitoring of information.

It is a rare adverse effect of this antihypertensive drug. The clinical presentation commonly includes severe chronic diarrhea leading to weight loss and a variable degree of dehydration. Histological findings are most commonly observed in the duodenum and consist of partial or total villous atrophy, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes and inflammation in the lamina propria.

For this purpose a hydrothermally altered and an unaltered granite drill core with axial fractures were investigated. Using three injection and three extraction locations at top and bottom of the fractured cores, different dipole flow fields were examined. The conservative tracer (Amino-G) breakthrough curves were measured using fluorescence spectroscopy. Based on 3-D digital data obtained by micro-computed tomography 2.5-D numerical models were generated for both fractures by mapping the measured aperture distributions to the 2-D fracture geometries (x-y plane). Fluid flow and tracer transport were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics®. By means of numerical simulations and tomographic imaging experimentally observed breakthrough curves can be understood and qualitatively reproduced. The experiments and simulations suggest that fluid flow in the altered fracture is governed by the 2-D fracture geometry in the x-y plane, while fluid flow in the unaltered fracture seems to be controlled by the aperture distribution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in our case simplified parallel-plate models fail to describe the experimental findings and that pronounced tailings can be attributed to complex internal heterogeneities.

In this study, we found that SPSB1 knockdown markedly decreased the viability and migration of ovarian cancer cells, while ectopic SPSB1 overexpression in IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells significantly increased their proliferation rate compared with empty vector-transfected cells. SPSB1 knockdown significantly elevated p21 protein and mRNA levels and induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, as evidenced by increased levels of cleaved PARP and decreased levels of Bcl-2. Notably, mechanistic investigations revealed that SPSB1 accelerated p21 destabilization by directly interacting with p21 and promoting its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.

The 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) associated with an inhibitory G-protein (Gi) with the widest and most abundant expression. It is not known; however, how expression or activity of 5-HTlAR is regulated. We studied here phosphorylation of 5-HT1AR by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a neuron-specific membrane-bound Ser/Thr kinase that is activated by binding of the p35 Cdk5 activator. 5-HT1AR was phosphorylated by the Cdk5-p35 complex at Thr314 in the third cytoplasmic loop. The phosphorylation stimulated the degradation of 5-HT1AR by the proteasome, resulting in neutralization of the inhibitory action of 5-HT1AR on intracellular cAMP concentration. These results suggest that Cdk5-p35 modulates 5-HT signaling through phosphorylation-dependent degradation of 5-HTlAR.",Changes in tissue abundance and activity of enzymes related to branched-chain amino acid catabolism in dairy cows during early lactation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712942,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 30,"Branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain α-keto acids. This reaction is considered as the rate-limiting step in the overall branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic pathway in mammals. For characterizing the potential enzymatic involvement of liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue (AT), and mammary gland (MG) in BCAA metabolism during early lactation, tissue and blood samples were examined on d 1, 42, and 105 after parturition from 25 primiparous Holstein cows. Serum BCAA profiles were analyzed and the mRNA and protein abundance as well as the activity in the different tissues were assessed for the BCAA catabolic enzymes, partly for the branched-chain aminotransferase and completely for BCKDH. Total BCAA concentration in serum was lowest on d 1 after parturition and increased thereafter to a steady level for the duration of the experiment. Pronounced differences between the tissues were observed at all molecular levels. The mRNA abundance of the mitochondrial isoform of branched-chain aminotransferase (BCATm) was greatest in AT as compared with the other tissues studied, indicating that AT might be an important contributor in the initiation of BCAA catabolism in dairy cows. From the different subunits of the BCKDH E1 component, only the mRNA for the β polypeptide (BCKDHB), not for the α polypeptide (BCKDHA), was elevated in liver. The BCKDHA mRNA abundance was similar across all tissues except muscle, which tended to lower values. Highest BCKDHA protein abundance was observed in both liver and MG, whereas BCKDHB protein was detectable in these tissues but could not be quantified. Adipose tissue and muscle only displayed abundance of the α subunit, with muscle having the lowest BCKDHA protein of all tissues. We found similarities in protein abundance for both BCKDH E1 subunits in liver and MG; however, the corresponding overall BCKDH enzyme activity was 7-fold greater in liver compared with MG, allowing for hepatic oxidation of BCAA transamination products. Reduced BCKDH activity in MG associated with no measurable activity in AT and muscle may favor sparing of BCAA for the synthesis of the different milk components, including nonessential AA. Deviating from previously published data on BCAA net fluxes and isotopic tracer studies in ruminants, our observed results might in part be due to complex counter-regulatory mechanisms during early lactation."

Recent studies have reported accurate predictions for Holstein bull fertility using genomic data. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of genomic prediction of sire conception rate (SCR) in US Jersey cattle using alternative predictive models. Data set consisted of 1.5k Jersey bulls with SCR records and 95k SNP covering the entire genome. The analyses included the use of linear and Gaussian kernel-based models fitting either all the SNP or subsets of markers with presumed functional roles, such as SNP significantly associated with SCR or SNP located within or close to annotated genes. Model predictive ability was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation with 10 replicates. The entire SNP set exhibited predictive correlations around 0.30. Interestingly, either SNP marginally associated with SCR or genic SNP achieved higher predictive abilities than their counterparts using random sets of SNP. Among alternative SNP subsets, Gaussian kernel models fitting significant SNP achieved the best performance with increases in predictive correlation up to 7% compared with the standard whole-genome approach. Notably, the use of a multi-breed reference population including the entire US Holstein SCR data set (11.5k bulls) allowed us to achieve predictive correlations up to 0.315, gaining 8% in accuracy compared with the standard model fitting a pure Jersey reference set. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic prediction of Jersey bull fertility is feasible. The use of Gaussian kernels fitting markers with relevant roles and the inclusion of Holstein records in the training set seem to be promising alternatives to the standard whole-genome approach. These results have the potential to help the dairy industry improve US Jersey sire fertility through accurate genome-guided decisions.",Short communication: Milk basic protein promotes proliferation and inhibits differentiation of mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712929,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 26,"It has been reported that the intake of milk basic protein (MBP) increases bone density by promoting bone formation and suppressing bone resorption. However, few studies have been done on MBP in cartilage, the tissue adjacent to bone. We therefore investigated the effect of MBP on a chondrocyte cell line, ATDC5. In a proliferative assay using the WST-1 method, the addition of 10, 100, and 1,000 µg/mL of MBP to ATDC5 cells significantly increased the cell number by about 1.2-, 1.5-, and 1.7-fold, respectively, compared with the control cells. The cell cycle analysis using flow-cytometry revealed that the proportion of S- and G2/M-phase cells was increased but that of G0/G1 phase was decreased in a dose-dependent manner with MBP addition. We measured the alkaline phosphatase activity of MBP-treated ATDC5 cells to examine the differentiation stage of the cells. Alkaline phosphatase activity was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner with MBP addition and was especially drastic at higher doses of MBP (100 and 1,000 µg/mL). The Alizarin Red S staining intensity, the indicator for calcification of cells, was lower in the MBP-treated (100 µg/mL) cells than in nontreated control cells. In the reverse-transcription PCR experiment, the mRNA level of SRY-box containing gene 9 (Sox9) and type II collagen (Col2) was significantly increased in the MBP-treated cells compared with the control cells. A significant decrease of the mRNA level of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and type X collagen (Col10) was also observed in the MBP-treated cells. These results suggested that MBP promoted the proliferation of chondrocytes by suppressing their differentiation toward calcification.","Harnessing anaerobic digestion for combined cooling, heat, and power on dairy farms: An environmental life cycle and techno-economic assessment of added cooling pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712928,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 07,"Anaerobic digestion coupled with combined heat and power production on dairy farms is environmentally advantageous; however, high capital and operating costs have limited its adoption, especially in the United States, where renewable electricity and heat production are under-incentivized. Biogas is also at a disadvantage because it has to compete with very low natural gas prices. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of integrating absorption refrigeration technology for combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) on the farm to help bridge this economic hurdle. A combined environmental life cycle and techno-economic assessment was used to compare 2 cooling pathways with and without co-digestion. We considered using CCHP to (1) displace electricity-driven refrigeration processes (e.g., milk chilling/refrigeration, biogas inlet cooling) or (2) mitigate heat stress in dairy cattle via conductive cow cooling. All cooling scenarios reduced environmental emissions compared with combined heat and power only, with an appreciable reduction in land use impacts when employing conductive cow cooling. However, none of the cooling scenarios achieved economically viability. When using cooling power to displace electricity-driven refrigeration processes, economic viability was constrained by low electricity prices and a lack of incentives in the United States. When used for conductive cow cooling, economic viability was constrained by (1) low waste heat-to-cooling conversion efficiency; (2) limited conductive cow cooling effectiveness (i.e., heat-stress mitigation); and (3) low heat stress frequency and limited severity. However, we predict that with minor improvements in conductive cow cooling effectiveness and in hotter climates, CCHP for conductive cow cooling would be economically viable even in current US energy markets.",Parenteral administration of l-arginine to twin-bearing Romney ewes during late pregnancy is associated with reduced milk somatic cell count during early lactation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712927,Journal of dairy science,2019 03 17,"Maternal milk is the primary source of nutrition for suckling mammals, and its yield and composition are important determinants of survival during the early neonatal period.

At 80 d of pregnancy, multiparous Romney ewes were housed indoors in group pens, split into 2 cohorts, and fed a lucerne-based pellet diet, formulated to meet 100% of National Research Council-recommended requirements for twin-bearing pregnant ewes, once a day. Cohort 1 was administered l-Arg (72.7 mg/kg of live weight via i.v, 3 times a day) from d 100 of pregnancy until d 140. At d 140, ewes were euthanized and maternal mammary tissues were collected for analysis of the biochemical indices total DNA, RNA, protein, protein synthetic efficiency (protein:RNA), cell size (protein:DNA), transcriptional efficiency (RNA:DNA), and the abundance of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mTORSer2448 protein. Cohort 2 was administered an identical l-Arg regimen as cohort 1, but from d 100 until parturition. Milk was collected over a 14-d period (d 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14) to assess milk yield and composition. In cohort 1, total mammary DNA (cell number) tended to be higher in l-Arg ewes, with no change in total mammary RNA or protein content, biochemical indices of protein synthetic efficiency, cell size or transcriptional efficiency, or mTOR protein abundance or phosphorylation. In cohort 2, milk composition analysis from l-Arg ewes showed lower (d 7-14) milk somatic cell counts, greater crude protein percentage from d 7 to 10 but lower at d 14, and altered absolute concentrations of some free AA (d 7 and 14) compared with controls.

The leukocyte surface markers integrin Mac-1 and CD16b have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis (LN). Mac-1 comprises a unique α subunit (CD11b) complexed with a common β2 subunit, which are released along with CD16b from specific leukocyte subsets under inflammatory conditions including glomerulonephritis. We investigated the association of urinary CD11b and CD16b with histopathological activity in 272 patients with biopsy-proven glomerular diseases, including 118 with LN. Urine CD11b and CD16b were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Urinary levels of both markers were increased in LN, but only urinary CD11b was correlated with the number of glomerular leukocytes and with overall histopathological activity. In a subset of patients with samples available from the time of biopsy and subsequent clinical remission of LN, urinary levels of CD11b decreased with successful glucocorticoid treatment. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that urinary CD11b was superior to CD16b, the scavenger receptor CD163, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 for the prediction of proliferative LN. In anti-mouse nephrotoxic serum glomerulonephritis, urinary CD11b correlated with histologic damage and decreased with corticosteroid treatment. In vitro, CD11b levels were decreased on activated mouse neutrophils displaying Fcγ receptor clustering and transendothelial migration, suggesting that leukocyte activation and transmigration are required for CD11b shedding in urine. Together, our results suggest that urinary CD11b may be a useful biomarker to estimate histopathological activity, particularly glomerular leukocyte accumulation, in LN.",A randomized controlled trial of the effect of spironolactone on left ventricular mass in hemodialysis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712923,Kidney international,2019 03 24,"Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have beneficial effects on left ventricular remodeling, cardiac fibrosis, and arrhythmia in heart failure, but efficacy and safety in dialysis patients is less clear. We evaluated the effect of spironolactone on left ventricular mass (LVM), an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, in hemodialysis patients. In this placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 97 hemodialysis patients (23% female; mean age 60.3 years) were randomized to spironolactone 50 mg once daily (n=50) or placebo (n=47). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in LVM index (LVMi) from baseline to 40 weeks as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Safety endpoints were development of hyperkalemia and change in residual renal function. There was no significant change in LVMi in participants randomized to spironolactone compared to placebo (-2.86±11.87 vs. 0.41±10.84 g/m2). There was also no difference in the secondary outcomes of mean 24-hour systolic or diastolic ambulatory blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, 6-minute walk test distance, or New York Heart Association functional class. Moderate hyperkalemia (pre-dialysis potassium levels of 6.0-6.5 mmol/L) was more frequent with spironolactone treatment (155 vs. 80 events), but severe hyperkalemia (≥6.5 mmol/L) was not (14 vs. 24 events). Changes in residual urine volume and measured glomerular filtration rate did not differ between groups. There were no deaths in the spironolactone group and 4 deaths in the placebo group. Thus, treatment with 50 mg spironolactone did not change left ventricular mass index, cardiac function, or blood pressure in hemodialysis patients. Spironolactone increased the frequency of moderate hyperkalemia, but did not increase severe hyperkalemia.",Biglycan evokes autophagy in macrophages via a novel CD44/Toll-like receptor 4 signaling axis in ischemia/reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712922,Kidney international,2019 02 20,"Biglycan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, acts as a danger signal and is classically thought to promote macrophage recruitment via Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 4. We have recently shown that biglycan signaling through TLR 2/4 and the CD14 co-receptor regulates inflammation, suggesting that TLR co-receptors may determine whether biglycan-TLR signaling is pro- or anti-inflammatory. Here, we sought to identify other co-receptors and characterize their impact on biglycan-TLR signaling. We found a marked increase in the number of autophagic macrophages in mice stably overexpressing soluble biglycan. In vitro, stimulation of murine macrophages with biglycan triggered autophagosome formation and enhanced the flux of autophagy markers. Soluble biglycan also promoted autophagy in human peripheral blood macrophages. Using macrophages from mice lacking TLR2 and/or TLR4, CD14, or CD44, we demonstrated that the pro-autophagy signal required TLR4 interaction with CD44, a receptor involved in adhesion, migration, lymphocyte activation, and angiogenesis. In vivo, transient overexpression of circulating biglycan at the onset of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) enhanced M1 macrophage recruitment into the kidneys of Cd44+/+ and Cd44-/- mice but not Cd14-/- mice. The biglycan-CD44 interaction increased M1 autophagy and the number of renal M2 macrophages and reduced tubular damage following IRI. Thus, CD44 is a novel signaling co-receptor for biglycan, an interaction that is required for TLR4-CD44-dependent pro-autophagic activity in macrophages. Interfering with the interaction between biglycan and specific TLR co-receptors could represent a promising therapeutic intervention to curtail kidney inflammation and damage.",The spectrum of kidney biopsy findings in patients with morbid obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712921,Kidney international,2019 02 20,"Morbid obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m2, affects approximately 8% of United States adults and is a recognized risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD). We present the first focused biopsy-based study exploring the range of kidney diseases in this population. Among 3263 native kidney biopsies interpreted at Columbia University in 2017, we identified 248 biopsies from morbidly obese patients. In this cohort with median age of 53.5 years, 56% were female and median BMI was 44.0 kg/m2. Diabetes and hypertension were present in 47% and 81% of patients, respectively. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 30 ml/min/1.73 m2, and most patients had nephrotic range proteinuria. Obesity related glomerulopathy (ORG), defined as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with glomerulomegaly or glomerulomegaly alone, was detected in 73 patients, including 29 with ORG alone and 44 with ORG plus another kidney disease. In contrast, 167 patients had other kidney diseases alone, without ORG, most commonly (in descending order) diabetic nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and lupus nephritis. In 49% of patients, kidney biopsy yielded a diagnosis predicted to change patient management. The strongest predictor of non-ORG lesions was eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and presentation with nephrotic syndrome or acute kidney injury (with or without background CKD) was more common in non-ORG than ORG. The findings reveal an unexpectedly broad spectrum of kidney pathology beyond metabolic syndrome-associated disorders and highlight the importance of kidney biopsy to guide management and prognosis in the morbidly obese population.",Health enhancing physical activity in all policies?

Paucity of studies have questioned the role of public national actors in PA policies enactment and delivery, the barriers and levers for adopting cross-sectoral HEPA. The present work seeks at comparing France and Belgium in regard to their competencies of ministries promoting HEPA, the presence of leadership and coordination in HEPA policies implementation, their key public legal entities working on HEPA. Expert interviews and document analysis were realized to complete the HEPA policy audit tool in each country. Results have shown that HEPA cross-sectoral policies are at their early stage. A broad diversity of sectors was implicated in HEPA policies: sport, health, transport, environment, and education, but often with weak activity. No leadership or coordination exist to implement HEPA policies, although different public legal entities could work on this aim. Ministries relationships were principally coming from formal co-interventions mandated by national public plans in France, where in Belgium relationships were punctual. Lobbying within each sector and in key public legal entities to promote HEPA is needed, and the development of official national coordination is essential.",Prevalence of Parvovirus B19 Infection by Serology and PCR in Pregnant Women Referring to Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712919,Journal of the National Medical Association,2019 02 04,"Infection by Primate erythroparvovirus 1, generally known Parvovirus B19, is highly prevalent worldwide.

The lung is a mucosal tissue colonized by a diverse bacterial community, and pulmonary infections commonly present in lung cancer patients are linked to clinical outcomes. Here, we provide evidence that local microbiota provoke inflammation associated with lung adenocarcinoma by activating lung-resident γδ T cells. Germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice were significantly protected from lung cancer development induced by Kras mutation and p53 loss. Mechanistically, commensal bacteria stimulated Myd88-dependent IL-1β and IL-23 production from myeloid cells, inducing proliferation and activation of Vγ6+Vδ1+ γδ T cells that produced IL-17 and other effector molecules to promote inflammation and tumor cell proliferation.

More than 80% of >60 cell types match between the two regions but exhibit substantial differences in proportions and gene expression, some of which we relate to functional differences. Comparison of macaque retinal types with those of mice reveals that interneuron types are tightly conserved.

Evidence suggests that immune cells can sense microbes through intact barriers, but regulation of microbial commensalism remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncovered spatial compartmentalization of skin-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and modulation of sebaceous glands by a subset of RORγt+ ILCs residing within hair follicles in close proximity to sebaceous glands. Their persistence in skin required IL-7 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and localization was dependent on the chemokine receptor CCR6. ILC subsets expressed TNF receptor ligands, which limited sebocyte growth by repressing Notch signaling pathway. Consequently, loss of ILCs resulted in sebaceous hyperplasia with increased production of antimicrobial lipids and restricted commensalism of Gram-positive bacterial communities. Thus, epithelia-derived signals maintain skin-resident ILCs that regulate microbial commensalism through sebaceous gland-mediated tuning of the barrier surface, highlighting an immune-epithelia circuitry that facilitates host-microbe symbiosis.",Molecular Discrimination between Two Conformations of Sphingomyelin in Plasma Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712872,Cell,2019 03 29,"Sphingomyelin and cholesterol are essential lipids that are enriched in plasma membranes of animal cells, where they interact to regulate membrane properties and many intracellular signaling processes.

One conformation, bound by OlyA, is induced by stoichiometric, exothermic interactions with cholesterol, properties that are consistent with sphingomyelin/cholesterol complexes. In its second conformation, sphingomyelin is free from cholesterol and does not bind OlyA. A point mutation abolishes OlyA's ability to discriminate between these two conformations. In cells, levels of sphingomyelin/cholesterol complexes are held constant over a wide range of plasma membrane cholesterol concentrations, enabling precise regulation of the chemical activity of cholesterol."

The viscosity of the fluorine bearing silicate melt decreased more quickly to the dynamic balance point between the dissociation and reconnection of the species, and reverted more slowly to the natural state than the fluorine free silicate melt, because fluorine ions join the silicate network via the formation of new Si-F bonds. The formation of SiF bonds can intensify the reduction of the viscosity, but the consumption of fluorine ions may lead to an increasing of the viscosity, which resulted in the weak decreasing trend in the viscosity as the ultrasonic intensity increased.

A homogenous microstructure characterized by refined (Bi) particles dispersing uniformly on the (Cu3Sn) matrix is obtained when the ultrasonic amplitude reaches the highest value of 24 μm. This is mainly ascribed to the ultrasonically induced cavitation and acoustic streaming, which promotes the nucleation, the fragmentation, and the dispersion of (Bi) droplets. The finally solidified immiscible alloy exhibits obvious improvements in electrochemical corrosion resistance, microhardness and wear-resisting if compared with those in static solidification. These results prove that applying power ultrasound is an effective way to modulate the liquid phase separation and enhance the applied performance for immiscible alloys.","Enantioseparation of racemic bupivacaine via ultrasonic-assisted diastereomeric crystallization using 12,14-dinitrodehydroabietic acid.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712856,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,2019 05 20,"12,14-Dinitrodehydroabietic acid (12,14-dinitroDHAA), a chiral acid obtained by the nitration of optical dehydroabietic acid (DHAA), was successfully employed as resolving agent.

The results indicated that ultrasonic-assist can well facilitate resolution of (R,S)-bupivacaine and a higher enantiomeric excess (ee) and yield was obtained for (S)-bupivacaine, and while without ultrasound, the ee value decreases by increasing the crystallization time. A Box-Behnken experimental design with four factors (amount of 12,14-dinitroDHAA, ethanol amount, ultrasonic power and crystallization temperature) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to explore resolution effects. A second-order polynomial equation was adequate to model the relationship between the ee (or yield) and the dependent variables.

Furthermore, protein thermal stability, electrophoresis pattern, and microstructure of the muscle tissue were also studied. Compared with a control, an ultrasonic power of less than 175 W had no significant negative effect on protein primary structure (P > 0.05), including total sulfhydryl, reactive sulfhydryl, carbonyl groups, free amino groups, dityrosine content, and surface hydrophobicity. UIF at 175 W (UIF-175) minimized the changes in protein secondary and tertiary structures. There were no obvious changes in the SDS-PAGE patterns of the control and frozen sample proteins. Microstructure analysis showed that an appropriate ultrasonic power (UIF-175) promoted the formation of smaller and more uniform ice crystals, reduced the damage of muscle tissue by ice crystals, and maintained the sarcomere integrity.

Indiscriminate disposal of industrial effluents containing toxic dyes has become a serious environmental issue across the globe since last few decades. In view of above, this study focused on the performance evaluation of ZnO/polyaniline nanocomposite (ZnO-PANI-NC) for quick ultrasonic assisted adsorptive remediation of methyl orange dye from aqua matrix. ZnO nanoparticles were fabricated by a simple co-precipitation method and ZnO-PANI-NC was synthesized by in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer in presence of ZnO nanoparticles. The nanocomposite was extensively characterized for its crystalline nature, morphological characteristics, surface chemical bonding, specific surface area and pore volume by employing XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR, and BET analysis. The ZnO-PANI-NC has shown superior adsorptive performance as compared to pure PANI as well as ZnO nanoparticles and the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 240.84 mg/g was obtained for the ZnO-PANI-NC.

In particularly, high-frequency ultrasound is known as an effective method because the theoretical resonance frequency of the gas vesicles in Microcystis aeruginosa is in the high frequency range (>100 kHz), which causes gas vesicles collapse and changes the settleability of the algal cells. In this work, the effects of the ultrasonic frequency, acoustic power density and duration on enhancing coagulation to remove turbidity in algae-laden water were studied. In order to explain the mechanism, the morphology of algae cells, the changes in extracellular organic substances, the zeta potential and the formation of hydroxyl radicals were analyzed systematically. Finally, Zeta potentials and flocs morphology after adding PAC were investigated to verify the mechanism. The results showed that the frequency exhibited fewer effects than power and duration on coagulation. SEM images showed that there were more severe cellular damages at 430 and 740 kHz than other frequencies. Sonication could cause the collapse of gas vesicle inside the cell, which was due to the instantaneous high pressure generated by the ultrasonic cavitation instead of the resonance. Furthermore, sonication would result in an increase in proteins in extracellular organic matter (EOM) with continuous ultrasonic irradiation, indicating that a small amount of proteins could promote coagulation and that the accumulation of proteins would inhibit coagulation. Free radical content testing showed that the production of excessive free radicals was often accompanied by a deterioration of the coagulation. The proper mechanical effects were the main mechanism of ultrasonic enhanced coagulation. Thus, it was recommended that the appropriate ultrasonic condition was the one that resulted in a small amount of protein leakage and little generation of free radicals, which occurred at 740 kHz and 0.02 W/mL in approximately 5 min, and would significantly enhance the turbidity removal rate in algae-containing water from approximately 80-90%.",Ultrasound wave assisted removal of Ceftriaxone sodium in aqueous media with novel nano composite g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 based on CCD-RSM model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712851,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,2019 02 04,"The aim of this study was ultrasound assisted removal of Ceftriaxone sodium (CS) based on CCD model.

The respective results showed that RSD% was lower than 5% while the t-test confirmed the high quality of fitting. Langmuir isotherm equation fits the experimental data best and the removal followed pseudo-second order kinetics. The estimation of the experimentally obtained maximum adsorption capacities was 19.57 mg.g- of g-C3N4/MWCNT/Bi2WO6 for CS.

Compared with conventional treatment, ultrasonic treatment is more efficient and time saving. Ultrasonic technology is effective for the degradation of many refractory organic pollutants. In this paper, the principle, influencing factors and various methods of ultrasonic degradation of organic pollutants are studied in view of ultrasonic treatment alone, ultrasound treatment methods combined with biocatalysts, chemical oxidation and adsorption techniques, respectively. In addition, the problems existing in the treatment of organic pollutants in water by ultrasonic technology are analyzed and the development direction is put forward."

A,2019 06 03,"Polar-embedded stationary phases are superior to conventional alkyl stationary phases in terms of water-wettability, silanol activity and polar selectivity. A novel method was proposed for efficient preparation of amide-embedded stationary phases bearing extended aliphatic chain and large aromatic ring. The present approach, which simply required isocyanate and desired carboxylic acid, rather than the normal combination of amine/acyl chloride/proton scavenger, produced aromatic pyrenyl amide-embedded (PYE-Amide) and aliphatic docosanyl amide-embedded (C22-Amide) stationary phases. The as-synthesized packing materials were characterized and evaluated in comparison with conventional octadecyl stationary phases in terms of bonding density, aromatic and hydrophobic natures, charge-transfer capability, and selectivity towards isomers of various unsaturated compounds. A high affinity of the unsaturated ligand for the unsaturated solutes, especially the electron-deficient ones, was observed. The PYE-Amide stationary phase exhibited unique aromaticity-dependent shape selectivity, which was beneficial to the resolution of certain geometric isomers of polycyclic arenes. The applicability of such stationary phases was demonstrated by effective separations of estrogens and sulfonamide drugs.",Rapid screening and identification of monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors from Corydalis Rhizome using enzyme-immobilized magnetic beads based method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712820,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 03,"Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is considered an important therapeutic target in depression. In order to rapidly screen and identify novel MAO-A inhibitors from natural products, a magnetic bead (MB) based drug discovery tool was developed in this study. MAO-A was first immobilized onto the surface of MBs, and the resulting MAO-A-immobilized MBs (MAO-A-MBs) were then applied to ligand fishing by combining them with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-MS/MS). The inherent catalytic activity and kinetic parameters of the immobilized-MAO-A were determined by measuring the peak area of the oxidation product. The immobilized MAO-A activity was found to remain over 80% after storage at 4 °C for about 7 days. Seven compounds (tetrahydrocolumbamine, protopine, jatrorrhizine, glaucine, tetrahydropalmatine, palmatine, dehydrocorydaline) with high binding affinity to MAO-A were fished out from the ethyl acetate fraction extract of Corydalis Rhizome. Their MAO-A inhibitory activity was further verified by enzymatic inhibition assay. These results show that the developed approach using MAO-A-MBs combined with HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is suitable for the fast screening and identification of MAO-A inhibitors in complex mixtures.",Selective recognition and enrichment of carbamazepine in biological samples by magnetic imprinted polymer based on reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712819,Journal of chromatography.

The composition of Fe3O4@CS@MIP was selected by a two-step screening method. 4-vinyl pyridine, divinylbenzene and dimethylformamide were chosen as the functional monomer, cross-linker and porogen, respectively. The imprinted layer was coated on the surface of the chain transfer agent-modified magnetic chitosan nanoparticles. The prepared Fe3O4@CS@MIP was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller measurement and vibrating sample magnetometer. The results indicated that Fe3O4@CS@MIP had a large surface area (265.8 m2/g), high saturation magnetization (19.88 emu/g) and uniform structure. Besides, the binding property of the Fe3O4@CS@MIP was studied in detail. The Fe3O4@CS@MIP showed high imprinting factor (IF = 4.83) and desirable adsorption capacity (323.10 μmol/g) to CBZ. Under the optimum conditions, the developed method exhibited excellent linearity (R2>0.999) in the range of 0.01-0.5 mg/L and 1.0-30.0 mg/L, and the limits of detection were 1.0 μg/L and 9.6 μg/L for the urine and serum samples, respectively. Good recoveries (88.22%-101.18%) were obtained with relative standard deviations less than 4.83%.

A,2019 05 13,"Polyprenols extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves is a kinds of unsaturated compound containing double bonds. Traditionally, the separation methods for the polyprenols are lack of selectivity and their separation efficiency are low. We synthesized two kinds of functional nano-silica containing silver ions materials (AgTCM and AgTCN) which have selectivity for unsaturated compounds to separate Ginkgo biloba leaves polyprenols for the first time. AgTCN displays exceptionally high selectivity for polyprenols and high stability under extended heat and light exposure, while silver is virtually immobile during solvent elution. Importantly, the exceptional stability of AgTCN gives rise to much higher polyprenols recovery than conventional silica gel during the chromatographic elution. In addition, we found that the adsorption of polyprenols onto the AgTCN conforms to pseudo-second-order kinetic model and AgTCN has strong affinity with polyprenols by analyzing Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin-Pyzhev, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. The calculation results of thermodynamic parameters demonstrate that decrease of temperature in favor of increasing the adsorbing capacity of polyprenols onto the AgTCN, and the adsorption process of which is exothermic reaction.

Therefore, the efficacies of O1 Manisa + O 3039 bivalent vaccine and O 3039 monovalent vaccine were studied for cross-protection against heterologous challenge with the O Jincheon strain. In this study, the efficacy of the O1 Manisa + O 3039 bivalent vaccine was better than that of the O 3039 monovalent vaccine, even though the serological relationship (r1 value) between O Jincheon and O 3039 was matched according to the OIE Terrestrial Manual.

M cells exist principally in the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) of the isolated solitary lymphoid follicles as well as in the lymphoid follicles of nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue and gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Through lymphatic cannulation it is possible to investigate local immune responses induced following nasal Ag delivery in sheep. Hence, identifying sheep M cell markers would allow the targeting of M cells to offset the problem of trans-epithelial Ag delivery associated with inducing mucosal immunity. Sheep cDNA from the tonsils of the oropharynx and nasopharynx was PCR amplified using Glycoprotein-2 (GP2)-specific primers and expressed as a poly-His-tagged recombinant sheep GP2 (56 kDa) in HEK293 cells. The recombinant GP2 protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and polyclonal serum against the protein was raised in rats. The antiserum recognized the recombinant sheep GP2 and purified rat IgG against GP2 stained M cells in sections of sheep tonsils from nasopharynx and oropharynx. M cells were found to be present in epithelium of the palatine tonsils (oropharynx), pharyngeal tonsils as well as tubal tonsils (nasopharynx). They were also present in the FAE of the scattered lymphoid follicles over the base of the nasopharynx.

The prevailing model involves reversible inhibition of SERCA by monomeric PLN and storage of PLN as an inactive pentamer. However, this paradigm has been challenged by studies demonstrating that PLN remains associated with SERCA and that the PLN pentamer is required for the regulation of cardiac contractility. We have previously used two-dimensional (2D) crystallization and electron microscopy to study the interaction between SERCA and PLN. To further understand this interaction, we compared small helical crystals and large 2D crystals of SERCA in the absence and presence of PLN. In both crystal forms, SERCA molecules are organized into identical antiparallel dimer ribbons. The dimer ribbons pack together with distinct crystal contacts in the helical versus large 2D crystals, which allow PLN differential access to potential sites of interaction with SERCA. Nonetheless, we show that a PLN oligomer interacts with SERCA in a similar manner in both crystal forms. In the 2D crystals, a PLN pentamer interacts with transmembrane segments M3 of SERCA and participates in a crystal contact that bridges neighboring SERCA dimer ribbons. In the helical crystals, an oligomeric form of PLN also interacts with M3 of SERCA, though the PLN oligomer straddles a SERCA-SERCA crystal contact. We conclude that the pentameric form of PLN interacts with M3 of SERCA and that it plays a distinct structural and functional role in SERCA regulation. The interaction of the pentamer places the cytoplasmic domains of PLN at the membrane surface proximal to the calcium entry funnel of SERCA. This interaction may cause localized perturbation of the membrane bilayer as a mechanism for increasing the turnover rate of SERCA.",Electroencephalographic features associated with intermittent rhythmic delta activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712784,Neurophysiologie clinique = Clinical neurophysiology,2019 06 02,To investigate the clinical importance of intermittent rhythmic delta activity (IRDA) in terms of accompanying electrophysiological findings on EEG and their association with IRDA.,ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition in liver disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712783,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019 06 15,"This update of evidence-based guidelines (GL) aims to translate current evidence and expert opinion into recommendations for multidisciplinary teams responsible for the optimal nutritional and metabolic management of adult patients with liver disease.

Due to the combined effect of internal stresses and damage accumulation in composites, the second harmonic frequency was found to be shifted towards the lower frequency with increasing amplitude, which was partially recovered and shifted back during the stress relaxation. A comprehensive fatigue experiment was conducted on ASTM standard composite specimens with fatigue loading sequences and relaxation, while the guided Lamb wave signals were collected using piezoelectric sensors integrated with the specimens.

Toe flexor strength and electromyography activity of the foot muscles were measured in 12 healthy men at 6 different ankle joint angles with the knee joint at 90 deg in the sitting position. To measure the maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles, subjects exerted maximum force on a toe grip dynamometer while the activity levels of the intrinsic and extrinsic plantar muscles were measured. The relation between ankle joint angle and maximum isometric force of the toe flexor muscles was determined, and the isometric force exhibited a peak when the ankle joint was at 70-90 deg on average. From this optimal neutral position, the isometric force gradually decreased and reached its nadir in the plantar flexion position (i.e., 120 deg). The EMG activity of the abductor hallucis (intrinsic plantar muscle) and peroneus longus (extrinsic plantar muscle) did not differ at any ankle joint angles. The results of this study suggest that the force generation of toe flexor muscles is regulated at the ankle joint and that changes in the length-tension relations of the extrinsic plantar muscle could be a reason for the force-generating capacity at the metatarsophalangeal joint when the ankle joint angle is changed.",The different clinical value of susceptibility vessel sign in acute ischemic stroke patients under different interventional therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712778,Journal of clinical neuroscience : official journal of the Neurosurgical Society of Australasia,2019 05 08,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) subtype, one of the most important factors for selecting therapeutic strategies, is difficult to be accurately diagnosed at admission sometimes. The magnetic susceptibility effect of deoxygenated hemoglobin in red thrombi appeared as hypointense signals in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The prognostic value of susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) for stroke subtype, recanalization and outcomes in AIS patients will be comprehensively determined in the present study. A comprehensive search of databases was conducted including the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception up to August 2017. Statistical tests were performed to check for heterogeneity and publication bias. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were also conducted to evaluate the robustness of the conclusions. Overall, 21 studies including 1832 patients were identified. The presence of SVS was significantly associated with cardioembolic stroke than absence of SVS (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.30-1.81, p < 0.001). The patients with SVS were less likely to achieve recanalization (RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.56-0.88, p = 0.002) and poor functional outcome (RR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.44-1.97, p < 0.001) after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), whereas it was similar between two group after endovascular treatment (EVT) (p = 0.990 and p = 0.335).

The presence of SVS appears to be a stronger predictor of cardioembolic stroke. Furthermore, the SVS was associated with a decreasing recanalization rate and poor outcome in AIS patients after IVT but not after EVT.

Although extent of resection (EOR) is a well-known surgical predictor for overall survival most lesions cannot be completely resected. We hypothesize that in the event of incomplete resection, residual tumor volume (RTV) may be a more significant predictor than EOR. This was a multicenter retrospective review of 147 adult glioblastoma patients (mean age 53 years) that underwent standard treatment. Semiautomatic magnetic resonance imaging segmentation was performed for pre- and postoperative scans for volumetric analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed for prognostic factors including: age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, EOR and RTV. EOR and RTV cut-off values for improved OS were determined and internally validated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for 12-month overall survival. Half of the tumors had MGMT promoter methylation (77, 52%). The median tumor volume, EOR and RTV were 43.20 cc, 93.5%, and 3.80 cc respectively. Gross total resection was achieved in 52 patients (35%). Cox proportional hazards regression, ROC and maximum Youden index analyses for RTV and EOR showed that a cut-off value of <3.50 cc (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.48-0.98) and ≥84% (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.96) respectively conferred an overall survival advantage. Independent overall survival predictors were MGMT promoter methylation (adjusted HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23-0.55) and a RTV of <3.50 cc (adjusted HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.95), but not EOR for incompletely resected glioblastomas."

It involves the attachment of ubiquitin, a small, highly conserved protein to selected substrates. The most notable function of ubiquitin is the targeting of modified proteins to the multi-proteolytic 26S proteasome complex for degradation. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) regulates the abundance of numerous enzymes, structural and regulatory proteins ensuring proper cellular function. Plants utilize the UPS to facilitate cellular changes required to respond to and tolerate adverse growth conditions. In this review, the regulatory role of the UPS in responses to abiotic stress is discussed, particularly the function of ubiquitin-dependent degradation in the suppression, activation and attenuation or termination of stress signaling.",Regulation of Plant Immunity by the Proteasome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712674,International review of cell and molecular biology,2019 02 04,"Plants rely on a sophisticated innate immune system to recognize pathogens and defend against pathogen attacks. The immune system must be precisely regulated to be capable of mounting a strong and effective defense response while avoiding autoimmunity. Targeted protein degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays crucial roles in both negative and positive regulations of immunity. In the absence of pathogens, the UPS targets immune receptors and downstream signaling components to maintain their homeostasis. Following pathogen recognition, UPS activity is also required for immune signaling and defense responses. Here we provide an overview of the diverse components of the UPS known to affect plant immunity.",Cross Talk Networks of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Signaling With the Ubiquitin Proteasome System and Their Clinical Implications in Multiple Myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712673,International review of cell and molecular biology,2019 02 04,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy and results from the clonal amplification of plasma cells.

They are composed of ∼90 amino acids and form a classical two α-helical/six β-strand structure. The prototypical ligand is the C-terminus of partner proteins; however, they also bind internal peptide sequences. Recent findings indicate that PDZ domains also bind phosphatidylinositides and cholesterol. Through their ligand interactions, PDZ domain proteins are critical for cellular trafficking and the surface retention of various ion channels. In addition, PDZ proteins are essential for neuronal signaling, memory, and learning. PDZ proteins also contribute to cytoskeletal dynamics by mediating interactions critical for maintaining cell-cell junctions, cell polarity, and cell migration. Given their important biological roles, it is not surprising that their dysfunction can lead to multiple disease states. As such, PDZ domain-containing proteins have emerged as potential targets for the development of small molecular inhibitors as therapeutic agents. Recent data suggest that the critical binding function of PDZ domains in cell signaling is more than just glue, and their binding function can be regulated by phosphorylation or allosterically by other binding partners. These studies also provide a wealth of structural and biophysical data that are beginning to reveal the physical features that endow this small modular domain with a central role in cell signaling.",Glycosylation and Antitumor Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712671,International review of cell and molecular biology,2019 02 04,"Glycosylation and its by-product, the glycan, play a crucial role in many cellular processes.

The Brassicaceae self-incompatibility pathway acts early on when pollen grains have landed on the stigmatic papillae at the top of the pistil. Extensive studies have revealed that self-pollen rejection in the Brassicaceae is initiated by an S-haplotype-specific interaction between two polymorphic proteins: the pollen S-locus protein 11/S cysteine-rich (SP11/SCR) ligand and the stigma S receptor kinase (SRK). While the different S-haplotypes are typically codominant, there are several examples of dominant-recessive interactions, and a small RNA-based regulation of SP11/SCR expression has been uncovered as a mechanism behind these genetic interactions. Recent research has also added to our understanding of various cellular components in the pathway leading from the SP11/SCR-SRK interaction, including two signaling proteins, the M-locus protein kinase (MLPK) and the ARM-repeat containing 1 (ARC1) E3 ligase, as well as calcium fluxes and induction of autophagy in the stigmatic papillae. Finally, a better understanding of the compatible pollen responses that are targeted by the self-incompatibility pathway is starting to emerge, and this will allow us to more fully understand how the Brassicaceae self-incompatibility pathway causes self-pollen rejection. Here, we provide an overview of the field, highlighting recent contributions to our understanding of Brassicaceae self-incompatibility, and draw comparisons to a recently discovered unilateral incompatibility system.",Differential effect of LPS and IL-1β in term placental explants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712669,Placenta,2019 02 04,"Inflammation is an important cause of placental dysfunction often associated with pregnancy complications. One well-known cause of inflammation is infection, through conserved ""pathogen-associated molecular patterns"" (PAMPs). Endogenous inducers of inflammation, known as ""damage-associated molecular patterns"" (DAMPs), have also been associated with pathological pregnancies and could contribute to the observed placental inflammation. Although both stimuli (i.e. PAMPs/DAMPs) can induce inflammation, they have yet to be studied together to compare their inflammatory effects on the placenta."
