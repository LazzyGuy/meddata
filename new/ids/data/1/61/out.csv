However, chronic activation of cGAS by self-DNA leads to severe autoimmune diseases for which no effective treatment is available yet. Here we report that acetylation inhibits cGAS activation and that the enforced acetylation of cGAS by aspirin robustly suppresses self-DNA-induced autoimmunity. We find that cGAS acetylation on either Lys384, Lys394, or Lys414 contributes to keeping cGAS inactive. cGAS is deacetylated in response to DNA challenges. Importantly, we show that aspirin can directly acetylate cGAS and efficiently inhibit cGAS-mediated immune responses. Finally, we demonstrate that aspirin can effectively suppress self-DNA-induced autoimmunity in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) patient cells and in an AGS mouse model. Thus, our study reveals that acetylation contributes to cGAS activity regulation and provides a potential therapy for treating DNA-mediated autoimmune diseases.",Eukaryotic Acquisition of a Bacterial Operon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799038,Cell,2019 04 20,"Operons are a hallmark of bacterial genomes, where they allow concerted expression of functionally related genes as single polycistronic transcripts. They are rare in eukaryotes, where each gene usually drives expression of its own independent messenger RNAs. Here, we report the horizontal operon transfer of a siderophore biosynthesis pathway from relatives of Escherichia coli into a group of budding yeast taxa. We further show that the co-linearly arranged secondary metabolism genes are expressed, exhibit eukaryotic transcriptional features, and enable the sequestration and uptake of iron. After transfer, several genetic changes occurred during subsequent evolution, including the gain of new transcription start sites that were sometimes within protein-coding sequences, acquisition of polyadenylation sites, structural rearrangements, and integration of eukaryotic genes into the cluster. We conclude that the genes were likely acquired as a unit, modified for eukaryotic gene expression, and maintained by selection to adapt to the highly competitive, iron-limited environment.",Human Anti-fungal Th17 Immunity and Pathology Rely on Cross-Reactivity against Candida albicans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799037,Cell,2019 03 08,"Th17 cells provide protection at barrier tissues but may also contribute to immune pathology. The relevance and induction mechanisms of pathologic Th17 responses in humans are poorly understood. Here, we identify the mucocutaneous pathobiont Candida albicans as the major direct inducer of human anti-fungal Th17 cells. Th17 cells directed against other fungi are induced by cross-reactivity to C. albicans. Intestinal inflammation expands total C. albicans and cross-reactive Th17 cells. Strikingly, Th17 cells cross-reactive to the airborne fungus Aspergillus fumigatus are selectively activated and expanded in patients with airway inflammation, especially during acute allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. This indicates a direct link between protective intestinal Th17 responses against C. albicans and lung inflammation caused by airborne fungi. We identify heterologous immunity to a single, ubiquitous member of the microbiota as a central mechanism for systemic induction of human anti-fungal Th17 responses and as a potential risk factor for pulmonary inflammatory diseases.",Extensive Heterogeneity and Intrinsic Variation in Spatial Genome Organization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799036,Cell,2019 06 13,"Several general principles of global 3D genome organization have recently been established, including non-random positioning of chromosomes and genes in the cell nucleus, distinct chromatin compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs). However, the extent and nature of cell-to-cell and cell-intrinsic variability in genome architecture are still poorly characterized. Here, we systematically probe heterogeneity in genome organization. High-throughput optical mapping of several hundred intra-chromosomal interactions in individual human fibroblasts demonstrates low association frequencies, which are determined by genomic distance, higher-order chromatin architecture, and chromatin environment. The structure of TADs is variable between individual cells, and inter-TAD associations are common. Furthermore, single-cell analysis reveals independent behavior of individual alleles in single nuclei. Our observations reveal extensive variability and heterogeneity in genome organization at the level of individual alleles and demonstrate the coexistence of a broad spectrum of genome configurations in a cell population.","Synthesis of (E)-α,β-unsaturated carboxylic esters derivatives from cyanoacetic acid via promiscuous enzyme-promoted cascade esterification/Knoevenagel reaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30799035,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 02 25,"A new enzymatic protocol based on lipase-catalyzed cascade toward (E)-α,β-unsaturated carboxylic esters is presented.

Different techniques, such as UV-Vis, SEM, TEM, FT-IR and GPC were used to characterize the obtained nanoparticles and understand the mechanism of their biosynthesis. The SEM and TEM images demonstrated the presence of silver nanoparticles on the mycelia surface suggesting that these particles are synthesized on the fungal cell wall. FT-IR analysis of the mycelium revealed two main types of compounds (saccharides and proteins) and these molecules might be involved in the formation of silver nanoparticles on the surface of mycelium. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and TEM analysis confirmed the formation of silver nanoparticles with different shapes by the cell-free extract of P. cyclopium. Their size ranges from 12 to 25 nm and possess an average size of 16 ± 6 nm. GPC analysis of this filtrate revealed a few peaks responsible for polysaccharides and proteins presence. The only protein fraction with the mass approximately to 5000 Da indicated the formation of silver nanoparticles. Polypeptide(s) as the major molecules involved in biomineralization of silver by the cell-free extract of P. cyclopium are suggested.

Training patients to manage aspects of their own care has the potential to enhance health literacy and increase patient involvement, independence, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness of care. Complex reasons underlie the variable use of PD across the world, acting at the level of the patient, the health care team that is responsible for them, and the health care system that they find themselves in. Important among these is the availability of competitively priced dialysis fluid. A number of key interventions can affect the uptake of PD. These include high-quality patient education around dialysis modality choice, timely and successful catheter placement, satisfactory patient training, and continued support that is tailored for specific needs, for example, when people present late requiring dialysis. Several health system changes have been shown to increase PD use, such as targeted funding, PD First initiatives, or physician-inserted PD catheters. This review explores the factors that explain the considerable international variation in the use of PD and presents interventions that can potentially affect them."

These programs are mediated by multiple cytosolic and endosomal sensors and adaptor molecules (c-GAS/STING axis and TLR9/MyD88 axis, respectively) and lead to the production of type I interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. While the identity and role of multiple pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been elucidated, such immune surveillance systems must be tightly regulated to limit collateral damage and prevent aberrant responses to self- and non-self-nucleic acids. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how cytosolic sensing of DNA is controlled during inflammatory immune responses.",Intracellular RNA Sensing in Mammalian Cells: Role in Stress Response and Cancer Therapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798990,International review of cell and molecular biology,2019 02 25,"DNA damage has been considered the primary action of ionizing radiation (IR) in normal and tumor cells resulting in cell autonomous death. However, recent findings have elucidated novel local and systemic effects of IR mediated by the induction of Type I interferons (IFN) and activation of adaptive immune responses. These responses are initiated by DNA- and RNA-dependent activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRR) which comprise an innate immunity system responsible for detection of exogenous pathogens, mounting of an anti-viral response, and activation of adaptive immunity. Activation of cytoplasmic RNA sensors by endogenous dsRNAs has emerged as an important mechanism of tumor cell-intrinsic Type I IFN induction in the response to genotoxic therapies. The fact that an effective anti-tumor effect of IR and chemotherapy response is dependent on the RNA sensing pathways indicates that tumor cells are equipped by functional innate immunity system which recognizes genotoxic stress insult as an intrusion of exogenous RNA pathogens. This indicates that DNA damage leads to the RNA stress, which is recognized as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) presented by aberrant RNA molecules interacting with cytoplasmic RNA sensors. In the current review, we will discuss the mechanistic bases for RNA-dependent innate responses in tumor cells, RNA ligands recognized as DAMPs, and the potential implications of these findings to improve cancer therapies.",Cytosolic Nucleic Acid Sensors in Inflammatory and Autoimmune Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798989,International review of cell and molecular biology,2019 02 25,"Innate immunity employs germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to sense microbial pattern molecules. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by various PPRs located on the cell membrane or in the cytosol leads to the activation of cell signaling pathways and production of inflammatory mediators. Nucleic acids including DNA, RNA, and their derivatives are potent PAMPs which can be recognized by multiple PRRs to induce inflammatory responses. While nucleic acid sensors can also sense endogenous nucleic acids, they are capable of discriminating self from non-self. However, defects in nucleic acid sensing PRRs or dysregulation of nucleic acid sensing signaling pathways may cause excessive activation of the immune system resulting in the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

In other words, most pathogens possess intrinsic differences that can distinguish them from host cells. For example, bacteria and fungi have cell walls comprised of peptidoglycan and carbohydrates (like mannans), respectively. Germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and C-type lectin receptor (CLR) family have the ability to detect such unique pathogen associated features. However, some TLRs and members of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), or AIM2-like receptor (ALR) family can sense pathogen invasion based on pathogen nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are not unique to pathogens, thus raising the question of how such PRRs evolved to detect pathogens but not self. In this chapter, we will examine the PRRs that sense pathogen nucleic acids and subsequently activate the inflammasome signaling pathway. We will examine the selective mechanisms by which these receptors distinguish pathogens from ""self"" and discuss the importance of such pathways in disease development in animal models and human patients.",Nucleic Acid Sensing Perturbation: How Aberrant Recognition of Self-Nucleic Acids May Contribute to Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798986,International review of cell and molecular biology,2019 02 25,"Bacteria and mammalian cells have developed sophisticated sensing mechanisms to detect and eliminate foreign genetic material or to restrict its expression and replication. Progress has been made in the understanding of these mechanisms, which keep foreign or unwanted nucleic acids in check.

Nucleic acids, which are critical components for inheriting genetic information in all species, including pathogens, are key structures recognized by the innate immune system. However, while nucleic acid recognition is required for host defense against pathogens, there is a potential risk of self-nucleic acids recognition. In fact, besides its essential contribution to antiviral or microbial defense and restriction of endogenous retro elements, deregulation of nucleic acid immunity can also lead to human diseases due to erroneous detection and response to self-nucleic acids, causing sterile inflammation and autoimmunity. In this review we will discuss the roles of nucleic acid receptors in guarding against pathogen invasion, and how the microbial environment could interfere or influence immune sensing in discriminating between self and non-self and how this may contribute to autoimmunity or inflammatory diseases."

We compared the clinical and procedural characteristics and outcomes of CTO PCIs performed with or without atherectomy in a contemporary multicenter CTO PCI registry. Between 2012 and 2018, 3,607 CTO PCIs were performed at 21 participating centers. Atherectomy was used in 117 (3.2%) cases: rotational atherectomy in 105 cases, orbital atherectomy in 8, and both in 4 cases. Patients in whom atherectomy was used, were older (68 ± 8 vs 64 ± 10 years, p <0.0001) and had higher Japan-chronic total occlusion score (3.0 ± 1.2 vs 2.4 ± 1.3, p <0.0001).

Molecular cell research,2019 05 21,"Calcium plays a key role in many different steps of the reproduction process, from germ cell maturation to placental development. However, the exact function and regulation of calcium throughout subsequent reproductive events remains rather enigmatic. Successful pregnancy requires the establishment of a complex dialogue between the implanting embryo and the endometrium. On the one hand, endometrial cell will undergo massive changes to support an implanting embryo, including stromal cell decidualization. On the other hand, trophoblast cells from the trophectoderm surrounding the inner cell mass will differentiate and acquire new functions such as hormone secretion, invasion and migration. The need for calcium in the different gestational processes implicates the presence of specialized ion channels to regulate calcium homeostasis. The superfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels is a class of calcium permeable ion channels that is involved in the transformation of extracellular stimuli into the influx of calcium, inducing and coordinating underlying signaling pathways. Although the necessity of calcium throughout reproduction cannot be negated, the expression and functionality of TRP channels throughout gestation remains elusive. This review provides an overview of the current evidence regarding the expression and function of TRP channels in reproduction.",Murine models of hapten-induced asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798944,Toxicology,2019 05 01,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the respiratory tract that is characterized by reversible airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness.

The development of adequate animal models of non-allergic asthma is a necessary prerequisite both for understanding the pathophysiology of non-allergic asthma and for the possibility of testing new therapies. Still, there is no ideal model that represents all the hallmarks of this complex disease. In this review, we examine the most popular hapten-induced murine models of occupational and non-atopic asthma.

The loss of the continuity of the DNA molecule presents a challenge to the cells, thus the repair of DNA double strand breaks might lead to genomic alterations. Indeed, to minimize this threat to genomic integrity, different DNA repair pathways can act on a broken chromosome. The balance between them is tightly controlled, and it heavily depends on global and local cellular cues. In this chapter, we review our current understanding on the repair of DNA double strand breaks and focus in the regulation of the balance between alternative pathways. Most of this modulation takes place at the level of DNA end resection. Here, we focus mostly on the local signals that control the repair pathway choice, as the global cues have been extensively reviewed recently.

These mechanisms coordinate repair with cell cycle progression, lead to DSB repair pathway choice, provide accessibility of repair machinery to damaged sites and move the lesions to nuclear environments permissive for repair.",A computational model to predict the structural and functional consequences of missense mutations in O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798937,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2019 02 25,"DNA repair mechanism is a process through which the cell repairs its damaged DNA. Although there are several mechanisms involved in the DNA repair mechanisms, the direct reversal method is the simplest and does not require a reference template, in which the guanine bases are often methylated, and the methyl guanine methyl transferase protein (MGMT) reverses them. The mutations occurring in the MGMT protein might result in dysfunction of such DNA repair mechanism. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the impact of six missense mutations (Y114E, Y114A, R128G, R128A, R128K, and C145A) at three active-site positions (Y114, C145, and R128) as this might hinder the DNA binding to the protein. These six mutations were subjected to pathogenicity, stability, and conservation analysis using online servers such as PredictSNP, iStable, and ConSurf, respectively. From the predictions, all the six mutations were almost predicted to be significant. Considering true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, three mutations (Y114E, R128G, and C145A) showed ""loss of DNA repair activity,"" and were analyzed further using molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) using GROMACS for 50ns. MDS run showed that the C145A mutant demonstrated higher structural deviation, decreased compactness, and the binding patterns. The Y114E mutant showed almost a null effect from the structural analysis. Finally, the R128G mutant showed structural variations in between the C145A and Y114E mutations of MGMT protein. We believe that the observed findings in this computational approach might further pave a way of providing better treatment measures by understanding the DNA repair mechanisms.",Elucidating the role of interacting residues of the MSH2-MSH6 complex in DNA repair mechanism: A computational approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798936,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2019 02 25,"The DNA repair system is crucial to repair the error resulting in DNA replication. MSH2-MSH6 protein complex plays a significant role in maintaining the mismatch repair mechanism. Mutations in the interface between the two proteins compromise their function in the repair process. The present study aims to understand the impact of missense mutations in the interacting sites of the MSH2-MSH6 protein complex. MSH6 is unstable due to the disordered N-terminal domain. This is stabilized by the MSH2 hetero-dimerization. We used pathogenicity and stability predictors to identify the missense mutations that could be more pathogenic with the destabilizing property. The mutations W764C of MSH2, and L1201F and G1316E of MSH6 were predicted to be highly deleterious and destabilizing by all the in silico predictors. The dynamic motion of the native and mutant (W764C) MSH2-MSH6 protein complexes was further investigated using Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the GROMACS package. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Radius of Gyration (Rg), and change in a number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) were analyzed using the embedded packages of GROMACS. From the simulation studies, we observed higher deviation, lower protein compactness, and a decrease in the number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the mutant W764C MSH2-MSH6 protein complex. The observed results from the computational methods suggest the involvement of higher structural impact on the MSH2-MSH6 protein complex upon W764C mutation could affect the DNA repair mechanism.","Mechanistic link between DNA damage sensing, repairing and signaling factors and immune signaling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798935,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2019 02 25,"Previously, DNA damage sensing, repairing and signaling machineries were thought to mainly suppress genomic instability in response to genotoxic stress. Emerging evidence indicates a crosstalk between DNA repair machinery and the immune system. In this chapter, we attempt to decipher the molecular choreography of how factors, including ATM, BRCA1, DNA-PK, FANCA/D2, MRE11, MUS81, NBS1, RAD51 and TREX1, of multiple DNA metabolic processes are directly or indirectly involved in suppressing cytosolic DNA sensing pathway-mediated immune signaling. We provide systematic details showing how different DDR factors' roles in modulating immune signaling are not direct, but are rather a consequence of their inherent ability to sense, repair and signal in response to DNA damage. Unexpectedly, most DDR factors negatively impact the immune system; that is, the immune system shows defective signaling if there are defects in DNA repair pathways. Thus, in addition to their known DNA repair and replication functions, DDR factors help prevent erroneous activation of immune signaling. A more precise understanding of the mechanisms by which different DDR factors function in immune signaling can be exploited to redirect the immune system for both preventing and treating autoimmunity, cellular senescence and cancer in humans.",cAMP-mediated regulation of melanocyte genomic instability: A melanoma-preventive strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798934,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2019 02 25,"Malignant melanoma of the skin is the leading cause of death from skin cancer and ranks fifth in cancer incidence among all cancers in the United States. While melanoma mortality has remained steady for the past several decades, melanoma incidence has been increasing, particularly among fair-skinned individuals. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly 10,000 people in the United States will die from melanoma this year. Individuals with dark skin complexion are protected damage generated by UV-light due to the high content of UV-blocking melanin pigment in their epidermis as well as better capacity for melanocytes to cope with UV damage. There is now ample evidence that suggests that the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a major melanoma risk factor. Inherited loss-of-function mutations in MC1R are common in melanoma-prone persons, correlating with a less melanized skin complexion and poorer recovery from mutagenic photodamage. We and others are interested in the MC1R signaling pathway in melanocytes, its mechanisms of enhancing genomic stability and pharmacologic opportunities to reduce melanoma risk based on those insights. In this chapter, we review melanoma risk factors, the MC1R signaling pathway, and the relationship between MC1R signaling and DNA repair."

Although such stabilizers facilitate the anastomosis procedure by immobilizing the heart and holding the surgery site steady, they can cause damage to the heart tissue and rupture of the capillary vessels, due to applying relatively large pressures on the epicardium. In this paper, we propose an advanced robotic approach to perform TECAB on a beating heart with minimal invasiveness. The idea comes from the fact that the main pulsations of the heart occur as excursions in normal direction, i.e., perpendicular to the heart surface. We devise a 1-DOF flexible heart stabilizer which eliminates the lateral movements of the heart, and a 1-DOF compensator mechanism which follows the heart trajectory in the normal direction, thus canceling the relative motion between the surgical tool and the heart surface. In fact, we bring a compromise between two radical approaches of operating on a completely immobilized beating heart with no heart motion compensation, and operating on a freely beating heart with full compensation of heart motion, considering the invasiveness of the first and the technical challenges of the second approach. We propose operating on a partially stabilized beating heart with unidirectional compensation of the heart motion; the flexible stabilizer would exert much less holding force to the heart tissue and the robotic system with unidirectional compensator would be technically feasible. In the proposed approach, a motion sensor mounted on the stabilizer measures the heart excursion data and sends it into a control unit. A predictive controller uses this data to generate an automated trajectory. The slave robots follow this trajectory, which is superimposed on the surgeon's tele-operation commands received from a master console. Finally, the tool-activation units in the slave robots actuate the articulated laparoscopic tools to perform the anastomosis procedure. The evaluation of the hypothesis showed that our solution for the robotic TECAB on beating heart is both practical and cost effective. We showed in an in-vivo study that the flexible stabilizer can effectively restrict the heart lateral movements, while allowing for its normal excursion. We found readily available linear motors which could afford the high forces, speeds and accelerations required for following the heart trajectory. Finally, we showed that the tool-activation unit is capable of providing the maneuverability and workspace required for the most challenging task of CABG procedure, i.e., anastomosis suturing.",Impact of parenting on the development of chronic diseases in adulthood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798922,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"The life course theory refers to a method developed in the 1960s that utilizes a multifaceted approach to evaluate people's lives, structural contexts, and social change.

We discuss the myriad adverse childhood experiences that may contribute to the development of chronic diseases in adulthood and offer several strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of adverse childhood experiences and educating parents about their responsibilities of nurturing and preparing a child for life.",RISUG® based improved intrauterine contraceptive device (IIUCD) could impart protective effects against development of endometrial cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798920,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices with multifaceted application potential is a need of an hour. Although, copper-based IUDs exert an effective contraceptive as well as anticancer effects in a long-term basis, but also results in multiple complications. In this regard, RISUG® a polymer based contraceptive device has been introduced as a suitable alternative. However, its potential to impart protective effects against development of endometrial cancer still remains unexplored. This article presents the hypothesis on this unexplored domain and provides scientific facts to support the hypothesis. The mechanism of anticancerous activity is hypothesized that RISUG® involves its lipid membrane destabilizing activity. This activity is modulated by both, the cellular microenvironment and lipid bilayer composition. Acidic environment along with the significantly higher fluidic nature of lipid bilayer of the cancerous cells make them more prone to lipid solubilisation effect of RISUG®. We here present an in-depth insight into the factors that would favour faster solubilisation of cancer cell membrane, thereby exerting an anticancer effect.",Pathomechanism of traumatic indirect choroidal rupture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798919,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"The probable chain of events responsible for choroidal rupture is as follows. During high-speed orbital injuries, the protective ocular reflexes position the eye in an elevated, and abducted position. At this point in time, the anteroposterior compressive forces on to the globe create an eccentrically positioned circle of damaging currents along the posterior ocular coats against a relatively static optic nerve. Because of this eccentricity, a longer radius of curvature is expected to lie along the temporal half of the globe leading to an elastic recoil of the retinal and scleral layers and a fracture along the RPE-Bruch's-Choriocapillaris complex manifesting clinically as choroidal rupture.",Laparoscopic promontofixation: Where to stop the anterior dissection?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798918,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,Laparoscopic promontofixation is the gold standard to treat apical defects but the dissection of the anterior compartment is variable since based on surgical judgment only.

Clinical evidence of a specific field-to-protein interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798917,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"The atrioventricular node (AV) is considered the electrical connection between the atria and ventricles. There is an electrical pause between activation of the atria and the ventricles (PR segment), but to date the mechanism responsible for this interruption remains unclear. The present communication focuses on the hypothesis that magnetic field dynamics could provide the answer. Proof of this hypothesis is that in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, where there is physical connection between the atria and ventricles (bundle of Kent), there is electrical AV continuity, no PR segment is detected, and catheter ablation of the abnormal bundle restores AV discontinuity. Spontaneous initiation of the heart at the level of the sinus node, the pacemaker of the heart, could also be explained via field dynamics. The known transmembrane pacemaker protein CHN4, present in both sinoatrial and AV nodal cells, could interact with field information to provide specificity in an electronic key-to-lock mechanism interaction.","Cannabis use during pregnancy: Are we at the verge of defining a ""fetal cannabis spectrum disorder""?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798916,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"Cannabis is probably the drug most commonly used globally since ancient times. Following the trend of legalization of access to cannabis in several Western countries, its use has increased in North America over the past few years. In spite of warnings of the potential hazards associated with in-utero exposure to cannabis, approximately 10% of pregnant women in an American study reported using cannabis in recent years, and most of them on a daily basis. Significant effects of prenatal cannabis exposure have been found on children's sleep, cognitive functions (memory and scholastic skills), as well as on executive (frontal lobe) functions (reasoning, attention, impulsivity, and motivation), and affective (depression) and anxiety symptoms throughout the stages of development. Following the presentation of two case vignettes, we integrate the published information on outcomes of maternal use of cannabis during pregnancy on the developing fetus and the ""soft"" neurological deficits and neuro-behavioral disturbances manifested by them from early childhood and evolving to peaks in adolescence. Taken together, these data serve to define what we call a heretofore unspecified ""fetal cannabis spectrum disorder"".",Cellular stress and AMPK links metformin and diverse compounds with accelerated emergence from anesthesia and potential recovery from disorders of consciousness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798915,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"The neural correlates of consciousness and the mechanisms by which general anesthesia (GA) modulate such correlates to induce loss of consciousness (LOC) has been described as one of the biggest mysteries of modern medicine. Several cellular targets and neural circuits have been identified that play a critical role in LOC induced by GA, including the GABAA receptor and ascending arousal nuclei located in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and brain stem. General anesthetics (GAs) including propofol and inhalational agents induce LOC in part by potentiating chloride influx through the GABAA receptor, leading to neural inhibition and LOC. Interestingly, nearly all GAs used clinically may also induce paradoxical excitation, a phenomenon in which GAs promote neuronal excitation at low doses before inducing unconsciousness. Additionally, emergence from GA, a passive process that occurs after anesthetic removal, is associated with lower anesthetic concentrations in the brain compared to doses associated with induction of GA. AMPK, an evolutionarily conserved kinase activated by cellular stress (e.g. increases in calcium [Ca2+] and/or reactive oxygen species [ROS], etc.) increases lifespan and healthspan in several model organisms. AMPK is located throughout the mammalian brain, including in neurons of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and striatum as well as in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. Increases in ROS and Ca2+ play critical roles in neuronal excitation and glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, activates AMPK in cortical neurons. Nearly every neurotransmitter released from ascending arousal circuits that promote wakefulness, arousal, and consciousness activates AMPK, including acetylcholine, histamine, orexin-A, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Several GAs that are commonly used to induce LOC in human patients also activate AMPK (e.g. propofol, sevoflurane, isoflurane, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, midazolam). Various compounds that accelerate emergence from anesthesia, thus mitigating problematic effects associated with delayed emergence such as delirium, also activate AMPK (e.g. nicotine, caffeine, forskolin, carbachol). GAs and neurotransmitters also act as preconditioning agents and the GABAA receptor inhibitor bicuculline, which reverses propofol anesthesia, also activates AMPK in cortical neurons. We propose the novel hypothesis that cellular stress-induced AMPK activation links wakefulness, arousal, and consciousness with paradoxical excitation and accelerated emergence from anesthesia. Because AMPK activators including metformin and nicotine promote proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells located in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus, AMPK activation may also enhance brain repair and promote potential recovery from disorders of consciousness (i.e. minimally conscious state, vegetative state, coma).",Fructose-associated hepatotoxicity indexed by the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798914,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"Modern diets have become increasingly rich in fructose, for example through the addition of high-fructose corn syrup to many foods and drinks. It has been suggested that this might lead to hepatotoxicity, including the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. After entering hepatocytes via insulin-independent glucose transporter 2 transmembrane carrier proteins, fructose is phosphorylated to fructose-1-phosphate in a reaction catalysed by fructokinase (ketohexokinase). In turn, fructose-1-phosphate is hydrolysed by aldolase B to glyceraldehydes. Glyceraldehydes may enter gluconeogenesis via fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and fructose-6-phosphate; glyceraldehydes may also enter glycogenolysis via pyruvate. The last pathway involves conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Alternatively, pyruvate may be converted, via the action of the hepatic lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme LDH-5, into lactate. In liver damage, the LDH-5 isoenzyme becomes elevated, predominantly in serum/plasma. We therefore hypothesised that if dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity, there should be a positive correlation between erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate and plasma LDH-5. This hypothesis was tested by assaying venous blood samples taken from 39 patients at rest, three hours after eating. Quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectrometry following gel electrophoresis was used to assay erythrocyte fructose-6-phosphate levels. Similarly, plasma LDH-5 concentrations were spectrophotometrically analysed, using the pyruvate-lactate reaction, following electrophoretic separation of the LDH isoenzymes. A significant positive correlation was found between the two variables (r = 0.44, p = 0.0047). This result, which supports our hypothesis, is evidence in favour of the possibility that dietary fructose is associated with hepatotoxicity. In addition to being a marker of hepatic damage, LDH-5 may play a more direct epigenetic role in causing liver damage; acute hepatic injury is associated with nuclear translocation of LDH, causing the production of lactate from pyruvate in the nucleus; in turn, the lactate inhibits histone deacetylase and is associated with upregulation of genes associated with the damage response, leading to cell death.",Psychosis is an extension of mood swings from the perspective of neuronal plasticity impairments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798913,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"We previously hypothesized that depressive and manic states may be consecutive presentations of the same underlying neuronal plasticity, and that moderate impairments in neuronal plasticity cause depressive states while further impairment to neuronal plasticity causes manic states. Psychopathological or biological relationships between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have also been revealed. Therefore, in addition to depressive and manic states, psychosis may also be considered a manifestation resulting from additional impairments to neuronal plasticity. In the present manuscript, we hypothesize that moderate and more severe impairments to neuronal plasticity cause depressive and manic states, respectively, and that more serious impairments to neuronal plasticity cause psychosis. Many studies have suggested that impairments in neuronal plasticity contribute to schizophrenia and other mental disorders with psychotic features, and that the impairment of neuronal plasticity in schizophrenia is more severe than that in bipolar disorder. Therefore, we hypothesize more specifically that impairments in neuronal plasticity may be more severe in the order of the cases featuring psychosis, mania, and depression. This progression notably overlaps with the arrangement of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder in the DSM-5. Psychotic symptoms are thought to appear further towards the base of the psychopathological hierarchy than are manic or depressive symptoms. If impairments to neuronal plasticity contribute to this psychopathological hierarchy, as we contest that they do, our hypothesis may serve as a bridge between clinical psychopathology, diagnosis, and biological psychiatry."

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a successful, safe and reliable minimally invasive method in the treatment of renal stones, especially big (≥2 cm) or complex ones. Gaining access is the most critical step of this procedure, which can affect the rest of the operation. Although previously described techniques, eye of the needle and triangulation techniques, are being used for gaining access, urologists (especially novice ones) can still have problems during this step. Some navigation concepts have been developed in order to make the access safer, easier and more successful, however, none of them has been incorporated in daily routine practice till now because of either complicated techniques or requirement of sophisticated equipment. Our hypothesis is that the access point, direction angle and access angle in order to touch a stone during PCNL can be calculated by the data obtained from the computed tomography images with the help of mathematical formulations, namely the theorem of the cosine.",Does the measurement of the difference of resistive indexes in spleen and kidney might be used for characterization of intrarenal tardus parvus phenomenon in chronic kidney disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798900,Medical hypotheses,2019 02 25,"Doppler sonography is used as a routine test for detection of renal artery stenosis (RAS). Although increased peak systolic velocity at the site of the narrowing is a widely accepted method for assessing main renal artery stenosis, tardus parvus phenomenon detected on the downstream blood flow has been used as an alternative to direct insonation of the main artery. However, the uncertainty about the best Doppler parameter to be used for characterization of tardus parvus has yielded a variety of studies. Recently, the difference between the resistive index of the spleen and kidney (RISK) has been proposed as a potential marker of kidney damage and Doppler criterion for RAS in hypertensive patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). The hypothesis of this study was to speculate further and propose the RISK as valuable new Doppler diagnostic criteria for the tardus parvus in CKD too. Data from 183 control patients and 135 chronic kidney disease patients (CKD) were included in the study to test the feasibility of the method and plausibility of the hypothesis. Criteria inclusion was a color Doppler ultrasound measurement of the renal (RRI) and spleen resistive index (SRI). Serum creatinine (0.83 ± 0.20 vs 3.27 ± 1.74), RRI (0.60 ± 0.06 vs 0.69 ± 0.09), SRI (0.55 ± 0.06 vs 0.58 ± 0.09), RISK (0.06 ± 0.04 vs 0.11 ± 0.08), and spleen size (94.1 ± 13.2 vs 100.8 ± 16.5) were higher in CKD patients (p < 0.05). RRI correlated with SRI in both groups; however, the coefficient of determination was different (Z = 2.29, p = 0.022). In the CKD group, RISK correlated inversely with age (r = -0.276; p = 0.001) and positively with creatinine (r = 0.509; p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis, creatinine remained an independent predictor of the high RISK (Wald = 13.07; p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.33-2.62). Since extraneous factors similarly influence RRI and SRI, the SRI can be considered the correction factor that can estimate the cardiovascular burden on the RRI. Consequently, according to the suggested hypothesis, RISK helps to distinguish the tardus parvus related to RAS from tardus parvus related to systemic influences on Doppler morphology. The identification of the underlying mechanisms of tardus parvus, would help a more accurate characterization of the phenomenon and improve screening and diagnostic test for RAS in CKD patients.",The epidemiology of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in a representative cohort of young people in England and Wales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798897,The lancet.

Like many other fungi, the Fusarium genus produces a wide range of secondary metabolites of which only few have been characterized. Recently a novel gene cluster was discovered in F. pseudograminearum, which encodes production of cytokinin-like metabolites collectively named Fusarium cytokinins. They are structurally similar to plant cytokinins and can activate cytokinin signalling in vitro and in planta. Here, the regulation of Fusarium cytokinin production was analysed in vitro. This revealed that, similar to deoxynivalenol (DON) production in Fusariumgraminearum, cytokinin production can be induced in vitro by specific nitrogen sources in a pH-dependent manner. DON production was also induced in both F. graminearum and F. pseudograminearum in cytokinin-inducing conditions. In addition, microscopic analyses of wheat seedlings infected with a F. pseudograminearum cytokinin reporter strain showed that the fungus specifically induces its cytokinin production in hyphae, which are in close association with the plant, suggestive of a function of Fusarium cytokinins during infection.",Different cadmium tolerance of two isolates of Hebeloma mesophaeum showing different basal expression levels of metallothionein (HmMT3) gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798880,Fungal biology,2019 04 03,"Hebeloma mesophaeum is an ectomycorrhizal fungus frequently associated with metal disturbed environments. In this work, we examined Ag, Cd, and Zn tolerance of H. mesophaeum isolates from heavy metal-polluted (isolate Prib) and clean (isolate Rez) sites. Both mycelia showed essentially the same level of Ag and Zn tolerance, but Prib was more Cd tolerant. In short-term exposures, Prib accumulated slightly less Cd than Rez. Size exclusion chromatography of cell-free extracts and fluorescence microscopy of hyphae with a Cd-specific fluorescent tracer revealed that substantial proportion of Cd was contained in the vacuoles in both isolates. Considering that the proportion of Cd associated with fractions attributable to Cd complexes with cytosolic, metallothionein (MT) peptides was higher in Prib, we examined the copy number and basal levels of HmMTs genes in Rez and Prib. While no difference between the isolates was observed in the gene copy numbers and basal levels of HmMT1 transcripts, the basal transcription of HmMT3 was 3-fold higher in Prib. These observations suggest that MTs provide in Prib better protection against Cd. Furthermore, the higher Cd tolerance in Prib can be to some extent also supported by the efflux or reduced uptake of Cd in the hyphae.",Anaerobic fungal communities differ along the horse digestive tract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798879,Fungal biology,2019 04 03,"Anaerobic fungi are potent fibre degrading microbes in the equine hindgut, yet our understanding of their diversity and community structure is limited to date. In this preliminary work, using a clone library approach we studied the diversity of anaerobic fungi along six segments of the horse hindgut: caecum, right ventral colon (RVC), left ventral colon (LVC), left dorsal colon (LDC), right dorsal colon (RDC) and rectum. Of the 647 ITS1 clones, 61.7 % were assigned to genus level groups that are so far without any cultured representatives, and 38.0 % were assigned to the cultivated genera Neocallimastix (35.1 %), Orpinomyces (2.3 %), and Anaeromyces (0.6 %). AL1 dominated the group of uncultured anaerobic fungi, particularly in the RVC (88 %) and LDC (97 %).

Though R-genes have been characterised, little information is known about the molecular details of the interaction between pathogen and host. Based on the recently published genome sequence of the black spot fungus, we analysed gene models with various bioinformatic tools utilising the expression data of infected host tissues, which led to the prediction of 827 secreted proteins. A significant proportion of the predicted secretome comprises enzymes for the degradation of cell wall components, several of which were highly expressed during the first infection stages. As the secretome comprises major factors determining the ability of the fungus to colonise its host, we focused our further analyses on predicted effector candidates. In total, 52 sequences of 251 effector candidates matched several bioinformatic criteria of effectors, contained a Y/F/WxC motif, and did not match annotated proteins from other fungi. Additional sequences were identified based on their high expression levels during the penetration/haustorium formation phase and/or by matching known effectors from other fungi. Several host genotypes that are resistant to the sequenced isolate but differ in the R-genes responsible for this resistance are available. The combination of these genotypes with functional studies of the identified candidate effectors will allow the mechanisms of the rose black spot interaction to be dissected.","UV-C irradiation compromises conidial germination, formation of appressoria, and induces transcription of three putative photolyase genes in the barley powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798877,Fungal biology,2019 04 03,"UV-C irradiation is known to compromise germination of Blumeria graminis conidia and to reduce powdery mildew infestation. However, only scarce information is available on the effects of UV-C irradiation on B. graminis appressorium formation. Applying a Formvar® resin-based in vitro system allowed for analyzing B. graminis germination and appressorium formation in absence of plant defense. UV-C irradiation more strongly affected the differentiation of appressoria than conidial germination. In vivo and in vitro, a single dose of 100 J m-2 UV-C was sufficient to reduce germination to less than 20 % and decrease appressorium formation to values below 5 %. UV-C irradiation negatively affected pustule size and conidiation. White light-mediated photoreactivation was most effective immediately after UV-C irradiation, indicating that a prolonged phase of darkness after UV-C treatment increases the efficacy of B. graminis control. UV-C irradiation increased transcript levels of three putative B. graminis photolyase genes, while mere white light or blue light irradiation did not contribute to the transcriptional up-regulation. Thus, UV-C irradiation effectively controls B. graminis infestation and proliferation by restricting prepenetration processes. Nevertheless, photoreactivation plays an important role in UV-C-based powdery mildew control in crops and hence has to be considered for planning specific irradiation schedules.",Dominant effects of gat1 mutations on the ligninolytic activity of the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798876,Fungal biology,2019 04 03,"In nature, white-rot fungi efficiently degrade lignin present in wood biomass.

In this study, we reveal that the mutations in gat1 gene cause defects in fruiting body development in P. ostreatus. Unlike the previously reported recessive gene mutations that decrease the ligninolytic activity of P. ostreatus, the gat1-1 mutation and Δgat1 are dominant and would thus be useful for future studies on the functional role of the orthologs in other white-rot fungi.",Identification and expression analysis of Pofst3 suggests a role during Pleurotus ostreatus primordia formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798875,Fungal biology,2019 04 03,"Only a few transcription factors involved in mushroom development have been reported till now, Therefore, identification of transcription factors in common edible mushroom has commercial and scientific importance. In this study, the Pofst3 gene from Pleurotus ostreatus was cloned and characterized. Bioinformatics analysis showed that Pofst3 protein had 71% sequence similarity with fst3 of model mushroom Schizophyllum commune. Furthermore, the function of Pofst3 gene was analyzed by overexpression and antisense silencing in P. ostreatus via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Expression verification of Pofst3 in transformants through qRT-PCR showed that compared with the wild type strains, the transcription level was about 1.26 ∼ 9.59 and 0.01 ∼ 0.30 fold in Pofst3 overexpressing and silencing strains, respectively. Petri dish and bag cultivation tests of transgenic strains showed that the number of primordia and the type of fruiting bodies of Pofst3 overexpressing strains were consistent with the wild type strains, i.e. fewer primordia and larger fruiting bodies; the number of primordia formed by Pofst3 silencing strains were more than those of wild type strains, but fruiting bodies were smaller. It was very likely that Pofst3 was involved in the regulation of P. ostreatus development through inhibiting the formation of clusters of primordia."

Small amounts of bodily fluid traces and (skin) contact traces are currently not visualized in standard forensic practice. Trace recovery is usually based on the information available in a particular case and on the experience and 'forensic common sense' applied by the trace recovery expert. Interactions between an offender and a victim may have characteristic features, resulting in specific trace patterns. Understanding these interactions, and their resulting trace patterns, might improve crime related trace recovery as well as DNA typing success rates. In this study, we examined the interactions between offender and victim when a body has been relocated from one position/location to another. The contact between the hands of the offender and the body of the victim was visualized using a fluorescent dye in a lotion that was applied to the hands of the individual undertaking the relocation. The contact locations were scored and patterns were analyzed based on both victim and offender characteristics (height, weight, age, gender). The resulting patterns were compared to current trace recovery practices in the Netherlands.

They typically involve the examination of clothing for damage such as cut, tear or thermal damage, often then followed by experimental scenario testing to help ascertain the cause of the damage. Understanding the underpinning science is central to the accurate interpretation of the complex mechanism of damage formation. In a stabbing incident for example, an understanding of the dynamic relationship between the knife blade, fabric and skin (or skin simulant) is critical. Recent reports, including the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) report, have scrutinised forensic feature-based comparison techniques. Whilst textile damage was not a focus area, it can be considered a feature-based evidence class, and one which is currently largely reliant upon a practitioner's opinion, experience and professional judgement. This paper will review the current state of textile damage examinations in Australia and survey research being conducted to address the issues raised in the context of the PCAST report. The central contribution of observational data to the evidence class of textile damage will also be explored, as well as some practical measures to counter the effects of cognitive bias.",The importance of dark adaptation for forensic examinations; an evaluation of the Crime-lite Eye™.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798860,Science & justice : journal of the Forensic Science Society,2019 02 25,"Forensic practitioners are recommended to dark adapt their eyes prior to conducting evidential searches in the dark. The dark adaptation process remains poorly standardised across the discipline, with little quantified regarding the benefits of such preparative steps. Herein, we report the findings of a study that recruited 50 participants to assess the effectiveness of the Crime-lite Eye™, a darkness adaptation device developed to assist forensic practitioners both in the laboratory and in field. Participants were tasked with searching for the fluorescent signatures left by reaction of 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one (DFO) with amino acids, in a manner akin to the fluorogenic fingerprint treatment of porous evidence. Using an Epson Stylus Photo R265 inkjet printer, ink cartridges were filled with alanine solutions of various concentrations, allowing different motifs to be printed onto copy paper and subsequently developed using DFO. Participants searched for this 'evidence' both with and without dark adapted vision. On average, participants were able to locate and correctly recognise 16% more evidence once dark adapted using the Crime-lite Eye™. The increase in evidence located by participants once dark adapted suggests that crime scene officers should be dark adapting in order to visualise as much as possible. The time taken to dark adapt, 10 min on average during this study, is not excessively long, and should not significantly slow the investigation.",Visualising the past - An evaluation of processes and sequences for fingermark recovery from old documents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798859,Science & justice : journal of the Forensic Science Society,2019 02 25,"This study aimed to collect data on the effectiveness of most of the fingermark visualisation reagents currently used on porous surfaces on fingermarks aged for up to 90 years, significantly extending the timescales for which such information exists. A limited subset of the variables associated with processing of old fingermarks was explored, with a focus on the use of 1,8 diazafluoren-9-one (DFO), 1,2-indandione, ninhydrin, and physical developer. These techniques were used in sequence on batches of cheques between 11 and 32 years old, and on documents dating from the 1920s and 1940s. The potential for applying a physical developer enhancement process (blue toning) as the final step in the sequence was also explored. The benefits of using processing sequences on porous items were clearly demonstrated, with all processes in the sequence adding value in terms of additional marks found on the cheques up to 32 years old. In addition, physical developer was found to be capable of developing fingermarks up to 90 years old, whereas the amino acid reagents appear less effective on documents of 70 years and older. An experimental physical developer formulation with reduced environmental impact was found to be as effective as the existing process in these experiments. Blue toning was found to visualise an additional 10-25% of marks, and its wider use after silver-based deposition processes is recommended based on the evidence from this study.",Environmental effects on magnetic fluorescent powder development of fingermarks on bird of prey feathers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798858,Science & justice : journal of the Forensic Science Society,2019 02 25,"A comparison study of the effects of environmental conditions on the development of latent fingermarks on raptor feathers using green magnetic fluorescent powder was undertaken using both sebaceous loaded and natural fingermark deposits. Sparrowhawk feathers were stored in indoor conditions for 60 days (Study 1), and buzzard feathers were left exposed to two different environmental conditions (hidden and visible) for 21 days (Study 2), with developments made at regular ageing periods. In Study 1, latent fingermarks were successfully developed (Grade 1-4) on the indoor feathers up to 60 days after deposition - 98.6% of the loaded deposits and 85.3% for natural deposits. Under outdoor conditions in Study 2, both loaded and natural deposits were affected by environmental exposure. Latent fingermarks were successfully developed up to 14 days after deposition on the outdoor feathers, with some occasional recovery after 21 days. The visible feathers recorded 34.7% (loaded) and 16.4% (natural) successful developments (Grade 1-4), whereas the hidden feathers recorded 46.7% (loaded) and 22.2% (natural) successful developments, suggesting that protection from the environment helps to preserve latent fingermarks on the surface of a feather.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) serves as a major enzyme for cellular superoxide radical metabolism and physiologically regulates cellular redox balance throughout the body. Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase-deficient (SOD1-/-) mice showed diverse phenotypes associated with enhanced oxidative damage in whole organs. Here, we found that oral treatment with syringaresinol (also known as lirioresinol B), which is the active component in the berries of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer), attenuated the age-related changes in Sod1-/- skin. Interestingly, syringaresinol morphologically normalized skin atrophy in Sod1-/- mice and promoted fibroblast outgrowth from Sod1-/- skin in vitro. These protective effects were mediated by the suppression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 overproduction in Sod1-/- skin, but not by increased collagen expression. Syringaresinol also decreased the oxidative damage and the phosphorylation of FoxO3a protein, which was a transcriptional factor of matrix metalloproteinase-2, in Sod1-/- skin. These results strongly suggest that syringaresinol regulates the FoxO3-matrix metalloproteinase-2 axis in oxidative damaged skin and exhibits beneficial effects on age-related skin involution in Sod1-/- mice.",Overview of evidence on risk factors and early management of acute carotid stent thrombosis during the last two decades.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798846,Journal of vascular surgery,2019 02 25,"Acute carotid stent thrombosis (ACST) occurring in the first hours after the procedure is an exceedingly rare complication of carotid artery stenting, but it is potentially devastating.

It is also noted that abnormal iron accumulation is one of the key factors to facilitate promotion and progression of cancer including hepatoma. In this study, we firstly revealed that a new alternative HAMP transcript was found in hepatoma-derived cell line HLF, which was identical to the wild-type preprohepcidin sequence except lacking of an internal 60 bases. In addition to HLF, most of hepatoma-derived cell lines have significant copy numbers of variant-type hepcidin mRNA by a copy-based-digital PCR. Furthermore, the copy number of hepcidin mRNA variant was significantly higher in serum exosomes of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The quantification of exosomal hepcidin mRNA variant may serve as a potential new biomarker for HCC diagnosis.",Regulators of hepcidin expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798807,Vitamins and hormones,2019 06 05,"Iron, an essential nutrient, is required for many biological processes but is also toxic in excess. The lack of a mechanism to excrete excess iron makes it crucial for the body to regulate the amount of iron absorbed from the diet. This regulation is mediated by the hepatic hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin also controls iron release from macrophages that recycle iron and from hepatocytes that store iron. Hepcidin binds to the only known iron export protein, ferroportin, inducing its internalization and degradation and thus limiting the amount of iron released into the plasma. Important regulators of hepcidin, and therefore of systemic iron homeostasis, include plasma iron concentrations, body iron stores, infection and inflammation, hypoxia and erythropoiesis, and, to a lesser extent, testosterone. Dysregulation of hepcidin production contributes to the pathogenesis of many iron disorders: hepcidin deficiency causes iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis and non-transfused β-thalassemia, whereas overproduction of hepcidin is associated with iron-restricted anemias seen in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and inherited iron-refractory iron-deficiency anemia. The present review summarizes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways contributing to hepcidin regulation by these factors and highlights the issues that still need clarification.",Hepcidin cDNA evolution in vertebrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798806,Vitamins and hormones,2019 06 05,"Hepcidin, belonging to the β-defensin family, was isolated for the first time from plasma and human urine.

Indeed, fungi are well known producers of oxalic acid, while bacteria are considered oxalic acid consumers. However, this framework may need to be modified, because the ability of fungi to degrade oxalic acid and the ability of bacteria to produce it, have been poorly investigated.

Siderophores present complex chemistry that allows them to form the strongest iron-chelating complexes. Interest in this field is always up to date and new siderophores are found with new roles and applications. For example, siderophores participate to the mobilization of iron and other elements and are involved in virulence processes. Recently, a strong relation between siderophores and oxidative stress tolerance has been also highlighted. Their application in medicine has been widely studied as well as in agriculture. However, new fields are paying attention to the use of siderophores as green-iron chelators.

Excess reactive nitrogen not only has a negative impact on human health, it also contributes to air and water pollution, and can cause complex ecosystems to collapse. In order to avoid the deleterious effects of excess reactive nitrogen in the environment, tertiary wastewater treatment practices that ensure the removal of reactive nitrogen species need to be implemented. Many wastewater treatment facilities rely on chemicals for tertiary treatment, however, biological nitrogen removal practices are much more environmentally friendly and cost effective. Therefore, interest in biological treatment is increasing. Biological approaches take advantage of specific groups of microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling to remove reactive nitrogen from reactor systems by converting ammonia to nitrogen gas. Organisms known to be involved in this process include autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, heterotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing archaea, anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (anammox), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, complete ammonia oxidizers, and dissimilatory nitrate reducing microorganisms. For example, in nitrifying-denitrifying reactors, ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria convert ammonia to nitrate and then denitrifying microorganisms reduce nitrate to nonreactive dinitrogen gas. Other nitrogen removal systems (anammox reactors) take advantage of anammox bacteria to convert ammonia to nitrogen gas using NO as an oxidant. A number of promising new biological treatment technologies are emerging and it is hoped that as the cost of these practices goes down more wastewater treatment plants will start to include a tertiary treatment step.",Role and regulation of the stress activated sigma factor sigma B (σB) in the saprophytic and host-associated life stages of Listeria monocytogenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798801,Advances in applied microbiology,2019 02 25,"The stress activated sigma factor sigma B (σB) plays a pivotal role in allowing the food-borne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes to modulate its transcriptional landscape in order to survive in a variety of harsh environments both outside and within the host.

T-cell receptor-engineered T-cell therapy, on the other hand, has shown unprecedented promise in treating solid tumors and has attracted growing interest. In order to create an unbiased, comprehensive, and scientific report for this fast-moving field, we carefully analyzed all 84 clinical trials using T-cell receptor-engineered T-cell therapy and downloaded from ClinicalTrials.gov updated by June 11, 2018.

The framework is based on one for financial outcomes of severe illness attributed to Scott Ramsey and adapted by the National Cancer Institute to describe relationships between preexisting factors, a cancer diagnosis, financial distress, and health outcomes for adult cancer patients and survivors. The adaption for pediatric oncology was informed by the results of a systematic scoping review to identify advances and gaps in the recent literature about the personal costs of illness to parents in the pediatric oncology context. The conceptual model for pediatric oncology indicates that existing and dynamic parent and family factors, other risk and protective factors, the child's diagnosis and treatment, and treatment-related financial costs can affect parent financial coping behaviors and parent health and family financial outcomes, all of which may affect child outcomes. Additionally, nursing's historic emphasis on holistic care, quality of life, and health determinants justify attention to financial toxicity as a nursing role. Therefore, pediatric oncology nurses must be sensitive to financial toxicity and related risk factors, become comfortable communicating about treatment-related financial costs and financial distress with parents and other health professionals, and collaborate in efforts that draw on the expertise of multiple stakeholders to identify potential or actual financial toxicity in parents and mitigate its impact on childhood cancer health outcomes through direct care, referral, research, quality improvement, and health advocacy.","In Defense of Class Wars in Population Health: The New Landscape of Social Class With Bourdieu, Neo-Marxists, and the Kohn/Schooler/Wright Integrative Models.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798685,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2019 02 25,"The field of social inequalities in health has been dominated by an individual attributes approach with a small number of indicators, namely occupation, income, and education.

Furthermore, the use of HiPSCs cultured in three-dimensional (3D) systems, as opposed to traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture approaches, better represents the complex tissue architecture in vivo. The use of HiPSCs in 3D spheroid and organoid culture is now growing, but particularly when using myocardial, intestinal enteric nervous system, and retinal cell lines. However, organoid cell culture is perhaps making the most notable impact in research and drug discovery, in which 3D neuronal cell cultures allow direct modeling of cortical cell layering and neuronal circuit activity. Given the specific degeneration seen in discrete neuronal circuitry in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), HiPSC culture systems are proving to be a major advance.

For the 76 patients (median age 67.2; Q1, Q3 = 60.9, 72.6) seen by geriatricians at the clinic, there were 184 recommendations, 54 instances of counseling, and 11 direct actions. Overall adherence to recommendations was 32.8%, 34.9% for patient-directed, and 31.7% for provider-directed recommendations. No demographic or CGA variables were associated with adherence. Despite this lack of adherence, surveyed providers reported that they usually or always followed recommendations; the most frequently cited barrier to implementation was lack of feasibility. Further research will be needed to determine how CGA can improve outcomes for this population.","Dynamics of Treatment Supporters and Patients Starting HIV Therapy in Lima, Peru.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798674,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care,2019 02 25,"As per the National HIV Program in Peru, the designation of a patient-elected treatment supporter is a requisite for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). These individuals are expected to aid the patient in medical and social support.

Twenty individual interviews with treatment supporters were analyzed alongside 5 group interviews: 2 groups of treatment supporters, 2 groups of PLWHA, and 1 group of community health workers. Findings characterized formal means of treatment support and informal emotional and instrumental support. Gradual transfer of treatment responsibilities from supporters to PLWHA was found to foster a sense of self-efficacy among PLWHA, and when paired with open communication and committed emotional support, created an ideal reciprocal relationship. However, lack of HIV-related knowledge among treatment supporters was detrimental. More training and systemic support for treatment supporters may optimize their role as informed participants in the care of PLWHA."

All Lewy body nOH patients had colocalization indices >1.5 in skin biopsies and 18F-dopamine-derived radioactivity <6000 nCi-kg/cc-mCi, a combination not seen in non-Lewy body nOH patients ( P<0.0001). In Lewy body nOH, AS deposition in sympathetic noradrenergic nerves is related to postmortem neurochemical and in vivo neuroimaging evidence of myocardial noradrenergic deficiency. These associations raise the possibility that intraneuronal AS deposition plays a pathophysiological role in the myocardial sympathetic neurodegeneration attending Lewy body nOH.",Angiogenic Factor Estimation as a Warning Sign of Preeclampsia-Related Peripartum Morbidity Among Hospitalized Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798660,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 03 13,"Preeclampsia-related morbidity and mortality is rising predominantly because of delayed identification of patients at risk for preeclampsia with severe features and associated complications. This study explored the association between angiogenic markers (sFlt1 [soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1]) and PlGF [placental growth factor]) and preeclampsia-related peripartum complications. Normotensive women or those with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were enrolled. Blood samples were collected within 96 hours before delivery, and angiogenic markers were measured on an automated platform. Our study included 681 women, 375 of which had hypertensive disorders. Of these, 127 (33.9%) had severe preeclampsia, and 71.4% were black. Compared with normotensive women, women with severe preeclampsia had higher levels of sFlt1 (9372.5 versus 2857.0 pg/mL; P<0.0001), lower PlGF (51.0 versus 212.0 pg/mL; P<0.0001), and a high sFlt1/PlGF (212.0 versus 14.0; all P<0.0001). A similar trend in sFlt1, PlGF, and sFlt1/PlGF was found in those women with complications secondary to preeclampsia (all P<0.001). The highest tertile of sFlt1/PlGF was strongly associated with severe preeclampsia in a multivariable analysis. Among patients with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, 340 (90.7%) developed postpartum hypertension, of which 50.4% had mild, and 40.3% had severe postpartum hypertension. The sFlt1/PlGF ratio was significantly higher for severe and mild postpartum hypertension compared with women with normal postpartum blood pressures (73.5, 46.0, and 13.0, respectively; P values<0.0001). Furthermore, the highest tertile of antepartum sFlt1/PlGF was associated with postpartum hypertension ( P=0.004).

We estimated the burden of hypertension in Australia in terms of productivity lost over the working lifetime of the Australian population. Life table models were used to estimate excess mortality, years of life lost, and productivity-adjusted life years lost among Australians with hypertension and of working age (20 to 69 years), with simulated follow-up until age 70 years. In 2017, an estimated 4.1 million working-age Australians (25.9%) had hypertension, of whom an estimated 21.6% were treated and controlled, 17.0% were treated but uncontrolled, and 61.4% were untreated. With simulated follow-up, over 149 846 excess deaths leading to a loss of over 548 794 years of life were predicted to occur in the hypertension cohort. Hypertension also caused the loss of 609 801 productivity-adjusted life years (2.4%), equating to AUD$137.2 billion in lost gross domestic product over the working lifetime. A 25% reduction in hypertension prevalence, in line with the World Health Organisation Global Action Plan targets, would lead to 155 450 productivity-adjusted life years saved over the working lifetime, whereas the adequate treatment and control of all of those with hypertension would lead to 342 538 productivity-adjusted life years saved. This equates to AUD$34.3 billion and $76.4 billion in gross domestic product retained over the working lifetime of the cohort, respectively.

However, priority statements from national and international bodies make it unclear whether the objective should be the reduction in HIV incidence or the maximization of health, most commonly measured with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Building off a model-based evaluation of HIV care interventions in British Columbia, Canada, we compare the optimal sets of interventions that would be identified using HIV infections averted, and QALYs as the primary outcome in a cost-effectiveness analysis. We found an explicit focus on averting new infections undervalues the health benefits derived from antiretroviral therapy, resulting in suboptimal and potentially harmful funding recommendations.",Late HIV Diagnosis but Earlier Antiretroviral Treatment Initiation in Northwest Spain: Impact of Current Treatment Guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798655,Journal of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care,2019 02 25,Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation for all HIV-infected individuals regardless of CD4 count.

However, it is unclear if the longitudinal change in BA diameter (Δ BA ) is associated with CVE s. Methods and Results In a cohort of Japanese participants with vascular risk factors in an observational study, we evaluated the relationship of Δ BA to CVE s and the time course of the BA diameter. The short axis of the BA diameter was measured at the midpons level in T2-weighted images. Brain magnetic resonance imaging measurements included cerebral small-vessel disease, lacunars, and white matter hyperintensities. First, 493 patients were analyzed by the time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the association between Δ BA and CVE s, with adjustment for age, sex, vascular risk factors, and magnetic resonance imaging parameters. Second, we assessed the longitudinal Δ BA in 164 patients who underwent long-term follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, by linear regression analysis. In the mean follow-up of 8.7 years, 105 patients developed CVE s. A smaller Δ BA was independently associated with the high incidence of CVE s (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.16-0.78; P=0.010; n=493). After a mean interval of 9.4 years, the average Δ BA was 0.41±0.46 mm (excluding patients with fetal-type circle of Willis). Progression of BA dilatation was associated with men but inversely associated with initial BA diameter and fetal-type circle of Willis (n=164). Conclusions BA diameter increased over time (excluding the patients with fetal-type circle of Willis), whereas Δ BA was inversely associated with the incidence of CVE s.",Impaired Right Ventricular Mechanics at Rest and During Exercise Are Associated With Exercise Capacity in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798647,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 04 26,"Background Impaired right ventricular ( RV ) function indicates RV involvement in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ). We aimed to assess RV function at rest and during exercise in HCM patients and to examine the association between impaired RV mechanics and exercise capacity. Methods and Results A total of 76 HCM patients (48 without and 28 with RV hypertrophy) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls were prospectively recruited. RV function was evaluated at rest and during semisupine bicycle exercise by conventional echocardiography and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging. Exercise capacity was measured by metabolic equivalents. RV functional reserve was calculated as the difference of functional parameters between peak exercise and rest. Compared with controls, HCM patients had significantly higher RV free wall thickness, lower RV global longitudinal strain and RV free wall longitudinal strain at rest and during exercise, and reduced RV systolic functional reserve. Compared with those with HCM without RV hypertrophy, patients with HCM with RV hypertrophy had lower metabolic equivalents. Among HCM patients, an effective correlation was seen between exercise capacity and peak exercise RV global longitudinal strain and peak exercise RV free wall longitudinal strain. A binary logistic regression model revealed several independent predictors of exercise intolerance in HCM patients, but receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated exercise RV global longitudinal strain had the highest area under the curve for the prediction of exercise intolerance in HCM patients. Conclusions HCM patients have RV dysfunction and reduced contractile reserve. Exercise RV global longitudinal strain correlates with exercise capacity and can independently predict exercise intolerance. In addition, patients with HCM with RV hypertrophy exhibit more reduced exercise capacity, suggesting more severe disease and poorer prognosis.",Common feline problem behaviours: Owner-directed aggression,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798644,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2019 02 27,"Aggression towards owners is a common behavioural problem in cats, particularly in cats that have been obtained from pet shops or other sources where there has been inadequate socialisation with people, and in those kept only indoors.

All three entities are separate, however, there are similarities in histopathological characteristics and possibly in aspects of the development pathway. Areas covered: We review current evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans diagnosis and management in children. The diagnosis of BO is usually based on a combination of history, clinical and radiological findings, although lung biopsy and histopathology remain the gold standard approaches to confirm BO. Expert opinion: At present, we do not have a clear understanding of the mechanisms of the development of BO and lack strong evidence for treatment.

Treatment options for allergic conjunctivitis include local and systemic antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, dual-action agents, vasoconstrictors and corticosteroids. Treatment seems easy, but inappropriate therapy - in extreme cases - can lead to vision loss. Corticosteroid eyedrops provide effective relief of symptoms, however, their use is limited due to their severe side effects. Both steroid-induced cataract and steroid-induced glaucoma are dangerous for vision.

The development of potent GVIA iPLA2 inhibitors is of great importance because only a few have been reported so far. We present a novel class of GVIA iPLA2 inhibitors based on the β-lactone ring. This functionality in combination with a four-carbon chain carrying a phenyl group at position-3 and a linear propyl group at position-4 of the lactone ring confers excellent potency. trans-3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-4-propyloxetan-2-one (GK563) was identified as being the most potent GVIA iPLA2 inhibitor ever reported ( XI(50) 0.0000021, IC50 1 nM) and also one that is 22 000 times more active against GVIA iPLA2 than GIVA cPLA2.

In the current study, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model was used to investigate the effects of Antarctic krill peptides (AKP) on cartilage protection. As observed, AKP clearly ameliorate cartilage degeneration as evidenced by increased cartilage thickness and cartilage area and decreased histological Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores. Toluidine blue staining showed that AKO remarkably inhibited the loss of cartilage matrix in mice with OA. Hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α) has a key role in catabolic regulation and inflammation cascades which are the main causes of OA. AKP can down-regulate the expression of HIF-2α and its downstream genes such as MMP-13, Adamts-5, IL-1β, iNOS, CXCL-1, and NOS2. Consistent with this, anabolic genes such as Acan and Col2α1 were restored after treatment with AKP. Chondrocyte apoptosis and the reduction in cartilage cell viability are also involved in the process of OA. The HIF-2α-mediated death receptor apoptosis signaling pathway has been involved in the regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis. AKP can reduce the expressions of key pro-apoptosis genes in Fas-FasL and DR3-DR3L signaling pathways such as Fas, FasL, FADD, caspase8, caspase3, DR3, DR3L, RIP, and NF-κB. In addition, expressions of antiapoptosis genes such as c-AIP and c-FLIP were increased significantly.

These properties are important for many studies, ranging from a fundamental neurophysiological study of functional MRI signals to a chronic neuromodulatory effect investigation of therapeutic deep brain stimulation. Here we develop soft and MRI compatible neural electrodes using carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers with a diameter from 20 μm down to 5 μm. The CNT fiber electrodes demonstrate excellent interfacial electrochemical properties and greatly reduced MRI artifacts than PtIr electrodes under a 7.0 T MRI scanner. With a shuttle-assisted implantation strategy, we show that the soft CNT fiber electrodes can precisely target specific brain regions and record high-quality single-unit neural signals. Significantly, they are capable of continuously detecting and isolating single neuronal units from rats for up to 4-5 months without electrode repositioning, with greatly reduced brain inflammatory responses as compared to their stiff metal counterparts. In addition, we show that due to their high tensile strength, the CNT fiber electrodes can be retracted controllably postinsertion, which provides an effective and convenient way to do multidepth recording or potentially selecting cells with particular response properties.

In this article, we theoretically study the case of an ionizable silica NP approaching the PM. We witness that the surface charge of the silica NP, dictated by the surface ionization of the silica in the electrostatic environment created by the PM surface charge and the extracellular ion concentration, decreases as it approaches the PM. In other words, a silica NP is more negative away from the PM than in close proximity to the PM. Accordingly, we witness a significantly lower repulsion between the PM and NP favoring the approach and the interactions of the silica NP with the PM. Additionally, the presence of the silica NP in the vicinity of the PM induces a large nonisopotentiality, even across a fully permeable PM. We anticipate that these findings will be critically important in the better design of the widely used silica NPs for targeted drug and gene deliveries.","Potential Applications of Halide Double Perovskite Cs2AgInX6 (X = Cl, Br) in Flexible Optoelectronics: Unusual Effects of Uniaxial Strains.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798602,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 03 13,"The discovery of halide double perovskite Cs2AgInX6 (X = Cl, Br) has provided an efficient way to search promising solar cell absorbers. Here, theoretical calculations on strained Cs2AgInX6 (X = Cl, Br) not only comprehensively and firstly help understand their physical properties but also provide a guideline to extend their potential applications. Although Cs2AgInX6 possesses a similar structure, the variations of physical properties of strained Cs2AgInX6 are different. Only compressive Cs2AgInBr6 undergoes a direct-to-indirect transition, which enables it to be a good radiation detection material. Moreover, the mobility of Cs2AgInCl6 is reduced by strains, while that of Cs2AgInBr6 is enhanced (reduced) by compression (tension). That is because the contribution degrees of Ag-d z2, d x2- y2 and In-d z2, d x2- y2 on the band edges of Cs2AgInX6 (X = Cl, Br) are inconsistent. In addition, the absorption coefficients of Cs2AgInX6 (X = Cl, Br) are deteriorated negligibly by strain, making it a potential material for further applications of photovoltaics and flexible optoelectronics.","Catalytic Regioselective Cage B(8)-H Arylation of o-Carboranes via ""Cage-Walking"" Strategy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798601,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 13,"A proof-of-concept example of catalytic regioselective cage B(8)-H functionalization of o-carboranes has been disclosed for the first time.

The chemical reaction triggers disassembly of the aggregates with simultaneous release of the product that can be spontaneously separated out of the solution by precipitation. Neutralization of the amphiphilic molecule leads to a new cycle of self-assembly entrapping substrates and disassembly with releasing the product.",Intestinal Barrier Function-Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Interactions and Possible Role of Gut Microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798598,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 03 22,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic stress liver injury that is closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome. The pathological features are diffuse hepatic vesicular steatosis, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, and even liver cancer. A variety of pathological outcomes cause serious harm to human health. At present, an increasing number of researchers are investigating the pathogenesis of NAFLD from the perspective of changes in the function of the intestinal barrier. The physical, chemical, immunological, and microbiological barriers in the intestinal tract constitute the complete intestinal barrier, which plays an important defensive role against the invasion of harmful substances from the intestines. Protecting the function of the intestinal barrier is a new way to treat NAFLD and its related diseases. In this perspective, we summarized the current knowledge of the role of the intestinal barrier in NAFLD."

The effect of external force on soft tissue is affected by many factors, such as local microenvironment, tissue blood supply, nutritional status, and underlying diseases of patients. Although great efforts have been made by mankind to prevent and treat pressure ulcer in last decades, its prevalence is still high, and the curative effect is still not impressive. The treatment of pressure ulcer is a challenge today, and it is necessary to seek new treatment methods. However, the prerequisite for exploring new treatment methods is to find a proper animal model and further explore new therapies through animal experiments. The pathogenesis of pressure ulcer is complex, and the formation process is affected by a variety of factors. To date, there is no recognized standard animal model. We review the pathogenesis of pressure ulcer and the recently reported animal models of pressure ulcer, so as to provide basic experimental basis for further research on the occurrence, development, and prevention of pressure ulcer.",[Influence of cluster nursing intervention on inadequate drainage in vacuum sealing drainage for inpatients in burn unit].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798582,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 05 28,"Objective: To explore the influence of cluster nursing intervention on inadequate drainage in vacuum sealing drainage (VSD) for inpatients in burn unit. Methods: From October to December 2016, 60 patients, aged (43.6±2.8) years admitted to our department, receiving VSD treatment and conforming to the inclusion criteria, were included in the routine nursing group, and among the patients, 37 cases were male and 23 cases were female. From May to July 2017, 58 patients, aged (44.2±3.2) years admitted to our department, receiving VSD treatment and conforming to the inclusion criteria, were included in the cluster nursing group, and among the patients, 36 cases were male and 22 cases were female. The patients' medical records were retrospectively analyzed. After VSD treatment, patients in routine nursing group received routine nursing, and patients in cluster nursing group received cluster nursing. A cluster intervention group was formed and headed by a chief surgeon. The cluster nursing plan was formulated and implemented strictly from the following six aspects of material preparation, negative pressure value control and negative pressure mode setting, drainage tube nursing, semi-permeable membrane reinforcement, standardizing changing process and timing of drainage capsule, and health education. During VSD treatment, the incidence of inadequate drainage, reasons of inadequate drainage and the occurrences, occurrences of inadequate drainage of wounds in different types and sites, and satisfaction of patients in two groups were observed and calculated. The patient satisfaction items included procedure of drainage capsule replacement, the method of tube fixation, the content and form of health education. Data were processed with independent sample t test and chi-square test. Results: (1) During VSD treatment, the incidence of inadequate drainage of patients in routine nursing group was 43.33% (130/300), which was significantly higher than 17.24% (50/290) in cluster nursing group (χ(2)=43.350, P<0.01).

Methods: (1) Fbs were isolated from the trunk of 2 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats embryos of 14-16 days' pregnancy and cultured, and the morphology of the cells was observed. The third passage of cells were used for subsequent experiments. The protein expressions of fibronectin and Ephrin-B2 were observed by immunohistochemical method. The mRNA expression of Ephrin-B2 was detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (n=3). (2) Schwann cells were isolated from the bilateral sciatic nerves and brachial plexus nerves of 45 SD rats born for 1-3 days and cultured, and the morphology of the cells was observed. The third passage of cells were used for subsequent experiments. The rate of S100 positive cells was detected by immunofluorescence method and flow cytometer, with sample numbers of 9 and 3 respectively. (3) In Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose medium, 1 mL Fbs and 1 mL Schwann cells both in the concentration of 1×10(5) cells/mL were co-cultured as Schwann cells+ Fbs co-culture group, and 2 mL Schwann cells in the concentration of 1×10(5) cells/mL were cultured alone as Schwann cells alone culture group, with 5 wells in each group. The clusters of Schwann cells in the two groups were observed and counted under inverted phase contrast microscope at post culture hour (PCH) 6 and 24 respectively. The clusters of Schwann cells in Schwann cells+ Fbs co-culture group were observed by immunofluorescence method at PCH 24 too. The protein expressions of EphB2, Sox2, and N-cadherin in Schwann cells of two groups at PCH 24 were detected by Western blotting (n=20). (4) Totally 100 8-week-old male SD rats were selected, and an in situ replanted peritoneal denervated perforator flap was made in each rat. According to the random number table, the rats were divided into simple flap group, Fbs alone transplantation group, Schwann cells alone transplantation group, Schwann cells+ Fbs co-transplantation group, with 25 rats in each group. Flaps of rats in Fbs alone transplantation group and Schwann cells alone transplantation group were injected with 0.4 mL Fb and 0.4 mL Schwann cells respectively (2×10(6) cells each). Flaps of rats in Schwann cells+ Fbs co-transplantation group were injected with 0.4 mL Fbs and Schwann cells mixed cells (totally 2×10(6) cells, cell number ratio: 1∶1), and flaps of rats of simple flap group were injected with the same volume of DMEM high glucose medium. On post injection day (PID) 2, 5, 7, 9, and 14, 5 rats in each group were selected respectively according to the random number table. The flap tissue was collected, and the number, diameter, and arrangement of regenerated nerves were observed by immunofluorescence method. Data were processed with completely random designed t test, analysis of variance for repeated measurement, t test, and Bonferroni correction. Results: (1) The third passage of cells isolated and cultured from the rat embryo trunks were uniform in size and shape, long spindle-shaped, with a large proportion of nuclei. Strong positive expressions of fibronectin and Ephrin-B2 protein in cells were observed, and the mRNA expression of Ephrin-B2 was 0.004 1±0.000 8. The cells were identified as Fbs. (2) After 5 days of culture, the primary cells isolated from the sciatic nerves and brachial plexus nerves of neonatal rats were elongated in cell bodies and grew in nest, fence, or vortex-like shape. The third passage of cells were detected by immunofluorescence method and flow cytometer, and the corresponding S100 positive cell rates were (95.9±1.0)% and (95.8±1.1)% respectively. The cells were identified as Schwann cells. (3) At PCH 6 and 24, the cluster numbers of Schwann cells in Schwann cells+ Fbs co-culture group were significantly higher than those of Schwann cells alone culture group (t=6.500, 10.614, P<0.01). At PCH 24, the Schwann cells in Schwann cells+ Fbs co-culture group aggregated into clusters, Fbs dispersed around the Schwann cell clusters, and the protein expressions of EphB2, N-cadherin, and Sox2 in Schwann cells were significantly higher than those in Schwann cells alone culture group (t=2.975, 19.717, 11.159, P<0.05 or P<0.01). (4) On PID 2, a small number of scattered, disordered, short, and thin nerve fibers were observed in the flap tissue of rats in the four groups. From PID 5 to 14, the number of nerve fibers in the flap tissue of rats of Schwann cells+ Fbs co-transplantation group increased gradually, and the nerve fibers were with long diameter and arranged orderly. The number of nerve fibers in the flap tissue of rats of Schwann cells alone transplantation group increased, but the nerve fibers were with short diameter and arranged disorderly, and the number was smaller than that of Schwann cells+ Fbs co-transplantation group. In simple flap group and Fbs alone transplantation group, the nerve fibers in the flap tissue of rats gradually degenerated with gradually decreased number or even disappeared. Conclusions: The combined transplantation of Fbs and Schwann cells in rats can regulate Schwann cells migration and clustering by activating Ephrin/Eph-Sox2-N-cadherin signaling pathway, thus promoting the orderly nerve regeneration of denervated perforator flaps in rats.",[Effects of three inducing factors on differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells into lymphatic endothelial cells].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798579,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 05 28,"Objective: To observe the effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) on the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs).

(5) On 10 d of culture at interval time of 6, 12, 24 h, there were no protein expressions of LYVE-1, VEGFR3, or integrin α9 in cells of blank control group. On 10 d of culture at interval time of 6, 12, 24 h, the protein expressions of LYVE-1, VEGFR3, and integrin α9 in cells of HGF+ VEGF-C+ bFGF group, bFGF+ VEGF-C+ HGF group, and VEGF-C+ HGF+ bFGF group were close (F(6 h)=2.25, 2.47, 2.19, F(12 h)=2.93, 1.47, 3.25, F(24 h)=0.28, 0.20, 1.01, P>0.05). Conclusions: VEGF-C is a necessary factor for inducing BMSCs to differentiate into LECs. HGF and bFGF may promote the differentiation by up-regulating the expressions of integrin α9 and VEGFR3 respectively. But the induction effects of the two factors may be independent. The combination of VEGF-C, HGF, and bFGF have the best effects of promoting differentiation.",[Role of hexokinase Ⅱ in the changes of autophagic flow in cardiomyocytes of mice with ischemia-hypoxia in vitro].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798578,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 05 28,"Objective: To investigate the role of hexokinase Ⅱ in the changes of autophagic flow in cardiomyocytes of mice with ischemia-hypoxia in vitro.

(2) Compared with those of corresponding normal control 3, 6, and 9 h groups, the LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰ ratio and protein expressions of p62 and hexokinase Ⅱ in cardiomyocytes of ischemia-hypoxia 3, 6, and 9 h groups were significantly increased (t(3 h)=16.15, 10.99, 5.30, t(6 h)=6.79, 10.42, 9.42, t(9 h)=15.76, 16.51, 7.20, P<0.05 or P<0.01).

The viability of cardiomyocytes in ischemia-hypoxia 9 h+ 2-DG group was 0.472±0.025, which was significantly higher than that of simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group (t=3.60, P<0.05). (4) Compared with those of normal control group, the LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰ ratio and protein expression of p62 in cardiomyocytes of simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group were significantly increased (t=9.45, 8.40, P<0.01). Compared with those of simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group, the LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰratio and protein expression of p62 in cardiomyocytes of ischemia-hypoxia 9 h+ 2-DG group were significantly decreased (t=4.39, 4.74, P<0.05). (5) In cardiomyocytes of normal control group, only single autophagosome/autolysosome with bilayer membrane structure was observed. Compared with that of normal control group, the number of autophagosome/autolysosome with bilayer membrane structure in cardiomyocytes of simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group was increased significantly. Compared with that of simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group, the number of autophagosome/autolysosome with bilayer membrane structure in cardiomyocytes of ischemia-hypoxia 9 h+ 2-DG group was significantly decreased. (6) The viability of cardiomyocytes in simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group was 0.358±0.023, which was significantly lower than 0.673±0.026 in normal control group (t=9.12, P<0.01). The viabilities of cardiomyocytes in ischemia-hypoxia 9 h+ HK-ⅡsiRNA1 group and ischemia-hypoxia 9 h+ HK-ⅡsiRNA2 group were 0.487±0.027 and 0.493±0.022, respectively, which were significantly higher than the viability in simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group (t=3.63, 4.28, P<0.05). (7) Compared with those of normal control group, the LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰratio and protein expressions of p62 and hexokinase Ⅱ in cardiomyocytes of simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group were significantly increased (t=6.08, 6.31, 4.83, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Compared with those of simple ischemia-hypoxia 9 h group, the LC3Ⅱ/Ⅰ ratio and protein expressions of p62 and hexokinase Ⅱ in cardiomyocytes of ischemia-hypoxia 9 h+ HK-ⅡsiRNA1 group and ischemia-hypoxia 9 h+ HK-ⅡsiRNA2 group were significantly decreased (t=5.10, 7.76, 15.33, 4.17, 8.42, 12.11, P<0.05 or P<0.01). Conclusions: Ischemia-hypoxia upregulates the expression level of hexokinase Ⅱ protein in mouse cardiomyocytes cultured in vitro, which decreases the viability of cardiomyocytes by impairing autophagic flow. To inhibit the activity of hexokinase Ⅱ or its expression can alleviate the ischemia-hypoxia damage of cardiomyocytes."

The etiology of autism currently remains poorly understood; however, emerging clinical and experimental evidence suggests central roles for maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy in ASD. In particular, children whose mothers suffered from an infectious disease or other inflammatory conditions during pregnancy are at a substantially higher risk of developing ASD. It has been shown that MIA-induced ASD can be modeled by treating pregnant mice with the viral mimetic polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) during key neurodevelopmental time points. In this paradigm, PolyI:C treatment induces systemic inflammatory responses that model MIA during viral infections. Offspring from PolyI:C-treated mothers develop many of the defining features of ASD including defects in social interactions, communicative impairments, and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors, as well as neuropathologies that are commonly observed in human ASD. While the early use of this emerging ASD model system has provided important initial insights into the involvement of gestational immune dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorder pathogenesis, we have only just begun to scratch the surface in our understanding of how MIA affects brain maturation and contributes to neurodevelopmental disease.

Upon activation, naïve CD4+ T cells are capable of differentiating into a number of effector subsets that perform distinct immune functions. These subsets include T helper 1 (TH1), TH2, TH9, TH17, TH22, T follicular helper (TFH), and regulatory T cell (TREG) populations. The differentiation of these subsets is dependent, in large part, on the coordinated interplay between signals from the extracellular cytokine environment and downstream transcriptional networks. The use of in vitro T helper cell culture systems has been extensively employed to aid in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern the differentiation of each effector subset. Here, we provide a detailed summary of the differentiation conditions that are utilized to generate effector CD4+ T cell populations in vitro.",Quantification and Visualization of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) from Murine Bone Marrow-Derived Neutrophils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798521,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 04 09,"Neutrophils are some of the first leukocytes to respond to inflammatory stimuli.

Since precise genomic manipulation required the time-consuming prerequisite of first generating genetically modified embryonic stem cells, the rapid nature of generating random integration transgenes remained a strong benefit outweighing various disadvantages. The advent of targetable nucleases, such as CRISPR/Cas9, has eliminated the prerequisite of first generating genetically modified embryonic stem cells for some types of targeted genomic mutations.

Inbred mouse lines have allowed researchers to control for many of the variables that define human diversity but complicate the study of the human genome, gene/protein function, cellular and molecular pathways, and countless other genetic diseases. Furthermore, genetically modified mouse models enable us to generate and study mice whose genomes differ by as little as a single point mutation while controlling for non-genomic variables. This allows researchers to elucidate the quintessential function of a gene, which will further not only our scientific understanding, but provide key insight into human health and disease.

However, the Markovian model is so stiff that speeding up the computation of the algorithms with variable time-steps always results in simulation instability. In particular, the unstable simulations always occur at a low voltage rate or current change, while transition rates in the Markovian model are changing markedly. The uniformization (UNI) method allows for a Markovian model simulation with high stability but also a high computation cost. To save computation costs with variable time-steps, we propose a speed increasing idea that is a compromise to the trade-off between stability and acceleration by combining Chen-Chen-Luo's ""quadratic adaptive algorithm"" (CCL) method with ""hybrid operator splitting"" (HOS) into the solver (CCL + HOS solver). The computation cost of this CCL + HOS solver is approximately 24 times lower than the CCL + UNI solver, and the CCL + HOS solver can function 295 times faster in comparison to the HOS solver with a fixed time-step (DT). The suggested optimal solver should be CCL + HOS solver with a maximum time-step at 0.1 ms due to its high speed with low error. Additionally, the CCL method has much better performance and stability than the hybrid method in this single-cell model simulation.",Amniotic membrane as novel scaffold for human iPSC-derived cardiomyogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798515,In vitro cellular & developmental biology. Animal,2019 04 06,"Recent approaches of using decellularized organ matrices for cardiac tissue engineering prompted us to culture human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) on the human amniotic membrane (hAM). Since hAM has been used lately to patch diseased hearts in patients and has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic benefits, it qualifies as a cardiac compatible and clinically relevant heart tissue scaffold. The aim of this study was to test the ability of the hAM to support attachment, differentiation, and maturation of hiPSC-derived CMs in vitro. hAMs were prepared from term placenta. An in-house generated hiPSC line was used for CM derivation. hiPSC-derived cardiac progenitors were cultured on the surface of cryopreserved hAMs and in the presence of cytokines promoting cardiac differentiation. CMs grown on hAM and popular basement membrane matrix (BMM) Matrigel™ were compared for the following aspects of cardiac development: the morphology of cardiomyocytes with respect to shape and cellular alignments, levels of cardiac-related gene transcript expression, functionality in terms of spontaneous calcium fluxes and mitochondrial densities and distributions. hAM is biocompatible with hiPSC-derived CMs. hAM increased cardiac transcription regulator and myofibril protein transcript expression, accelerated intracellular calcium transients, and enhanced cellular mitochondrial complexity of its cardiomyocytes in comparison to cardiomyocytes differentiated on Matrigel™. Our data suggests that hAM supports differentiation and improves cardiomyogenesis in comparison to Matrigel™. hAMs are natural, easily and largely available. The method of preparing hAM cardiac sheets described here is simple with potential for clinical transplantation.

Animal,2019 04 06,"Copper is an essential dietary micronutrient in humans for proper cell function; however, in excess, it is toxic. The human cell line Caco-2 is popular as an in vitro model for intestinal absorption and toxicology. This study investigated the response of exponentially growing Caco-2 cells to prolonged copper exposure (120 h). An unexpected non-monotonic dose-response profile was observed in Caco-2 cells. Exposure to media supplemented with 3.125 μM CuSO4 resulted in decreased cell yield vs. untreated. However, toxicity was progressively reduced from 90% at 3.125 μM to 60% at 25 μM. This effect was documented between 48 and 120 h continuous exposure (p < 0.05). This triphasic toxicity curve was observed to be specific to copper in Caco-2 cells, as iron, manganese and zinc displayed monotonic dose-response profiles. Two inorganic copper forms, copper sulphate and copper chloride, were shown to conserve the non-monotonic dose-response curve. The triphasic effect was shown to be specific to Caco-2 cells. These results have implications for research investigating the effect of copper and other micronutrients using Caco-2 cells."

In air (1-20% O2), HCHO, HCOOH, CO, and CO2 were observed as products in FTIR spectra. The removal rate of CH3CHO in air using the side-on lamp (SL) increased from 3.2 to 18.6 min-1 with decreasing O2 concentration from 20 to 1%.

The best energy efficiency of the CH3CHO removal using the SL in a flow system was 2.8 g/kWh at 1% O2. Results show that the contribution of O(1D) and O3 is insignificant in the initial decomposition of CH3CHO. It was inferred that CH3CHO is initially decomposed by the O(3P) + CH3CHO reaction at 5-20% O2, whereas the contribution of direct vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photolysis increases concomitantly with decreasing O2 pressure at < 5% O2. After initial decomposition of CH3CHO, it was oxidized further by reactions of O(3P), OH, and O3 with various intermediates such as HCHO, HCOOH, and CO, leading to CO2 as a final product.",Generation of biodiesel from industrial wastewater using oleaginous yeast: performance and emission characteristics of microbial biodiesel and its blends on a compression injection diesel engine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798498,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"Microbial-derived biodiesel was tested on a lab scale CI diesel engine for carrying out exhaust emission and performance characteristics. The performance, emission, and combustion characteristics of a single cylinder four stroke fixed compression ratio engine when fueled with microbial bio-diesel and its 10-30% blends with diesel (on a volume basis) were investigated and compared with conventional diesel. The bio-diesel was obtained from microbes which were grown by combining distillery spent wash with lignocellulosic hydrolysate at nutrient deprived conditions. The microbes consumed the wastes and converted the high strength waste water into lipids, which were trans-esterified to form bio-diesel. Testing of microbial bio-diesel blends with ordinary diesel at different loading pressures and the emission characteristics were compared. Results indicate that with increasing of the blends, reduction of HC and CO emissions were observed, whilst brake thermal efficiency maxed out at 20% blending. Further increase of blends showed a tendency of increasing of both emissions in the exhaust stream. The Brake Specific Fuel consumption was observed to decline with blending until 20% and then increased. The nitrogen oxide emissions, however, were found to increase with increasing blend ratios and reached a maximum at 20% blend. The escalation of HC, CO, CO2, and NOx emissions was also observed at higher blending ratios and higher engine loads. The performance studies were able to show that out of the three blends of biodiesel, 20% biodiesel blend was able to deliver the best of reduced hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, whilst also delivering the highest Brake thermal efficiency and the lowest Brake Specific Fuel consumption.",Snapshot of environmental condition in different tropical estuarine systems by using S. cucullata (an edible oyster) as bio-indicator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798497,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"Accumulation of toxic metals and indigenous bacteria in oyster, (Saccostrea cucullata) and their impact on antioxidant enzyme activities in the biological system was studied and used to provide snapshot of environmental condition in different tropical estuarine systems.

However, there is a paucity of information on how salinity may influence the effects of other chemical stressors especially psychiatric pharmaceuticals. Freshwater planarians which have been suggested as bioindicator species in aquatic habitats were used in this study to evaluate toxic effects of sodium chloride (NaCl) used here as a surrogate for increasing salinity, and its influence on the effects of the antidepressant, fluoxetine. Effects of NaCl on Schmidtea mediterranea were evaluated using survival, regeneration, locomotion, feeding, and reproduction as endpoints. Subsequently, combined effects of NaCl and fluoxetine on planarians' locomotion and reproduction were also evaluated. Result showed that exposure to increased NaCl concentrations is toxic to planarians with 48 and 96 h LC50 of 9.15 and 7.55 g NaCl L-1 respectively and exposure to sub-lethal concentrations led to reductions in feeding (LOEC of 0.75 g NaCl L-1 or 1906 μS cm-1 at 20 °C) and reproduction (LOEC 3.0 g NaCl L-1 or 5530 μS cm-1 at 20 °C), delayed head regeneration (LOEC of 1.5 g NaCl L-1 or 3210 μS cm-1 at 20 °C), and also slight decreases in locomotor activity. Moreover, some developmental malformations were observed in regenerating planarians, as well as delayed or inhibition of wound healing and degeneration after fissioning and during head regeneration. A significant interaction between fluoxetine and NaCl was observed for locomotor activity and unlike planarians exposed to fluoxetine alone, fissioned planarians and their pieces from the combined exposure treatments were also unable to regenerate missing portions. Results show that S. mediterranea can be highly sensitive to low NaCl concentrations and that this stressor can alter the effects of fluoxetine.

Life sciences,2019 04 17,"The realization that body parts of animals and plants can be recruited or coopted for novel functions dates back to, or even predates the observations of Darwin. S.J. Gould and E.S. Vrba recognized a mode of evolution of characters that differs from adaptation. The umbrella term aptation was supplemented with the concept of exaptation. Unlike adaptations, which are restricted to features built by selection for their current role, exaptations are features that currently enhance fitness, even though their present role was not a result of natural selection. Exaptations can also arise from nonaptations; these are characters which had previously been evolving neutrally. All nonaptations are potential exaptations. The concept of exaptation was expanded to the molecular genetic level which aided greatly in understanding the enormous potential of neutrally evolving repetitive DNA-including transposed elements, formerly considered junk DNA-for the evolution of genes and genomes. The distinction between adaptations and exaptations is outlined in this review and examples are given. Also elaborated on is the fact that such distinctions are sometimes more difficult to determine; this is a widespread phenomenon in biology, where continua abound and clear borders between states and definitions are rare.",Neisseria chenwenguii sp. nov. isolated from the rectal contents of a plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798492,Antonie van Leeuwenhoek,2019 06 04,"Two Gram-stain negative, catalase positive, coccus shaped bacteria, designated 10023T and 10010, were isolated from the rectal contents of a plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.

The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein was assessed for its ability to inhibit alpha-amylase in the gut of the larvae of the maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Motsch.). ZmDEF1 was cloned into a pBetaPhaso-dest vector, which harbours phaseolin, a seed-specific promoter, and the Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 harbouring the pBetaPhaso-ZmDEF1 vector was used to transfer the ZmDEF1 gene into two maize cultivars using immature embryos. Transformed calluses were selected on selection media containing kanamycin. The stable integration of the ZmDEF1 transgene into the transgenic maize plant genome was confirmed using Southern blotting. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein of approximately 10 kDa was expressed in three transgenic maize lines from the LC1 cultivar (C1, C3, and C5) and two transgenic maize lines from the LVN99 cultivar (L1 and L3). The ZmDEF1 transgenic efficiency based on the results of PCR, as well as Southern and Western blotting, was 1.32% and 0.82%, respectively, which depends on the genotypes of LC1 and LVN99. The recombinant ZmDEF1 protein inhibited the alpha-amylase activity of the maize weevil larvae, and its ability to inhibit alpha-amylase is 54.52-63.09% greater than the ZmDEF1 protein extracted from non-transgenic plants."

We studied the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), delivered over the cerebellum in cathodal, anodal, and sham sessions, on ANT parameters in healthy subjects. After anodal and sham tDCS, the efficiency of the three attention networks remained stable, and a significant reduction in reaction time (RT) following the task repetition was observed for both congruent and incongruent targets, indicating a learning effect. After cathodal stimulation, instead, while the efficiency of the alerting and orienting networks remained stable, the efficiency of the executive network was significantly reduced. Moreover, a significant reduction in RT was observed for the congruent target alone, with no difference being detected for the incongruent target, indicating that cerebellar inhibition caused an attentive executive dysfunction specifically related to the ability to process complex stimuli in which conflict signals or errors are present. These results point to a role of the cerebellum, a subcortical structure that is thought to affect error processing both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by managing the functioning of brain cortical areas involved in the perception of conflicting signals, in the functioning of the attentional networks, particularly the executive network.",Respiratory syncytial virus contributes to more severe respiratory morbidity than influenza in children < 2 years during seasonal influenza peaks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798473,Infection,2019 02 24,To compare the frequency and the severity of influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) infections among children < 24 months hospitalized with respiratory symptoms.,"The efficacy of magnesium oxide and sodium valproate in prevention of migraine headache: a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798472,Acta neurologica Belgica,2019 02 24,"Migraine is a disabling disorder that affects the quality of life of patients. Different medications have been used in prevention of migraine headache. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of magnesium oxide in comparison with valproate sodium in preventing migraine headache attacks. This is a single-center, randomized, controlled, crossover trial which is double-blind, 24-week, 2-sequence, 2-period, 2-treatment. After patient randomization into two sequences, the intervention group received magnesium oxide 500 mg and the control group received valproate sodium 400 mg two tablets each day (every 12 h) for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was reduction in the number of migraine attacks and number of days with moderate or severe headache and hours with headache (duration) per month in the final of 8 weeks in comparison with baseline. Seventy patients were randomized and seven dropped out, leaving 63 for analysis. In an intention-to-treat analysis, 31 patients were in group 1 (magnesium oxide-valproate) and 32 patients were in group 2 (valproate-magnesium oxide). The mean number of migraine attacks and days per month was 1.72 ± 1.18 and 2.09 ± 1.70, with a mean duration of 15.50 ± 21.80 h in magnesium group and 1.27 ± 1.27 and 2.22 ± 1.96, with a mean duration 13.38 ± 14.10 in valproate group. This study has shown that 500 mg magnesium oxide appears to be effective in migraine prophylaxis similar to valproate sodium without significant adverse effect.",Word position coding in reading is noisy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798470,Psychonomic bulletin & review,2019 05 19,"In the present article, we investigate a largely unstudied cognitive process: word position coding. The question of how readers perceive word order is not trivial: Recent research has suggested that readers associate activated word representations with plausible locations in a sentence-level representation. Rather than simply being dictated by the order in which words are recognized, word position coding may be influenced by bottom-up visual cues (e.g., word length information), as well as by top-down expectations. Here we assessed how flexible word position coding is. We let readers make grammaticality judgments about four-word sentences. The incorrect sentences were constructed by transposing two words in a correct sentence (e.g., ""the man can run"" became ""the can man run""). The critical comparison was between two types of incorrect sentence: one with a transposition of the inner two words, and one with a transposition of the outer two words (""run man can the""). We reasoned that under limited (local) flexibility, it should be easier to classify the outer-transposed sentences as incorrect, because the words were farther away from their plausible locations in this condition. If words were recognized irrespective of location, on the other hand, there should be no difference between these two conditions. As it turned out, we observed longer response times and higher error rates for inner- than for outer-transposed sentences, indicating that local flexibility and top-down expectations can jointly lead the reader to confuse the locations of words, with a probability that increases as the distance between the plausible and actual locations of a word decreases. We conclude that word position coding is subject to a moderate amount of noise.",Liver assessment using Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in primary biliary cholangitis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798469,Japanese journal of radiology,2019 04 29,To evaluate the feasibility of utilizing gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of Child-Pugh class and for differentiating between patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and posthepatitic cirrhosis.,Management of Adrenocortical Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798468,Current oncology reports,2019 04 02,Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy typically with poor prognosis.

According to a recent model, two asymmetric H+ half-channels in the a subunit translate a transmembrane vertical H+ flux into the rotor rotation required for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. Along the H+ pathway, conserved aminoacid residues, mainly glutamate, address H+ both in the downhill and uphill transmembrane movements to synthesize or hydrolyze ATP, respectively. Point mutations responsible for these aminoacid changes affect H+ transfer through the membrane and, as a cascade, result in mitochondrial dysfunctions and related pathologies. The involvement of specific aminoacid residues in driving H+ along their transmembrane pathway within a subunit, sustained by the literature and calculated data, leads to depict a model consistent with some mitochondrial disorders.",Regulation of protein synthesis in porcine mammary epithelial cells by L-valine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798466,Amino acids,2019 04 05,"This study was conducted to determine the catabolism of L-valine in porcine mammary epithelial cells (PMECs) and its role in stimulating protein synthesis in these cells. PMECs were incubated with 0.05-, 0.10-, 0.25-, 0.5-, and 1.0-mM L-valine at 37 oC for 2 h. Cell viability and expressions of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were measured after culture with L-valine for 3 days. L-[1-14C]valine was used to study valine catabolism, whereas [3H]phenylalanine was employed as a tracer to determine protein synthesis and degradation in PMECs. The abundances of proteins involved in the mTOR signaling pathway and the mRNA levels for the related key genes were determined using the western blot and RT-PCR techniques, respectively. Cell numbers and the synthesis of proteins (including α-lactalbumin and β-casein) were greater (P < 0.05) in the presence of 0.5-mM L-valine, compared with 0.05- or 0.1-mM L-valine. L-Valine at 0.5 mM also enhanced (P < 0.05) the production of α-lactalbumin by PMECs, in comparison with 0.25 mM L-valine. Increasing the extracellular concentration of L-valine from 0.05 to 0.5 mM stimulated protein synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting proteolysis. Although L-valine was actively transaminated in PMECs, its α-ketoacid product (α-ketoisovalerate) at 0.05-0.2 mM did not affect protein synthesis or degradation in the cells. Thus, the effect of L-valine on protein synthesis was independent of its metabolism to yield α-ketoisovalerate. At the molecular level, 0.5-mM L-valine increased (P < 0.05) the mRNA levels for Ras, ERK1/2, and p70S6K, and the abundances of mTOR, p-4EBP1, total 4EBP1, p-ERK1/2, and total ERK1/2 proteins. These findings establish the critical role of L-valine in enhancing PMEC growth and milk protein synthesis possibly by regulating the mTOR and Ras/ERK signaling pathways. Further studies are warranted to understand how L-valine regulates gene expression and mTOR activation in PMECs.",Synthesis of selenopeptides: an alternative way of incorporating selenocystine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798465,Amino acids,2019 04 05,"Selenocysteine (Sec) residue cannot be directly attached to a peptide sequence unless the selenol form is protected beforehand and several problems have been reported in the preparation of Sec building blocks.

Overall, minimal differences were found between currently and formerly homeless people with mental health problems, suggesting that both groups have the same wants and needs related to service use, including to be treated fairly and without judgment, receive needed support and assistance, and feel good following their service experience. However, both groups also described encountering barriers to accessing programs and navigating service systems; using services where they felt judged, unsafe, or uncared for; and having unmet needs following service use.",Comparing Educational Music Therapy Interventions via Stages of Recovery with Adults in an Acute Care Mental Health Setting: A Cluster-Randomized Pilot Effectiveness Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798451,Community mental health journal,2019 04 08,"The purpose of this cluster-randomized pilot effectiveness study was to compare two different group-based educational music therapy interventions with a control condition as measured by the stage model of recovery in adults on an acute care mental health unit.

ELA and ESW conditions targeted motivations for and factors contributing to recovery. Results indicated no significant between-group difference. However, ELA and ESW conditions tended to have slightly more favorable stage of recovery mean scores than the control condition. Generally, educational music therapy may be clinically relevant for impacting stage of recovery within the temporal parameters of a single session. As ELA and ESW conditions had similar results, the specific educational music therapy intervention did not affect results.

Regardless of whether or not these entities are a cause or consequence of the disease process, preventing their accumulation or accelerating their clearance may slow the rate of AD onset. Motoneuronotrophic factor (MNTF) is an endogenous neurotrophin that is specific for the human nervous system, and some of the observed effects of MNTF include motoneuron differentiation, maintenance, survival, and reinnervation of target muscles and organs. GM6 is a six-amino-acid component of MNTF that appears to replicate its activity spectrum. In this study, we investigated the effect of GM6 in a mouse model of AD before the development of amyloid plaques and determined how this treatment affected the accumulation of Aβ peptide and related pathologic changes (e.g., inflammation, nerve growth factor (NGF) expression, cathepsin B, and memory impairment). Application of GM6 over a 4-month period in young APP/ΔPS1 double-transgenic mice resulted in attenuation in Aβ peptide levels, reduction of inflammation and amyloid load, increased cathepsin B expression, and improved spatial orientation. In addition, treatment with GM6 increased brain NGF levels and tempered memory impairment by ∼ 50% at the highest dose. These data suggest that GM6 may modulate disease-determining pathways at an early stage to slow the histological and clinical progression of AD.",Delayed Galectin-3-Mediated Reprogramming of Microglia After Stroke is Protective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798442,Molecular neurobiology,2019 02 24,"Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a β-galactoside-binding lectin, has recently emerged as a molecule with immunoregulatory functions. We investigated the effects of Gal-3 on microglia morphology, migration, and secretory profile under physiological conditions and in the context of ischemic injury. We show that in the control conditions, exposure to recombinant Gal-3 increases microglial ramification and motility in vitro and in vivo via an IL-4-dependent mechanism. Importantly, after stroke, Gal-3 exerted marked immune-modulatory properties. Delivery of Gal-3 at 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was associated with an increase in Ym1-positive microglia and decrease in iNOS. Analysis of cytokine profiles at the protein level revealed downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a marked upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-4, 24 h after i.c.v. injection of Gal-3. Importantly, the observed shift in cytokines in microglia was associated with a significant decrease in the infarct size. Taken together, our results suggest that when delivered well after ischemic injury, Gal-3 might fine tune innate immunity and induce a therapeutic shift in microglia polarization.",Analysis of Predictors of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Remission After Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in 101 Chinese Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798440,Obesity surgery,2019 06 10,To investigate prognostic factors for complete remission in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients who underwent gastric bypass (GBP) and to establish a prognostic model for risk stratification.,Increased androgen secretion in patients with prolactinomas: the impact of altered HPA function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798438,Pituitary,2019 03 29,Earlier studies suggested that hyperprolactinemia was associated with elevated serum DHEA-S levels.

This paper describes the methods used to conduct follow-up data collection of a longitudinal cohort that enrolled ANAI adults between 2004 and 2006 in south central Alaska. The follow-up study re-examined ANAI participants in a large, urban centre in south central Alaska between 2015 and 2017. Computerized surveys were used to collect self-reported health, lifestyle, physical activity, and diet data. Clinical measurements included blood pressure, fasting blood glucose and lipid panel, urine albumin/creatinine, height, weight, and waist and hip circumference. Participants were provided individual results at the conclusion of their visit. A total of 1320 south central Alaska study participants completed the baseline visit. Study staff attempted to contact all living cohort members for inclusion in the follow-up study. More than 11,000 attempted contacts were made.

Studies have shown that there is an increase in preventative services usage and a decrease in chronic disease burden with increased access to insurance. However, very little has been studied about how the implementation of ACA has impacted utilization of health services and health status among Asian Americans. In this study, we recruited 427 Asian Americans who attended health fairs and examined (1) changes in health care coverage and utilization of preventive health services before and after ACA, (2) health status on chronic disease risk factors, (3) comparing health services utilization by insurance status and types of insurance, and (4) identifying relationships between health care utilization and demographic factors. Study results indicate that even though the percentage of insured Asian Americans in Michigan increased significantly over study periods, health care utilization and chronic disease burden did not change significantly. The insured tended to utilize preventive health services more than the uninsured, but the types of insurance did not affect health care utilization. Gender and having a primary care physician were significant predictors in determining health care utilization. There is a need in this population for language-appropriate and culturally-sensitive education about the importance and availability of preventive services, which could improve adherence to preventive health services, thereby reducing health disparities.",SNAIL is induced by tamoxifen and leads to growth inhibition in invasive lobular breast carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798422,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 05 24,"Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is a histological subtype of breast cancer that is predominantly estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive (+) and is thus treated with endocrine therapies.

Offenders with mental disorder habitually make disadvantageous decisions, but no study has systematically appraised the literature. This review aimed to clarify the field by bringing together different neuropsychological measures of decision-making, and using meta-analysis and systematic review to explore the performance of offenders with mental disorders on neuropsychological tasks of decision-making. A structured search of PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Medline, Cinahl was conducted with additional hand searching and grey literature consulted. Controlled studies of decision-making in offenders with evidence of any mental disorder, including a validated measure of decision-making were included. Total score on each relevant decision-making task was collated. Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria (n = 1820), and 10 studies (with 15 experiments) were entered into the meta-analysis (n = 841). All studies included in the meta-analysis used the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to measure decision-making. Systematic review findings from individual studies showed violent offenders made poorer decisions than matched offender groups or controls. An omnibus meta-analysis was computed to examine performance on IGT in offenders with mental disorder compared with controls. Additionally, two sub-group meta-analyses were computed for studies involving offenders with personality disorder and psychopathy, and recidivists who were convicted of Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). Individual studies not included in the meta-analysis partially supported the view that offenders make poorer decisions. However, the meta-analyses showed no significant differences in performance on IGT between the offender groups and controls. Further research is required to ascertain whether offenders with mental disorder have difficulty in making advantageous decisions. An analysis of cause and effect and various directions for future work are recommended to help understand the underpinning of these findings.

Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 49 (ANKRD49), an evolutionarily conserved protein highly expressed in the testes, is mainly found in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids. However, the exact function of ANKRD49 in spermatogenesis has remained elusive. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of ANKRD49 in apoptosis and determine the mechanism underlying this process in male germ cell-derived GC-1 cells. Nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 and annexin V-FITC/PI, as well as analysis of caspase 3 activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptotic protein expression, showed that etoposide-induced apoptosis was attenuated by ANKRD49 overexpression but promoted by RNA interference-induced ANKRD49 knockdown. Furthermore, assessment of the levels of caspase 9, caspase 8, and proteins of the Bcl-2 family revealed ANKRD49 to be involved in an intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Examination of the subcellular distribution of the NF-κB p65 subunit after treatment with an NF-κB signaling inhibitor or p65 small interfering RNA demonstrated that ANKRD49 modulated etoposide-induced GC-1 cell apoptosis via the NF-κB pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that ANKRD49 plays an important role in reducing intrinsic apoptosis of GC-1 cells by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway."

To learn phosphate-solubilizing mechanisms of 71-2, mutants showing reduced solubilizing phosphate activity were obtained using the EZ-Tn5 transposon. Mutant 71-2-MT51 was reduced in the solubilizing phosphate content to 34.36% as compared with the wild-type strain 71-2. The disrupted gene in 71-2-MT51 was cloned and sequenced, and the putative protein from the gene shared 65.26% identity to protein sequences of enolase from Escherichia coli, which suggests the gene encodes an enzyme of enolase. Complementation analyzing showed that Eno was responsible for phosphate solubilizing for B. cenocepacia strain 71-2.

Over a period of 15 months, 40 female inpatients of a tertiary care psychiatric hospital with the diagnosis of schizophrenia were assessed by applying PANSS. Rating was done up to two menstrual cycles. Total scores, positive and negative subscale scores, and general psychopathology scores of PANSS in premenstrual, menstrual, and postmenstrual phases of those patients were compared with one another by applying paired t test. Symptoms in women suffering from schizophrenia frequently vary with the different phases of menstrual cycle. The positive symptoms improved significantly only during progesterone phase. Negative symptoms and general psychopathology subscale showed improvement on estrogen phases of menstrual cycle. So optimal treatment needs to be adjusted to the individual women suffering from schizophrenia.",The effect of male involvement and a prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) intervention on depressive symptoms in perinatal HIV-infected rural South African women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798376,Archives of women's mental health,2019 06 10,"This study investigated perinatal depressive symptoms among HIV-infected women enrolled in a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in South Africa. Women (n = 1370) attending 12 community health centers were consecutively enrolled in a two-phase (phase 1 = without a male partner, phase 2 = with a male partner) and two-condition (experimental or control) prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) intervention. Women were enrolled at 8-24 weeks pregnant and followed postpartum at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months (retention rate = 69.8%). Antenatally, 45.4% of women were above the 12-point Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) cutoff, 30.2% were above the cutoff at 6 weeks, and 34.2% and 36.9% at 6 months and 12 months postpartum, respectively. In multilevel regression analyses, depressive symptoms decreased over time among women in phase 2 participating in the intervention condition, but neither condition nor phase alone was associated with a decrease in depression. Greater HIV stigma, increased psychological intimate partner violence, less male involvement, lower education, and non-adherence during pregnancy were associated with increased depressive symptoms over the perinatal period. Results indicated that women participating had high levels of depressive symptoms (> 40% prenatally and > 30% postnatally), and the combination of the multi-session PMTCT intervention plus male partner participation contributed to a reduction in depressive symptoms. Results suggest that interventions targeting the reduction of depressive symptoms in perinatal HIV-positive women by increasing male involvement and decreasing HIV stigma and intimate partner violence are needed to reduce depression in this vulnerable population.",The effect of maternal antidepressants on third trimester uteroplacental hemodynamics and the neonatal abstinence syndrome: a retrospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798375,Archives of women's mental health,2019 02 24,"The objective of this study is to determine whether maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy influences uteroplacental hemodynamics, thereby affecting fetal growth and gestational age at delivery. The secondary aim was to determine the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) among infants exposed to antidepressant medications.

Exclusion criteria were substance abuse; narcotic or lithium use at the time of delivery.In total, 205 women met the inclusion criteria (92 took antidepressants; 113 women did not). There were no significant differences in umbilical artery pulsatility index (PI), gestational age at delivery, or birth weight when comparing women based on antidepressant use. A small proportion (18%) of neonates had mild withdrawal symptoms; one baby had a score (≥ 8) consistent with severe NAS. In women with a history of depression, there was no difference in uteroplacental hemodynamics as measured by third trimester Doppler ultrasonography when comparing women who took antidepressant medication versus those who did not.

In this study, we propose a new counting method, which consists of three modules including localization, segmentation and classification. The localization of BMC is achieved from a color transformation enhanced BMC sample image and stepwise averaging method. In the nucleus segmentation, both stepwise averaging method and Otsu's method are applied to obtain a weighted threshold for segmenting the patch into nucleus and non-nucleus. In the cytoplasm segmentation, a color weakening transformation, an improved region growing method and the K-Means algorithm are employed. The connected cells with BMC will be separated by the marker-controlled watershed algorithm. The features will be extracted for the classification after the segmentation. In this study, the BMC are classified using the support vector machine into five classes; namely, neutrophilic split granulocyte, neutrophilic stab granulocyte, metarubricyte, mature lymphocytes and the outlier (all other cells not listed). Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation and classification performance with an average segmentation accuracy of 91.76% and an average recall rate of 87.49%.

The elemental mapping of the selected leaf area was accomplished via line scans with a 110-μm-diameter laser beam at a 37-μm s-1 scan speed and repetition rate of 10 Hz. The lines were spaced 180 μm apart and ablated at an energy density of 2 J cm-2. The elemental imaging clearly confirmed that Cd was predominantly distributed within the parenchyma of the T. arvense, whereas in the Noccaea spp. and A. halleri, the highest intensity Cd signal was observed in the veins of the leaves. For Zn, higher intensities were observed in the veins for all the plant species except for A. thaliana. Close relationships between Zn and Ca were identified for the Noccaea spp. leaves. These relationships were not confirmed for A. halleri. Significant correlations were also proved between the Cd and Zn distribution in A. halleri, but not for the Noccaea spp. For both T. arvense and A. thaliana, no relevant significant relationship for the interpretation of the results was observed. Thus, the LA-ICP-MS imaging is proved as a relevant technique for the description and understanding of the elements in hyperaccumulating or highly accumulating plant species, although its sensitivity for the natural element contents in nonaccumulator plant species is still insufficient.","Feasibility testing of the Core set of quality Indicators for Paediatric Primary Care in Europe, COSI-PPC-EU.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798371,European journal of pediatrics,2019 04 23,"There is a need to measure and improve the quality of paediatric primary care in Europe where major differences in the delivery and outcomes of child health care exist. A collaborative panel of paediatric senior experts developed a Core Set of Indicators for Paediatric Primary Care in Europe by compiling 42 quality indicators in a modified consensus process following the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of the quality indicator set in European paediatric primary care practices. Seventy-nine practices from eight countries participated in a detailed online interview. The practices rated the applicability, relevance, reliability and acceptance of the 42 quality indicator as well as the availability, technical feasibility and effort to retrieve the needed data from their medical records. Most quality indicators were considered applicable, available, reliable, acceptable and relevant for monitoring quality of care in paediatric primary care. Respondents rated feasibility and effort to retrieve the data lowest because of difficulties collecting the data from the medical records.Conclusion: European paediatric primary care practices generally agree with the proposed quality indicator set. They document most of the parameters. However, the collection of specific needed values from available routine patient-data is considered technically difficult and time-consuming. What is Known? • Paediatric primary care systems in Europe show striking differences in their performance. Pre-existing sets of quality indicators are predominantly limited to national populations, specific diseases and hospital care. • A Core Set of 42 quality indicators for paediatric primary care in Europe was developed by European paediatricians using a systematic literature review and a consensus process following a modified RAND/UCLA appropriateness method. What is New? • Paediatric primary care providers in Europe agree with the idea to use COSI-PPC-EU to monitor and improve the quality of care. The set was considered applicable, available, reliable, acceptable, and relevant for quality improvement. • The score for feasibility and effort to retrieve the data was low, because of technical reasons; the electronical or paper-based medical documentation in most cases does not allow convenient access to all necessary data.",Pharmacological stimulation of sigma-1 receptor promotes activation of astrocyte via ERK1/2 and GSK3β signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798370,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2019 06 10,"Astrocyte is considered to be a type of passive supportive cells that preserves neuronal activity and survival. The dysfunction of astrocytes is involved in the pathological processes of major depression. Recent studies implicate sigma-1 receptors as putative therapeutic targets for current available antidepressant drugs. However, it is absent of direct evidences whether sigma-1 receptor could promote activation of astrocyte. In the present study, we took advantage of primary astrocyte culture and a highly selective agonist of sigma-1 receptor, (+)SKF-10047 to determine the effect of sigma-1 receptor on Brdu (bromodeoxyuridine) labeling positive cells, migration as well as GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) expression of astrocyte. The results showed that (+)SKF-10047 notably increased the number of Brdu labeling positive cells, migration, and the expression of GFAP in primary astrocytes, which were blocked by antagonist of sigma-1 receptor. Moreover, we also found that (+)SKF-10047 increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2) and GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3β) (ser 9) in the primary astrocytes. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 and GSK3β (ser 9) abolished sigma-1 receptor-promoted activation of astrocyte. Therefore, sigma-1 receptor could be considerate as a new pattern for modulating astrocytic function might emerge as therapeutic strategies.",In vitro schistosomicidal activity of tamoxifen and its effectiveness in a murine model of schistosomiasis at a single dose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798369,Parasitology research,2019 04 26,"Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease affecting 220 million people worldwide. Praziquantel has proven to be effective against this parasitic disease, though there are increasing concerns regarding tolerance/resistance that calls for new drugs. Repurposing already existing and well-known drugs has been a desirable approach since it reduces time, costs, and ethical concerns. The anti-cancer drug tamoxifen (TAM) has been used worldwide for several decades to treat and prevent breast cancer. Previous reports stated that TAM affects Schistosoma hormonal physiology; however, no controlled schistosomicidal in vivo assays have been conducted. In this work, we evaluated the effect of TAM on female and male Schistosoma mansoni morphology, motility, and egg production. We further assessed worm survival and egg production in S. mansoni-infected mice. TAM induced morphological alterations in male and female parasites, as well as in eggs in vitro. Furthermore, in our in vivo experiments, one single dose of intraperitoneal TAM citrate reduced the total worm burden by 73% and led to a decrease in the amount of eggs in feces and low percentages of immature eggs in the small intestine wall. Eggs obtained from TAM citrate-treated mice were reduced in size and presented hyper-vacuolated structures. Our results suggest that TAM may be repurposed as a therapeutic alternative against S. mansoni infections."

However, we have a little understanding of how evolutionary diversity is affected by gradients and the role of niche persistence in flooded forests in dry biomes. Here, we assessed the evolutionary diversity across a flooding gradient in the Caatinga Domain of South America. We established 120 plots across four tributaries of the São Francisco River, eastern Brazil, consisting of 72 plots in flooded, 24 in occasionally flooded, and 24 in unflooded forests. We computed richness, phylogenetic diversity (PD), mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD), and mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD) and their standardized effect sizes (ses.PD, ses.MNTD, and ses.MPD). We found low richness, low PD, and high MNTD values in flooded forests relative to unflooded and occasionally flooded forests. MPD did not differ across the flooding gradient. The standardized effect size metrics were higher in flooded forests. Despite the unflooded and occasionally flooded forests being rich in terms of species and correlated phylogenetic structure, flooded forests showed more lineage diversity than expected by chance. We assessed whether this pattern could be driven by resprouting ability testing its phylogenetic signal. Resprouting is randomly distributed across phylogeny, but plant communities are likely assembled from random draws of the resprouters' lineage pool. Quantifying evolutionary diversity across flooding gradients in dry environments brought new insights to how the same environmental filters may lead to disparate patterns of evolutionary diversity and the role of response traits in allowing certain clades to persist in flooded habitats.",α-Synuclein and astrocytes: tracing the pathways from homeostasis to neurodegeneration in Lewy body disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798354,Acta neuropathologica,2019 06 16,"α-Synuclein is a soluble protein that is present in abundance in the brain, though its normal function in the healthy brain is poorly defined. Intraneuronal inclusions of α-synuclein, commonly referred to as Lewy pathology, are pathological hallmarks of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders referred to as α-synucleinopathies. Though α-synuclein is expressed predominantly in neurons, α-synuclein aggregates in astrocytes are a common feature in these neurodegenerative diseases. How and why α-synuclein ends up in the astrocytes and the consequences of this dysfunctional proteostasis in immune cells is a major area of research that can have far-reaching implications for future immunobiotherapies in α-synucleinopathies. Accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein can disrupt astrocyte function in general and, more importantly, can contribute to neurodegeneration in α-synucleinopathies through various pathways. Here, we summarize our current knowledge on how astrocytic α-synucleinopathy affects CNS function in health and disease and propose a model of neuroglial connectome altered by α-synuclein proteostasis that might be amenable to immune-based therapies.",Atopic dermatitis and autoimmunity: the occurrence of autoantibodies and their association with disease severity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798353,Archives of dermatological research,2019 03 14,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a widespread condition that appears to be increasing in prevalence and severity worldwide, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Recent research has identified various similarities between AD and autoimmune conditions, as well as indicating that there may be an association between AD and autoimmunity. This systematic review evaluates the association between AD and autoimmunity, as well as between severity of disease in AD and autoimmunity, with an emphasis on the associations with autoantibodies. MEDLINE (1946 to December 2017) and Embase (1974 to December 2017) databases were searched. Further relevant articles were retrieved from reference lists. Only studies measuring direct indicators of autoimmunity, in humans, were included. Qualitative analysis was carried out for all studies. In addition, quantitative analysis was used to evaluate prevalence of IgE autoantibodies and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs) in AD patients and control subjects. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used with a random-effects model. 28 studies assessed the occurrence of autoantibodies in AD patients and 16 studies were used to evaluate association between disease severity and autoantibodies. Pooled analysis from 14 studies, involving 986 AD patients and 441 control subjects, showed that IgE autoantibodies were significantly more prevalent in patients with AD (P < 0.00001) than control subjects. Similar analysis was carried out for ANAs, with eight studies that involved 1045 AD patients and 1273 control subjects. ANAs were significantly more prevalent in patients with AD (P = 0.003). This quantitative analysis supported an association between AD and IgE autoantibodies, as well as between AD and ANAs. There was insufficient data to make similar conclusions for other indicators of autoimmunity. The weight of evidence also suggests an association between IgE autoantibodies and disease severity. There was insufficient evidence to make this link for other indicators of autoimmunity.",Nestin+ progenitor cells isolated from adult human sweat gland stroma promote reepithelialisation and may stimulate angiogenesis in wounded human skin ex vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798352,Archives of dermatological research,2019 05 05,"The combination of an aging population and an increasing prevalence of diseases associated with impaired-wound healing, including obesity, peripheral vascular disease and diabetes, is likely to result in a dramatic increase in the incidence and prevalence of chronic skin wounds. Indeed, systemic reviews are now not only trying to establish both the prevalence and the often under-estimated socio-economic costs of chronic skin wounds, but most importantly are addressing the impact that chronic wounds have on quality of life. Given the clear need for novel approaches to the management of chronic skin ulceration, ideally developed and tested in the human system in a manner that can be rapidly translated into clinical practice, we examined the effects of multipotent primary human nestin+ progenitor cells on human wound healing in an ex vivo model. Human sweat gland-derived nestin+ cells demonstrated the capacity to significantly promote two key wound healing parameters, i.e., both reepithelialisation and angiogenesis in experimentally wounded, organ-cultured human skin. The current data further support the use of full-thickness human skin wound-healing models ex vivo to pre-clinically test wound healing-promoting candidate agents. Whilst larger studies are required to substantiate a firm ""proof-of-concept,"" our preliminary studies encourage further efforts to systemically determine the potential of cell-based regenerative medicine strategies in general, and the use of skin appendage-associated human nestin+ cells in particular, as novel treatment strategies for chronic skin ulceration.",Decision-making algorithm for sequential treatment of diaphyseal bone gaps in war-wounded patients in the Middle East.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798351,International orthopaedics,2019 02 24,"Tibial bone gaps after war injuries are common and can be managed by different types of surgery, including compression, bone graft, tibialisation of fibula, bone transport, and free flaps.

It has gained broad attention since it is a promising approach to overcome resistance to apoptosis in cancer chemotherapy. We have recently identified tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) as a novel inducer of ferroptosis. t-BuOOH is a widely used compound to induce oxidative stress in vitro. t-BuOOH induces lipid peroxidation and consequently ferroptosis in murine and human cell lines. t-BuOOH additionally results in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, formation of DNA double-strand breaks, and replication block. Here, we specifically address the question whether cell-cell contacts regulate t-BuOOH-induced ferroptosis and cellular damage. To this end, murine NIH3T3 or human HaCaT cells were seeded to confluence, but below their saturation density to allow the establishment of cell-cell contacts without inducing quiescence. Cells were then treated with t-BuOOH (50 or 200 µM, respectively). We revealed that cell-cell contacts reduce basal and t-BuOOH-triggered lipid peroxidation and consequently block ferroptosis. Similar results were obtained with the specific ferroptosis inducer erastin. Cell-cell contacts further protect against t-BuOOH-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and formation of DNA double-strand breaks. Interestingly, cell-cell contacts failed to prevent t-BuOOH-mediated replication block or formation of the oxidative base lesion 8-oxo-dG. Since evidence of protection against cell death was both (i) observed after treatment with hydrogen peroxide, methyl methanesulfonate or UV-C, and (ii) seen in several cell lines, we conclude that protection by cell-cell contacts is a widespread phenomenon. The impact of cell-cell contacts on toxicity might have important implications in cancer chemotherapy.",Impact of second decline rate of BCR-ABL1 transcript on clinical outcome of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients on imatinib first-line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798348,Annals of hematology,2019 04 25,"Early molecular response has been associated with clinical outcome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The BCR-ABL1 transcript rate decline from baseline to 3 months has been demonstrated to be more predictive than a single BCR-ABL1 level at 3 months (M3). However, it cannot be used routinely because ABL1, as an internal gene control, is not reliable for BCR-ABL1 quantification above 10%. This study aimed to compare clinical outcome and molecular response of chronic phase CML patients, depending on the percentage of BCR-ABL1 transcript decrease from month 3 to month 6 using ABL1 as an internal control gene. Two hundred sixteen chronic phase CML patients treated with imatinib 400 mg for whom M3 and month 6 molecular data were available were included in the study. Associations with event-free (EFS), failure-free (FFS), progression-free (PFS), and overall survivals (OS) molecular response 4 log and 4.5 log were assessed. The percentage of BCR-ABL1 decline from month 3 to month 6 was significantly linked to the EFS and the FFS (p < 0.001). A common cut-off of 67% of decline predicted the better risk of event. Patients with a decrease below 67% have worse EFS and FFS as compared to those having a higher decrease (p < 0.001). The impact was confirmed by multivariate analysis. Since the slope between diagnosis and 3 months cannot be reliable using ABL1 as an internal gene control, the second decline rate of BCR-ABL1 transcript between month 3 and month 6 could efficiently identify patients at higher risk of event.",Higher prevalence of heart failure in rural regions: a population-based study covering 87% of German inhabitants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798347,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2019 02 24,So far the extent of regional variation of heart failure (HF) prevalence in Germany is unknown.,Digitalis therapy is associated with higher comorbidities and poorer prognosis in patients undergoing ablation of atrial arrhythmias: data from the German Ablation Registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798346,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,2019 02 24,Digitalis glycosides are employed for rate control of atrial fibrillation.

Pancreatic ductal carcinoma arises from MCN as a precursor lesion, but data on progression pathways are limited. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old female was referred to our hospital for further investigation of a pancreatic cyst. Further examination showed a 7.0 cm multilocular cyst in the pancreatic tail and a solid mass in the thick septum of the cystic tumor. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Histological examination revealed a moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with a diameter of 0.5 cm in the thick septum of the cystic lesion and a cyst wall composed of epithelium with low-grade to severe dysplasia. The epithelium covered an OS. Pathological diagnosis was IDC arising in MCN of the pancreas. Immunohistochemical examination showed that MUC1 expression was negative in MCN but positive in IDC. KRAS mutation was observed in both MCN and IDC regions. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of moderately differentiated pancreatic IDC arising in MCN. To elucidate the underlying progression pathway, we explored the correlation between KRAS mutation and MUC expression as a clinicopathological parameter.",miR-483-5p Targets MKNK1 to Suppress Wilms' Tumor Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis In Vitro and In Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798328,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 10,"BACKGROUND Wilms' tumor (WT) is the most common type of renal tumor in children and it has high mortality rates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of cellular differentiation processes that have been discovered to contribute to the development of various kinds of tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS The Wilms' tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were obtained from 28 patients to quantity miR-483-5p expression level. The miR-483-5p mimics and scrambles were transfected into the human kidney WT cell line GHINK-1 to evaluate the effect of miR-483-5p on Wilms' tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. A total of 18 female BALB/c nu/nu mice were used to further confirm how miR-483-5p affects Wilms' tumor in vivo. RESULTS In the present study, miR-483-5p was identified to be downregulated in Wilms' tumor tissues compared with the normal adjacent tissues. Additionally, low expression of mir-483-5p was significantly correlated with unfavorable histology subtypes, lymphatic metastasis, and late clinical stage (stage III and IV). Overexpression of miR-483-5p inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of GHINK-1 (Wilms' tumor) cells compared with the control group due to enhanced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, miR-483-5p upregulated the protein expression level of caspase-3. Finally, MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 was identified as a direct target of miR-483-5p, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting. CONCLUSIONS miR-483-5p suppressed WT cell proliferation via inducing apoptosis through targeting MKNK1. This may provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying WT and a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of WT in the future.",ADAR1 p110 Enhances Adhesion of Tumor Cells to Extracellular Matrix in Hepatocellular Carcinoma via Up-Regulating ITGA2 Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798327,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 10,"BACKGROUND Intrahepatic and distant metastases could be the major cause of treatment failure in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The deep mechanism of HCC metastasis is closely related to the interaction between integrins and extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment. MATERIAL AND METHODS In vitro cell adhesion assay was performed to determine the capability of adhering to ECM elements of HCC cells. To modulate the expression status of ADAR1 p110 in tumor cells, lentivirus system was applied. Meanwhile, patients' HCC samples and orthotopic xenograft mouse model were used for verifying our in vitro data. RESULTS ADAR1 p110 could strongly enhance the adhesion of HCC tumor cells to ECM, which was usually regarded as the initiation of tumor invasion. Such phenotype was caused due to up-regulation of ITGA2 both in mRNA and protein level. Moreover, specimen collected from HCC patients revealed a positive correlation between ADAR1 and ITGA2. Finally, ADAR1 p110 promoted HCC metastasis was verified when we applied orthotopic xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSIONS ADAR1 could enhance HCC metastasis by promoting tumor cells adhering to ECM via increasing ITGA2 expression. This phenomenon could provide novel information to better understanding the mechanism of HCC metastasis procedure.","The Relation of Satisfaction, Self-Confidence and Emotion in a Simulated Environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798326,International journal of nursing education scholarship,2019 02 24,"Clinical simulation allows discussions about improving the quality on the patient's care. This method have effectiveness on what concerns to satisfaction, self-confidence and student motivation. However, during the assessment, the students have emotional reactions that have tended to be overlooked. In view of this, this article seeks to identify and describe the relationship of the emotions observed by facial expressions and assess their degree of satisfaction and self-confidence by carrying out simulated practices among the nursing students. The analysis based on the scales showed high satisfaction and self-confidence levels, and it was found that the predominant basic emotion was anger, which is caused by other correlated emotions like tension and stress. This divergence between the identified emotions opens up space for further investigations about the level of motivation and the stimulus tolearning that these emotions can provide, and the extent to which they can lead to satisfaction and self-confidence.",An Exploration of the Clinical Accommodation Process for Nursing Students with Physical Disabilities Using Grounded Theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798325,International journal of nursing education scholarship,2019 02 24,The purpose of this study was to uncover the process by which nursing faculty make reasonable academic accommodations in the clinical environment for nursing students with orthopedic impairments.,SRT1720 retards renal fibrosis via inhibition of HIF1α /GLUT1 in diabetic nephropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798323,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 02 24,"Renal fibrosis is a major pathological characteristic of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Reportedly, increased SIRT1 expression played a renal protective role in animal models of DN. This study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SRT1720, an SIRT1 activator, against diabetes-induced renal fibrosis. Type 2 diabetic mice (db/db) were treated with SRT1720 (50 mg/kg/d) by gavage for 10 weeks. Renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells) were treated with high glucose (HG, 30 mM) in the presence or absence of SRT1720 (2.5 µM) for 48 h. We observed that impaired SIRT1 expression and activity were restored by SRT1720 administration in db/db mice as well as in HG-treated HK-2 cells. Moreover, SRT1720 administration improved renal function, attenuated glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial expansion, glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, and inhibited TGFB1 and CTGF expressions and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in db/db mice. Similarly, HG-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and collagen IV and fibronectin expressions were inhibited in SRT1720 treated HK-2 cells. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that SRT1720 suppressed HIF1α, GLUT1 and SNAIL expressions both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Hif1α or Glut1 knockdown effectively abrogated HG-induced EMT and collagen IV and fibronectin expressions in HK-2 cells. These findings suggest that SRT1720 prevented diabetes-induced renal fibrosis via the SIRT1/HIF1α/GLUT1/SNAIL pathway.",Pancreatic prolactin receptor signaling regulates maternal glucose homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798322,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 02 24,"Prolactin (PRL) signaling has been implicated in the regulation of glucose homeostatic adaptations to pregnancy. In this report, the PRL receptor (Prlr) gene was conditionally disrupted in the pancreas, creating an animal model which proved useful for investigating the biology and pathology of gestational diabetes including its impacts on fetal and placental development. In mice, pancreatic PRLR signaling was demonstrated to be required for pregnancy-associated changes in maternal β cell mass and function. Disruption of the Prlr gene in the pancreas resulted in fewer insulin producing cells, which failed to expand appropriately during pregnancy resulting in reduced blood insulin levels and maternal glucose intolerance. This inability to sustain normal blood glucose balance during pregnancy worsened with age and a successive pregnancy. The etiology of the insulin insufficiency was attributed to deficits in regulatory pathways controlling β cell development. Additionally, the disturbance in maternal blood glucose homeostasis, was associated with fetal overgrowth and dysregulation of inflammation and prolactin-associated transcripts in the placenta. Overall, these results indicate that the PRLR, acting within the pancreas, mediates maternal pancreatic adaptations to pregnancy and therefore its dysfunction may increase a woman's chances of becoming glucose intolerant during pregnancy.",Role of neutrophil extracellular traps in chronic kidney injury induced by bisphenol-A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798321,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 02 24,"Bisphenol-A (BPA) is a common environmental pollutant, and exposure to it is associated with proteinuria and may predict the progression of chronic kidney disease，however, the mechanism is not clear. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is a DNA skeleton coated with various proteases, and it is associated with various autoimmune nephritis. In this study, we examine whether NETs is involved in BPA-induced chronic kidney injury. In vivo, BPA exposure resulted in impaired renal function and altered renal morphology, including glomerular mesangial matrix expansion and increased renal interstitial fibroblast markers. Meanwhile, more dsDNA can be detected in the serum, and the NETs-associated proteins, MPO and citH3 were deposited in the renal system. In vitro, BPA and NETs treatment caused podocyte injury, a loss of marker proteins, and disorder in the actin skeleton. After NETs inhibition via DNase administration, BPA-induced injuries were significantly relieved. In conclusion, the increase of NETosis in circulation and the renal system during BPA exposure suggests that NETs may be involved in BPA-induced chronic kidney injury."

Here, we describe an in-depth ADP-ribosylome using our Af1521-based proteomics methodology for comprehensive profiling of ADP-ribosylation sites, by systematically assessing complementary proteolytic digestions and precursor fragmentation through application of electron-transfer higher-energy collisional dissociation (EThcD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD), respectively. Although ETD spectra yielded higher identification scores, EThcD generally proved superior to ETD in identification and localization of ADP-ribosylation sites regardless of protease employed. Notwithstanding, the propensities of complementary proteases and fragmentation methods expanded the detectable repertoire of ADP-ribosylation to an unprecedented depth. This system-wide profiling of the ADP-ribosylome in HeLa cells subjected to DNA damage uncovered >11,000 unique ADP-ribosylated peptides mapping to >7,000 ADP-ribosylation sites, in total modifying over one-third of the human nuclear proteome and highlighting the vast scope of this PTM. High-resolution MS/MS spectra enabled identification of dozens of proteins concomitantly modified by ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation, revealing a considerable degree of crosstalk on histones. ADP-ribosylation was confidently localized to various amino acid residue types, including less abundantly modified residues, with hundreds of ADP-ribosylation sites pinpointed on histidine, arginine, and tyrosine residues. Functional enrichment analysis suggested modification of these specific residue types is directed in a spatial manner, with tyrosine ADP-ribosylation linked to the ribosome, arginine ADP-ribosylation linked to the endoplasmic reticulum, and histidine ADP-ribosylation linked to the mitochondrion.","Dismantling, personalising and optimising internet cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression: a study protocol for individual participant data component network meta-analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798295,BMJ open,2019 02 26,"Psychotherapy is a complex intervention, consisting of various components and being implemented flexibly in consideration of individual patient's characteristics.

To achieve it, cellulose paper based single-crystalline three-dimensional aloe like TiO2 arrays (PSATs) were firstly fabricated as the electron transporting material, providing direct pathways for the charge carriers transfer, and subsequently coupled with CdS to form PSATs/CdS heterojunction for extending the solar spectrum response. Meanwhile, positive charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (PMSNs) were prepared as the nanocarrier to efficient entrap the Cu2+ which could be regarded as signal quencher due to their reaction with CdS to form CuxS. Single stranded DNAs (ssDNAs), which could bind specifically with the target of cTnI, were then introduced to couple with the PMSNs and used as the bio-gate to encapsulate the signal quencher of Cu2+, endowing the functional PMSNs with responsiveness to cTnI. When the cTnI existed, the ssDNAs were dissociated from PMSNs due to the formation of cTnI-ssDNAs complexes, triggering controllable release of the trapped Cu2+, and further decreasing the photocurrent signal caused by the formation of CuxS. Accordingly, the concentration of cTnI could be accurately quantified via the photocurrent, realizing the target-induced modification-free μ-PAD assay.

The different LMWOAs such as acetic acid, glycolic acid, malonic acid, and tartaric acid were used in experiments. The effects of LMWOAs on the transport of GO were markedly dependent upon organic acid species. In general, the transport enhancement effects followed the order of tartaric acid > malonic acid > glycolic acid > acetic acid, the regular pattern might be related to amount and type of functional groups of LMWOAs. Additionally, the different enhanced ability of LMWOAs was determined by their molecular weight. In the presence of Na+, the main deposition mechanism was ascribed to steric hindrance and competition between LMWOA and GO for deposition sites on grain surfaces under acidic conditions (i.e., pH 4.0 and 5.0). Batch adsorption experiments indicated the extents of competitive adsorption between LMWOAs and GO on quartz sand. In addition, the DLVO theory was not applicable to describe the transport of GO in the presence of LMWOAs at pH 5.0. Nevertheless, electrostatic and steric repulsion, existing between GO and sand grains, were the most important deposition mechanisms under the neutral condition (i.e., pH 7.0). When Ca2+ was the main cation in the background solution, the transport enhancement effects followed quite similar order to those of Na+, mainly due to different complexing strength of organic acids.",Using enzyme activities and soil microbial diversity to understand the effects of fluoxastrobin on microorganisms in fluvo-aquic soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798246,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"Whether now or in the foreseeable future, agricultural production cannot do without chemical pesticides. Strobilurin fungicides, including mitochondrial inhibitors, can easily enter the soil environment and causing pollution. Fluoxastrobin is one of the top-selling strobilurin fungicides. Limited information can be found in the literature on the environmental toxicity of fluoxastrobin in soil. It is essential to understand the effects of fluoxastrobin on microorganisms in fluvo-aquic soil. The present study used a Biolog-EcoPlate method to analyze the effects of fluoxastrobin on soil microbial diversity in groups exposed to 0.1, 1.0, and 2.5 mg/kg fluoxastrobin and in control groups at exposure and on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 48.

The results indicated that the three tested enzyme activities were lower at each dose to a varying degree than those of the controls. The soil microbial diversity was shown to be affected according to the results of average well color development (AWCD) experiments. The present study aimed to assess environmental risks to terrestrial ecosystems under the stress of pesticide use.

The present study was designed to compare the efficacy of nitenpyram and thiamethoxam for A. gossypii control, impacts on natural enemies and their potential risks to honeybees. Investigations in two locations in China revealed that the seed treatment with nitenpyram at a dosage of 3 g a.i. kg-1 seed could effectively control A. gossypii throughout the seedling stage. In addition, Nitenpyram at the dosage of 2 g a.i. kg-1 seed did not significantly change present number of the 7-spot ladybeetles in fields, compared with thiamethoxam treatments and blank control. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was utilized to identify and quantify the residue dynamics and transformation of parental and metabolite products in pollen and leaves. On the basis of residue data, the first-tier risk assessment disclosed that nitenpyram applied at doses of 2, 3 and 4 g a.i. kg-1 seed might result in relative lower potential exposure risks to honeybees when compared with thiamethoxam. These results enable us to better understand the performance of nitenpyram seed treatments against A. gossypii during the seedling stage, indicating that nitenpyram may be safer than thiamethoxam for natural enemies and honeybees."

The mean concentrations of Σ9OPFRs were 22.7 ng m-3 and 1.40 ng m-3 in paired indoor and outdoor PM2.5, respectively. The concentrations of tri-n-butyl phosphate (TNBP), tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) in indoor PM2.5 were significantly correlated with those in outdoor PM2.5. For different indoor microenvironments, mean concentrations of Σ9OPFRs were in the order of office (29.0 ± 11.7 ng m-3) > home (24.0 ± 9.4 ng m-3) > dormitory (19.4 ± 4.9 ng m-3) > activity room (14.4 ± 3.1 ng m-3). TCIPP was the most abundant compound in the indoor PM2.5, followed by TCEP. Significantly higher concentrations of OPFRs were observed in indoor environments with more furnishing, electronics or other materials (p < 0.05). Moreover, lower levels of OPFRs in indoor air were observed at well-ventilated (with higher air exchange rate) indoor sampling sites. Concentrations of Σ9OPFRs in the activity room, dormitory, homes and outdoor sites generally increased in summer and heating seasons (November 2016 to February 2017). Significant correlations (p < 0.05) were observed between temperatures and mass concentrations of OPFRs with higher vapor pressures, i.e. TNBP, TCEP and TCIPP in all indoor and outdoor samples. Seasonal differences in human exposure were observed and the highest daily exposure dose occurred in summer. Toddlers may suffer the highest exposure risk of PM2.5-bound OPFRs via inhalation among all age groups. This is one of the very few studies that have revealed the seasonal variation and human exposure of PM2.5-bound OPFRs in different microenvironments, which shed light on emission sources and fate of OPFRs and potential human exposure pathway.",Biogas residues in substitution for chemical fertilizers: A comparative study on a grassland in the Walloon Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798232,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"To provide sufficient quantities of food and feed, farming systems have to overcome limiting factors such as the nutrient depletion of arable soils. Nitrogen being the main mineral element required for plant growth, has led to the extensive use of chemical fertilizers causing nitrogen pollution of the ecosystems. This field study investigates the use of biogas residues (BRs) as biofertilizers and their contribution to the mitigation of nitrate leaching in agricultural soils, while also demonstrating the polluting nature of chemical fertilizers. Nine different fertilization treatments classified in three schemes and two nitrogen doses were tested for three consecutive years on a grassland in the Walloon Region of Belgium. Residual soil mineral nitrogen, percentage contribution of treatments in residual nitrate and agronomic performance were assessed for each fertilization treatment. The results obtained showed significant differences on treatment and scheme level regarding nitrate accumulation in the soil, with chemical fertilizers posing the highest nitrate leaching risk. BRs did not cause nitrate accumulation in the soil, and were N rate and rainfall independent, while the chemical treatments indicated a cumulative tendency under high N rate and low precipitation. Forage yield did not demonstrate statistical differences on treatment and scheme level but varied with changing precipitation, while the maximum application rate suggested a plateau. Aboveground nitrogen content was significantly higher after the application of chemical fertilizers only in the first year, while all the chemical treatments indicated a dilution effect under elevated annual rainfall. Finally, the partial substitution of chemical fertilizers by raw digestate reduced the concentration of NO3- in the soil without having a negative impact on the yield and N content of the biomass. These results strongly advocate for the environmental benefits of BRs over chemical fertilizers and underline their suitability as biofertilizers and substitutes for chemical fertilizers in similar agricultural systems.",Arsenic removal and biomass reduction of As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata: Coupling ethanol extraction with anaerobic digestion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798231,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"Improper disposal of arsenic-rich biomass and the lack of efficient methods to treat it may cause contamination in the environment. We developed an efficient method for arsenic (As) removal and biomass reduction of As-rich biomass of the As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata by coupling ethanol extraction with anaerobic digestion. This study assessed As partitioning among the three phases (gas, liquid and solid) after anaerobic digestion of P. vittata biomass. Biomass with and without As was first extracted with ethanol. Ethanol extraction removed ~93% As, with remaining As concentration at 197 mg kg-1. The extracted biomass was then digested at 35 °C under anaerobic conditions for 35 d. Arsenic in the digested biomass was reduced by 89%, with remaining As concentration at 60 mg kg-1. In addition, anaerobic digestion reduced the biomass by 64-71% and decreased the volatile solids content from 94 to 15-18%. Methane production was 145 and 160 LNCH4/kgVS after 35 d for As-rich and control biomass, respectively. As a final step, As concentration in anaerobic digestate supernatant was reduced to 0.26 mg L-1 by As-Mg precipitation. Overall, coupling ethanol extraction with anaerobic digestion decreased As concentration in P. vittata biomass from 2665 to 60 mg kg-1, or by 98%. At this level (<100 mg As kg-1), P. vittata biomass can be considered a safe material based on USEPA regulations. Effective As removal from P. vittata biomass prior to disposal improves the phytoremediation process and lowers biomass transport and landfill disposal costs.",Assessment on applicability of common source tracking tools for particulate organic matter in controlled end member mixing experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798229,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"In this study, ideal mixing behaviors of the three commonly-used source tracking tools, which include fluorescence spectroscopy, stable isotope ratios, and lipid biomarkers, were evaluated in controlled particular organic matter (POM) mixtures of two contrasting end members e.g., soil and algae. In parallel, three different extraction methods based on water (WEOM) and two alkaline solutions were compared to identify the preferential pre-treatment option that leads to a good performance of the spectroscopic source tracking indices on the dissolved organic matter (DOM) extracted from the POM. Based on three evaluation criteria concerning the linearity of the relationships, the discrimination sensitivity, and the conservative mixing behavior of fourteen tested indices, the fluorescence proxies such as the relative distribution of the fluorescence components and the modified fluorescence index YFI of the WEOM were found to be reliable and robust indices for POM source tracking. The carbon stable isotope ratios of the POM samples exhibited an ideal mixing behavior even after the DOM extraction, while the biomarkers of sterols/stanols did not present a good linear and conservative behavior at similar conditions. In addition, the WEOM was identified as the preferred extraction method for the application of spectroscopic indices for POM source discrimination. This study provides a guideline to select the optimum indices for the POM source discrimination via the end member mixing analysis.",Gross N transformation rates and related N2O emissions in Chinese and UK agricultural soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798228,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"The properties of agricultural soils in various regions of the world are variable and can have a significant but poorly understood impact on soil nitrogen (N) transformations and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. For this reason, we undertook a study of gross N transformations and related N2O emissions in contrasting agricultural soils from China and the UK. Seven Chinese and three UK agricultural soils were collected for study using a 15N tracing approach. The soil pH ranged from 5.4 to 8.7, with three acidic soils collected from Jinjing, Lishu and Boghall; one neutral soil collected from Changshu, and the other six alkaline soils collected from Quzhou, Zhangye, Changwu, Jinzhong, Boxworth and Stetchworth. Our results showed that the main N transformation processes were oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3-) (ONH4), and mineralization of organic N to NH4+. The gross autotrophic nitrification rates calculated in the three acidic soils were between 0.25 and 4.15 mg N kg-1 d-1, which were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those in the remaining neutral and alkaline soils ranging from 6.94 to 14.43 mg N kg-1 d-1. Generally, soil pH was positively correlated (p < 0.001) with gross autotrophic nitrification rate and cumulative N2O emissions, indicating that soil pH was an important factor regulating autotrophic nitrification and N2O emissions. There was also a significant positive correlation between the gross autotrophic nitrification rate and cumulative N2O emissions, highlighting the importance of this process for producing N2O emissions in these agricultural soils under aerobic conditions. Gross NH4+ immobilization rates were very low in most soils except for the Jinjing soil with the lowest pH. In conclusion, the gross autotrophic nitrification rates and related N2O emissions were controlled by soil pH irrespectively of the soil's origin in these agricultural soils.","Sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in a mixed land use catchment (Exe, UK).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798227,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"Many catchment management schemes in the UK have focussed on peatland restoration to improve ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, water quality and biodiversity. The effect of these schemes on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux is critical in understanding peatland carbon budgets as well as the implications for drinking water treatment. In many catchments, however, peatland areas are not the only source of DOC, meaning that their significance at the full catchment scale is unclear. In this paper we have evaluated the importance of different land uses as sources of DOC by combining three datasets obtained from the Exe catchment, UK. The first dataset comprises a weekly monitoring record at three sites for six years, the second, a monthly monitoring record of 25 sites in the same catchment for one year, and the third, an assessment of DOC export from litter and soil carbon stocks. Our results suggest that DOC concentration significantly increased from the peaty headwaters to the mixed land-use areas (ANOVA F = 12.52, p < 0.001, df = 2), leading to higher flux estimates at the downstream sites. We present evidence for three possible explanations: firstly, that poor sampling of high flows may lead to underestimation of DOC flux, second, that there are significant sources of DOC besides the peatland headwaters, and finally, that biological- and photo-degradation decreases the influence of upstream DOC sources. Our results provide evidence both for the targeting of catchment management in peatland areas as well as the need to consider DOC from agricultural and forested areas of the catchment.",Process stability and comparative rDNA/rRNA community analyses in an anaerobic membrane bioreactor with silicon carbide ceramic membrane applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798226,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"This study evaluated the feasibility of using a silicon carbide (SiC) anaerobic ceramic membrane bioreactor (AnCMBR) to co-manage domestic wastewater (DWW) and food waste recycling wastewater (FRW).

The organic removal efficiency was 93.5 ± 3.7% over the operational period. Methane production increased significantly after sludge re-seeding at OLR 3. rDNA and rRNA microbial results showed that the active archaeal community was affected by sludge re-seeding, whereas the active bacterial community was not, indicating that a shift in the active archaeal community was responsible for the increased methane production. Our results thus suggest that SiC-AnCMBRs are a promising option for co-managing DWW and FRW.","Estimation of work-related injury and economic burden attributable to heat stress in Guangzhou, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798225,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"Climate change has exacerbated the health effects of high ambient temperatures on occupational health and safety; however, to what extent heat stress can induce workplace injuries and economic costs is poorly studied.

With consideration of CO2 effects, rice yield during the 2030s, 2060s, and 2090s would increase by 5.4%, 10.0%, and 11.6% under RCP4.5, and by 6.4%, 12.9%, and 15.6% under RCP8.5, respectively. The rice-growing season would be shortened by 2 to 5 weeks in the future. Overall, the future climate would have positive effects on rice yields in the NECP. Although uncertainties in our study on the impact of climate change on rice might arise from the choice of crop model and GCMs, the results are important for informing policy makers and developing appropriate strategies to improve rice productivity in China.",Reduction of Cu(II) and simultaneous production of acetate from inorganic carbon by Serratia Marcescens biofilms and plankton cells in microbial electrosynthesis systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798222,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 23,"Simultaneous Cu(II) reduction (6.42 ± 0.02 mg/L/h), acetate production (1.13 ± 0.02 mg/L/h) from inorganic carbon (i.e., CO2 sequestration), and hydrogen evolution (0.0315 ± 0.0005 m3/m3/d) were achieved in a Serratia marcescens Q1 catalyzed microbial electrosynthesis system (MES). The biofilms released increasing amounts of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) with a higher compositional diversity and stronger Cu(II) complexation, compared to the plankton cells, at higher Cu(II) concentrations (up to 80 mg/L) and circuital currents (cathodic potential of -900 mV vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)). Moreover, the biofilms reduced Cu(II) to Cu(0) more effectively than the plankton cells. At Cu(II) concentrations below 80 mg/L, the dehydrogenase activity in the biofilms was higher than in the plankton cells, and increased with circuital current, which was converse to the lower activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and antioxidative glutathione (GSH) in the biofilms than the plankton cells, although all these physiological activities were positively correlated with the concentration of Cu(II). This is the first study that evaluates the EPS constituents and the physiological activities of the biofilms and the plankton cells in the MESs, that favors the production of acetate from CO2 sequestration and the simultaneous reduction of Cu(II) from organics-barren waters contaminated with heavy metals."

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 18,"Triamcinolone acetonide (TCA) abuse in cosmetics is a common phenomenon. A rapid lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (ICA) was developed for the quantitative detection of TCA using a probe based on upconversion luminescence nanoparticles. Lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were synthesized in a system comprising water and ethylene glycol, and a silicon dioxide layer was covered at the carboxyl site. A binding site protection strategy was used to decrease the background signal of UCNPs-ICA. Using dexamethasone derivative as a coating antigen, the optimal UCNPs-ICA exhibits good dynamic linear detection for TCA in the range 1.0-100 ng mL-1 with a median inhibitory concentration of 9.8 ng mL-1. The detection limits for TCA in a cosmetic sample are 20 μg kg-1. The pretreatment of samples only needs dilution with water, suggesting the assay can quantitate TCA on-site using a portable upconversion luminescence reader with a cumulative analysis time of only 10 min.","Development of a new automatic on-site detector of pesticides in natural waters by photo induced fluorescence, application to three phenylurea and benzoylurea herbicide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798210,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 19,"Prototypes of on-site automatic photo induced fluorescence detectors of pesticide in natural waters are set up and applied for the determination of the benzoyl- and phenylurea pesticides, namely fluometuron, monolinuron and diflubenzuron. As these pesticides present no native fluorescence the set up system use the photo conversion under UV irradiation of these pesticides into highly fluorescent photoproducts. A first system, called AUTOPIF, (evolution the commercial AQUAPOD system) is develop using a detection via a diode array spectrometer. To improve the sensitivity of the method, a second system, called AUTOPIF+, is developed with a more resolute spectrometer and an intensified CCD camera detection. Analytical applications were carried out in aqueous solution and detected on line with the AUTOPIF and AUTOPIF+ system. The calibration curves are linear over one order of magnitude, and the limits of detection are in the μg mL-1 range. The analytical performances of these methods for the determination of the three pesticides are satisfactory in comparison to other classical PIF methods published for the determination of phenylurea pesticides in aqueous solutions. Our results show that the AUTOPIF and AUTOPIF+ methods are versatile, sensible and can be easily applied as an alert system to detect pollutant residues in naturals waters over a threshold value.",Quantification of eight benzodiazepines in human breastmilk and plasma by liquid-liquid extraction and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry: Application to evaluation of alprazolam transfer into breastmilk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798209,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 03 19,"Breastfeeding is strongly encouraged for infant and maternal health. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are widely prescribed drugs for symptoms, such as anxiety and insomnia, which many women could experience during the postpartum period. However, limited information is currently available to evaluate the transfer of different BZDs into breastmilk. In order to assess the proprieties of this medication during breastfeeding, robust and sensitive analytical methods to quantify BZDs are required. For this purpose, we developed a method for quantification of BZDs, including alprazolam, bromazepam, clonazepam, clotiazepam, etizolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, and CM7116 (a metabolite of ethyl loflazepate), in human breastmilk and plasma using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Sample preparation was performed by a simple liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with ethyl acetate. For sample preparation of CM7116, the pretreatment process to completely obtain the metabolite was added before the LLE step. The BZDs were separated by a C18 column using a gradient elution of acetonitrile in aqueous ammonium acetate solution, and were detected in the positive ion electrospray mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) in breastmilk ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 ng/mL, and those in plasma ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day precision, and accuracy of data were assessed and found to be acceptable. The developed method was successfully applied to measure the concentration of alprazolam in breastmilk and plasma, which were donated by a lactating woman who had been regularly treated with alprazolam. Milk to plasma (M/P) ratios were calculated as 0.52 (before oral administration) and 0.49 (2 h after administration) 3 days after delivery. The M/P ratio 1 month after delivery was calculated as 0.41 (2 h after administration). We estimated that the relative infant dose (RID) values of alprazolam ranged from 3.11 to 4.61%.",Systematic screening and characterization of prototype constituents and metabolites of triterpenoid saponins of Caulopphyllum robustum Maxim using UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap MS after oral administration in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798208,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 03 19,"Triterpenoid saponins are the main bioactive components in Caulopphyllum Robustum Maxim (CRM), and they have been reported to have extensive pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-tumor effects. Cauloside C, Cauloside D, Leonticin D and Cauloside H are the main active chemical constituents of CRM in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, their metabolic processes and products remain unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the metabolic components and metabolic pathways of total saponins after oral administration of CRM effective part (CRME) in rats. In this work, we collected plasma, bile, urine and feces of rats at different sampling time points after intragastric administration. The saponins and reference substances were separated from CRME and analyzed via Thermo Scientific™ Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Orbitrap Elite Combined High resolution Mass Spectrometry. According to the structural characteristics of the compounds in CRM, the pyrolysis behavior of various components was inferred in the negative ion mode. Twenty-two components were found in rat plasma, bile, urine and stool; among these components, there were 8 prototypes and 14 metabolites. Seven prototypes and 8 metabolites were found in rat plasma; no prototype and 6 metabolites were found in bile; 5 prototypes and 8 metabolites were found in urine; and 4 prototypes and 9 metabolites were found in stool. The metabolites include deglycosylation products, sapogenin products, sulfides, and glucuronide conjugates. The same metabolites were also found in biological samples, and these products may be important metabolic pathways of triterpene saponins in rats. The current findings clarified the metabolic pathways of the main active ingredients in CRME and further elucidated the anti-RA drug-responsive substance basis of CRM.",Study of alpha-amylase and gold nanoparticles interaction at two different temperatures through molecular dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798207,Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,2019 03 22,"The interaction of alpha-amylase with gold nanoparticles was studied at the two different temperatures of 25 and 75 °C through molecular dynamics simulation. To this end, 3-nm diameter spherical gold nanoparticles were designed. According to root mean square deviation results, at a high temperature, enzyme stability decreased in the absence of nanoparticles and increased in the presence of nanoparticles. Root mean square fluctuation results obtained for alpha-amylase residues indicated that the flexibility of residues 150-160 was affected more by the temperature in the presence and absence of nanoparticles. In addition, loop and helix regions in the secondary structure were affected more by the temperature. Results of enzyme contact maps in the designed systems showed that, in the absence of nanoparticles, a great number of contacts between residues were removed at high temperatures. The radius of gyration showed that the contact between the residues of amylase were removed in the absence of nanoparticles due to the enzyme expansion. Also Molecular dynamics simulation of α-amylase was performed in the presence of fifty 3- to 7-carbon sugar molecules at 25 and 75 °C. The results showed that the structure of α-amylase beta sheets is not affected by sugars. Docking of 3- to 7-carbon sugars with amylase sampled from simulations revealed that the affinity of sugars to the enzyme decreased at high temperatures in the absence of nanoparticles, while the presence of nanoparticles increased the affinity. Docking also showed that van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions contributed more than hydrogen interactions to the sugars-amylase interactions.",Poring over chromosomes: mitotic nuclear pore complex segregation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798206,Current opinion in cell biology,2019 06 10,"Eukaryotic cells rely on flux of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm for growth and survival. Bidirectional transport is achieved through Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) embedded in the Nuclear Envelope (NE). NPC proteins perform other cellular functions during mitosis, chromatin organization, DNA repair and gene regulation. Dysregulation of NPC number, or defects in their structure and function, are linked to numerous diseases but how NPCs are faithfully inherited during mitosis is poorly understood. In this review, we discuss recent insights to mechanisms of mammalian mitotic NPC segregation and NPC assembly as well as mitotic NPC inheritance via the mitotic chromatin located NPC protein Nup2 in Aspergillus nidulans. We suggest mitotic Nup2 chromatin-based mechanisms could also operate in vertebrate cells.",Formation of 107Cd radionuclide impurities during 18F production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798205,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,"Cd isotopes (107Cd and 109Cd) are generated from the silver target body during the bombardment of [18O]water in the routine production of 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) for PET (Positron Emission Tomography) diagnosis. Cadmium isotopes contribute significantly to the total activity of generated impurities and, due to being potentially radiotoxic to living organisms, they should be effectively reduced from FDG to prevent accidental injection of even small concentrations into patients. Purification of the final [18F]FDG can be based on a set of columns, fulfilling various functions in the cleaning process. To assess cadmium impurities and the efficiency of the purification process, a low background gamma spectrometry system with high resolution has been applied. Even activity of 3.5 kBq and 290 kBq has been measured on QMA (Sep-Pak Light Accell Plus QMA) columns for 109Cd and 107Cd isotopes, respectively. 107Cd activity in the five column set was higher than that of 109Cd. The rate of 18F production process was about 1 GBq/min, while that of 107Cd and 109Cd radionuclides was about 4.2 kBq/min and 50 Bq/min respectively. The same purification efficiency of both isotopes has been obtained at each step of the process. The production rate of 107Cd and 109Cd radionuclides was insignificant compared to the 18F production rate. Therefore [18F]FDG final product for use in injections before PET diagnostics was efficiently purified from cadmium radionuclide impurities.",Synthesis and sorption potential study of Al2O3ZrO2CeO2 composite material for removal of some radionuclides from radioactive waste effluent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798204,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,"Increasing in the use of various radioactive elements in many applications over the past few decades has accompanied with an increase radioactive waste.

The result showed that removal of 94%, 44% and 8.5% for 134Cs, 90Sr and 90Y, respectively. The experimental results are fitted with pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Isotherm models of sorption process are calculated and it can be concluded that the Langmuir model more fitted than Freundlich model. The calculated thermodynamic functions exhibited that sorption behavior of 134Cs and 90Sr ions are spontaneous in nature and the positive value of ΔHo value indicates that the sorption is endothermic. The results demonstrated that the % sorption of 134Cs(I) and 90Sr(II) is sharply decreased in the presence of coexisting ions (Na, Mg and Cr) using nanoparticles of Al2O3 ZrO2CeO2.",Variability of hydrogeological parameters in the environment of new nuclear power plant in Lithuania.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798203,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,"The groundwater flow and radionuclide (3H, 14C and 137Cs) transport model was performed for the model domain of the experiment site near Ignalina nuclear power plant (INPP) in Lithuania assuming that the radionuclides will reach groundwater straight after the new NPP operation begins. The task of the study is to predict the transportation of radionuclide from the hypothetical reactor of the new NPP and perform a sensitivity analysis in order to predict the effects of radiation on the environment. The main focus of attention was the evaluation of ranges of the parameters, such as effective porosity, hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity, mostly influencing the assessment results. The obtained results show that the activity concentration of the modelled radionuclides strongly depends on the hydrogeological properties of the aquifer. The largest variability of activity concentration is established for the radiocarbon determined by the dispersivity and hydraulic conductivity.","Doses in eye lens, thyroid, and gonads, due to scattered radiation, during a CT radiodiagnosis study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798202,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,"X-ray images used for radio-diagnosis are very useful to evaluate the progress of a treatment or to have a better diagnosis.

In this work the dose in eye lenses, thyroid, and gonads of a solid water phantom was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters, while a Computer Tomography of the torso was obtained. With the measured absorbed dose the effective dose was calculated. Thus, the effective dose in the eye lens, thyroid, and gonads is approximately 57, 214 and 9 μSv respectively. The largest effective dose was on that area located nearest to the region where the radiation is scattered."

The possible binding of PFASs to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and nuclear receptors raises concerns that PFASs may impact cholesterol levels in human. In this study, the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were employed to address the temporal trend for PFAS concentrations in biomonitoring and associations between cholesterol levels and PFAS exposure. Compared to the PFAS levels in 2003-2004, the median perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) levels in human serum in 2013-2014 decreased from 3.7 to 1.8 ng/mL, 19.2-4.7 ng/mL, 1.7 ng/mL to 1.3 ng/mL and 0.8 ng/mL to 0.6 ng/mL, respectively.

The properties of DOM in road runoff can be greatly changed by grassy swale (GS) treatment, which influences the complexation of CBZ with DOM. Spectroscopic techniques were employed to explore the different binding properties between CBZ and DOM, and to understand the migration and biogeochemistry of CBZ. The two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS)demonstrated that effluent DOM displayed more binding sites for CBZ than influent DOM, and the binding sequencing of CBZ with DOM fluorophores can be greatly influenced by GS treatment. The results also suggest that protein-like materials exhibit higher log KM values than other fluorescent components, indicating that fluorescent protein-like materials play a crucial role in the biogeochemical behavior of CBZ. Meanwhile, the log KM values showed a remarkable increase after GS treatment. GS treatment can also remove most fluorescent DOM, reducing the risk of CBZ in the water environment.","Microcystin - LR exposure causes cardiorespiratory impairments and tissue oxidative damage in trahira, Hoplias malabaricus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798187,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 16,"This study investigated the effect of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) on in vivo cardiorespiratory function and on tissue biomarkers of oxidative stress in gills and liver of the trahira, a neotropical freshwater fish. Trahira were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 µg MC-LR.kg-1 body mass or a saline, with the toxic effects of MC-LR then evaluated after 48 h. Rates of oxygen uptake (V̇O2) did not differ significantly between Control and the exposed group (Mcys), but exposure to MC-LR significantly reduced O2 extraction in the Mcys group at all O2 tensions. This was associated with higher gill ventilation volume (V̇G) in the Mcys group at all O2 tensions except 140 and 120 mmHg, and a higher tidal volume (VT) of the Mcys group at all tensions except 140 mmHg. Heart rate was also higher in the Mcys group, significantly so at an O2 tension of 40 mmHg. In the liver of trahira, exposure to MC-LR has significant effects on antioxidant defense systems, inducing a significant increase in the activity of the (GPx) glutathione peroxidase enzyme (100%) and in the reduced glutathione (GSH) content (70%) compared to the control group, but no effects on superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes. The liver showed no oxidative damage, when measured as lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and protein carbonyl (PC) content. In the gills SOD and GPx enzyme activity increased significantly in the Mcys group (98% and 73% respectively) compared to the controls, although GSH, CAT and GST did not differ between groups. There was also no significant difference in GSH in this tissue. Levels of lipid peroxidation in the gills were 53% higher in the Mcys group, although carbonyl protein levels did not differ. In conclusion, these data show that MC-LR leads to development of hyperventilation and increased activity of the detoxification system and that this species was able to compensate the deleterious effects of microcystin on its vital functions. The antioxidant defense in the liver was able to contain the propagation of LPO and prevent the oxidation of proteins, although the gills of the fishes exposed to MC-LR were not able to contain the formation of reactive oxygen species and LPO, which led to the establishment of oxidative stress which impaired gill function.",The association between lead and cadmium co-exposure and renal dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798186,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 16,"Both cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) exposure can induce kidney damage. However, the effects of combined exposure to Cd and Pb on renal function at environmental levels have not been fully clarified. In this study we investigated the renal function in a Chinese population co-exposed to Cd and Pb. A total of 331 subjects (215 women and 116 men), living in either a control or a polluted area, were included in this study. Cd and Pb in blood and urine (BCd, BPb, UCd, and UPb), and kidney effect markers including urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (UNAG) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were determined, and the association between exposure markers and renal effect biomarkers were analyzed. The exposure levels in the polluted area were significantly higher than in the control area (all p < 0.01). The eGFR of subjects in the polluted area was decreased compared with that in the control area (p < 0.01). The subjects with high BCd/BPb (BCd ≥ 2 μg/L, BPb ≥ 100 μg/L) or high UCd/UPb (UCd ≥ 3 μg/g creatinine, UPb ≥ 10 μg/g creatinine) showed higher UNAG and UALB levels compared with other subgroups (p < 0.01). The probability of having elevated UNAG in subjects with high BCd/BPb was greater than those with low BCd/BPb [odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4-4.7), low BCd/high BPb (OR =3.1, 95% CI: 1.4-6.6), and high BCd/low BPb (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 0.9-3.2). The OR of subjects with low UCd and high UPb, high UCd and low UPb, and high UCd/UPb were 2.9 (95% CI: 1.4-5.7), 3.3 (95% CI: 1.5-7.2), and 7.7 (95% CI: 4.0-14.7), respectively, compared with those with low UCd/UPb. The risk of decrease in eGFR was also higher in subjects with high UCd/UPb than for those with low UCd/UPb (OR = 7.2, 95% CI: 0.8-62.2). Our data demonstrate that Cd and Pb exposure, alone or in combination, are associated with renal impairment. In addition, co-exposure to Pb and Cd propagates the renal tubular dysfunction compared with Cd or Pb exposure alone.","Antioxidant, antiapoptotic, antigenotoxic, and hepatic ameliorative effects of L-carnitine and selenium on cadmium-induced hepatotoxicity and alterations in liver cell structure in male mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798185,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 16,"L-carnitine (LC) and selenium (Se) have significant protective and antioxidant effects on several tissues. Cadmium (Cd), widely used in some industries and emitted from fossil fuels, is a heavy metal having a number of side effects, including hepatotoxicity. This study aims to assess the ameliorative function of both LC and SeCl4 on cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced liver toxicity. In total, 70 male mice included in this study were allocated to seven groups: control, CdCl2, LC, SeCl4, CdCl2 plus SeCl4, CdCl2 plus LC, CdCl2 plus SeCl4 and LC groups. Hepatic aminotransferase (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine transaminase [ALT]) activity and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α] levels, as well as the antioxidant biomarkers (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione reductase [GRx], glutathione-S-transferase [GST] and catalase [CAT], were examined. Histological and transmission electron microscopic [TEM] variations in the liver were used as indicators of liver damage after the administration of CdCl2-alone or CdCl2 with LC, SeCl4, or both. Genotoxic effects of CdCl2 were also evaluated and the possible roles of SeCl4 and/or LC on the expression of the antioxidant enzymes were studied. Results showed that administration of LC and SeCl4 decreased CdCl2-induced increase in ALT and AST levels and reduced oxidative stress to normal levels. In addition, LC combined with SeCl4 had a highly synergistic effect and elevated significantly the enzymatic antioxidants and decreased lipid peroxidation levels compared with those in the CdCl2-treated group. It is clear from the data that both LC and SeCl4 inhibit liver injury and improve the redox state in mice.",Metabolism of diethyl phthalate (DEP) and identification of degradation intermediates by Pseudomonas sp.

Fe3+ could promote the degradation ability of DNE-S1 to DEP probably by over-expression of the gene phthalate dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (ophB) and phthalate dioxygenase ferredoxin reductase (ophA4). The degradation rate of DEP (500 mg L-1 at 12 h) increased by 14.5% in the presence of Fe3+. Cu2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+ showed an inhibiting effect on the degradation performance of the strain and could alter the cellular morphology, surface area and volume of DNE-S1. Three degradation intermediates, namely ethyl methyl phthalate (EMP), dimethyl phthalate (DMP), and phthalic acid (PA), were detected in the biodegradation of DEP, and the biochemical pathway of DEP degradation was proposed. This study provides new information on the biochemical pathways and the responsible genes involved in DEP degradation.","Dosimetric evaluation of individuals to 238U series, 232Th series and 40K radionuclides present in Brazilian ornamental rocks using computational simulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798183,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 16,"Granites are widely used in construction and they may be potential sources of ionizing radiation, due to the presence of radionuclides such as 40Kand decay products from 238Useries and 232Thseries. These radionuclides occur in the minerals constituting the rocks. To evaluate the doses in humans exposed to 40K, and decay products from 238Useries and 232Thseries γ radiation, a room with dimensions of 4.0 × 5.0 × 2.8 m3, with uniformly distributed radiation source on the floor of granitic rocks, was computationally modeled. Adult individuals were represented in the virtual scenario by two virtual anthropomorphic phantoms FASH3 and MASH3, incorporated simultaneously in the software MCNPX 2.7.0. The mean energy deposited on each organ and tissue of FASH3 and MASH3 phantoms was determined using the MCNPX F6 tally (MeV/g/particle), while the photon flux within the room was calculated with the MCNPX F4 tally (MeV/cm2/particle). The organs that obtained the highest conversion coefficients CC[HT](Sv/Gy) were the red bone marrow (0.94), skin (0.90), breast (0.81) and bladder (0.73) for the FASH3; skin (0.89), gonads (0.88), breast (0.79) and bladder (0.70) for the MASH3. The simulated air absorbed dose rates varied between 23.4 (11%) and 25.8 (12%) nGy/h, and the annual dose rates were 0.10 (6%) and 0.11 (6%) mSv/year. These results presented acceptable statistical uncertainties and they are in agreement with the literature. Fluency of photons pointed to the central region of the room floor as the place of greatest exposure. The results showed that the organs closer to the radiation source had the highest deposited energy values. Based on the annual effective dose data obtained, it was possible to note that the values are within the literature. We believe that the methodology used will allow the investigation of any ornamental material that emits natural radiation.",Mechanical behaviours and mass transport properties of bone-mimicking scaffolds consisted of gyroid structures manufactured using selective laser melting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798182,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 03 27,"Bone scaffolds created in porous structures manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM) are widely used in tissue engineering, since the elastic moduli of the scaffolds are easily adjusted according to the moduli of the tissues, and the large surfaces the scaffolds provide are beneficial to cell growth. SLM-built gyroid structures composed of 316L stainless steel have demonstrated superior properties such as good corrosion resistance, strong biocompatibility, self-supported performance, and excellent mechanical properties. In this study, gyroid structures of different volume fraction were modelled and manufactured using SLM; the mechanical properties of the structures were then investigated under quasi-static compression loads. The elastic moduli and yield stresses of the structures were calculated from stress-strain diagrams, which were developed by conducting quasi-static compression tests. In order to estimate the discrepancies between the designed and as-produced gyroid structures, optical microscopy and micro-CT scanner were used to observe the structures' micromorphology. Since good fluidness is conducive to the transport of nutrients, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) values were used to investigate the pressure and flow velocity of the channel of the three kinds of gyroid structures. The results show that the sizes of the as-produced structures were larger than their computer aided design (CAD) sizes, but the manufacturing errors are within a relatively stable range. The elastic moduli and yield stresses of the structures improved as their volume fractions increased. Gyroid structure can match the mechanical properties of human bone by changing the porosity of scaffold. The process of compression failure showed that 316L gyroid structures manufactured using SLM demonstrated high degrees of toughness. The results obtained from CFD simulation showed that gyroid structures have good fluidity, which has an accelerated effect on the fluid in the middle of the channel, and it is suitable for transport nutrients. Therefore, we could predict the scaffold's permeability by conducting CFD simulation to ensure an appropriate permeability before the scaffold being manufactured. SLM-built gyroid structures that composed of 316L stainless steel were suitable to be designed as bone scaffolds in terms of mechanical properties and mass-transport properties, and had significant promise.",Mechanical behavior of restorative dental composites under various loading conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798181,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 03 27,"Mechanical engineering and its scientific principles constitute an essential core in medical science. Currently, different composite resins are widely used as restorative dental materials. However, their lack of adequate strength and toughness has led to research that is aimed at improving the mechanical properties of dental composites. In the present study, the behavior of three different dental materials is investigated under static and dynamic loading conditions. In the experimental tests, a split Hopkinson pressure bar is utilized which corresponds to the most commonly used experimental setup for examining material behavior under a high rate of loading. The examined dental composites experience impacts during their service life and also during car accidents or sport injuries. Hence, in the study, impact loading is modeled in an experiment. A series of compression tests is conducted from low to high strain rates up to 40s-1, and the dynamic elastic moduli of three different dental composites are measured. Furthermore, studies on the compressed surface of the dental composite specimens are performed to improve the analysis with respect to the hardness of the materials. The responses of the examined composites to dynamic loadings verify the impact resistance of the materials. The results indicate the load-carrying capabilities of the dental composites. These results can be used for materials development and existing computational models."

Clinical,2019 06 15,"Brain imaging studies have revealed that functional and structural brain connectivity in the so-called triple network (i.e., default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN) and central executive network (CEN)) are consistently altered in schizophrenia. However, similar changes have also been found in patients with major depressive disorder, prompting the question of specific triple network signatures for the two disorders. In this study, we proposed Supervised Convex Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SCNMF) to extract distributed multi-modal brain patterns. These patterns distinguish schizophrenia and major depressive disorder in a latent low-dimensional space of the triple brain network. Specifically, 21 patients of schizophrenia and 25 patients of major depressive disorder were assessed by T1-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and resting-state functional MRIs. Individual structural and functional connectivity networks, based on pre-defined regions of the triple network were constructed, respectively. Afterwards, SCNMF was employed to extract the discriminative patterns. Experiments indicate that SCNMF allows extracting the low-rank discriminative patterns between the two disorders, achieving a classification accuracy of 82.6% based on the extracted functional and structural abnormalities with support vector machine. Experimental results show the specific brain patterns for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder that are multi-modal, complex, and distributed in the triple network. Parts of the prefrontal cortex including superior frontal gyri showed variation between patients with schizophrenia and major depression due to structural properties. In terms of functional properties, the middle cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and cingulate cortex were the most discriminative regions.",Characterization of white matter changes along fibers by automated fiber quantification in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798166,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 06 15,"Brain white matter fiber bundles in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have abnormalities not usually seen in unaffected subjects. Ideal algorithm of the localization-specific properties in white matter integrity might reveal the changes of tissue properties varying along each tract, while previous studies only detected the mean DTI parameters of each fiber. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these abnormalities of nerve fiber tracts are localized to specific regions of the tracts or spread throughout and to analyze which of the examined fiber tracts are involved in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we utilized VBA, TBSS as well as AFQ together to comprehensively investigate the white matter fiber impairment on 25 CE patients, 29 MCI patients and 34 normal control (NC) subjects. Two tract profiles, fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were extracted to evaluate the white matter integrity at 100 locations along each of 20 fiber tracts and then we validated the results with 27 CE patients, 21 MCI patients and 22 NC from the ADNI cohort. Also, we compare the AFQ with VBA and TBSS in our cohort. In comparison with NC, AD patients showed widespread FA reduction in 25% (5 /20) and MD increase in 65%(13/20) of the examined fiber tracts. The MCI patients showed a regional FA reduction in 5% (1/20) of the examined fiber tracts (right cingulum cingulate) and MD increase in 5%(1/20) of the examined fiber tracts (left arcuate fasciculus). Among these changed tracts, only the right cingulum cingulate showed widespread disruption of myelin or/and fiber axons in MCI and aggravated deterioration in AD, findings supported by FA/MD changes both by the mean and FA changes by point wise methods and TBSS. And the AFQ findings from ADNI cohort showed some similarity with our cohort, especially in the pointwise comparison of MD profiles between AD vs NC. Furthermore, the pattern of white matter abnormalities was different across neuronal fiber tracts; for example, the MCI and AD patients showed similar FA reduction in the middle part of the right cingulum cingulate, and the anterior part were not damaged. However, the left arcuate fasciculus showed MD elevation located at the temporal part of the fibers in the MCI patients and expanding to the temporal and middle part of the fibers in AD patients. So, the AFQ may be an alternative complementary method of VBA and TBSS, and may provide new insights into white matter degeneration in MCI and its association with AD.",Disrupted left fusiform response to print in beginning kindergartners is associated with subsequent reading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798165,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 06 15,"Dyslexia is a common neurobiological disorder in which a child fails to acquire typical word reading skills despite adequate opportunity and intelligence. The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region within the left fusiform gyrus that specializes for print over the course of reading acquisition and is often hypoactivated in individuals with dyslexia. It is currently unknown whether atypicalities in this brain region are already present in kindergarten children who will subsequently develop dyslexia. Here, we measured fMRI activation in response to letters and false fonts in bilateral fusiform gyrus in children with and without risk for dyslexia (defined by family history or low scores on assessments of pre-reading skills, such as phonological awareness). We then followed these children longitudinally through the end of second grade to evaluate whether brain activation patterns in kindergarten were related to second-grade reading outcomes. Compared to typical readers who exhibited no risk factors for reading impairment in kindergarten, there was significant hypoactivation to both letters and false-fonts in the left fusiform gyrus in at-risk children who subsequently developed reading impairment, but not in at-risk children who developed typical reading skills. There were no significant differences in letter- or false-font responses in the right fusiform gyrus among the groups. The finding that hypoactivation to print in the VWFA is present in children who subsequently develop reading impairment even prior to the onset of formal reading instruction suggests that atypical responses to print play an early role in the development of reading impairments such as dyslexia.",Motor unit recruitment in myopathy: The myopathic EMG reconsidered.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798164,Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,2019 05 07,"Motor unit recruitment is abnormal in myopathies. We have addressed this subject by recording motor unit potentials (MUPs) using a standard concentric needle electrode in tibialis anterior muscles of clinically normal strength in a group of patients with myopathy (15 with myositis and 4 with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy Type 1). In each recording site, a minimal voluntary contraction was sought in order to activate only 2 MUPs. At least 5 pairs of MUPs were recorded in each muscle. We analysed the recruitment rate of the first activated MUP and the mean consecutive difference (MCD) of firing frequency between the individual MUPs of each recruited pair. Results were compared with 30 healthy control subjects. In myopathy the first recorded MUs fired at similar rates to controls (8.2 vs 8.0 Hz, respectively), but the MCD of the firing rate difference between the first two recruited MUPs was less than in controls (median difference 1.78 Hz vs median difference 2.47 Hz, p = 0.02). This change suggests increased lower motor neuron excitability as a functional adaptation, since muscle strength was normal in the studied muscles. These findings are consistent with spinal cord adaptation to the functional changes associated with myopathic muscle disease, although a primary muscle fibre feedback sensing mechanism could also be involved.",Adsorption of diclofenac sodium on bilayer amino-functionalized cellulose nanocrystals/chitosan composite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798163,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"Residual diclofenac sodium (DS) in the environment is harmful to human health. A promising method for DS removal is the use of adsorbents functionalized with amino groups that can form an ionic bond with the carboxyl group of DS at a suitable pH. In this work, a novel composite adsorbent composed of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and chitosan (CS) has been synthesized and functionalized by ethylenediamine (ED) in both layers. Characterization methods, including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were used to confirm the morphology and synthetic mechanism of the double- amino-functionalized adsorbent. Based on the optimization of adsorption conditions and modeling of the adsorption mechanism, the DS adsorption process on CNC-ED@CS-ED involves chemical adsorption, and the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from the Langmuir model is 444.44 mg/g. CNC-ED@CS-ED exhibits good adsorption capacity and high sustainability; thus, it is a promising composite material for the removal of DS from wastewater.",Plasmonics driven engineered pasteurizers for solar water disinfection (SWADIS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798162,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"Rampant environmental pollution is the most ubiquitous concern of current world. A sustainable panacea to overarching contamination of water-borne pathogens demands cheap and eco-friendly oriented research. Solar energy is effortlessly accessible in most of the weather conditions and can be used for water decontamination. In this context, Solar Water Disinfection (SWADIS) appears to be feasible solution. Herein we are reporting newly developed Carbon nanoparticles (CNP) which shows absorption of light in broad region extending from Ultraviolet-Visible (UV) to Infrared Spectroscopy (IR). This CNP with pronounced photothermal effect has been used for SWADIS. Photothermal effect of plasmonic nanomaterials has massive potential and has exploited for disinfection of water. Moving towards practical device design we have developed an efficient CNP based Multipurpose Solar Pasteurizer (MSP) and Nano-Solar Pasteurizer (NSP) which can efficiently perform the SWADIS. Result shows that upon irradiation under natural solar radiation pasteurizers can thermally inactivate the bacteria. The system proves to be able to perform 100% bacterial inactivation in sunny days. We also conducted bacterial inactivation experiments by simulating 106 CFU mL-1 concentration of E. coli in water to mimic field conditions. Results are evident that pasteurizers achieved 100% bacterial inactivation within period of ˜45 min under sunlight.",Modification of IL-24 by tumor penetrating peptide iRGD enhanced its antitumor efficacy against non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798161,International immunopharmacology,2019 04 01,"Interleukin-24 (IL-24) is known for its tumor suppressive activity and the selective induction of apoptosis of numerous human cancer cells, while demonstrating little harm to normal cells. However, poor tumor penetration remains a key problem for the efficacy of IL-24 as a treatment. The iRGD (CRGDK/RGPDC) is a novel tumor-specific peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. To enhance the tumor-penetrating effects of IL-24, the iRGD peptide was fused with the C-terminal domain of IL-24 to generate a novel recombinant protein, IL-24-iRGD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effects of IL-24-iRGD in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that IL-24-iRGD increased the production of IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ from human peripheral blood monocyte (PBMC), and suppressed cell growth of A549 in vitro. Then A549 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and these tumor-bearing mice were immunized with IL-24, IL-24-iRGD or PBS via the tail vein. The IL-24 and IL-24-iRGD-treated groups exhibited tumor growth inhibition rates of 26.2% and 59.1%, respectively, when compared with the PBS-treated group. Protein penetration into tumors was analyzed by immunofluorescence, cell apoptosis was examined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed by immuno-histochemical staining. The results demonstrated that IL-24-iRGD induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of A549 cells to a significantly greater extent when compared with IL-24 treatment alone. It may provide an improved strategy for antitumor therapy and the clinical treatment of NSCLC.",Magnolol prevents ossified tendinopathy by inhibiting PGE2-induced osteogenic differentiation of TDSCs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798160,International immunopharmacology,2019 04 01,"Magnolol is a compound that is extracted from magnolia, is used in Chinese medicine and is a type of lignan. Magnolol has various anti-inflammation, anti-proliferation and pro-autophagy effects. Ossified tendinopathy affects many athletes and people with repetitive tendon injuries. Ossified tendinopathy is a tremendous economic burden, and no effective and safe drugs are available to prevent the pathogenesis of ectopic ossification. In this study, we aimed to study how magnolol affects ossified tendinopathy by evaluating its effects on osteogenic differentiation of tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs). Our data suggested that magnolol attenuated ectopic ossification in the Achilles tendon caused by Achilles tenotomy. Magnolol inhibited PGE2-induced ALP activity and prevented calcium deposits in TDSCs in vitro. Magnolol also exerted inhibitory effects on expression of osteogenic factors, such as Runx2, OCN, and BMP2 in vivo. Further investigation revealed the underlying mechanism by which magnolol prevents PGE2-induced ectopic ossification. Specifically, magnolol inhibits PGE2-induced PI3K/AKT/β-catenin pathway activation in TDSCs. Our findings demonstrated that magnolol inhibited ossified tendinopathy through preventing osteogenic differentiation of TDSCs via downregulation PGE2-induced PI3K/AKT/β-catenin pathways."

Little is known about whether people respond crashes involving SDVs and human drivers differently and why. Across five vignette-based experiments in two studies (total N = 1267), for the first time, we witnessed that participants had a tendency to perceive traffic crashes involving SDVs to be more severe than those involving conventionally human-driven vehicles (HDVs) regardless of their severity (injury or fatality) or cause (SDVs/HDVs or others). Furthermore, we found that this biased response could be a result of people's reliance on the affect heuristic. More specifically, higher prior negative affect tagged with an SDV (vs. an HDV) intensifies people's negative affect evoked by crashes involving the SDV (vs. those involving the HDV), which subsequently results in higher perceived severity and lower acceptability of the crash. Our results imply that people's over-reaction to crashes involving SDVs may be a psychological barrier to their adoption and that we may need to forestall a less stringent introduction policy that allows SDVs on public roads as it may lead to more crashes that could possibly deter people from adopting SDVs. We discuss other theoretical and practical implications of our results and suggest potential approaches to de-biasing people's responses to crashes involving SDVs.",Generation of two iPS cell lines (FRIMOi003-A and FRIMOi004-A) derived from Stargardt patients carrying ABCA4 compound heterozygous mutations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798147,Stem cell research,2019 04 09,"Recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1) is an autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy, caused by mutations in the retina-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABCA4) gene, which plays a role as a retinaldehyde flippase in the photoreceptor outer segments.

Luteolin (3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxy flavone) is a flavonoid found in different plants such as vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruits. It acts as an anticancer agent against various types of human malignancies such as lung, breast, glioblastoma, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers. It also blocks cancer development in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of proliferation of tumor cells, protection from carcinogenic stimuli, and activation of cell cycle arrest, and by inducing apoptosis through different signaling pathways. Luteolin can additionally reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through a mechanism that involves cytoskeleton shrinkage, induction of the epithelial biomarker E-cadherin expression, and by down-regulation of the mesenchymal biomarkers N-cadherin, snail, and vimentin. Furthermore, luteolin increases levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activation of lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress response and mitochondrial dysfunction in glioblastoma cells, and by activation of ER stress-associated proteins expressions, including phosphorylation of eIF2α, PERK, CHOP, ATF4, and cleaved-caspase 12.

In addition, intestinal flora may be associated with depression. This study investigated the effect of the decoction Xiaoyaosan (XYS) against depressive behavior through the regulation of intestinal flora. Fifty-two healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (i.e., control, model, XYS, and fluoxetine). The latter three groups were subjected to 21 days of chronic restraint stress to produce the stress depression model. Rats in the XYS and fluoxetine groups received intragastric administration of XYS and fluoxetine, respectively. The behavioral changes of the rats were observed after 21 days. Stool specimens were sequenced using the 16S rDNA high-throughput method to detect the structure and changes in intestinal flora. There was no difference observed in alpha diversity among the groups. At the phylum level, XYS regulated the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes. At the genus level, XYS reduced the abundance of the Prevotellaceae_Ga6A1_group, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Desulfovibrio. On the contrary, it increased the abundance of the Ruminococcaceae family to improve depression-like behavior. The mechanism involved in this process may be related to short-chain fatty acids, lipopolysaccharides, and intestinal inflammation.",Bu-Shen-Yi-Qi formula ameliorates airway remodeling in murine chronic asthma by modulating airway inflammation and oxidative stress in the lung.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798140,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Bu-Shen-Yi-Qi formula (BSYQF) could suppress chronic airway inflammation according to previous studies. However, there is relatively little direct experimental evidence to evaluate the effects of BSYQF treatment on airway remodeling in chronic asthma. Recent evidence suggests that oxidative stress is involved in airway inflammation and airway remodeling in chronic asthma. BSYQF which includes various of chemical components having antioxidant effects, could be beneficial in attenuating airway remodeling in chronic asthma. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effect of BSYQF treatment on airway remodeling and investigate its potential mechanisms in chronic asthma. To develop the murine models of chronic asthma, BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin for 8 weeks. BSYQF (5, 10, 20 g raw herbs/kg body weight) or tiotropium bromide (0.1 mM) were administered orally and intranasal instillation, respectively. The effect of BSYQF on pulmonary inflammation and remodeling was evaluated. The parameters of oxidative stress in the lung were analyzed. BSYQF treatment reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), Th2 response including IL-4, IL-13, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), airway inflammation and airway remodeling including smooth muscle thickening and peribronchial collagen deposition. As for oxidative stress, BSYQF treatment reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS), Malondialdehyde (MDA), NO, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but increased significantly glutathione (GSH) /Oxidized glutathione(GSSH) ratios in the lung, restored mitochondrial ultrastructural changes of bronchial epithelia and ATP levels in the lung. In summary, this study suggested that BSYQF treatment ameliorated airway remodeling and alleviated asthmatic features in chronic asthma models. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of BSYQF may explain why BSYQF has effects on preventing airway remodeling.",The effect of white tea on serum TNF-α/NF-κB and immunohistochemical parameters in cisplatin-related renal dysfunction in female rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798139,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Nephrotoxicity is the most important side effect of the antineoplastic drug cisplatin, thereby restricting its use.

Currently, dexrazoxane is the only approved drug that can partially protect against this toxicity in patients, however, its administration is restricted to those patients receiving a high cumulative dose of anthracyclines. Investigations into the mechanisms of cardiotoxicity and efforts to improve cardioprotective strategies have been hindered by the limited availability of a phenotypically relevant in vitro adult human cardiac model system. Here, we adapted a readily reproducible, functional 3D human multi-cell type cardiac system to emulate patient responses seen with doxorubicin and dexrazoxane. We show that administration of two NRF2 gene inducers namely the semi-synthetic triterpenoid Bardoxolone methyl, and the isothiocyanate sulfurophane, result in cardioprotection against doxorubicin toxicity comparable to dexrazoxane as evidenced by an increase in cell viability and a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species. We further show a synergistic attenuation of cardiotoxicity when the NRF2 inducers and dexrazoxane are used in tandem. Taken together, our data indicate that the 3D spheroid is a suitable model to investigate drug induced cardiotoxicity and we reveal an essential role of the NRF2 pathway in cardioprotection providing a novel pharmacological mechanism and intervention route towards the alleviation of doxorubicin-induced toxicity.","Amelioration of renal and hepatic function, oxidative stress, inflammation and histopathologic damages by Malva sylvestris extract in gentamicin induced renal toxicity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798126,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Gentamycin, contrary to its wide range of antimicrobial effects, has a high potential for nephrotoxicity, and renal injury can have effects on other organs such as the liver.",Phyllanthus taxodiifolius Beille suppresses microtubule dynamics and restricts glioblastoma aggressiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798125,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Glioblastoma is the most common and the most malignant form of brain tumor. This devastating tumor results in death within a year after diagnosis. Although the tumor mass can be surgically removed, glioma cells invade other areas in the brain leading to tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Therefore, new agents that can overcome cancer cell invasion are urgently required. Phyllanthus taxodiifolius Beille (P. taxodiifolius), has been reported to have potent anti-cancer activities. However, its effects on glioblastoma cells and its underlying mechanisms have never been revealed. Here we investigated the effect and underlying mechanisms of P. taxodiifolius extract on aggressive properties of the glioblastoma, including adhesion, migration, and invasion. P. taxodiifolius extract disrupted adhesion, delayed migration and interfered with the invasion of glioblastoma cells. In addition, the extract suppressed microtubule dynamics as shown by live imaging of a microtubule plus tip protein and decreased focal adhesion by decreasing focal adhesion kinase activity. Our study is the first evidence showing that P. taxodiifolius extract suppresses invasive properties of glioblastoma cells by disrupting microtubule structure and interfering with microtubule dynamics, suggesting the possibility to further develop P. taxodiifolius and its bioactive compounds as an anti-cancer drug targeting microtubules in glioblastoma.",Cancer cells change their glucose metabolism to overcome increased ROS: One step from cancer cell to cancer stem cell?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798124,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Cancer cells can adapt to low energy sources in the face of ATP depletion as well as to their high levels of ROS by altering their metabolism and energy production networks which might also have a role in determining cell fate and developing drug resistance. Cancer cells are generally characterized by increased glycolysis. This is while; cancer stem cells (CSCs) exhibit an enhanced pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolism. Based on the current literature, we suggest that cancer cells when encountering ROS, first increase the glycolysis rate and then following the continuation of oxidative stress, the metabolic balance is skewed from glycolysis to PPP. Therefore, we hypothesize in this review that in cancer cells this metabolic deviation during persistent oxidative stress might be a sign of cancer cells' shift towards CSCs, an issue that might be pivotal in more effective targeting of cancer cells and CSCs.",Development of a recombinant human IL-15·sIL-15Rα/Fc superagonist with improved half-life and its antitumor activity alone or in combination with PD-1 blockade in mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798123,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Recombinant human interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a potent cancer immunotherapeutic candidate due to its excellent immune stimulating effects. Previous work demonstrated that IL-15 appeared with short half-life in circulation system, while the complex with its receptor can prolong the half-life as well as benefit its activities in vivo. Therefore, IL-15 complex was more favorably considered for clinical development. Herein we developed IL-15·sIL-15Rα/Fc, a complex comprising of IL-15 and the extracellular region of its receptor alpha subunit which fused to Immunoglobulin G (IgG1) Fc to further prolong the half-life in plasma. Through transient gene expression in HEK293 cells, we expressed the superagonist by co-transfection of plasmids encoding IL-15 and sIL-15Rα/Fc respectively, yielding 36 mg/L of product after purification. Pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the combination profoundly prolonged the half-life of IL-15 to 13.1 h in mice, about 18 folds longer than that of IL-15 monomer which is around 0.7 h. The bioactivity of the superagonist was characterized by CTLL-2 cells proliferation assay in vitro, showing its capability of stimulating the expansion of memory CD8+ T cells (cluster of differentiation) in mouse spleen. Using a HT-29 xenograft NOD-SCID mouse model, we observed tumor growth inhibition in all groups that received the superagonist, indicating its anti-tumor efficacy via stimulating infused human immune cells. In addition, combo cancer treatment by IL-15·sIL-15Rα/Fc and programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody have shown stronger inhibitory effects as compared with treatment with either single molecule. Therefore, we developed IL-15·sIL-15Rα/Fc to be a long half-life potential cancer immunotherapy candidate that can be applied alone or in synergy with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.",Trametenolic acid B protects against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury through modulation of microRNA-10a and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798122,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Trametenolic acid B (TAB) was a lanostane-type triterpenoid isolated from the trametes lactinea (Berk.) Pat. We have previously reported that extract from trametes lactinea (Berk.) Pat and TAB could efficiently improve learning and memory ability of the cerebral ischemia injury rats and suppress mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in hydrogen peroxide damaged SH-SY5Y cells. However, the potential mechanisms have not been fully understood yet. The current study was to further investigate the protective effect of TAB on oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-damaged SH-SY5Y cells and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury rats, as well as its mechanisms involved. Cell experiments demonstrated that TAB (10, 20 and 40 μg/mL) protected OGD/R-induced SH-SY5Y cell injury by promoting cell proliferation and suppressing LDH leakage; Meanwhile, the results in vivo showed that TAB (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) might significantly ameliorate the neurological deficit score, cerebral edema, neuronal cell loss and apoptosis, suppress cerebral infarction volume of the cerebral I/R injury rats. Further studies in vitro and in vivo indicated TAB could efficiently reduce OGD/R-damaged SH-SY5Y cell and cerebral I/R rat serum ROS, LDH and MDA levels, elevate SOD, GSH-Px and CAT activities, downregulate miR-10a mRNA and Bax, cytochrome C, cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-9 protein expressions, upregulate p-PIK3CA, p-Akt, p-mTOR, Bcl-2, pro-caspase-9 and pro-caspase-3 protein expressions and p-PIK3CA/PIK3CA, p-Akt/Akt, p-mTOR/mTOR ratios (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01, respectively). Our present study indicated that TAB possessed neuroprotective property against ODG/R and I/R injury by suppressing miR-10a expression, activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thereby reducing mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, which provided a new insight for interpreting the underlying mechanisms of TAB' neuroprotective effect and a candidate agent to treat cerebral I/R injury.",Moringa concanensis Nimmo extracts ameliorates hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress and upregulates PPARγ and GLUT4 gene expression in liver and pancreas of streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced diabetic rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798121,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"The current study investigates the effects of ethanolic extract of M. concanensis Nimmo leaves (EEMCNL) with respect to its potent protective tissue damage, antioxidant properties in serum, liver and kidney, histopathological evaluation, and PPARγ and GLUT4 gene expression in liver and pancreatic tissue of Streptozotocin-Nicotinamide (STZ-NA) induced diabetic rats. Animals were divided into five groups (n = 5): control; diabetic; diabetic + EEMCNL; control + EEMCNL; and diabetic + glibenclamide. After 45 days of treatment with EEMCNL, MDA levels were significantly decreased in the diabetic-induced group when compared with the STZ-induced diabetic group (P < 0.05). The activities of serum enzymes AST, ALT, ALP, ACP and LDH were significantly decreased in serum and kidney, and increased in liver tissues of the EEMCNL-treated group as compared with the STZ-NA induced diabetic group (P < 0.05). The levels of total protein, urea, creatinine and uric acid observed in the diabetic group returned to normal by administration of EEMCNL (250 mg/kg) as relative to the STZ-NA induced diabetic group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, EEMCNL upregulated PPARγ and GLUT4 expression in liver and pancreatic tissue of the STZ-NA induced diabetic group rats. Taken together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of the hepatoprotective and renoprotective potential of EEMCNL against oxidative stress in the diabetic state, which was evidenced by the capacity of EEMCNL to modulate the antioxidant defence and to decrease lipid peroxidation in these tissues.",Downregulation of RGMA by HIF-1A/miR-210-3p axis promotes cell proliferation in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798120,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Repulsive guidance molecules comprise a group of proteins that play an important role in carcinogenesis through interactions with their receptors, but their function in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unclear. Here, we investigated the potential role of the RGM family members in oral cancer pathogenesis. Our study showed that only RGMA was significantly downregulated in the OSCC tissues analyzed by TCGA and validated this finding in OSCC cells. The decreased expression of RGMA was strongly associated with the T stage and with poor prognosis. The ectopic expression of RGMA significantly inhibited the proliferation of OSCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we confirmed that RGMA was a target of miR-210-3p in OSCC and miR-210-3p overexpression contributed to the acceleration of OSCC growth. Further experiments revealed that HIF1A specifically interacted with the promoter of miR-210-3p and enhanced its expression. In summary, our research indicates that RGMA is regulated by the HIF1A/miR-210-3p axis and inhibits OSCC cell proliferation; thus, in the future, the development of therapies that target the HIF1A/miR-210-3p/RGMA axis may aid in the treatment of aggressive cancers.",Immunostimulatory activity of Y-shaped DNA nanostructures mediated through the activation of TLR9.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798119,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotides (DNAs) have been widely studied in pharmaceutical and biomedical research fields for applications in cancer immunotherapy and vaccination. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical for the instruction and orchestration of the host immune system composed of innate and adaptive immunity. In particular, TLR9 responds to DNAs with unmethylated deoxycytosine-deoxyguanosine (CpG) motifs, thereby inducing the activation of innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells, and consequently, adaptive immune cells. In this study, we developed two kinds of Y-shaped double-stranded DNA nanostructures (Y-DNAs), including a single unit composed of three DNA strands (YS-DNA) and a ligated multiunit complex formed by crosslinking each YS-DNA (YL-DNA), and investigated whether they have immunostimulatory activity in innate immune cells. YS-DNA and YL-DNA induced the production of immune cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF-α and the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86 in primary mouse dendritic cells and macrophage cells (RAW264.7 cells). A Coprecipitation study demonstrated that YL-DNA was directly associated with TLR9. The induction of immune cytokines by YS-DNA and YL-DNA was abolished in TLR9-deficient primary mouse dendritic cells. The results demonstrated that Y-DNAs induced the activation of dendritic cells and macrophages mediated by the activation of TLR9, as shown by the expression of immune cytokines and costimulatory molecules. The results suggest that Y-DNA nanostructures provide a beneficial strategy for immunotherapy by modulating the immune system.",Genistein reverses isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy by regulating miR-451/TIMP2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798118,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 03 23,"Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, a prevalent clinical condition is deeply associated with many physiological factors.

Simultaneously, ICR mice were treated with genistein for 21 days to evaluate the effects of the phytochemical on isoproterenol-induced myocardial hypertrophy in vivo. Results showed that isoproterenol induced cardiac hypertrophy and down-regulated the expression of miR-451 and up-regulated miR-451's target gene TIMP2. Genistein increased the expression of miR-451 and inhibited the isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

Eight splenectomized subjects and eight matched healthy control subjects were exposed to one-hour infusion of adrenaline (6 μg/kg/h). Administration of adrenaline to the healthy subjects reduced time to TEG-detected initial fibrin formation (by 22%) and increased rate of clot development (by 10%), maximal amplitude (by 8%), platelet count (by 30%), and Multiplate evaluated Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (by 21%) (all p ≤ 0.05), but infusion of adrenaline did not result in significant arterial to liver vein differences for plasma markers of coagulation. In the splenectomized subjects, adrenaline reduced the TEG-determined time to initial fibrin formation (by 17%; p = 0.005) whereas rate of clot development and maximum amplitude were unaffected. Also, 6 patients undergoing liver transplantation were exposed to infusion of adrenaline (4.8 μg/kg/h) during the anhepatic phase of the operation and that increased TEG-determined rate of clot formation (by 10%; p < 0.05), maximal amplitude (by 9%; p = 0.002) and tended to reduce time to initial fibrin formation (p = 0.1). In conclusion, adrenaline enhances hemostasis as evaluated by TEG in both healthy subjects and in anhepatic patients during liver transplantation and Ristocetin-induced aggregation in control subjects. In contrast, infusion of adrenaline reduces only time to initial fibrin formation in splenectomized subjects. These findings suggest that mobilization of platelets from the spleen dominates the adrenaline-induced enhanced hemostatic competence.",The impact of meditation on healthy ageing - the current state of knowledge and a roadmap to future directions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798104,Current opinion in psychology,2019 05 23,"There is increasing evidence that meditation-based training promotes healthy ageing across many dimensions.

These results suggest that calyculin A-sensitive and okadaic acid-less sensitive protein phosphatases (1α and 1γ) are suppressors for the extracellular Ca2+-dependent full-type hyperactivation in bull ejaculated spermatozoa.",Potential anti-herpes and cytotoxic action of novel semisynthetic digitoxigenin-derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798081,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 18,"In recent years, new therapeutic possibilities were proposed for cardiac glycosides traditionally used to treat heart diseases, such as anticancer and antiviral activities. In this sense, this work aimed to synthesize the readily accessible 3β-azido-3-deoxydigitoxigenin (5) from digitoxigenin (1). Two new series of compounds were obtained from derivative (5): (i) O-glycosyl trizols through click chemistry with propargyl glycosides; and (ii) compounds substituted in the alpha carbonyl position with different residues linked via an amino-group. All obtained derivatives have their chemical structures confirmed, and their anti-herpes (against HSV-types 1 and 2 replication) and cytotoxic (against PC3, A549, HCT-8 and LNCaP cell lines) activities evaluated. Compounds 10 and 11 exhibited the most promising results against HSV-1 (KOS and 29-R strains) and HSV-2 (333 strain) replication with SI values > 1000. Both compounds were also the most cytotoxic for the human cancer cell lines tested with IC50 values similar to those of paclitaxel. They also presented reduced toxicity toward non-cancerous cell lines (MRC-5 and HGF cells). Promising compounds were tested in regard to their ability to inhibit Na+/K+-ATPase. The inhibition rate correlates suitably with the bioactivity demonstrated by those both compounds against the different human cancer cells tested as well as against HSV replication. Moreover, the results showed that specific chemical features of compound 10 and 11 influenced the bioactivities tested. In summary, it was possible to obtain novel digitoxigenin-derivatives with remarkable cytotoxic and anti-herpes activities as well as low toxicity and high selectivity. In this way, they could be considered potential molecules for the development of new drugs.",Hippocampal subfield-specific connectivity findings in major depressive disorder: A 7 Tesla diffusion MRI study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798080,Journal of psychiatric research,2019 05 08,"Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) enables non-invasive characterization of white matter (WM) structures in vivo.

We use 7 Tesla dMRI to investigate differences in hippocampal subfield connectivity of MDD patients.",Diclofenac conjugates with biocides through silver(I) ions (CoMeD's); Development of a reliable model for the prediction of anti-proliferation of NSAID's-silver formulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798079,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2019 03 29,"The conjugation of diclofenac (DICLH), a Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID), with biocides such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and triphenylphosphine (TPP), through silver(I) ions, results into the chemical [Agn(DICL)n(L)m]k (L = DMSO and n = 2, m = 2, k = infinite (1); L = TPP and n = 1, m = 2, k = 1 (2)). The compounds were characterized by m.p., FT-IR, UV-vis and 1H NMR spectroscopic techniques. The crystal and molecular structures of 1-2 were determined by X-ray crystallography. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of 1-2 against the human breast adenocarcinoma cancer cells MCF-7 (hormone dependent) and MDA-MB-231 (hormone independent) reveals that the 1 inhibits the MCF-7 rather than the MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting hormone mimetic behaviour. Compound 2 inhibits both cancerous cell lines, stronger than cisplatin. Both compounds inhibit MCF-7 cells migration. Compounds 1-2, exhibit, lower toxicity against fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells than cisplatin. Their genotoxicity was evaluated on MRC-5 cells. The molecular mechanism of 1-2 against MCF-7 cells was clarified by (i) their cell cycle arrest study (ii) their mitochondrial membrane permeability (iii) their binding affinity towards Calf Thymus (CT)-DNA and (iv) their inhibitory activity against the enzyme lipoxygenase (LOX).

This may combat platinum resistance and side effects seen commonly in current anticancer chemotherapy regimes. Here, we explore a novel degradable ruthenium-albumin hydrogel, which shows strong luminescence for cell imaging and high selectivity for cancer cells versus non-cancer cells. This is an early indication of the possibility of reducing unwanted side effects of metals by using bovine serum albumin hydrogel as a delivery strategy. This work provides a strong basis for development of a new class of metal-based cancer therapeutic agents.",A potpourri of pathogenetic pathways in endometrial carcinoma with a focus on Lynch Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798077,Annals of diagnostic pathology,2019 05 06,"Endometrial carcinoma is the most frequently occurring female genital tract malignancy in developed nations, with a rising annual incidence. Endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), the most common histological variant, differs in morphologic and molecular characteristics from serous carcinomas but morphological distinction of high-grade EECs from serous carcinomas may prove difficult. Thus, molecular categorization of tumors may allow for better tumor classification with greater insight into the underlying biology of endometrial carcinomas with new therapeutic options. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a commonly occurring molecular aberration in EECs and has been identified in most Lynch Syndrome (LS) associated tumors. This tumor syndrome predisposes afflicted individuals to a myriad of tumors including endometrial carcinoma. Herein, the molecular signature of endometrial tumors as well as LS, and its clinical manifestations are reviewed. Understanding of the pathogenetic pathways allows for greater comprehension of occurrences at a molecular level which are then appreciated at a cellular and tissue level, by the histopathologist. The molecular classification of endometrial tumors allows for further targeted therapeutic options for affected patients. Screening tests for patients with suspected LS enables surveillance of other tumors in the affected patient and her family with the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality. It is envisioned that this overview will allow for enhanced comprehension of genetic pathways by practicing pathologists, oncologists, gynecologists and other members of the multidisciplinary team, all of whom are involved in the management of the patient with an endometrial malignancy.",Utilization of spectrins βI and βIII in diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798076,Annals of diagnostic pathology,2019 05 06,"Spectrins are a group of cytoskeletal proteins which participate in many important cellular functions. It has been suggested that loss of spectrin isoforms may be associated with tumorigenesis of lymphoma, leukemia, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We recently reported that βI spectrin expression was present in normal hepatocytes but lost in HCC cells, which suggested that spectrins may be helpful markers in diagnosis of HCC. In this study, using immunohistochemical staining, we further investigated the expression pattern of four spectrin isoforms (αII, βI-III) on different benign and malignant liver tumors including focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hepatic adenoma (HA), HCC, and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). The results revealed that βI spectrin was moderately to strongly positive in FNH and HA tissues, but was only weakly positive or lost in HCC cases and was weakly positive in all CC cases. In addition, the βIII spectrin, majority of which was moderately positive in both FNH and HA tissues, was mostly lost in poorly differentiated HCC but remained at least moderately positive in most CC cases. These results suggest that spectrins βI and βIII may be used to differentiate well differentiated HCC from FNH or HA, and poorly differentiated HCC from CC, respectively.",Cystic and pseudocystic pulmonary malformations in children: Clinico-pathological correlation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798075,Annals of diagnostic pathology,2019 05 06,"Pulmonary malformations are rare disorders, with cystic and pseudocystic pulmonary malformations (CPPM) the most frequent, and constitute the first cause of lobectomy in children <1 year of age. Morphological overlap of congenital cystic pulmonary lesions might correspond to a spectrum of lesions in which bronchial atresia is a common etiopathogenetic mechanism. We aimed to report the frequency of CPPM resected in a tertiary-level hospital and to evaluate the degree of agreement between presurgical and anatomopathological diagnoses. We studied 44 surgical pieces with a diagnosis of CPPM received at the Pathology Service from 2009 to 2014, resected from 39 patients, 51.3 % males, with a median age of 16.8 months. Up to 69.2% of the patients had adenomatoid malformation of pulmonary airway (AMPA), with type 2 the most frequent (55.5%). Pulmonary sequestration was present in 15.4% of patients; in two cases the diagnosis was an incidental finding during surgery for the repair of a diaphragmatic hernia. Congenital lobar hyperinflation (CLH) occurred in 7.6% cases. Bronchogenic cyst (BC) was present in 7.6% cases. Presurgical and anatomopathological diagnoses in all patients coincided in 71.8% of cases. Kappa coefficient was 0.56 for global concordance in patients with AMPA, and 0.72, 0.64, 0.37 and 0.33 for CLH, BC, and types 1 and 2 AMPA, respectively. This relatively low interobserver agreement could reflect the low reproducibility of diagnoses used in the current nomenclature. Thus, the new nomenclature must be promoted in order to allow for better reproducibility and greater clinico-pathological concordance. The anatomopathological analysis must include the intentional search for bronchial atresia.",Revisiting localized malignant mesothelioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798074,Annals of diagnostic pathology,2019 05 06,"Malignant Mesothelioma is an uncommon tumor that usually presents with diffuse pleural involvement and carries a dismal prognosis. Rarely, however, it can present as a localized, circumscribed mass or focal pleural lesion without evidence of diffuse spread. We found four such cases in our database. Three patients had localized epithelioid malignant mesothelioma and one had localized sarcomatoid mesothelioma. These localized tumors are a potential diagnostic pitfall for the pathologists as well as radiologists, especially those practicing in a community setting.

However, whether NADPH oxidase is involved in non-motor symptoms, especially cognitive dysfunction in PD remains unknown. This study is undertaken to characterize the effects of inhibition of NADPH oxidase by a widely used NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin on learning and memory deficits in paraquat and maneb-induced mouse PD model. Results showed that mice injected with paraquat and maneb displayed impairments of spatial learning and memory, which was associated with reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression as well as increased neurodegeneration, synaptic loss, α-synuclein expression and Ser129-phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Interestingly, apocynin treatment significantly ameliorated learning and memory deficits as well as hippocampal neurodegeneration and α-synuclein pathology in mice treated with these two pesticides. Mechanistically, we found that apocynin mitigated paraquat and maneb-induced NADPH oxidase activation and related oxidative stress. Furthermore, reduced microglial activation and M1 polarization were observed in apocynin and paraquat and maneb co-treated mice compared with paraquat and maneb alone group. Finally, apocynin inhibited the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways, two key regulatory factors for microglial M1 inflammatory responses, in paraquat and maneb-treated mice. Altogether, our findings implied that NADPH oxidase mediates learning and memory deficits in PD, and inhibition of NADPH oxidase by apocynin blocks impairments of learning and memory via the suppression of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation."

B, Biointerfaces",2019 04 30,"Glucose-responsive multilayer capsules have been produced through the layer-by-layer deposition of biodegradable polymers based on hydrogen bonding. The used polymers are alginate derivative and polyvinylpyrolidone (PVPON). Concentration-dependent glucose responsiveness was reached through chemical modification of alginate, selected as polyanion, with phenylboronic acid moieties (known to enable complexes with diols derivative) demonstrated that the alginate derivative self-assembles with the PVPON in accordance with (i) the formation of hydrogen bonding layer-by-layer assembly, and (ii) also evidence an enhancement of the stability versus the pH. We demonstrate that incorporating boronic acid moieties inside a polymer chain allows (i) glucose-responsiveness and (ii) using boronic moieties as hydrogen bond acceptor. This strategy was implemented for the fabrication of smart capsules employing calcium carbonate microparticles as a removable core template. This later enables to consider the loading of two probes. The porosity of the calcium carbonate microparticles template has been used to load the first probe (rhodamine b) and the other one has been loaded through electrostatic interaction with the carboxylate moiety in the alginate (methylene blue hydrate). Insulin has also been loaded as chemical of interest to demonstrate the interest of the present strategy.",The grammaticality asymmetry in agreement attraction reflects response bias: Experimental and modeling evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798061,Cognitive psychology,2019 03 09,"Memory access mechanisms such as cue-based retrieval have come to dominate theories of the processing of linguistic dependencies such as subject-verb agreement. One phenomenon that has been regarded as demonstrating the role of such mechanisms is the grammaticality asymmetry in agreement attraction, which is the observation that nouns other than the grammatical controller of agreement can influence the computation of subject-verb agreement in ungrammatical, but not grammatical, sentences. This asymmetry is most often accounted for via the dynamics of retrieval interference. We challenge this interpretation, arguing that the asymmetry largely reflects response bias. Three forced-choice judgment experiments show that neutralizing response bias results in a decrease in the size of the grammaticality asymmetry, or its elimination altogether. Together with the response time patterns in these experiments, this result favors an account that attributes attraction effects to a continuous and equivocal representation of number, rather than to the dynamics of retrieval interference. We implement a model of grammaticality judgments that links a continuous representation of number to the rate of evidence accumulation in a diffusion process. This model accounts for the presence or absence of the grammaticality asymmetry through shifts in the decisional starting point (i.e. response bias), and highlights the importance of monitoring for response bias effects in judgment tasks.","Poultry eggs as a source of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs and PBDD/Fs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798060,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"Regardless of the country or region of the world, poultry eggs are one of the most important components of the human diet. Nutritional value is derived from them, but chicken eggs can be contaminated with POPs. The aim of the study was to compare the impact of different types of chicken husbandry system on bioaccumulation of selected POPs. The HRGC/HRMS method was used for determination of 58 congeners of chlorinated and brominated halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons. The influence of the farm rearing system on concentration and congener profile was seen for most groups of tested contaminants, of which the eggs were a source. Human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds as a result of consumption of contaminated eggs should be a subject of concern. The occurrence of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs, and PBDD/Fs in commonly consumed foodstuffs such as eggs supports the need for further research on environmental pollutants and for determination of exposure as the result of their occurrence in different food categories.",Molecular characterization of monocrotophos and chlorpyrifos tolerant bacterial strain for enhancing seed germination of vegetable crops.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798059,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"The main aim of this study is to investigate the toxicity of organophosphate (OPs) insecticides monocrotophos (MCP) and chlorpyrifos (CLS) on plant growth promoting (PGP) properties and seed germination of brinjal, tomato and okra vegetables inoculated by Microbacterium hydrocarbonoxydans (BHUJP-P1), Stenotrophomonas rhizophila (BHUJP-P2), Bacillus licheniformis (BHUJP-P3) and Bacillus cereus (BHUJP-P4). Maximum increase in microbial growth (52.6% & 47.9%) with enhanced EPS production (447.67 mg/ml & 75.00 mg/ml) was showed by BHUJP-P4 and BHUJP-P3 at 10× dose of MCP and CLS over control, BHUJP-2 and BHUJP-P1 respectively. Simultaneously, both strains recorded minimum reduction in PGP activities and seed germination at 3× dose of both insecticides as compared to BHUJP-2 and BHUJP-P1, respectively. Strains BHUJP-P3 and BHUJP-P4 showed 83 and 81% of monocrotophos degradation at 50 mg/kg concentration; 81 and 80% at 150 mg/kg concentration within 5days respectively. Concurrently, these strains BHUJP-P3 and BHUJP-P4 were recorded 53 and 90% of chlorpyrifos degradation at 50 mg/kg concentration; 49% and 87% at 100 mg/kg concentration within 72 h, respectively. The OPs insecticide degrading gene opdA and opd was found in strain BHUJP-P3 and BHUJP-P4, respectively. The multifarious biological activities of strain BHUJP-P3 and BHUJP-P4 showed maximum tolerance against insecticide, and minimum reduction in P-solubilisation, IAA, siderophore and HCN production for plant growth promotion and biological control under insecticide stress. Thus, these novel isolates may be used as biodegradation of organophosphate insecticide and plant growth promoting bacterial (PGPB) inoculum for enhancing seed germination of vegetables under stress insecticide. These novel strains will be environment friendly, socially acceptable and economically viable.",Effects of acetylacetone on the thermal and photochemical conversion of benzoquinone in aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798058,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"Quinones are components of electron transport chains in photosynthesis and respiration. Acetylacetone (AA), structurally similar to benzoquinone (BQ) for the presence of two identical carbonyl groups, has been reported as a quinone-like electron shuttle. Both BQ and AA are important chemicals in the aquatic environment. However, little information is known about their interactions if co-existed. We found here that AA significantly enhanced the conversion of BQ. By analyzing the evolution of chemical concentration, solution pH, dissolved oxygen, and the final products, the interactions between AA and BQ were elucidated. The reactions between BQ and AA generated oxygen but ultimately led to the reduction of solution pH and dissolved oxygen. The reactions proceeded faster under indoor lighting condition than in the dark. The formation of semiquinone radicals is believed as the primary step. The secondary AA-derived radicals might be strongly oxidative or reductive, depending on the concentration of dissolved oxygen. Insoluble humus was generated in the mixture of BQ and AA. These results suggest that the presence of AA might interfere with photosynthesis and respiration through the interactions with quinones.",Simultaneous removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals from water using granular activated carbon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798057,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals are dangerous pollutants that commonly co-occur in water. An adsorption study conducted on the simultaneous removal of PAHs (acenaphthylene, phenanthrene) and heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Zn) by granular activated carbon (GAC) showed that, when these pollutants are present together, their adsorption was less than when they were present individually. The adsorptive removal percentage of PAHs (initial concentration 1 mg/L) was much higher than that of heavy metals (initial concentration (20 mg/L). The reduction in adsorption of PAHs by heavy metals followed the heavy metals' adsorption capacity and reduction in the negative zeta potential of GAC order (Cu > Zn > Cd). In contrast, PAHs had little effect on the zeta potential of GAC. The Langmuir adsorption capacities of acenaphthylene (0.31-2.63 mg/g) and phenanthrene (0.74-7.36 mg/g) on GAC decreased with increased metals' concentration with the reduction following the order of the metals' adsorption capacity. The kinetic adsorption data fitted to Weber and Morris plots, indicating intra-particle diffusion of both PAHs and heavy metals into the mesopores and micropores in GAC with the diffusion rates. This depended on the type of PAH and metal and whether the pollutants were present alone or together.",Organic contamination of beached plastic pellets in the South Atlantic: Risk assessments can benefit by considering spatial gradients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798056,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"Microplastics are important vectors for the transport and accumulation of persistent organic contaminants in coastal and marine environments. We determined the concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) associated with microplastic pellets collected along a 39-km stretch of Brazil's South Atlantic coastline to understand the spatial dynamics and potential risk posed by these contaminants. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 1,454 to 6,002 ng g-1 and regularly exceeded the threshold effect level (TEL) for sediments defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Sampling stations, spaced evenly along the coastline (i.e., 3-km intervals) exhibited a general north-to-south decline in the concentrations of some PAHs, but this spatial gradient was complicated by small-scale differences in the concentrations and composition of associated contaminants. Similarly, analysis of individual isomer ratios revealed further complexity driven by differences in the contribution of petrogenic versus pyrolytic inputs which pose different levels of risk to marine organisms. PCB concentrations ranged from 0.8 to 104.6 ng g-1 and were dominated by low chlorinated congeners likely to have originated from major industrial areas to the north. Overall, this study highlights the challenge of directly linking microplastic pollution with the potential toxicological effects of organic contaminants in coastal waters. We recommend that monitoring programs should explicitly consider both the origin (i.e., pellet sources and dispersal pathways) and nature of organic contamination (i.e., concentration and composition) when assessing the risks for biota and human health.",Predicting the survival of zebrafish larvae exposed to fluctuating pulses of lead and cadmium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798055,Chemosphere,2019 06 13,"Aquatic organisms are often exposed to time-varied concentrations of contaminants due to pulsed inputs in natural water. Traditional toxicology experiments are usually carried out in a constant exposure pattern, which is inconsistent with the actual environment. In this study, a refined toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TK-TD) model was used to study the toxic effects of Pb and Cd on zebrafish larvae under three pulse exposures with 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively. The parameter sensitivity analysis showed that JM, max had the greatest impact on the output of the model. Cd or Pb pulse exposure resulted in less death than constant exposure at the same time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations. Survival fraction in larvae under 6 h interval between two pulses of Pb or Cd was larger than that under 2 h and 4 h interval. Toxicity under constant exposure of Cd or Pb was greater than that under 2, 4, and 6 h interval pulse exposure because the cumulative Cd or Pb concentration in the body under constant exposure was greater than that under pulse exposure. The results also showed that the stochastic death (SD) model was more suitable than the individual tolerance (IT) model for predicting the survival fraction of larvae under pulse exposure to Pb and Cd, which was indicated by higher R2 (0.670-0.940) in SD model than that (0.588-0.861) in IT model. Our model provides approaches for laboratory toxicity testing and modeling approaches for addressing the toxicity of heavy metal pulsed exposure.",22-Oxocholestane oximes as potential anti-inflammatory drug candidates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798054,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 22,"22-Oxocholestanes bearing the oxime functionality in the side chain have been synthesized from diosgenin and evaluated in vivo as anti-inflammatory agents in an acute inflammation mouse ear model, against the commercial glucocorticoid dexamethasone.

The most active oximes repressed the expression of proinflammatory genes TNF-α, COX-2, and IL-6; including macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Overall, our data suggest that 22-oxocholestane oximes exert a strong in vivo anti-inflammatory activity.","Design, biological evaluation and X-ray crystallography of nanomolar multifunctional ligands targeting simultaneously acetylcholinesterase and glycogen synthase kinase-3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798053,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 22,"Both cholinesterases (AChE and BChE) and kinases, such as GSK-3α/β, are associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Two scaffolds, targeting AChE (tacrine) and GSK-3α/β (valmerin) simultaneously, were assembled, using copper(I)-catalysed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), to generate a new series of multifunctional ligands. A series of eight multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs) was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in cell cultures. Molecular docking studies, together with the crystal structures of three MTDL/TcAChE complexes, with three tacrine-valmerin hybrids allowed designing an appropriate linker containing a 1,2,3-triazole moiety whose incorporation preserved, and even increased, the original inhibitory potencies of the two selected pharmacophores toward the two targets. Most of the new derivatives exhibited nanomolar affinity for both targets, and the most potent compound of the series displayed inhibitory potencies of 9.5 nM for human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and 7 nM for GSK-3α/β. These novel dual MTDLs may serve as suitable leads for further development, since, in the micromolar range, they exhibited low cytotoxicity on a panel of representative human cell lines including the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Moreover, these tacrine-valmerin hybrids displayed a good ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) without interacting with efflux pumps such as P-gp."

Tolerance was found to be up to 100-150 ppm for five strains. Those strains had optimum growth conditions at salinity level of 10 ppm NaCl and pH 7-8. Starting from a concentration 7.9 ppm of mercury extracted from fluorescent lamps and after 6 days of incubation at 37 °C, two isolated strains HA6 (Bacillus spp.) and HA9 (Acinetobacter sp.) showed 96.7% and 98.9% of mercury bio-uptake efficiency, respectively.

This study evaluated the physical and chemical properties of hydrothermally converted biosolids (Sewchar) and its effect as a potential soil amendment on the growth of rice, beans, and radish. The germination experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in a randomized design using five Sewchar doses (0, 10, 20, 40 and 60 Mg ha-1). The results showed that hydrothermal carbonization influences the physicochemical properties of the biosolids, such as promoting pore structure and trace elements below the threshold values for use in agriculture. The spectroscopic techniques demonstrated higher presence of oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., CO/OH) on surfaces of Sewchar than that of biosolids. The Sewchar doses of 10 Mg ha-1 and 60 Mg ha-1 yielded the highest dry biomass for beans and rice respectively. Increasing Sewchar doses negatively correlated with radish dry biomass, as indicated by linear regression equation fitting (p < 0.05). Thus, biomass responses to Sewchar application into the soil varied with Sewchar dose and type of plant. For a proper environmental management, a survey was conducted to assess farmers' perception and acceptance of Sewchar as a soil amendment. The survey revealed that younger farmers who had higher education qualifications were more prone to use Sewchar as soil amendment. Additionally, farmers who would not use Sewchar as soil amendment attributed the highest level of importance to economic criteria, such as fertilizer and freight prices. In the future, studies on a longer term under field conditions should be performed to elucidate the interactions between Sewchar and soil properties on plant growth and to ensure the safe use of Sewchar as a soil amendment.",The dynamics of institutional innovation: Crafting co-management in small-scale fisheries through action research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798038,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"This paper investigates the dynamics of institutional development and co-management performance in small-scale fisheries. The study covers different contexts and spatial and temporal scales, for nine case studies in the South Pacific. In these cases, new co-management institutions were intentionally set up from 2008 to 2016 through fishery policy intervention to address over-exploitation problems of sea cucumber resources. This was carried out in a process of adaptive experimentation, based on a collaborative and problem-solving approach to governance, and a context-based vision of sustainability issues. In order to quantitatively and empirically assess change in governance within and between cases, a multidimensional analytical framework of governance performance is developed. A set of governance performance criteria is defined and the criteria are scored using data from an institutional diagnosis of the cases, throughout the research period. Ten out of eleven criteria were positively impacted by the co-management interventions. Three institutional development trajectories can be identified for the fishery co-management building process, involving a range of gradual and abrupt changes. Consolidation of the institutional changes achieved by the interventions is required to successfully develop the resilience of the fishing systems to multiple stresses. This empirical study provides a methodology for systematically assessing institutional dynamics in fisheries, and in particular the crafting and sustaining of co-management regimes in small-scale fisheries. The approach could potentially be applied to other complex social-ecological systems.",The acute effects of physiotherapy on general movement patterns in preterm infants: A single-blind study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798037,Early human development,2019 04 01,"The General Movement Assessment (GMA) is a video analysis method developed by Heinz Prechtl that examines the infant's spontaneous movements.

Suspected cases were screened by ELISA for NS1 antigen and anti-DENV IgM antibodies. Serologically confirmed cases were subjected to RT-PCR based detection and serotyping. The RT-PCR results were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Genome-wide association was undertaken with DENV sequences from ViPR database and the immune evasion potential of infecting serotypes was ascertained by computing antigenic variability in B cell and Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes of all DENV proteins. The immunological basis of more prolonged viremia in DENV2-infected patients was also addressed through sequencing of NS2a gene and comparing the CTL activity in NS2a sequences identified among patients with ≤5 days and >5 days of illness. Among 166 serologically confirmed Dengue patients, 75 were positive for DENV RNA. Serotyping revealed predominance of DENV-1 and DENV-2, followed by DENV-3. Co-infection with multiple serotypes was observed in 15.5% of cases. In ~40% cases, DENV RNA was detectable beyond 5 days, among whom majority were DENV-2 infected (p = .044). Highest prevalence of antigenic variability was observed in B cell and CTL epitopes of DENV-2. The potential association between prolonged viremia and higher ability for immune evasion in DENV-2 patients was further corroborated with the observation of poorer HLA-I binding affinity in CTL epitopes observed in NS2a sequences retrieved from patients with >5 days of illness, compared to those with ≤5 days. This is the first report from central India revealing circulation of all DENV serotypes and high prevalence of co-infection with multiple serotypes. We also observed prolonged viremia upon DENV-2 infection, which could be potentially associated with its superior immune evasion potential.",Bats as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance determinants: A survey of class 1 integrons in Grey-headed Flying Foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798035,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 03 30,"Increasing reports of antimicrobial resistance in wildlife highlight the significance of a One Health approach to managing resistance. We investigated the prevalence and diversity of class 1 integrons, a genetic determinant of resistance, in grey-headed flying foxes, a large fruit bat species belonging to the order Chiroptera. Class 1 integrons were detected in both wild flying foxes (5.3%) and captive flying foxes (41.2%) housed in wildlife rehabilitation facilities. Genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides, trimethoprim and beta-lactams, and Qac efflux pumps were detected. Analysis of conserved integron elements and gene cassette arrays indicate the direction of integron transfer is from humans to flying foxes. The detection of two novel gene cassette arrays (5'CS-qacH-aacA34-blaOXA-21-3'CS and 5'CS-qacF-3'CS strongly suggests acquisition of genes from the environmental resistome into class 1 integrons within the flying fox microbiota. The dynamics of class 1 integrons in flying foxes indicates bats have a role in the emergence of novel antibiotic resistance determinants.","Prevalence and multilocus genotypes of Giardia duodenalis infecting pigs in Ogun state, Nigeria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798034,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 03 30,"Giardia duodenalis is an intestinal flagellated protozoan parasite that is infectious to humans and a wide range of animals worldwide. While varying prevalence rates have been reported in pigs worldwide, there are currently no published reports on the genotypes of Giardia infecting pigs in any African country. The present study is on the prevalence and genotypes of G. duodenalis in 209 pigs raised on four farms in Ogun State Nigeria. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, Giardia duodenalis coproantigens were detected on all farms and in 25.4% (53/209) of pigs sampled. However, there was no significant influence (p > 0.05) of age, sex and stool consistencies of the pigs on the distribution of the infection. Genotyping of Giardia duodenalis in all ELISA-positive samples, achieved by the amplification of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and beta giardin (bg) genes, identified 14 and 37 assemblage B and E isolates respectively while mixed infection by both assemblages was recorded in two isolates. Novel nucleotide substitutions were identified in four assemblage B isolates at the ssu rRNA locus. Genetic diversity was observed among the assemblage B isolates after multiple alignment analyses of the gdh, tpi and bg sequences whereby sub-assemblages BII (n = 2), BIII (n = 9) and BIV (n = 3) were identified. The assemblage B isolates from pigs in this study were phylogenetically related to isolates from humans, marmoset and cattle while the assemblage E isolates were related to isolates from sheep, goats and cattle. These findings suggest that pigs in southwest Nigeria predominantly harbour G. duodenalis isolates that could be infectious to other animal species and to a lesser extent, isolates that may be of zoonotic importance.",Molecular identification of Puumala orthohantavirus in Bulgaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798033,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 03 30,"In Bulgaria, only Dobrava orthohantavirus has been detected in patients and in rodents.

Extant research on ENDs' acute health effects find them to be lesser than use of combustible cigarettes. ENDs do not appear to be efficacious as an immediate cessation aid, and may be a 'gateway' to adolescent nicotine use. However, in the absence of longitudinal research, a determination of ENDs as a nicotine harm-reduction approach is premature.",Hydrosalpinx in patients with hysterectomy without salpingo-oophorectomy referred for pelvic magnetic resonance imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798017,Clinical imaging,2019 04 11,"Women with ovarian-sparing hysterectomy before 2007 are more likely to have retained Fallopian tube remnants which can become fluid-filled, distended masses, potentially mistaken for a cystic adnexal neoplasm on imaging.

We report the case of a GD patient treated with two weeks of high frequency (15 Hz) rTMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). At baseline and after rTMS treatment the patient underwent a SPECT examination with (123)I-FP-CIT tracer, to test changes in dopamine transporter (DAT) availability. The patient was followed up for six months, to explore safety and clinical correlates of a weekly high frequency rTMS maintenance treatment. Over the six-month follow-up the patient reported no episodes of gambling relapse. Also, the patient did not report craving for gambling or gambling-related symptoms. After two weeks of left DLPFC-rTMS treatment, we found a decrease in DAT availability in striatal regions, that represents a putative neurobiological substrate of dopaminergic pathways modulation. This study suggests that high frequency DLPFC-rTMS deserves further investigations in larger samples, using controlled study designs, to assess its real potential as a treatment for GD.",A follow-up study of mental health service utilisation in a cohort of 2433 sexually abused Australian children utilising five years of medical data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798015,Child abuse & neglect,2019 03 02,"There are well established links between child sex abuse (CSA) and a range of mental health adversities in the literature. However, there has been very limited examination of mental health care needs of CSA survivors, indicated by contacts with mental health professionals. Similarly, no existing research has examined rates of prescription of psychopharmacology to CSA survivors. Service utilisation is a vital component of the health landscape, and a clear understanding of the mental health care needs of CSA survivors is central to policy formation regarding mental health funding. Therefore, this study aimed to assess differences in rates of mental health care utilisation and rates of prescription of psychopharmacology during adulthood between individuals with a history of CSA and a comparison sample from the general population without a known abuse history.",The processing of color preference in the brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798014,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Decades of research has established that humans have preferences for some colors (e.g., blue) and a dislike of others (e.g., dark chartreuse), with preference varying systematically with variation in hue (e.g., Hurlbert and Owen, 2015). Here, we used functional MRI to investigate why humans have likes and dislikes for simple patches of color, and to understand the neural basis of preference, aesthetics and value judgements more generally. We looked for correlations of a behavioural measure of color preference with the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response when participants performed an irrelevant orientation judgement task on colored squares. A whole brain analysis found a significant correlation between BOLD activity and color preference in the posterior midline cortex (PMC), centred on the precuneus but extending into the adjacent posterior cingulate and cuneus. These results demonstrate that brain activity is modulated by color preference, even when such preferences are irrelevant to the ongoing task the participants are engaged. They also suggest that color preferences automatically influence our processing of the visual world. Interestingly, the effect in the PMC overlaps with regions identified in neuroimaging studies of preference and value judgements of other types of stimuli. Therefore, our findings extends this literature to show that the PMC is related to automatic encoding of subjective value even for basic visual features such as color.",Anterior insular cortex is a bottleneck of cognitive control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798012,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Cognitive control, with a limited capacity, is a core process in human cognition for the coordination of thoughts and actions. Although the regions involved in cognitive control have been identified as the cognitive control network (CCN), it is still unclear whether a specific region of the CCN serves as a bottleneck limiting the capacity of cognitive control (CCC). Here, we used a perceptual decision-making task with conditions of high cognitive load to challenge the CCN and to assess the CCC in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. We found that the activation of the right anterior insular cortex (AIC) of the CCN increased monotonically as a function of cognitive load, reached its plateau early, and showed a significant correlation to the CCC. In a subsequent study of patients with unilateral lesions of the AIC, we found that lesions of the AIC were associated with a significant impairment of the CCC. Simulated lesions of the AIC resulted in a reduction of the global efficiency of the CCN in a network analysis. These findings suggest that the AIC, as a critical hub in the CCN, is a bottleneck of cognitive control.",Age-related differences in reallocating cognitive resources when dealing with interruptions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798011,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"The ability to perform at a high level, even when the task at hand is interrupted by an unrelated secondary task, is central to human information processing. Executive control processes, in particular the reallocation of attentional resources, are crucial for coping with interruptions. Although the age-related decline in cognitive control functions is well described, the consequences of such changes for the ability to deal with interruptions are as of yet unclear. In the present study, we examined behavioral performance as well as electrophysiological parameters associated with executive control processes in older and younger participants using a nested task design: In one third of all trials, an ongoing working memory task was interrupted by a math task. We found that the impact of interruptions on primary task performance was more severe in the older age group. In the EEG, older adults showed stronger frontal midline theta activation and fronto-parietal connectivity in the theta range in response to the cue indicating the relevant attentional set. Younger participants, on the other hand, showed distinct and specific increases in cognitive control as indexed by frontal midline theta in response to the stimulus signaling an upcoming interruption. Overall, the results reveal strategic differences between the age groups, as older participants seem to prioritize the primary task more strongly. The data furthermore indicate that the combination of a rapid succession of events and the decreased ability to shift executive resources renders older adults' performance particularly vulnerable to the occurrence of interruptions.",Real-time fMRI neurofeedback training to improve eating behavior by self-regulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: A randomized controlled trial in overweight and obese subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798010,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Obesity is associated with altered responses to food stimuli in prefrontal brain networks that mediate inhibitory control of ingestive behavior. In particular, activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is reduced in obese compared to normal-weight subjects and has been linked to the success of weight-loss dietary interventions. In a randomized controlled trial in overweight/obese subjects, we investigated the effect on eating behavior of volitional up-regulation of dlPFC activity via real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training. Thirty-eight overweight or obese subjects (BMI 25-40 kg/m2) took part in fMRI neurofeedback training with the aim of increasing activity of the left dlPFC (dlPFC group; n = 17) or of the visual cortex (VC/control group; n = 21). Participants were blinded to group assignment. The training session took place on a single day and included three training runs of six trials of up-regulation and passive viewing. Food appraisal and snack intake were assessed at screening, after training, and in a follow-up session four weeks later. Participants of both groups succeeded in up-regulating activity of the targeted brain area. However, participants of the control group also showed increased left dlPFC activity during up-regulation. Functional connectivity between dlPFC and ventromedial PFC, an area that processes food value, was generally increased during up-regulation compared to passive viewing. At follow-up compared to baseline, both groups rated pictures of high-, but not low-calorie foods as less palatable and chose them less frequently. Actual snack intake remained unchanged but palatability and choice ratings for chocolate cookies decreased after training. We demonstrate that one session of fMRI neurofeedback training enables individuals with increased body weight to up-regulate activity of the left dlPFC. Behavioral effects were observed in both groups, which might have been due to dlPFC co-activation in the control group and, in addition, unspecific training effects. Improved dlPFC-vmPFC functional connectivity furthermore suggested enhanced food intake-related control mechanisms. Neurofeedback training might support therapeutic strategies aiming at improved self-control in obesity, although the respective contributions of area-specific mechanisms and general regulation effects are in need of further investigation.",Response time as a proxy of ongoing mental state: A combined fMRI and pupillometry study in Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798009,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"In Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), fluctuations in ongoing thoughts (i.e., mind-wandering) often take the form of rigid and intrusive perseverative cognition, such as worry. Here, we sought to characterise the neural correlates of mind-wandering and perseverative cognition, alongside autonomic nervous system indices of central arousal, notably pupil dilation. We implemented a protocol incorporating the dynamic delivery of thought-probes within a functional neuroimaging task. Sixteen individuals with GAD and sixteen matched healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging with concomitant pupillometry. Participants performed a series of low-demand tracking tasks, responding to occasional changes in a target stimulus. Such a task is typically accompanied by self-generated, off-task thinking. Thought-probes were triggered based on an individual's response time (RT) when responding to the change in the target. Subjective reports showed that long RT predicted off-task thinking/mind-wandering. Moreover, long RT and mind-wandering were also associated with larger pupil diameter. This effect was exaggerated in GAD patients during perseverative cognition. Within brain, during both pre-target periods and target events, there were distinct neural correlates for mind-wandering (e.g., anterior cingulate and paracingulate activation at target onset) and perseverative cognition (e.g., opposite patterns of activation in posterior cingulate and cerebellum at target onset in HC and GAD). Results suggest that not only attention systems but also sensory-motor cortices are important during off-task states. Interestingly, changes across the 'default mode network' also tracked fluctuations in pupillary size. Autonomic expression in pupillary changes mirrors brain activation patterns that occur during different forms of repetitive thinking.",In vivo measurement of brain network connectivity reflects progression and intrinsic disease severity in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30798008,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 15,"Different types of brain injury, such as status epilepticus (SE), trauma, or stroke may initiate the process of epileptogenesis and lead to the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. Epileptogenesis is characterized by an initial latent period during which impaired network communication and synaptic circuit alterations are occurring. Ultimately, these modifications result in the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Current knowledge on the functional connectivity network changes during epileptogenesis and how network alterations relate to seizure is very limited. To investigate these underlying network connectivity modifications, we imaged epileptic and control rats by means of resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) during epileptogenesis. A cohort of animals was video-electroencephalography (video-EEG) monitored continuously over 12 weeks to determine disease severity during the course of disease, with the first SRS appearing around 2 weeks post-SE for most of the animals. Epileptic animals displayed a significant wide-spread hyposynchrony at 2 weeks post-SE, followed by a significant increase in network synchronicity from 2 to 4 weeks post-SE. Interestingly, subjects with a delayed epilepsy onset demonstrated significantly lower synchronicity compared to controls and the epileptic group at 4 weeks post-SE. Finally, network connectivity at 4 weeks post-SE was found to correlate with seizure onset (r = 0.858, p < .0001) and disease severity measured over 12 weeks (e.g. cingulate cortex: r = 0.863, p = .002), suggesting a possible network strengthening upon seizure reoccurrence. Our findings indicate that epileptogenesis is characterized by an initial hyposynchrony of brain networks and the disease-associated progression reflects disease severity."

This creates the need to find trade-offs between temporal coordination and spatial alignment. To study coordination under incongruent spatial and temporal demands, we devised a novel coordination task that required task partners to synchronize their actions while tracing different shapes that implied conflicting velocity profiles. In three experiments, we investigated whether coordination under incongruent demands is best achieved through mutually coupled predictions or through a clear role distribution with only one task partner adjusting to the other. Participants solved the task of trading off spatial and temporal coordination demands equally well when mutually perceiving each other's actions without any role distribution, and when acting in a leader-follower configuration where the leader was unable to see the follower's actions. Coordination was significantly worse when task partners who had been assigned roles could see each other's actions. These findings make three contributions to our understanding of coordination mechanisms in joint action. First, they show that mutual prediction facilitates coordination under incongruent demands, demonstrating the importance of coupled predictive models in a wide range of coordination contexts. Second, they show that mutual alignment of velocity profiles in the absence of a leader-follower dynamic is more wide-spread than previously thought. Finally, they show that role distribution can result in equally effective coordination as mutual prediction without role assignment, provided that the role distribution is not arbitrarily imposed but determined by (lack of) perceptual access to a partner's actions.",Generation of an integration-free iPSC line(SYSUi001-A) from a sporadic Alzheimer's disease patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797990,Stem cell research,2019 05 05,"Human iPSC line, iPSC-ADM01(SYSUi001-A), was generated from a 70-year-old male patient with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, using non-integrative reprogramming method.

Mental imagery can increase engagement in planned behaviours, potentially due to its special role in representing emotionally salient experiences. The present study tested the hypothesis that mental imagery promotes motivation and engagement when planning pleasant and rewarding activities. Participants were recruited from a community volunteer panel (N = 72). They self-nominated six activities to complete over the following week, and were randomized to either: a) a single-session Motivational Imagery condition (N = 24); b) an Activity Reminder control condition (N = 24); or c) a No-Reminder control condition (N = 24). As predicted, relative to control groups, the Motivational Imagery group reported higher levels of motivation, anticipated pleasure, and anticipated reward for the planned activities. The Motivational Imagery group also completed significantly more activities than the Activity Reminder group, but not more than the No-Reminder group. Relevance of results to behavioural activation approaches for depression are discussed.",Long-term generation of antiPCSK9 antibody using a nanoliposome-based vaccine delivery system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797988,Atherosclerosis,2019 03 23,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a liver secretory enzyme that controls plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels through modulation of LDL receptor (LDLR). Inhibition of PCSK9 using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can efficiently lower plasma LDL-C. However, the relatively short half-life of mAbs necessitates frequent passive immunization, which is costly.

Since hemichannels are permeable to relatively large molecules, their exacerbated activity has been linked to cell damage. Cx46 is highly expressed in the lens and its mutations have been associated to cataract formation, but it is unknown whether Cx46 has a role in non-genetic cataract formation (i.e. aging and diabetes). Nitric oxide (NO) is a key element in non-genetic cataract formation and Cx46 hemichannels have been shown to be sensitive to NO. The molecular mechanisms of the effects of NO on Cx46 are unknown, but are likely to result from Cx46 S-nitrosation (also known as S-nitrosylation). In this work, we found that lens opacity was correlated with Cx46 S-nitrosation in an animal model of cataract. Consistent with this result, a NO donor increased Cx46 S-nitrosation and hemichannel opening in HLE-B3 cells (cell line derived from human lens epithelial cells). Mutagenesis studies point to the cysteine located in the fourth transmembrane helix (TM4; human C212, rat C218) as the NO sensor. Electrophysiological studies performed in Xenopus oocytes revealed that rat Cx46 hemichannels are sensitive to different NO donors, and that the presence of C218 is necessary to observe the NO donors' effects. Unexpectedly, gap junctions formed by Cx46 were insensitive to NO or the reducing agent dithiothreitol. We propose that increased hemichannel opening and/or changes in their electrophysiological properties of human Cx46 due to S-nitrosation of the cysteine in TM4 could be an important factor in cataract formation.","Sub-lethal doses of polybrominated diphenyl ethers affect some biomarkers involved in energy balance and cell cycle, via oxidative stress in the marine fish cell line SAF-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797971,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 10,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of persistent contaminants which are found all over the world in the marine environment. Sparus aurata fibroblast cell line (SAF-1) was exposed to increasing concentrations of PBDEs 47 and 99, until 72 h to evaluate the cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the expression of some selected molecular markers related to cell cycle, cell signaling, energetic balance and oxidative stress (p53, erk-1, hif-1α and nrf-2), by real-time PCR. Furthermore, SAF-1 cells were exposed for 7 and 15 days to sub-lethal concentrations, in order to evaluate the response of some biomarkers by immunoblotting (p53, ERK-1, AMPK, HIF-1α and NRF-2). After 48 and 72 h, the cells showed a significant decrease of cell vitality as well as an increase of intracellular ROS production. Gene expression analysis showed that sub-lethal concentrations of BDE-99 and 47, after 72 h, up-regulated cell cycle and oxidative stress biomarkers, although exposure to 100 μmol L-1 down-regulated the selected markers related to cell cycle, cell signaling, energetic balance. After 7 and 15 days of sub-lethal doses exposure, all the analyzed markers resulted affected by the contaminants. Our results suggest that PBDEs influence the cells homeostasis first of all via oxidative stress, reducing the cell response and defense capacity and affecting its energetic levels. This situation of stress and energy imbalance could represents a condition that, modifying some of the analyzed biochemical pathways, would predispose to cellular transformation.",Iron-induced oxidative stress contributes to α-synuclein phosphorylation and up-regulation via polo-like kinase 2 and casein kinase 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797969,Neurochemistry international,2019 05 23,"α-Synuclein plays a central role in synucleinopathies pathogenesis such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Phosphorylation is the most common and important protein modification linked to α-synuclein pathologies. There is mounting evidence suggested iron and α-synuclein are closely related in PD. We previously reported iron up-regulated α-synuclein mRNA levels and induced α-synuclein aggregation. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether and how phosphorylation was involved in iron-induced α-synuclein regulations. The results showed that iron could induce pS129 α-synuclein (phosphorylation at Ser129) and α-synuclein upregulation in the substantia nigra of iron-overloaded rats and iron-treated SH-SY5Y cells, accompanied by the elevated levels of polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) and casein kinase 2 (CK2). Over-expression of CK2 or PLK2 induced pS129 α-synuclein up-regulation and inhibitors of CK2 or PLK2 could suppress iron-induced α-synuclein phosphorylation. Antioxidant NAC could fully block iron-induced upregulation of CK2, PLK2 and pS129 α-synuclein levels, indicating oxidative stress plays a critical role in iron-induced α-synuclein phosphorylation. However, iron-induced α-synuclein up-regulation could only be partially blocked by CK2/PLK2 inhibitor or NAC. These findings demonstrate that iron-induced oxidative stress is largely responsible for α-synuclein phosphorylation and upregulation via CK2 and PLK2, and α-synuclein upregulation is not fully phosphorylation-dependent.",Echinacoside selectively rescues complex I inhibition-induced mitochondrial respiratory impairment via enhancing complex II activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797968,Neurochemistry international,2019 05 23,"Previous investigations have implicated mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by Complex I deficiency in the death of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, there are no efficient therapeutic approaches to rescue mitochondrial respiratory impairment or prevent neurodegeneration in PD. The beneficial effects of echinacoside (ECH) on neurodegeneration have been reported in both in vivo and in vitro studies, yet the mechanisms underlying remain elusive and little has been investigated concerning the influences of ECH on mitochondrial respiratory impairment. Here, we compared the protection of ECH on cell injury and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by various inhibitors of Complex I-IV using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. We found that ECH selectively attenuates cell injury, reverses mitochondrial depolarization and bioenergetic failure caused by Complex I inhibitors, whereas it has little protection against Complex II-IV inhibitors. Further investigation demonstrated that ECH enhances Complex II activity and mitochondrial respiration in the cells treated with Complex I inhibitors. This suggests that ECH selectively rescues Complex I inhibition-induced mitochondrial respiratory impairment though elevating Complex II activity, and further confirms that ECH might have a promising potential in PD treatment.",Gene grouping strategy for network modeling from a small time-series dataset: An illustrative analysis of human organogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797967,Bio Systems,2019 03 31,"Several algorithms have been proposed for modeling a gene regulatory network from a time-series expression dataset, but these have been used in relatively few studies because experimental cost often restricts the number of sampling time points to less than that of genes by more than one order of magnitude. In order to reduce the number of parameters for network modeling, we propose a method for grouping genes by both temporal expression pattern and biological function, modeling interactions between the gene groups by a dynamic Bayesian network approach. Results from applying the method to a gene expression dataset on human organogenesis demonstrate that more biologically plausible results can be obtained by modeling an interaction network for groups of genes than by modeling that for single genes.","Influenza A(H7N9) virus emerged and resulted in human infections in Chongqing, southwestern China since 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797966,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 04 13,"Influenza A(H7N9) virus has emerged and resulted in human infections in Chongqing, southwestern China since 2017.

This study used quantitative sensory testing to assess pain experience in healthy, pain-free adults (n = 137 NAs (87 female), n = 145 non-Hispanic whites (NHW; 68 female)) after painful electric, heat, cold, ischemic, and pressure stimuli. After each stimulus, ratings of pain intensity, sensory pain, affective pain, pain-related anxiety, and situation-specific pain catastrophizing were assessed. The results suggested that NAs reported greater sensory pain in response to suprathreshold electric and heat stimuli, greater pain-related anxiety to heat and ischemic stimuli, and more catastrophic thoughts in response to electric and heat stimuli. Sex differences were also noted; however, with the exception of catastrophic thoughts to cold, these finding were not moderated by race/ethnicity. Together, findings suggest NAs experience heightened sensory, anxiety, and catastrophizing reactions to painful stimuli. This could place NAs at risk for future chronic pain and could ultimately lead to a vicious cycle that maintains pain (eg, pain → anxiety/catastrophizing → pain). PERSPECTIVE: NAs experienced heightened sensory, anxiety, and catastrophizing reactions in response to multiple pain stimuli. Given the potential for anxiety and catastrophic thoughts to amplify pain, this characteristic may place them at risk for pain disorders and could lead to a vicious cycle that maintains pain.",The Role of Perceived Stress and Life Stressors in the Development of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain Disorders: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797962,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 04 09,"The etiologic role of work-related psychological stress in the development of musculoskeletal pain disorders (MDs) has been systematically investigated.

This review aimed to assess the evidence for an etiologic role of perceived stress and life stressors in the development of chronic MDs. Database searches were conducted to identify prospective longitudinal studies that assessed perceived stress and life stressors in individuals without, or in the first 6 weeks of, musculoskeletal pain. The primary outcome was the development of a chronic MD. Methodologic quality was investigated using an adapted version of the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort studies and Cross-Sectional studies, and the strength of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Seven studies were included representing data from 6 independent cohorts. There was some evidence to support the etiologic role of perceived stress and life stressors in the development of arthritis (low quality) and chronic spinal pain (low quality). The limited number of studies, the poor quality of the evidence, and the heterogeneity of stress measures used across studies suggest that further high quality prospective studies are required to clarify the role of perceived stress and life stressors in the development of chronic MDs. PROSPERO: CRD42017059949 PERSPECTIVE: This review summarizes and critically appraises the evidence for the etiologic role of perceived stress and life stressors in the development of chronic MDs. The limited number of studies, the low quality of the evidence, and the heterogeneity across studies suggest that further research is needed on perceived stress and life stressors in MDs."

Enucleation requires specific signal transduction pathways and the local assembly of contractile actomyosin rings. However, the energy source driving these events has not yet been identified. We examined whether different O2 environments (hypoxic [5% O2] and normoxic [21% O2] conditions) affected human CD34+ cell erythroblast differentiation. We also investigated the regulatory mechanisms underlying energy production in erythroblasts during terminal differentiation under 5% or 21% O2 conditions. The results obtained revealed that the enucleation ratio and intracellular levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) M3H, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α in erythroblasts during terminal differentiation were higher under the 5% O2 condition than under the 21% O2 condition. We also found that the enzymatic inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and LDH, key enzymes in anaerobic glycolysis, blocked the proliferation of colony-forming units-erythroid and enucleation of erythroblasts, and also reduced ATP levels in erythroblasts under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Under both conditions, phosphorylation of the Ser232, Ser293, and Ser300 residues in pyruvate dehydrogenase (inactive state of the enzyme) in erythroblasts was involved in regulating the pathway governing energy metabolism during erythroid terminal differentiation. This reaction may be mediated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) 4, the major PDK isozyme expressed in erythroblasts undergoing enucleation. Collectively, these results suggest that ATP produced by anaerobic glycolysis is the main source of energy for human erythroblast enucleation in the hypoxic bone marrow environment.",Neurophysiological and behavioral evidence that self-uncertainty salience increases self-esteem striving.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797949,Biological psychology,2019 04 29,"The present research investigated the effect of self-uncertainty salience on self-esteem striving, as well as the corresponding self-regulatory processes. Inspired by uncertainty management and meaning maintenance models, we conducted an electroencephalogram experiment to examine how self-uncertainty salience affects performance on self-esteem related tasks, and how it affects neurophysiological activity related to performance monitoring (e.g., error-related negativity, error positivity) on those tasks. Results showed that when self-uncertainty was salient, participants performed better on a task that was high (but not low) in self-esteem relevance, and these participants also displayed a larger amplitude of error positivity after error commissions, which is considered a manifestation of heightened performance monitoring. Overall, these results suggest that self-uncertainty salience increases the need and efforts for self-esteem striving. Further implications are discussed in terms of meaning compensation and self-uncertainty management.",Cumulative cortisol exposure in the third trimester correlates with postpartum mothers' neural response to emotional interference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797948,Biological psychology,2019 04 29,"Prolonged stress affects the central nervous system, rendering individuals vulnerable to a wide range of mental health disorders. 76 healthy postpartum mothers were studied by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging within 6 days of childbirth.

Hair samples were collected to determine cumulative hair cortisol concentration (HCC) in the third trimester. HCC was found to be negatively correlated with the recruitment of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the midcingulate cortex (MCC). In response to the emotional interference of only anxious target faces, a negative correlation was seen between HCC and the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, extending to the rostral ACC and the MCC.

Autoimmune diseases are heterogeneous conditions that involve the breakdown of tolerogenic circuitries and consequent activation of autoreactive immune cells. Therefore, critical enzymes along amino acid degradative pathways may be hijacked to keep in check autoimmunity. We examined here current knowledge of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and arginase 1 (ARG1), the main enzymes catabolizing tryptophan and arginine, respectively, in organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases as well as in the development of autoantibodies to therapeutic proteins. At variance with neoplastic contexts, in which it is known to act as a pure immunosuppressive molecule, ARG1 exhibited a protective or pathogenetic profile, depending on the disease. In contrast, in several autoimmune conditions, the bulk of data indicated that drugs capable of potentiating IDO1 expression and activity may represent valuable therapeutic tools and that IDO1-based immunotherapeutic protocols could be more effective if tailored to the genetic profile of individual patients.",Risk Factors for Development of and Progression of Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797942,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 04 13,"Veno-occlusive disease, also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (VOD/SOS), is a potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) most commonly associated with high-intensity chemotherapies. The development of VOD/SOS may be rapid and unpredictable, and the importance of identifying risk factors to facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely treatment has become increasingly recognized. The reporting of new retrospective study data for adults and children and the emergence of novel anticancer therapies that may increase the risk of VOD/SOD also necessitate updates on risk factors, as provided in this review. The latest studies reporting VOD/SOS risk factors support previously published data, although the importance of patient-related factors, such as acute kidney injury, increased international normalized ratio, female sex (in children), and platelet refractoriness, is given greater emphasis in the recent data. Non-transplantation-related chemotherapies associated with increased risk for VOD/SOS include oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapies. The novel antibody drug conjugates gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin are now reported in product labeling to pose risks for VOD/SOS based on clinical trial data; an expert consensus panel has issued recommendations for risk reduction measures with inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment, including VOD/SOS prophylaxis and limitation to ≤2 inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment cycles. A wide range of biomarkers, including genetic, hematologic, hepatic, and inflammatory factors, as well as novel diagnostic techniques such as thromboelastography and measures of liver stiffness, may further enhance future risk calculation for VOD/SOS, although none has been widely adopted.

However, many factors influence the estimation of divergence times, and uncertainty in the inferred time trees remains a major issue that is often insufficiently acknowledged. We here focus on a fundamental problem of time tree analysis: the combination of slow-evolving (nuclear DNA) and fast-evolving (mitochondrial DNA) markers in a single time tree. Both markers differ in their suitability to infer divergences at different time scales (the 'genome-timescale-dilemma'). However, strategies to infer shallow and deep divergences in a single time tree have rarely been compared empirically. Using Mediterranean amphibians as model system that is exceptional in its geographic and taxonomic completeness of available genetic information, we analyze 202 lineages of western Palearctic amphibians across the entire Mediterranean region. We compiled data of four nuclear and five mitochondrial genes and used twelve fossil calibration points widely acknowledged for amphibian evolution. We reconstruct time trees for an extensive lineage-level data set and compare the performances of the different trees: the first tree is based on primary fossil calibration and mitochondrial DNA, while the second tree is based on a combination of primary fossil and on secondary calibrations taken from a nuclear tree using mitochondrial DNA (two-step protocol). Focusing on a set of nodes that are most likely explained by vicariance, we statistically compare the reconstructed alternative time trees by applying a biogeographical plausibility test. Our two-step protocol outperformed the alternative approach in terms of spatial and temporal plausibility. It allows us to infer scenarios for Mediterranean amphibian evolution in eight geographic provinces. We identified several tectonic and climatic events explaining the majority of Mediterranean amphibian divergences, with Plio-Pleistocene climatic fluctuations being the dominant driver for intrageneric evolution. However, often more than one event could be invoked for a specific split. We give recommendations for the use of secondary calibrations in future molecular clock analyses at the community level."

We describe a case of an ectopic TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma located in the nasopharynx in a patient initially presenting with signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism that persisted despite treatment with anti-thyroid medications. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary gland was normal, though subsequent review by neuroradiology revealed a nodule attached to the posterior septum in the nasopharynx that was, in retrospect, seen on several other MR scans. Gallium (Ga)-68-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) showed increased uptake in the nasopharyngeal nodule. The patient underwent resection of the nasopharyngeal mass with remission of the hyperthyroidism. On pathology, the resected mass stained positive for TSH and prolactin (PRL).

Presently, most chest tube removal protocols include a fluid output threshold based on a 24-hour observation period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if, within a 24-hour time period, fluid output measurements at 6, 8, and 12hours could predict if the total 24-hour fluid output would comply with a predetermined volume threshold considered acceptable for safe chest tube removal. Following lung resection, pleural fluid output data were prospectively recorded by a digital drainage system and analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-four-hour fluid output was calculated from every available 6-, 8-, and 12-hour measurement and compared to set 24-hour output criteria for chest tube removal (ie, 400mL, 250mL, and 20% of whole-body lymphatic flow). Performance of interim fluid outputs in predicting whether 24-hour fluid output criteria were satisfied was measured. From 2015 to 2018, 150 patients had digital pleural fluid drainage data suitable for analysis. Performance of interim fluid output data in identifying which patients would satisfy 24-hour output criteria ranged from 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 83-86) to 94% (95% CI = 93-94) for specificity, 75% (95% CI = 73-76) to 92% (95% CI = 90-93) for positive predictive value, and 6% (95% CI = 6-7) to 15% (95% CI = 14-17) for false-positive rate. Potential time saved in duration of drainage using interim fluid output data ranged from 10 to 16hours.

Ideally, protein tags are introduced into a gene of interest by homologous recombination to ensure expression from endogenous control elements. However, inefficient homologous recombination makes this approach difficult in mammalian cells. Although gene targeting efficiency by homologous recombination increased dramatically with the development of designer endonuclease systems such as CRISPR/Cas9 capable of inducing DNA double-strand breaks with unprecedented accuracy, the strategies still require synthesis or cloning of homology templates for every single gene. Recent developments have shown that endogenous protein tagging can be achieved efficiently in a homology independent manner. Hence, combinations between CRISPR/Cas9 and generic tag-donor plasmids have been used successfully for targeted gene modifications in mammalian cells. Here, we developed a tool kit comprising a CRISPR/Cas9 expression vector with several EGFP encoding plasmids that should enable tagging of almost every protein expressed in mammalian cells. By performing protein-protein interaction and subcellular localization studies of mTORC1 signal transduction pathway-related proteins expressed in HEK293T cells, we show that tagged proteins faithfully reflect the behavior of their native counterparts under physiological conditions.",Structural and biochemical analysis of DNA lesion-induced RNA polymerase II arrest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797902,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2019 03 29,"Transcription, catalyzed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in eukaryotes, is the first step in gene expression. RNA Pol II is a 12-subunit enzyme complex regulated by many different transcription factors during transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. During elongation, Pol II encounters various types of obstacles that can cause transcriptional pausing and arrest. Through decades of research on transcriptional pausing, it is widely known that Pol II can distinguish between different types of obstacles by its active site. A major class of obstacles is DNA lesions. While some DNA lesions can cause transient transcriptional pausing, which can be bypassed by Pol II itself or with the help from other elongation factors, bulky DNA damage can cause prolonged transcriptional pausing and arrest, which signals for transcription coupled repair. Using biochemical and structural biology approaches, the outcomes of many different types of DNA lesions, DNA modifications, and DNA binding molecules to transcription were studied. In this mini review, we will describe the in vitro transcription assays with Pol II to investigate the impacts of various DNA lesions on transcriptional outcomes and the crystallization method of lesion-arrested Pol II complex. These methods can provide a general platform for the structural and biochemical analysis of Pol II transcriptional pausing and bypass mechanisms.",Intraoperative injection of combined fibrin sealant and methylene blue dye for surgery of branchial cleft cysts: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797901,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2019 03 11,"Differential diagnosis of a lateral neck mass, especially in paediatric patients, should include branchial cleft cysts (BrCC).

Tisseel fibrin glue (FG: Baxter AG, Vienna, Austria) was mixed with methylene blue dye in inverse portion to the cyst size and/or the FG volume before injecting into the cystic lumen. After polymerisation of the dyed glue, the lesion was better visualised and extirpated in toto with the aid of the dye colour and gelatinisation by FG.

However, there are few reports of Rk1 activity against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). In this study, the anti-proliferation and potential mechanisms of Rk1 in MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated. Xenograft model exhibited that Rk1 significantly repressed tumor growth with low toxicity to major organs. Moreover, Rk1 dramatically inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, promoted LDH release, and induced G0/G1 phase arrest. Rk1 also triggered intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential reduction. Western blot results revealed that Rk1 increased the expression of Bax, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase 3, 8 and 9 levels and decreased Bcl-2 level and blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, PI3K/Akt pathway activator insulin or ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) further demonstrated that ROS/PI3K/Akt pathway was responsible for Rk1-induced apoptosis.

Deficits in learning and memory are often the first signs of disease onset in both HD patients and mouse models of HD and are in part regulated by the hippocampus. In the R6/2 mouse model of HD, GABAergic transmission can be excitatory in the hippocampus and restoring inhibition can rescue the associated memory deficits. In the present study we determine that hippocampal GABAergic neurotransmission in the R6/2 mouse is disrupted as early as 4 weeks of age and is accompanied by alterations in the expression of key inhibitory proteins. Specifically, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents were initially increased in frequency at 4 postnatal weeks and subsequently decreased after the mice displayed the typical R6/2 behavioral phenotype at 10 weeks of age. Symptomatic mice also exhibited a change in the probability of GABA release and changes in the basic membrane properties including neuronal excitability and input resistance. These electrophysiological changes in presymptomatic and symptomatic R6/2 mice were further accompanied by alterations in the protein expression level of pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory markers. Taken together, the present findings demonstrate profound alterations in the inhibitory neurotransmission in the hippocampus across the lifespan of the disease, including prior to neuronal degeneration, which suggests that the inhibitory hippocampal synapses may prove useful as a target for future therapeutic design."

By contrast, real-world studies explore the effectiveness of treatments in routine clinical practice, often with diverse patient populations. Although both randomized controlled trials and real-world studies contribute to the understanding of the benefits and risks of therapies, they generate different types of data and serve complementary purposes. Real-world studies evaluating the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration have shown that visual outcomes achieved with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor in clinical practice often differ from those derived from clinical trials, highlighting the importance of assessing such outcomes in real-world studies. Benefits include finding variations in treatment provision, leading to: service improvements; the understanding of the need for continued and higher than previously provided treatment frequency; and new treatment regimens such as treat-and-extend. There is potential for the scope of real-world studies to be expanded to include other patient outcomes, such as quality of life, thus providing decision-makers with additional information to complement the data collected in randomized controlled trials. Physicians, patients, and regulators stand to gain much from further development and the conduct of real-world studies.

However, despite continuous advancements in the delivery of NPs, endosomal escape remains a major issue and a matter of grave concern for developing an efficient and targeted delivery system for therapeutic applications. Most of NPs generally follow endocytic pathway for internalization into the cells. Following the internalization process, NPs must escape into the cell cytoplasm for evading degradation by hydrolytic enzymes present in the lysosomes. Various types of lipids have been used in the past viz. fusogenic lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), pH-sensitive lipids, cationic lipid and multiple charges containing lipid to escape from endosomes. Recently, several novel polymers, pH-sensitive peptides, proteins and many others endosomolytic agents have been identified and developed for incorporating into gene and drug delivery system to facilitate endosomal escape. In this review, endosomal escape mechanisms of different types of NPs have been discussed in detail and compared with endosomal escape mechanisms of viruses and other synthetic gene delivery systems to escape from endosomes. Also, the designing of endosomolytic agents to facilitate endosomal escape based on different approaches and strategies is explored.

Earlier we showed that 2-methoxyestradiol increases the level and activity of cyclin B1/CDK1, which subsequently induces mitotic prometaphase arrest. In the present study, we demonstrate that upregulation of cyclin B1/CDK1 is responsible for the increased phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in 2-methoxyestradiol-induced, mitotically-arrested cancer cells. Additional analysis shows that only the increase in phosphorylation of Bcl-XL, but not Bcl-2, is associated with activation of the mitochondrial cell death pathway. We find that MAD2 is an important upstream mediator of the antitubulin function of 2-methoxyestradiol, resulting in activation of the MKK4-JNK1 pathway. JNK1 activation then leads to cyclin B1/CDK1 upregulation, which further increases Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL phosphorylation. Together, these results indicate that cyclin B1/CDK1 upregulation in cancer cells undergoing 2-methoxyestradiol-induced mitotic catastrophe causes apoptosis via Bcl-XL phosphorylation.",Design and synthesis of fluorescently labeled steroidal antiestrogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797876,Steroids,2019 03 12,"A set of derivatives of 11β-(4-oxyphenyl)estradiol were prepared as potential fluorescent imaging agents for the evaluation of the estrogen receptor.

Two organoclays, named N116_HDTA and N116_TMSA, were prepared using a commercially available sodium bentonite clay and the organic modifiers hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (HDTA) and octadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (TMSA). An in vitro hazard assessment was performed using HaCaT skin cells, C3A liver cells, and J774.1 macrophage-like cells. Organic modification with HDTA and TMSA increased the hazard potential of the organoclays in all cell models, as evidenced by the higher levels of cytotoxicity measured. N116_TMSA caused the greatest loss in viability with IC50 values of 3.2, 3.6 and 6.1 μg/cm2 calculated using J774.1, HaCaT and C3A cell lines, respectively. Cytotoxic effects were dictated by the amount of free or displaced organic modifier present in the exposure suspensions.

In this study, we investigated via LC-MS/MS, the content of 19 different types of PFCs in 302 samples belonging to five different categories of the typical South Korean seafood. The highest levels of PFOA, PFTrDA, PFOS, and PFPeA were found in dried seafood, canned and salted seafood, processed fish food, and seasoned laver, respectively. The levels of PFOA and PFOS were compared on the basis of various criteria including the nomenclature, biological classification, and habitat of the source of seafood. High levels of PFOA and PFOS were detected in anchovy, sea squirt, and mackerel based on the nomenclature of raw seafood, in crustaceans based on the biological classification, and in demersal organisms based on the habitat. The human intake values of PFOA and PFOS from the processed marine products in South Korea were lower than the tolerable daily intake, indicating that the consumption of these processed seafood poses no immediate harm.","Comparative phytochemical, cytotoxicity, antioxidant and haemostatic studies of Taraxacum officinale root preparations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797873,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 05 06,"Although the majority of potentially bioactive components of dandelion root have been described, revealing the presence of hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) and sesquiterpene lactones (SLs), new compounds are still being discovered, an example of which are the recently characterized 4-hydroxyphenylacetate inositol esters (PIEs). In this work, the dandelion root was separated into five preparations (A-E) differing in chemical content. A detailed LC-MS and chemical investigation of dandelion fractions allowed the identification of about 100 phytochemicals, including new compounds for the genus Taraxacum, and the plant kingdom, such as amino acid-SL adducts. In the DPPH● test, two preparations characterized by high content of HCAs (D and E) showed the highest free radical scavenging activity, while other demonstrated weaker action. In turn, in blood plasma, the best overall protective effect against oxidation by H2O2/Fe was obtained in the presence of preparations A (SL-amino acid adducts enriched fraction) and C (PIEs enriched fraction). A stronger anticoagulant effect was demonstrated for two preparations enriched with HCAs (D and E).

To this day, INH remains a cornerstone of modern tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy. This review describes the serendipitous discovery of INH, its effectiveness on TB patients, and early studies to discover its mechanisms of bacteriocidal activity. Forty years after its introduction as a TB drug, the development of gene transfer in mycobacteria enabled the discovery of the genes encoding INH resistance, namely, the activator (katG) and the target (inhA) of INH. Further biochemical and x-ray crystallography studies on KatG and InhA proteins and mutants provided comprehensive understanding of INH mode of action and resistance mechanisms. Bacterial cultures can harbor subpopulations that are genetically or phenotypically resistant cells, the latter known as persisters. Treatment of exponentially growing cultures of M. tuberculosis with INH reproducibly kills 99% to 99.9% of cells in 3 days. Importantly, the surviving cells are slowly replicating or non-replicating cells expressing a unique stress response signature: these are the persisters. These persisters can be visualized using dual-reporter mycobacteriophages and their formation prevented using reducing compounds, such as N-acetylcysteine or vitamin C, that enhance M. tuberculosis' respiration. Altogether, this review portrays a detailed molecular analysis of INH killing and resistance mechanisms including persistence. The phenomenon of persistence is clearly the single greatest impediment to TB control, and research aimed at understanding persistence will provide new strategies to improve TB chemotherapy.",APOBEC3 Host Restriction Factors of HIV-1 Can Change the Template Switching Frequency of Reverse Transcriptase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797859,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 01,"The APOBEC3 family of deoxycytidine deaminases has the ability to restrict HIV-1 through deamination-dependent and deamination-independent mechanisms. Although the generation of mutations through deamination of cytosine to uracil in single-stranded HIV-1 (-) DNA is the dominant mechanism of restriction, the deaminase-independent mechanism additionally contributes. Previous observations indicate that APOBEC3 enzymes competitively bind the RNA template or reverse transcriptase (RT) and act as a roadblock to DNA polymerization. Here we studied how the deamination-independent inhibition of HIV-1 RT by APOBEC3C S188I, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3H affected RT template switching. We found that APOBEC3F could promote template switching of RT, and this was dependent on the high affinity with which it bound nucleic acids, suggesting than an APOBEC3 ""road-block"" can force template switching. Our data demonstrate that the deamination-independent functions of APOBEC3 enzymes extend beyond only disrupting RT DNA polymerization. Since alterations to the RT template switching frequency can result in insertions or deletions, our data support a model in which APOBEC3 enzymes use multiple mechanisms to increase the probability of generating a mutated and nonfunctional virus in addition to cytosine deamination.","Electrostatic Steering Enables Flow-Activated Von Willebrand Factor to Bind Platelet Glycoprotein, Revealed by Single-Molecule Stretching and Imaging.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797858,Journal of molecular biology,2019 05 08,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF), a large multimeric blood protein, senses changes in shear stress during bleeding and responds by binding platelets to plug ruptures in the vessel wall. Molecular mechanisms underlying this dynamic process are difficult to uncover using standard approaches due to the challenge of applying mechanical forces while monitoring structure and activity. By combining single-molecule fluorescence imaging with high-pressure, rapidly switching microfluidics, we reveal the key role of electrostatic steering in accelerating the binding between flow-activated VWF and GPIbα, and in rapidly immobilizing platelets under flow. We measure the elongation and tension-dependent activation of individual VWF multimers under a range of ionic strengths and pH levels, and find that the association rate is enhanced by 4 orders of magnitude by electrostatic steering. Under supraphysiologic salt concentrations, strong electrostatic screening dramatically decreases platelet binding to VWF in flow, revealing the critical role of electrostatic attraction in VWF-platelet binding during bleeding.",Structural Conservation of the Two Phosphoinositide-Binding Sites in WIPI Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797857,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 01,"WIPI proteins are mammalian PROPPIN family members that bind to phosphoinositides and play prominent roles in autophagosome biogenesis. Two phosphoinositide-binding sites were previously described in yeast PROPPIN Hsv2 but remain to be determined in mammalian WIPI proteins. Here, we characterized four human WIPI proteins (WIPI1-4) and solved the structure of WIPI3. WIPI proteins can bind to PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2 and adopt a conventional seven-bladed β-propeller fold. The structure of WIPI3 revealed that WIPI proteins also contain two sites embedded in blades 5 and 6 for recognizing phosphoinositides, resembling that in Hsv2. Structural comparison further demonstrated that the two conserved phosphoinositide-binding sites in PROPPIN proteins are not identical but intrinsically tend to recognize different types of phosphoinositides. This work provides the structural evidence to support the conservation of the two phosphoinositide-binding sites in WIPI proteins and also uncovers the potential phosphoinositide-binding selectivity for each site.",Structural Factors Enabling Successful GFP-Like Proteins with Alanine as the Third Chromophore-Forming Residue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797856,Journal of molecular biology,2019 06 10,"GFP-like proteins from lancelets (lanFPs) is a new and least studied group that already generated several outstanding biomarkers (mNeonGreen is the brightest FP to date) and has some unique features. Here, we report the study of four homologous lanFPs with GYG and GYA chromophores. Until recently, it was accepted that the third chromophore-forming residue in GFP-like proteins should be glycine, and efforts to replace it were in vain. Now, we have the first structure of a fluorescent protein with a successfully matured chromophore that has alanine as the third chromophore-forming residue. Consideration of the protein structures revealed two alternative routes of posttranslational transformation, resulting in either chromophore maturation or hydrolysis of GYG/GYA tripeptide. Both transformations are catalyzed by the same set of catalytic residues, Arg88 and Glu35-Wat-Glu211 cluster, whereas the residues in positions 62 and 102 shift the equilibrium between chromophore maturation and hydrolysis.",Dopamine D4 receptor gene expression plays important role in extinction and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797855,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 23,"Dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) dysregulation is associated with a variety of behaviors including novelty-seeking, approach avoidance, and ADHD. DRD4 has also been shown to interact with the environment to produce changes in behavior and longevity. The present study sought to examine the role of DRD4 on cocaine-seeking behavior in the conditioned place preference (CPP) test and determine its effects on extinction and reinstatement in adult wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HT), and knockout (KO) mice. Results revealed that all mice, regardless of sex or genotype, developed a similar acquisition for a cocaine place preference. Female DRD4 KO mice failed to extinguish their preference for the cocaine-paired chamber following the extinction period. Male DRD4 KO mice failed to reinstate their preference after a priming dose following successful extinction. No differences in locomotor activity were observed within drug treatment conditions due to genotype, and female mice displayed reduced locomotor activity during CPP conditioning compared to male mice. The observed effects illustrate the role DRD4 gene expression has on extinction and reinstatement, but not acquisition, of cocaine-seeking behavior.","Restraint stress exacerbates cell degeneration induced by acute binge ethanol in the adolescent, but not in the adult or middle-aged, brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797854,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 23,"Restraint stress (RS) induces neurotoxicity in the hippocampus, yet most of the studies have employed protracted RS (i.e., ≈ 21 days). Binge ethanol can induce brain toxicity, an effect affected by age. It could be postulated that RS may facilitate ethanol-induced neurotoxicity, perhaps to a greater extent in adolescent vs. older subjects. We analyzed whether adolescent, adult or middle-aged male rats exposed to five episodes of RS followed, 72h later, by binge ethanol (i.e., two administrations of 2.5 g/kg ethanol) exhibited hippocampal neurotoxicity. Adolescents, but not adult or middle-aged rats, exhibited sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of ethanol at dorsal CA2, ventral CA3 and ventral DG, and a neurotoxic effect of stress at dorsal CA1. Moreover, the combination of ethanol and stress exerted a synergistic effect upon cell degeneration at ventral CA1 and CA2, which was restricted to adolescents. Ethanol also increased cell degeneration, irrespective of age or stress, in dorsal CA3 and in dorsal DG; and ethanol and stress had, across all ages, a synergistic effect upon cell degeneration at the dorsal CA1. The greater neurotoxic response of adolescents to ethanol, stress, or ethanol+stress can put them at risk for the development of alcohol problems.",Hydroxychloroquine antiparkinsonian potential: Nurr1 modulation versus autophagy inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797853,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 23,"The nuclear orphan receptor (Nurr1) has recently received a perceivable solicitude as a target for the therapeutic intervention against PD. Meanwhile, the dysregulation of autophagy, along with other processes is believed to contribute massively to PD pathophysiology. Hydroxychloroquine, a hydroxy derivative of chloroquine, is an antimalarial agent which is also used as an anti-rheumatic drug. The neuroprotective potential of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine remained controversial until recently a study showed that chloroquine exhibited an antiparkinsonian activity through Nurr1 modulation. The aim of this work is to identify whether the less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine, could show a similar pattern. In rat rotenone model, hydroxychloroquine effectively boosted Nurr-1 expression, exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect as verified by hindering certain pro-inflammatory cytokines and successfully reduced GSK-3β activity. Consequently, an increase in the striatal tyrosine hydroxylase content, as well as improved locomotion and muscle coordination was shown. However, this improvement was opposed by hydroxychloroquine induced autophagic inhibition as manifested by enhancing both LC3-II and P62 levels possibly through the prominent decline in sirtuin 1 level and elevated apoptotic biomarkers. In conclusion, hydroxychloroquine successfully ameliorated PD motor dysfunction in spite of the fact that both autophagy and apoptosis were deregulated through Nurr1 modulation."

Both enzymes are essential for bacterial survival in the presence of toxic reactive electrophiles, such as N-ethylmaleimide and methyl glyoxal. Here, we report the identification and characterization of NemR from Acinetobacter nosocomialis, a nosocomial pathogen. We confirmed that nemR and the nemA gene which encodes N-ethylmaleimide reductase form a single operon, which is in accordance with the reports from E. coli. Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of an NemR binding motif in the promoter regions of nemRA operon and gloA (encoding glyoxalase I) and the binding was confirmed by gel mobility shift assay. The deletion of nemR resulted in increased biofilm/pellicle formation in A. nosocomialis. mRNA expression analysis revealed that NemR acts as a repressor of the nemRA operon and gloA, and that the repressor function is inactivated by the addition of toxic Cys modification agents, contributing to bacterial survival. In addition, it was demonstrated that the nemRA operon is positively regulated by the quorum sensing regulator, AnoR and the operon plays a role in biofilm/pellicle formation in A. nosocomialis.",Fos activation patterns related to acute ethanol and conditioned taste aversion in adolescent and adult rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797833,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 06 13,"Studies in rats have revealed marked age differences in sensitivity to the aversive properties of ethanol, with a developmental insensitivity to ethanol aversion that is most pronounced during pre- and early adolescence, declining thereafter to reach the enhanced aversive sensitivity of adults. The adolescent brain undergoes significant transitions throughout adolescence, including in regions linked with drug reward and aversion; however, it is unknown how ontogenetic changes within this reward/aversion circuitry contribute to developmental differences in aversive sensitivity. The current study examined early adolescent (postnatal day [P]28-30) and adult (P72-74) Sprague-Dawley male rats for conditioned taste aversion (CTA) after doses of 0, 1.0, or 2.5 g/kg ethanol, and patterns of neuronal activation in response to ethanol using Fos-like immunohistochemistry (Fos+) to uncover regions where age differences in activation are associated with ethanol aversion. An adolescent-specific ethanol-induced increase in Fos+ staining was seen within the nucleus accumbens shell and core. An age difference was also noted within the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW) following administration of the lower dose of ethanol, with 1 g/kg ethanol producing CTA in adults but not in adolescents and inducing a greater EW Fos response in adults than adolescents. Regression analysis revealed that greater numbers of Fos+ neurons within the EW and insula (Ins) were related to lower consumption of the conditioned stimulus (CS) on test day (reflecting greater CTA). Some regionally specific age differences in Fos+ were noted under baseline conditions, with adolescents displaying fewer Fos+ neurons than adults within the prelimbic (PrL) cortex, but more than adults in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). In the BNST (but not PrL), ethanol-induced increases in Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) were evident at both ages. Increased ethanol-induced activity within critical appetitive brain regions (NAc core and shell) supports a role for greater reward-related activation during adolescence, possibly along with attenuated responsiveness to ethanol in EW and Ins in the age-typical resistance of adolescents to the aversive properties of ethanol.",Voluntary elevated ethanol consumption in adolescent Sprague-Dawley rats: Procedural contributors and age-specificity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797832,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 06 13,"Alcohol consumption is typically initiated during adolescence, with the incidence of binge drinking (production of blood ethanol concentrations [BECs] > 80 mg/dL) peaking during this stage of development. Studies in outbred rats investigating the consequences of adolescent ethanol exposure have typically employed intragastric, vapor, or intraperitoneal administration to attain BECs in this range. While these procedures have yielded valuable data regarding the consequences of adolescent exposure, they are varyingly stressful, administer the full dose at once, and/or bypass digestion. Consequently, we have worked to develop a model of voluntary elevated ethanol consumption in outbred adolescent Sprague-Dawley males and females, building on our previous work (see Hosová & Spear, 2017). This model utilizes daily 30-min access to 10% ethanol (v/v) in chocolate Boost® from postnatal day (P)28-41. Experiment 1 compared intake levels between (1a) animals given either ball-bearing or open-ended sipper tube tips for solution access, (1b) animals separated from their cage mate by wire mesh or isolated to a separate cage during solution access, (1c) animals given solution access with or without simultaneous access to banana-flavored sugar pellets, and (1d) animals that were either moderately food-restricted or fed ad libitum. Experiment 2 compared intake levels between animals given daily solution access and animals given access only on a ""Monday-Wednesday-Friday"" intermittent schedule. Experiment 3 compared adolescent and adult (P70-83) consumption using the finalized procedure as based on the results of Experiments 1 and 2. As in our previous work, consumptions well within the binge range were produced on some days, with high-consumption days typically followed by several days of lower consumption before increasing again. Sipper tube type (1a) and simultaneous pellet access (1c) did not affect consumption, while intake was significantly higher in non-isolated (1b), food-restricted (1d), daily-access (2), and adolescent (3) animals. However, although ethanol intake was higher in food-restricted animals, the resulting BECs were equivalent or higher in non-restricted animals, likely due to a hepatoprotective effect of moderate food restriction. Post-consumption intoxication ratings correlated with BECs and were notably higher in adults than adolescents, despite the lower voluntary consumption levels of adults, confirming prior reports of the attenuated sensitivity of adolescents to ethanol intoxication relative to adults. The final model utilized ball-bearing sipper tube tips to provide daily access to 10% ethanol in chocolate Boost® to free-feeding adolescent animals separated from their cage mate by wire mesh, with no food provided during solution access. This easy-to-implement model is effective in producing elevated voluntary ethanol consumption in adolescent, but not adult, Sprague-Dawley rats.",Task modulates ERP effects of orthographic neighborhood for pseudowords but not words.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797831,Neuropsychologia,2019 06 16,"Words and pseudowords from high-density orthographic neighborhoods elicit larger amplitude N400s than similar items from low-density orthographic neighborhoods in the lexical decision task. This pattern could be interpreted as an increase in the amount of lexico-semantic information to be processed or as an increase in difficulty identifying a word (or rejecting a pseudoword) amongst many co-activated alternatives. In order to dissociate between these mechanisms, we compared neighborhood effects between a lexical decision task (LDT) and a letter search task (LST). Behaviorally, we found the standard neighborhood and lexicality effects in the LDT, but no significant effects in the LST. Thus, behavioral responses were sensitive to the decisions required by the respective tasks. Electrophysiologically, we found similar N400 neighborhood effects between tasks for words, but the N400 neighborhood effect for pseudowords was only present in the LDT. Moreover, the effect of neighborhood in the LDT occurred earlier for words than for pseudowords. These nuanced differences in the time course and automaticity of word and pseudoword neighborhood effects lend insight into the processes that underlie N400 effects of orthographic neighborhood and how they unfold over time. We propose that the early neighborhood effects for words across tasks were driven by highly automatized word identification processes that were sensitive to the lateral inhibition generated by orthographic neighbors. In contrast, the later neighborhood effects for pseudowords in the LDT could have been driven by task-specific processes tied to how global lexical activity is used to make a lexical decision.",Functional and structural basis of the color-flavor incongruency effect in visual search.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797830,Neuropsychologia,2019 03 29,"We conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study and a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study to investigate the functional and structural basis of how visual search for flavor labels in packaging is influenced by the color of the packaging. The participants were cued by a flavor word before searching for a package with this flavor label. The behavioral results of both studies revealed that the participants were slower to find the target when its color was incongruent with the flavor label in terms of color-flavor associations than when it was congruent with the flavor label, which is indicative of a color-flavor incongruency effect in the reaction times. The fMRI results revealed that this behavioral effect was associated with enhanced activation in the right putamen. The VBM results further revealed a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of the behavioral effect and volume of gray matter in the right putamen. Taken together, these findings suggest that the color-flavor incongruency effect may be attributed to the violation of color expectation in the incongruent condition and that the putamen may be one of the important areas for processing events in violation of expectation.","Membrane transporters in traumatic brain injury: Pathological, pharmacotherapeutic, and developmental implications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797827,Experimental neurology,2019 06 10,"Membrane transporters regulate the trafficking of endogenous and exogenous molecules across biological barriers and within the neurovascular unit. In traumatic brain injury (TBI), they moderate the dynamic movement of therapeutic drugs and injury mediators among neurons, endothelial cells and glial cells, thereby becoming important determinants of pathogenesis and effective pharmacotherapy after TBI. There are three ways transporters may impact outcomes in TBI. First, transporters likely play a key role in the clearance of injury mediators. Second, genetic association studies suggest transporters may be important in the transition of TBI from acute brain injury to a chronic neurological disease. Third, transporters dynamically control the brain penetration and efflux of many drugs and their distribution within and elimination from the brain, contributing to pharmacoresistance and possibly in some cases pharmacosensitivity. Understanding the nature of drugs or candidate drugs in development with respect to whether they are a transporter substrate or inhibitor is relevant to understand whether they distribute to their target in sufficient concentrations. Emerging data provide evidence of altered expression and function of transporters in humans after TBI. Genetic variability in expression and/or function of key transporters adds an additional dynamic, as shown in recent clinical studies. In this review, evidence supporting the role of individual membrane transporters in TBI are discussed as well as novel strategies for their modulation as possible therapeutic targets. Since data specifically targeting pediatric TBI are sparse, this review relies mainly on experimental studies using adult animals and clinical studies in adult patients.",Interplay between CTHRC1 and the SU protein of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) facilitates viral replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797826,Virus research,2019 06 03,"The lifecycle of avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), a typical tumorigenic retrovirus, is highly dependent upon host cellular proteins. However, there have been few studies directed at uncovering the host proteins responsible for ALV-J replication, which could provide insights into new strategies for ALV-J prevention and control. Here, we used proteomics to identify the association of differential levels of collagen triple helix-repeat-containing 1 (CTHRC1) and with viral replication. Our results revealed that CTHRC1 was significantly upregulated in ALV-J-infected cells in vitro, and these findings were confirmed in vivo. Additionally, CTHRC1 overexpression facilitated ALV-J replication, whereas CTHRC1 knockdown suppressed this activity. Moreover, we found that ALV-J drove CTHRC1 translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol through interactions with the ALV-J envelope glycoprotein. These results revealed CTHRC1 as a shutting protein is recruited by ALV-J to facilitate viral replication.","Bench stepping with incremental heights improves muscle volume, strength and functional performance in older women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797825,Experimental gerontology,2019 03 27,"Task-specific exercises such as bench stepping can improve functional ability and reduce falling incidents in older adults.

HLA-C is the only polymorphic HLA-I molecule present on the trophoblast. In this study we investigated the role of ERAP1 and ERAP2 polymorphisms in the context of KIR and HLA-C genes in women suffering from recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) in the Polish population. We used TaqMan genotyping assays for ERAP1 rs27044, rs30187, rs2287987, rs26618, rs2665 and ERAP2 rs2248374; PCR-SSP methods for KIR and HLA-C genotyping. We tested 285 women who experienced recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) and 319 fertile women. We observed a significant association of ERAP1 rs30187TT genotype with RSA (p = 0.02, OR = 1.89, 95%CI = 1.11-3.21), however the most striking association was found in comparison of patients and controls with ERAP1 rs30187TT and KIR Bx genotypes (p = 0.006, pcorr. = 0.036, OR = 2.40, 95%CI = 1.27-4.52).

Other weaker associations of the remaining tested ERAP single nucleotide polymorphisms with RSA were also presented. In conclusion, ERAP1 rs30187TT genotype itself increased susceptibility to RSA but this effect was much stronger in patients positive for HLA-C2 and KIR Bx genotypes."

Recent studies have suggested that the glucose counter-regulation response (CRR), a critical defense against hypoglycemic emergencies, is dependent on glucoprivation-sensitive astrocytes in the hindbrain. This subpopulation of astrocytes produces a robust calcium signal in response to glucopenic stimuli. Both ex vivo and in vivo evidence suggest that low-glucose sensitive astrocytes utilize purinergic gliotransmission to activate catecholamine neurons in the hindbrain that are critical to the generation of the integrated CRR. Lastly, reports in the clinical literature suggest that an uncontrolled activation of CRR may as part of the pathology of severe traumatic injury. Work in our laboratory also suggests that this pathological hyperglycemia resulting from traumatic injury may be caused by the action of thrombin (generated by tissue trauma or bleeding) on hindbrain astrocytes. Similar to their glucopenia-sensitive neighbors, these hindbrain astrocytes may trigger hyperglycemic responses by their interactions with catecholaminergic neurons.",Uricase grafted nanoconducting matrix based electrochemical biosensor for ultrafast uric acid detection in human serum samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797811,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,Gold nanoparticles decorated graphene oxide (Au-rGO) nanocomposite thin films with enhanced electro-active characteristics were prepared and covalently immobilized with uricase (UOx) enzyme for sensitive and selective detection of uric acid (UA). Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) studies revealed rapid response of fabricated electrode towards UA at low potential (0.228 V) in a wide concentration range of 50-800 μM with a sensitivity of 86.62 ± 0.19 μA mM-1 and very low detection limit of 7.32 ± 0.21 μM. The obtained Michaelis-Menten constant (km) value of 51.75 μM signifies high enzyme kinetics at electrode surface with UA. The developed biosensor was successfully applied to detect UA in human serum samples. Interferences due to components present in the real matrix were evaluated and UA determination in mixed sample was also performed. The fabricated UOx/Au-rGO/ITO biosensor demonstrated high reproducibility and a shelf-life of 6 months indicating the promising future of Au-rGO nanocomposite as an efficient transducer matrix for biosensing applications. The fast response time (1.0 ± 0.6 s) and improved sensor performance is attributed to the synergistic electronic properties of Au-nanoparticles and rGO that provided enhanced electron transfer and high electro-active species surface coverage at Au-rGO nanocomposite.,Focusing on the functional characterization of the anserinase from Oreochromis niloticus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797810,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"Carnosine, anserine and homocarnosine are the three most representative compounds of the histidine dipeptides family, widely distributed in mammals in different amounts depending on the species and the tissue considered. Histidine dipeptides are mainly degraded by two different carnosinase homologues: a highly specific metal-ion dependent carnosinase (CN1) located in serum and brain and a non-specific cytosolic form (CN2). The hydrolysis of such dipeptides in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is also catalyzed by the anserinase (ANSN). Such naturally occurring dipeptides represent an interesting topic because they seem to have numerous biological roles such as potential neuroprotective and neurotransmitter functions in the brain and therefore ANSN results to be a very interesting target of study. We here report, for the first time, cloning, expression of ANSN from the fish Oreochromis niloticus both in a mammalian and in a prokaryotic system, in order to perform deep functional studies by enzymatic assays in the presence of different metals and substrates. Furthermore, by means of a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach, we analysed protein sequence and the potential presence of post-translational modifications in the mammalian recombinant protein. Finally, a preliminary structural characterization was carried out on ANSN produced in Escherichia coli.",Antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities of polysaccharides from the rhizome of Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797809,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"Rhizome of the fern Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai is used as an antiviral drug in China. The objective was to characterize physicochemical properties, structural features and antioxidant and immunological activities of D. crassirhizoma polysaccharides. An acidic polysaccharide fraction (DCP-3) was obtained from Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai by purification with DEAE-52 and Sephadex G-100. DCP-3 was a novel triple-helical polysaccharide with an average MW of 273.2 kDa. This fraction was mainly composed of galactose (36.65%), xylose (34.75%), arabinose (17.07%) and mannose (9.22%). DCP-3 had strong activity for scavenging DPPH radical (IC50: 2.04 mg/mL), hydroxyl radical (IC50: 1.70 mg/mL), and superoxide anions (IC50: 4.20 mg/mL) and also was capable of reducing ferric ions. In addition, nitric oxide production was enhanced in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated by DCP-3. Based on these bioactivities, we inferred that DCP-3 was a functional component of D. crassirhizoma and may confer antivirus activity, with potential applications in functional food and drug industries.",Preparation and characterisation of a novel silk fibroin/hyaluronic acid/sodium alginate scaffold for skin repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797808,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"To mimic the natural structure of tissue extracellular matrix, a novel silk fibroin (SF)/hyaluronic acid (HA)/sodium alginate (SA) composite scaffold (92% in porosity) was prepared by freeze-drying. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectra indicated interactions among SF, HA, and SA molecules. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the prepared SF/HA/SA scaffold had soft, elastic characteristics, with an average pore diameter of 93 μm. Mechanical property, thermogravimetric analyses and degradation results indicated that the SF/HA/SA scaffold had good physical stability in body fluid and mechanical movement-related environments. Cell proliferation, morphological, and live-dead analyses showed that NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells were better able to attach, grow, and proliferate on the SF/HA/SA scaffold compared with SF, SF/HA, and SF/SA scaffolds. We evaluated the wound healing effects in a rat full-thickness burn model. The hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome staining results from SF/HA/SA scaffold showed that improved re-epithelialization, enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling. Our findings showed that the prepared SF/HA/SA scaffold can provide a potential way as a wound dressing for skin repair.",Synthesis and characterization of interpenetrating polymeric networks based bio-composite alginate film: A well-designed drug delivery platform.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797807,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,This study aimed to develop and characterize the calcium alginate films loaded with diclofenac sodium and other hydrophilic polymers with different degrees of cross-linking obtained by external gelation process. To the formed films different physicochemical evaluation were performed which showed an initial character of the films. The films produced by this external gelation process were found thicker (0.031-0.038 mm) and stronger (51.9-52.9 MPa) but less elastic (2.3%) than those non-cross-linked films (0.029 mm; 39.7 MPa; 4.4%). The lower water vapor permeability (WVP) values of the films were obtained where maximum level of crosslinking occurs. Composite films can be cross-linked in presence of external crosslinking agent to improve the quality of the produced matrices for various uses. The characterization of the film was performed using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) study showed the morphology of treated composite films. The kinetic release studies showed a sustained release of the drug from the formulated films as it can be prolonged in composite film. The prepared biodegradable Ca-Alginate bio-composite film may be of clinical importance for its therapeutic benefit.,Nanocapsules of Sterculia striata acetylated polysaccharide as a potential monomeric amphotericin B delivery matrix.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797806,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"Stable oil nanocapsules based on acetylated Sterculia striata polysaccharide (ASSP) were produced without the use of a surfactant, and derivatives of ASSP with four different degrees of substitution (DS) were synthesised. The data revealed that only derivatives with high DS were able to produce nanocapsules (NC), which exhibited monomodal size distribution profiles with a Z-average particle size, ζ-potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) that were dependent on ASSP DS and concentration. Nanocapsules were loaded with amphotericin B (AMB) with encapsulation efficiencies (EE%) that were dependent on drug and ASSP concentrations and DS. A maximum EE% value of 99.2% was achieved, and the loaded AMB was found to be in a monomeric form, even with a concentration one hundredfold higher than that usually observed for commercial AMB aqueous solutions. Loaded nanocapsules show an in vitro controlled release of AMB. As the monomeric AMB state decreased drug toxicity, ASSP nanocapsules loaded with AMB (NC1.68) have potential for use as a drug delivery system. AMB loaded NC 1.68 keeps its activity against 5 strains of Candida albicans tested.",Zr4+ ions embedded chitosan-soya bean husk activated bio-char composite beads for the recovery of nitrate and phosphate ions from aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797805,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"Removal of nitrate and phosphate ions using Zr4+ ions embedded chitosan-soya bean husk activated bio-char composite beads (Zr-CS-SAC) was carried out by batch mode to overcome the environmental problems due to eutrophication. The adsorbent was well characterized by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis with energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface analyzer (BET), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) etc. The adsorption equilibrium models of Langmuir, Freundlich and D-R isotherms were evaluated and the results described that the Freundlich model was the best for both the adsorbates of nitrate and phosphates ions with respective capacities of 90.09 and 131.29 mg g-1 at 30 °C. Studies on thermodynamic parameters revealed the endothermic and spontaneous nature of the adsorption. Different kinetic models were studied and found that pseudo-second-order kinetic data were well fitted for adsorption process. These results suggested that Zr-CS-SAC composite beads as a promising adsorbent for the removal of nitrate and phosphate ions from water with good removal efficiency, adsorbability, recyclability and non- toxicity.",In Vitro interaction between yeast frataxin and superoxide dismutases: Influence of mitochondrial metals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797804,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

In addition to its wide range of bioactivity, it exhibits neuroactive properties as a sedative and sleeping aid. The compounds responsible for this activity are yet to be revealed and understood in terms of their pharmacological properties. Here we evaluated the potential of several hops flavonoids in modulating the GABAergic activity and assessed their selectivity to GABAA receptors subtypes. GABA-potentiating effects were measured using [3H]ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB) radioligand binding assay in native and recombinant α1β3γ2, α2β3γ2 and α6β3δ receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Flumazenil sensitivity of GABA-potentiating effects and [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding assay were used to examine the flavonoids binding to benzodiazepine site. The prenylflavonoids xanthohumol (XN), isoxanthohumol (IXN) and 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN) potentiated GABA-induced displacement of [3H]EBOB binding in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 for this potentiation in native GABAA receptors were 29.7 µM, 11.6 µM, 7.3 µM, respectively. In recombinant receptors, the sensitivity to prenylflavonoid potentiation of GABA-induced displacement of [3H]EBOB binding followed the order α6β3δ > α2β3γ2 > α1β3γ2 with the strongest inhibition observed by 8PN in α6β3δ (IC50 = 3.6 μM). Flumazenil had no significant effect on the prenylflavonoid-induced displacement of [3H]EBOB binding and [3H]Ro 15-4513 displacement from native GABAA receptors was only detected at high micromolar concentrations (100 µM). We identified potent prenylflavonoids in hops that positively modulate GABA-induced responses in native and αβγ/δ recombinant GABAA receptors at low micromolar concentrations. These GABAergic modulatory effects were not mediated via the high-affinity benzodiazepine binding site.",Rosiglitazone attenuates paraquat-induced lung fibrosis in rats in a PPAR gamma-dependent manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797787,European journal of pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Rosiglitazone, a PPAR-γ agonist, possesses anti-fibritic effect; however, its inhibitory effect on paraquat (PQ)-induced pulmonary fibrosis is not completely understood. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone on PQ-induced acute pulmonary fibrosis in rats and its underlying mechanism. Male Sprague-Dawly rats were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg PQ and euthanised 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after PQ poisoning. PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis was most obvious on day 28. Male Sprague-Dawly rats were exposed either against distilled water as control groups or PQ (30 mg/kg, i.p.) as test groups. The control groups were nominated as NC group (without treatment), RSG group (only treatment with rosiglitazone, 10 mg/kg/d), and GW group (only treatment with GW9662, a PPAR-γ antagonist, 1 mg/kg/d). The test groups were nominated as PQ group (PQ exposed without treatment), PQ + RSG group (treatment with rosiglitazone), and PQ + RSG + GW group (treatment with rosiglitazone and GW9662). Rosiglitazone was able to recover the PQ-induced decrease in arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), increase in the wet-to-dry (W/D) lung tissue weight ratio and lung fibrosis score. Rosiglitazone inhibited the PQ-induced reduction in protein and mRNA levels of PPAR-γ and PTEN and elevation in protein and mRNA levels of TGF-β1 and α-SMA. GW9662 administration antagonized the effect of rosiglitazone. These data suggest that rosiglitazone attenuated PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis by upregulateing PTEN and downregulating TGF-β1 expression in a PPAR-γ dependent manner.","Suppressive effects of type I angiotensin receptor antagonists, candesartan and irbesartan on allergic asthma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797786,European journal of pharmacology,2019 04 20,"The effects of candesartan and irbesartan, antagonists of the type I angiotensin II receptor, were investigated on allergic asthma. The antigen-induced degranulation was measured by evaluating β-hexosaminidase activity in vitro. Additionally, a murine ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma model was used to test the in vivo efficacy. It was observed that while candesartan inhibited the antigen-induced degranulation in rat RBL-2H3 mast cells, irbesartan did not. Administration of candesartan and irbesartan decreased the number of immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and reduced the expression of Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and Th1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-γ) in the lung tissues of mice with ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma. Histological studies revealed that both antagonists reduced inflammation and mucin production in the lungs. Therefore, these findings provide evidence that candesartan and irbesartan could have potential applications as anti-allergic agents.",Stearoyl lysophosphatidylcholine inhibits LPS-induced extracellular release of HMGB1 through the G2A/calcium/CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797785,European journal of pharmacology,2019 04 20,"Stearoyl lysophosphatidylcholine (sLPC) has protective effects against several lethal sepsis models, even after induction of sepsis, which is associated with sLPC-mediated inhibition of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) release. This study investigated the mechanism by which sLPC inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced extracellular secretion of HMGB1 after the onset of sepsis. sLPC increased AMPK phosphorylation and the binding of AMPK to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ), one of the upstream signals of AMPK. Inhibition of CaMKKβ activity decreased sLPC-mediated inhibition of HMGB1 release, and sLPC increased the concentration of intracellular calcium. Blocking of the macrophage G protein-coupled receptor G2A (G2A) suppressed AMPK phosphorylation, suppressed increases in the intracellular levels of calcium, and prevented the inhibition of HMGB1 release by sLPC. In particular, when macrophages were incubated with sLPC even after LPS treatment, sLPC increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and the binding of CaMKKβ and AMPK, and suppressed the secretion of HMGB1. In addition, sLPC administered 1 h before or 4 h after establishment of sepsis significantly diminished circulating HMGB1 levels in mice. sLPC inhibited LPS-induced extracellular release of HMGB1 through the activation of the G2A/calcium/CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway. These findings suggest that sLPC may be a potential anti-inflammatory agent for acute inflammatory conditions such as sepsis.",Efficacy of lapachol on treatment of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797783,Experimental parasitology,2019 04 22,"Leishmaniasis is one of the most important neglected diseases worldwide. It is a life-threatening disease and causes significant morbidity, long-term disability, and early death. Treatment involves disease control or use of intervention measures, although the currently used drugs require long-lasting therapy, and display toxicity and reduced efficacy. The use of natural products isolated from plants, such as lapachol, an abundant naphthoquinone naturally occurring in South American Handroanthus species (Tabebuia, Bignoniaceae), is a promising option for the treatment of leishmaniasis. In this study, we investigated the leishmanicidal activity of lapachol in vitro and in vivo against Leishmania infantum and L. amazonensis, causative agents of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. Low cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells (3405.8 ± 261.33 μM), good anti-Leishmania activity, and favorable selectivity indexes (SI) against promastigotes of both L. amazonensis (IC50 = 79.84 ± 9.10 μM, SI = 42.65) and L. infantum (IC50 = 135.79 ± 33.04 μM, SI = 25.08) were observed. Furthermore, anti-Leishmania activity assays performed on intracellular amastigotes showed good activity for lapachol (IC50 = 191.95 μM for L. amazonensis and 171.26 μM for L. infantum). Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of lapachol in Leishmania promastigotes was caused by apoptosis-like death. Interestingly, the in vitro leishmanicidal effect of lapachol was confirmed in vivo in murine models of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, as lapachol (25 mg/kg oral route for 24 h over 10 days) was able to significantly reduce the parasitic load in skin lesions, liver, and spleen, similar to amphotericin B, the reference drug. These results reinforce the therapeutic potential of lapachol, which warrants further investigations as an anti-leishmaniasis therapeutic.",DNA Quadruplex-Based Inhibitor With Flexible Fragments at the 3' Terminal Shows Enhanced Anti-HIV-1 Fusion Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797782,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 03 18,"Chemically optimizing the molecular structure of aptamers may enhance properties such as biological activity or metabolic stability. DNA quadruplex-based HIV-1 fusion inhibitors were found to interact with HIV-1 surface glycoprotein in aptamer mode. In this work, a series of quadruplex-based HIV-1 fusion inhibitors with flexible oligodeoxynucleotide fragments at the 3' terminal was discovered. The flexible extension did not greatly influence quadruplex formation at the 5'-end. Increasing the length of the flexible fragment may increase antifusion activity. Compared with a traditional inhibitor, d(5'TGGGAG3')4, these novel inhibitors showed enhanced interaction with HIV-1 glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, which increased inhibition of 6-helical bundle formation during the course of virus fusion. These inhibitors also showed improved stability, compared with natural oligodeoxynucleotide. This work may inform the design of anti-HIV-1 DNA helix-based inhibitors with new structures or mechanisms.",Evaluation of a 3D Human Artificial Lymph Node as Test Model for the Assessment of Immunogenicity of Protein Aggregates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797781,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 04 03,"The immunogenicity of protein aggregates has been investigated in numerous studies. Nevertheless, it is still unknown which kind of protein aggregates enhance immunogenicity the most. The ability of the currently used in vitro and in vivo systems regarding their predictability of immunogenicity in humans is often questionable, and results are partially contradictive. In this study, we used a 2D in vitro assay and a complex 3D human artificial lymph node model to predict the immunogenicity of protein aggregates of bevacizumab and adalimumab. The monoclonal antibodies were exposed to different stress conditions such as light, heat, and mechanical stress to trigger the formation of protein aggregates and particles, and samples were analyzed thoroughly. Cells and culture supernatants were harvested and analyzed for dendritic cell marker and cytokines. Our study in the artificial lymph node model revealed that bevacizumab after exposure to heat triggered a TH1- and proinflammatory immune response, whereas no trend of immune responses was seen for adalimumab after exposure to different stress conditions. The human artificial lymph node model represents a new test model for testing the immunogenicity of protein aggregates combining the relevance of a 3D human system with the rather easy handling of an in vitro setup.",Preservative and Irritant Capacity of Biosurfactants From Different Sources: A Comparative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797780,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 03 22,"One of the most important challenges for pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries is solubilization and preservation of their active ingredients. Therefore, most of these formulations contain irritant chemical additives to improve their shelf-life and the solubility of hydrophobic ingredients. An interesting alternative to chemical surfactants and preservatives is the use of biosurfactants; thus, their surfactant properties and composition make them more biocompatible than their chemical counterparts. Moreover, some biosurfactants have shown antimicrobial activity in addition to their detergent capacity. In this work, the antimicrobial and irritant effect of 2 biosurfactant extracts was studied: one produced in a controlled fermentation process with Lactobacillus pentosus and the other produced from corn stream by spontaneous fermentation. The results showed a strong antimicrobial activity of the biosurfactant extract obtained from corn stream on pathogenic bacteria, in comparison with the L. pentosus biosurfactant extract. Moreover, both biosurfactants did not produce any irritant effect on the chorioallantoic membrane of hen's egg assay contrary to sodium dodecyl sulfate. This is the first study dealing with the application of biosurfactant extracts on sensitive biological membranes, and this is the first time that the preservative capacity of a biosurfactant extract obtained in spontaneous fermentation is being evaluated, achieving promising results.","Insights into eyespot color-pattern formation mechanisms from color gradients, boundary scales, and rudimentary eyespots in butterfly wings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797779,Journal of insect physiology,2019 04 13,"Butterfly eyespot color patterns are traditionally explained by the gradient model, where positional information is stably provided by a morphogen gradient from a single organizer and its output is a set of non-graded (or graded) colors based on pre-determined threshold levels. An alternative model is the induction model, in which the outer black ring and the inner black core disk of an eyespot are specified by graded signals from the primary and secondary organizers that also involve lateral induction. To examine the feasibility of these models, we analyzed eyespot color gradients, boundary scales, and rudimentary eyespots in various nymphalid butterflies. Most parts of eyespots showed color gradients with gradual or fluctuating changes with sharp boundaries in many species, but some species had eyespots that were composed of a constant color within a given part. Thus, a plausible model should be flexible enough to incorporate this diversity. Some boundary scales appeared to have two kinds of pigments, and others had ""misplaced"" colors, suggesting an overlapping of two signals and a difficulty in assuming sharp threshold boundaries. Rudimentary eyespots of three Junonia species revealed that the outer black ring is likely determined first and the inner yellow or red ring is laterally induced. This outside-to-inside determination together with the lateral induction may favor the induction model, in which dynamic signal interactions play a major role. The implications of these results for the ploidy hypothesis and color-pattern rules are discussed.",Impact of Omalizumab on Food Allergy in Patients Treated for Asthma: A Real-Life Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797778,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

The magnitude of the TAE has been shown to relate to the salience of the adapting stimulus (e.g., its contrast) as well as to the similarity between the adapting and testing stimuli. However, the relationship between TAE and orientation uncertainty - variability in the perceived orientation of the stimulus - of either the adapting or the testing stimulus and, more importantly, change in orientation uncertainty as a function of adaptation have not previously been explored. We manipulated stimulus salience by using a variety of contour types, including real and illusory contours. Tilt aftereffects were observed even for stimuli that had much weaker or invisible illusory contours. Orientation uncertainty of the adapting stimulus, as measured by the slope of a psychometric function in orientation discrimination, was positively correlated with TAE magnitude for real and illusory contours, but not for stimuli with weak contour percepts. On an individual subject level, orientation uncertainty increased post-adaptation and was correlated with pre-adaptation uncertainty. That is, individuals with more variability in their perception of orientation before adaptation showed increased variability in orientation discrimination following adaptation. This may account for some of the variability in TAE across individuals and stimulus types and is consistent with previous findings on increased orientation discrimination thresholds post-adaptation for nearby orientations.",A shape-level flanker facilitation effect in contour integration and the role of shape complexity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797765,Vision research,2019 05 28,"The detection of an object in the visual field requires the visual system to integrate a variety of local features into a single object. How these local processes and their global integration is influenced by the presence of other shapes in the visual field is poorly understood. The detectability (contour integration) of a central target object in the form of a two dimensional Gaborized contour was compared in the presence or absence of nearby surrounding objects. A 2-AFC staircase procedure added orientation jitter to the constituent Gabor patches to determine the detectability of the target contour. The set of contours was generated using shape profiles of everyday objects and geometric forms. Experiment 1 examined the effect of three types of congruencies between the target and two flanking contours (contour shape, symmetry and familiarity). Experiment 2 investigated the effect of varying the number and spatial positions of the flankers. In addition, a measure of shape complexity (reciprocal of shape compactness) was used to assess the effects of contour complexity on detection. Across both experiments the detectability of the target contour increased when the target and flanker had the same shape and this was related to both the number of flankers and the complexity of the target shapes. Another factor that modulated this shape-level flanker facilitation effect was the presence of symmetry. The overall results are consistent with a contour integration process in which the visual system incorporates contextual information to extract the most likely smooth contour within a noise field.",Mosaic plasmids are abundant and unevenly distributed across prokaryotic taxa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797764,Plasmid,2019 04 14,"Mosaic plasmids, plasmids composed of genetic elements from distinct sources, are associated with the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Transposons are considered the primary mechanism for mosaic plasmid formation, though other mechanisms have been observed in specific instances. The frequency with which mosaic plasmids have been described suggests they may play an important role in plasmid population dynamics. Our survey of the confirmed plasmid sequences available from complete and draft genomes in the RefSeq database shows that 46% of them fit a strict definition of mosaic. Mosaic plasmids are also not evenly distributed over the taxa represented in the database. Plasmids from some genera, including Piscirickettsia and Yersinia, are almost all mosaic, while plasmids from other genera, including Borrelia, are rarely mosaic. While some mosaic plasmids share identical regions with hundreds of others, the median mosaic plasmid only shares with 8 other plasmids. When considering only plasmids from finished genomes (51.6% of the total), mosaic plasmids have significantly higher proportions of transposase and antibiotic resistance genes. Conversely, only 56.6% of mosaic fragments (DNA fragments shared between mosaic plasmids) contain a recognizable transposase gene, and only 1.2% of mosaic fragments are flanked by inverted repeats. Mosaic fragments associated with the IS26 transposase gene are 3.8-fold more abundant than any other sequence shared between mosaic plasmids in the database, though this is at least partly due to overrepresentation of Enterobacteriaceae plasmids. Mosaic plasmids are a complicated trait of some plasmid populations, only partly explained by transposition. Though antibiotic resistance genes led to the identification of many mosaic plasmids, mosaic plasmids are a broad phenomenon encompassing many more traits than just antibiotic resistance. Further research will be required to determine the influence of ecology, host repair mechanisms, conjugation, and plasmid host range on the formation and influence of mosaic plasmids. AUTHOR SUMMARY: Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic entities that are found in many prokaryotes. They serve as flexible storage for genes, and individual cells can make substantial changes to their characteristics by acquiring, losing, or modifying a plasmid. In some pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, antibiotic resistance genes are known to spread primarily on plasmids. By analyzing a database of 8592 plasmid sequences we determined that many of these plasmids have exchanged genes with each other, becoming mosaics of genes from different sources. We next separated these plasmids into groups based on the organism they were isolated from and found that different groups had different fractions of mosaic plasmids. This result was unexpected and suggests that the mechanisms and selective pressures causing mosaic plasmids do not occur evenly over all species. It also suggests that plasmids may provide different levels of potential variation to different species. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized pattern in plasmids across prokaryotes, that could lead to new insights into the evolutionary role that plasmids play.",Compulsive methamphetamine taking and abstinence in the presence of adverse consequences: Epigenetic and transcriptional consequences in the rat brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797763,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019 03 26,"Methamphetamine addiction is characterized by compulsive binges of drug intake despite adverse life consequences. A model of methamphetamine self-administration that includes contingent footshocks to constitute adverse consequences has helped to segregate rats that reduce or stop lever pressing for methamphetamine (sensitive) from those that continue to lever press for the drug (resistant) in the presence of negative outcomes. We have observed differential DNA hydroxymethylation and increased expression of potassium channel mRNAs in the nucleus accumbens of sensitive compared to resistant rats, suggesting a role of these channels in suppressing methamphetamine intake. There were also significant increases in nerve growth factor (NGF) expression and activation of its downstream signaling pathway (NGF-TrkA and p75NTR/MAPK signaling) in only the dorsal striatum of sensitive rats after a month of abstinence. In contrast, oxytocin mRNA expression was increased in only the nucleus accumbens of resistant rats compared to sensitive rats euthanized after that time. These results indicate that footshocks can differentiate two behavioral phenotypes with differential biochemical and epigenetic consequences in the ventral and dorsal striatum.",Examination of the Gateway Hypothesis in a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797762,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019 03 26,"The Gateway Hypothesis is based on epidemiological data and states there is a progression of drug use from use of a softer drug (e.g., nicotine) to use of a harder drug (e.g., morphine). It has been suggested that this sequence is causal and is relevant to drug prevention policies and programs. The present experiment used an animal model to investigate whether the Gateway Hypothesis involves a causal progression. Subjects were 16 female and 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats with ages comparable to late adolescence/emerging adulthood in humans. Subjects received nicotine (6 mg/kg/day) or saline for 21 days SC via osmotic minipump and subsequently were allowed to self-administer IV morphine (0.5 mg/kg/injection, 3 h/day) for 10 days. Results did not confirm the Gateway Hypothesis. In fact, rats pre-exposed to nicotine self-administered significantly less morphine than did rats pre-exposed to saline. These findings may be relevant to future drug use prevention policies and programs.",Aspirin delays the development of preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797761,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2019 06 01,"In the Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention trial, risks of preterm preeclampsia were obtained from the competing risk model. Consenting women with risks of greater than 1 in 100 were randomized to treatment with aspirin or placebo. The trial showed strong evidence of an effect (odds ratio, 0.38, 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.74) on the incidence of preterm preeclampsia, which was the primary outcome of Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention. There was a small and insignificant effect on the incidence of term preeclampsia, which was a secondary outcomes (odds ratio, 0.95, 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.39). These differential effects on term and preterm preeclampsia could reflect a mechanism in which the action of aspirin is to delay the delivery with preeclampsia, thereby converting what would be, without treatment, preterm preeclampsia to term preeclampsia.",Long-term clinical outcomes of isolated ostial left anterior descending disease treatment: Ostial stenting versus left main cross-over stenting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797760,Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,2019 02 24,The optimal strategy for treating ostial left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) disease remains matter of speculation.

KIF15, which belongs to the kinesin-12 family, has been shown to function in many different cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and development. However, the role of KIF15 in melanoma, remains unknown. In this study, the expression levels of KIF15 in melanoma cells lines and tissues were determined via real-time PCR, immunohistochemical staining and western blot. The effect of KIF15 on tumorigenesis was evaluated by using MTT and colony information. The function of KIF15 on cell survival was detected through flow cytometry assay. Microarray assay and bioinformatics analysis were used to find the potential target of KIF15. We show that KIF15 was significantly upregulated in melanoma cells and tissues. The suppression of KIF15 in tumors significantly reduced tumor growth and increased apoptosis in A375 and OCM1 cells. Findings based on the subcutaneous xenograft model were further consistent with the in vitro results that KIF15 knockdown inhibited melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Microarray assay and bioinformatics indicated that BIRC5, CDK4 and WNT5A were three potential targets of KIF15. Taken together, our results suggest that KIF15 plays a positive role in the tumorigenicity of melanoma and it may serve as a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for melanoma, especially uveal melanoma.",The Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 is required for maintaining the normal cardiac differentiation program in Xenopus laevis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797757,Developmental biology,2019 05 08,"Wnt proteins can activate different intracellular signaling pathways. These pathways need to be tightly regulated for proper cardiogenesis. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor Dkk1 has been shown to be sufficient to trigger cardiogenesis in gain-of-function experiments performed in multiple model systems. Loss-of-function studies however did not reveal any fundamental function for Dkk1 during cardiogenesis. Using Xenopus laevis as a model we here show for the first time that Dkk1 is required for proper differentiation of cardiomyocytes, whereas specification of cardiomyocytes remains unaffected in absence of Dkk1. This effect is at least in part mediated through regulation of non-canonical Wnt signaling via Wnt11. In line with these observations we also found that Isl1, a critical regulator for specification of the common cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) population, acts upstream of Dkk1."

Human alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) is reported to have glycans that consist of sialylated N-glycans. The N-glycan profiling of AGP is qualitatively and quantitatively investigated here by UPLC and LC-ESI-MS/MS. Three fluorescent tags (AB, AA, and ProA) and two separation columns (HILIC and AEX-HILIC) were adopted to confirm and compare each analytical characteristic. The results of AA were comparable to those of the well-established AB. The qualification of ProA was notable due to its superior fluorescence intensity and ionization efficiency, and ProA showed smaller quantitative or larger-sized fragments in LC-ESI-MS/MS compared to AB and AA. However, the MS quantification of ProA was distorted because the increased sialylation level decreased the LC-ESI-MS/MS ionization efficiency. HILIC had better peak separability, AEX-HILIC had an advantage in UPLC sialylation profiling, and each isomeric glycan could be identified by both columns in LC-ESI-MS/MS. In conclusion, ProA is favored for UPLC and LC-ESI-MS/MS detection but not reliable for MS quantification. This study firstly demonstrates the qualification and quantification of sialylated N-glycans by comparing the commonly used analytical conditions with different fluorescent tags, columns, and instruments.","The Effectiveness of Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization in Athletes, Participants Without Extremity or Spinal Conditions, and Individuals with Upper Extremity, Lower Extremity, and Spinal Conditions: A Systematic Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797743,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2019 04 08,"To assess the effectiveness of instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) to other treatments or placebo in athletes or participants without extremity or spinal conditions and individuals with upper extremity, lower extremity, and spinal conditions.",Use of Computed Tomography scanning in a 'virtual' bioarchaeology of care analysis of a Central Coast Peruvian mummy bundle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797742,International journal of paleopathology,2019 02 24,"CT scanning was utilized to investigate an intact mummy bundle within the bioarchaeology of care framework.

However, early recognition is paramount because delays in treatments have much higher risk of unfavorable clinical outcomes. Identification of WD remains challenging because it is a great imitator and requires a high index of suspicion for correct and timely diagnosis. Initial neurologic problems can be seen in approximately 40%-50% of patients and the rest has either hepatic or primarily psychiatric manifestations. Neurologic and neuropsychiatric problems in WD are quite nonspecific and we discuss the most common clinical problems associated with early and late stages of the disease. Many patients with neurologic symptoms do not have any obvious hepatic symptoms. Most common neurologic abnormalities include dysarthria, dystonia, tremor and Parkinsonism. In spite of its phenotypic heterogeneity, laboratory abnormalities, reflecting abnormal copper homeostasis, are very specific and the diagnosis of WD remains laboratory based. We review most important challenges and pitfalls in laboratory evaluation of WD, including emerging role of genetic testing. Pharmacologic treatments need to be life-long and are focused on restoration of negative copper balance without inducing iatrogenic copper deficiency. The gold standard of therapy is chelation of excessive copper. Chelators may induce further clinical deterioration in some treated patients.

However, in their assessment of the theoretical contributions of botanists and practical experiments conducted by farmers, they negotiated the authority of scientific expertise in the study of nature and delineated standards of scientific inquiry into agricultural matters. The reformers' engagement with the transmutation debate thus contributed to the professionalization of agricultural improvement, laying the groundwork for the activities of agricultural research institutions that emerged in the second half of the century.",Personality profile and health-related quality of life in adults with previous continuous spike-waves during slow sleep syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797668,Brain & development,2019 04 28,"Epilepsy with continuous spike-waves during slow sleep syndrome (CSWSS) is characterized by various seizure types, a characteristic EEG pattern and neuropsychological disorders.

Over time, the durability of artificial materials becomes an issue, and therefore, artificial materials cannot be considered a permanent solution to reconstruction. For long-term outcomes, the goal is to regain function, permanence, and form that are as close to normal as possible. Thus, physiological materials are desirable for use in reconstruction. Biological reconstruction involves the use of materials that are modified in vivo following reconstruction of bone defects. The goal is to achieve bone union, bone revival and remodeling, with biointegration of soft tissue and bone. Allograft use has been the mainstay of bone defect reconstruction in most parts of the world, although in some countries like Japan, allogeneic bone is difficult to obtain due to socio-religious concerns. Therefore, we developed new biological reconstruction techniques to overcome this problem. Bone derived from distraction osteogenesis is autologous bone, which must be an ideal reconstruction material for its biological affinity, strength, resilience, and immunity to infection. When applying this method to patients with malignant disease however, it is important to preserve as much of the local soft tissue as possible, and the clinician must be especially careful of infection and callus formation. Liquid nitrogen treatment of tumor-bearing bone produces equal, if not better, bone revitalization compared to other forms of treatment to date. Reconstruction with liquid nitrogen-treated bone involves resecting the diseased bone and returning it to the body following liquid nitrogen treatment (free-freezing method). Another method involves dislocating the joint proximal to the tumor, or cutting the bone while the distal side remains attached to the body and the limb inverted and treated with liquid nitrogen (pedicle freezing method). When both methods are possible, the pedicle freezing method is preferable since it is performed with minimal osteotomy. Our recent research has looked into the possible role of adipose-derived stem cells in promoting bone fusion and revitalization. This method has produced promising results for the future of biological reconstruction."

A significant number of patients with CKD have decreased bone mineral density (BMD), are at high risk of fragility fractures and have an increased morbidity and mortality risk. With an ageing population, these observations are not only dependent on ""renal osteodystrophy"" but also on the associated OP. As BMD predicts incident fractures in CKD patients (partI), we now aim to analyse the potential therapeutic consequences. Post-hoc analyses of randomised studies have shown that the efficacy of drugs such as alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene, teriparatide and denosumab is similar to that of the general population in patients with a mild/moderate decline in their glomerular filtration rate (especially CKD-3). These studies have some flaws however, as they included mostly ""healthy"" women with no known diagnosis of CKD and generally with normal lab test results. Nevertheless, there are also some positive preliminary data in more advanced stages (CKD-4), even though in CKD-5D they are more limited. Therefore, at least in the absence of significant mineral metabolism disorders (i.e. severe hyperparathyroidism), the potential benefit of these drugs should be considered in patients with a high or very high fracture risk. It is an important change that the new guidelines do not make it a requirement to first perform a bone biopsy and that the risk/benefit ratio of these drugs may be justified. However, we must also be aware that most studies are not consistent and the level of evidence is low.

A,2019 04 29,"Two-dimensional (2D) liquid chromatography (2DLC) methods have grown in popularity due to their enhanced peak capacity that allows for resolving complex samples. Given the large number of commercially available column types, one of the major challenges in implementing 2DLC methods is the selection of suitable column pairs. Column selection is typically informed by chemical intuition with subsequent experimental optimization. In this work a computational screening method for 2DLC is proposed whereby virtual 2D chromatograms are calculated utilizing the Snyder-Dolan hydrophobic subtraction model (HSM) for reversed-phase column selectivity. Towards this end, 319 225 column pairs resulting from the combination of 565 columns and 100 sets of 1000 diverse analytes are examined. Compared to other screening approaches, the present method is highly predictive for column pairs that are able to resolve the largest number of analytes. This approach shows a strong sensitivity to the choice of the second dimension column (having a shorter operating time) and a preference for those with embedded polar moieties, whereas a relatively weak preference for C18 and phenyl columns is found for the first dimension.",Stable isotope labeling derivatization coupled with magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction for the determination of hydroxyl-containing cholesterol and metabolites by in vivo microdialysis and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797576,Journal of chromatography.

In this respect, a pair of new SILD reagents, d0-/d3-3-N-methyl-2'-carboxyl Rhodamine 6G (d0-/d3-MCR6G), were designed, synthesized and used to label HCMs. Rhodamine 6G with permanently positive charge was introduced into HCMs, improving ionization efficiency and enhancing detection sensitivity. In addition, the d3-MCR6G labeled standards were served as internal standards, reducing the matrix effect and guaranteeing accurate quantification. Various factors affecting MA-SILD and MDSPE were optimized. Furthermore, good linearity was obtained with R2 > 0.994 over the concentration range of 2-3000 pg/mL. The limits of detection (LODs) and quantitation (LOQs) were in the range of 0.24-0.31 and 1.5-1.8 pg/mL, respectively.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been associated with bacterial predation, as well as regulatory events during D. discoideum development and differentiation. Coenzyme A (CoA) is a key metabolic integrator in all living cells. A novel function of CoA in redox regulation, mediated by covalent attachment of CoA to cellular proteins in response to oxidative or metabolic stress, has been recently discovered and termed protein CoAlation. In this study, we report that the level of CoA and protein CoAlation in D. discoideum are developmentally regulated, and correlate with the temporal expression pattern of genes implicated in CoA biosynthesis during morphogenesis. Furthermore, treatment of growing D. discoideum cells with oxidising agents results in a dose-dependent increase of protein CoAlation. However, much higher concentrations were required when compared to mammalian cells and bacteria. Increased resistance of D. discoideum to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 has previously been attributed to high levels of catalase activity. In support of this notion, we found that H2O2-induced protein CoAlation is significantly increased in CatA-deficient D. discoideum cells. Collectively, this study provides insights into the role of CoA and protein CoAlation in the maintenance of redox homeostasis in amoeba and during D. discoideum morphogenesis.",Dynamic stacking of an expected branch point adenosine in duplexes containing pseudouridine-modified or unmodified U2 snRNA sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797552,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 07,"The pre-mRNA branch point sequence (BPS) anneals with a pseudouridine-modified region of the U2 small nuclear (sn)RNA, and offers a 2' hydroxyl group of a bulged adenosine as the nucleophile for the first catalytic step of pre-mRNA splicing.

These results highlight the importance of auxiliary factors to achieve the active bulged conformation of the branch site nucleophile for the first step of pre-mRNA splicing.","The effect of adding a new monomer ""Phene"" on the polymerization shrinkage reduction of a dental resin composite.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797550,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2019 03 20,"A new photocurable monomer, ""Phene"" (N-methyl-bis(ethyl-carbamate-isoproply-α-methylstyryl)amine) was synthesized and incorporated into Bis-GMA/TEGDMA with the aim of reducing polymerization shrinkage swithout detriment to the physical properties and wearing of the resin composites.",A novel homozygous mutation in TREM2 found in a Chinese early-onset dementia family with mild bone involvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797549,Neurobiology of aging,2019 02 24,"Variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) are associated with both behavioral variant frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. TREM2 homozygous mutations cause Nasu-Hakola disease, an early-onset recessive form of dementia preceded by bone cysts and fractures. The same type of mutations has been shown to cause frontotemporal dementia without the presence of any bone phenotype. Herein, we report a Chinese Han consanguineous family carrying a novel TREM2 mutation, presenting with early-onset dementia similar to behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia with mild radiological bone involvement.

Clinical heterogeneity is frequently observed in patients with PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations. Using whole exome sequencing, we screened a Dutch cohort of 68 patients with EOAD for rare variants in Mendelian Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and prion disease genes. We identified 3 PSEN1 and 2 PSEN2 variants. Three variants, 1 in PSEN1 (p.H21Profs*2) and both PSEN2 (p.A415S and p.M174I), were novel and absent in control exomes. These novel variants can be classified as probable pathogenic, except for PSEN1 (p.H21Profs*2) in which the pathogenicity is uncertain. The initial clinical symptoms between mutation carriers varied from behavioral problems to memory impairment. Our findings extend the mutation spectrum of EOAD and underline the clinical heterogeneity among PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutation carriers. Screening for Alzheimer's disease-causing genes is indicated in presenile dementia with an overlapping clinical diagnosis.",Flow field dynamics and high ethanol content in gasohol blends enhance BTEX migration and biodegradation in groundwater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797547,Journal of contaminant hydrology,2019 03 29,"Gasohol spills may easily descend through the soil column down and impact sensitive receptors as contaminants dissolve into the groundwater. Gasoline formulations are commonly blended with ethanol to alleviate environmental and economic issues associated with fossil fuels. However, the amount of ethanol added to gasoline and the groundwater hydraulic regime can significantly affect BTEX plume dynamics and lifespan. In this study, two long-term (5 and 10 years) field-scale gasohol releases with ethanol contents of 85% (E85) and 24% (E24), respectively, were assessed to discern the different dynamics undergone by gasohol blends. Statistical, geochemical, microbiological and trend approaches were employed to estimate the influence of groundwater flow variations on ethanol and dissolved BTEX transport, and the associated biodegradation rates of different gasohol blend spills. Ethanol and BTEX groundwater flow were quantified in terms of breakthrough curve characteristics, plume centroid positions and spreading, source depletion and mass degradation rates. In addition, bromide migration was evaluated to address the contribution of flow-driven dissolution. Results revealed that the high amount of ethanol along with a fast and dynamic flow exerted a flushing behavior that enhanced BTEX dissolution, migration (vertical and horizontal) and concentrations in groundwater. The higher amount of ethanol in E85 enhanced BTEX dissolution (and bioavailability) relative to E24 site and led to faster biodegradation rates, which can be explained by the cosolvency effect and metabolic flux dilution. Therefore, flow field dynamics and high ethanol content in gasohol blends enhance BTEX migration and biodegradation in gasohol-contaminated sites. The balance of these factors is crucial to determine fate and transport of contaminants in field sites. These findings suggest that hydraulic regime should be spatially and temporally characterized to support decisions on appropriate monitoring plan and remedial strategies for gasohol spills.","A Stochastic Model of Consensus Reaching in Committee Decisions for Faculty Advancement, Promotion and Tenure: Does Diversity Matter?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797545,Journal of the National Medical Association,2019 04 07,"There are considerable gender and racial disparities in academic promotions regardless of academic qualifications, suggesting bias.

However, approximately one-third of ischaemic strokes remain unexplained, or 'cryptogenic'. There is a wide range of possible underlying causes in cryptogenic stroke, and the best approach to secondary prevention of these may differ. To date, though, the widely accepted and uniform secondary preventive strategy in this group consists of modification of vascular risk factors, and of treatment with a combination of antiplatelet therapy and antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication. Among the potential causes for cryptogenic stroke are occult atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, atrial cardiopathy, aortic arch atheroma and hypercoagulable states. While it is possible to diagnose these conditions, in individual patients there is often uncertainty over whether they have a directly causative role, are markers of disease, or are innocent bystanders. Similarly, even if the cause is found, the best secondary preventive strategies remain uncertain, which questions the benefit of extensive investigations in a clinical setting. More recently, the concept of ""embolic stroke of unknown source (ESUS)"" has been introduced, in the hope that anticoagulation may offer better secondary prevention than antiplatelet therapy, but trials so far have been negative. At present, there is little justification for introducing extensive new investigative strategies into the management of patients with cryptogenic stroke. Investigations should be targeted at identifying those high-risk conditions which lead to a change in management. Further investigations need to be tailored individually, according to clinical circumstances. This should include identifying patients for participation in clinical trials, as the significance and best management of many of the potential causes for cryptogenic stroke require further research.",A systematic review of osteoarthritis prevention and management with dietary phytochemicals from foods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797528,Maturitas,2019 04 03,"Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory joint disease affecting mobility in humans, as well as in companion and captive animals. Understanding the effect of dietary phytochemical intake from foods on osteoarthritis and its long-term outcomes may inform public health strategies for osteoarthritis prevention and management, reducing healthcare costs globally. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of dietary phytochemical intake from foods on osteoarthritis in adult populations. A literature search was performed using Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library for human studies to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies focused on osteoarthritis up to May 2018. From 5879 articles, five RCTs and four cross-sectional studies were identified. Dietary carotenoids were examined in the observational studies, while dietary intakes of polyphenols from foods were assessed in the RCTs. Dietary polyphenol intake from foods (e.g., freeze-dried strawberries and tart cherry juice) may slow the progression of osteoarthritis via decreased inflammation and reduced cartilage degradation. However, there were relatively few studies and a lack of uniformity in the biomarkers used and the measurements of pain, quality of life and physical activity relating to osteoarthritis. The heterogeneity among the studies suggests that there is insufficient evidence related to phytochemical intake from foods. High-quality epidemiological studies and controlled trials are therefore required. Nevertheless, exploring dietary phytochemical intake from foods may complement current dietary strategies for the management of osteoarthritis and help in the formulation of more economical and manageable strategies for osteoarthritis.",Investigating the healthcare utilisation and other support needs of people with young-onset dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797527,Maturitas,2019 04 03,"There exists a knowledge gap about the specific needs and utilisation of healthcare services by people with young-onset dementia (YOD), defined as being diagnosed before the patient is 65 years of age.

This allows blood to be carried through the liver parenchyma sampled by all hepatocytes and bile produced by the hepatocytes to be carried out of the liver through the intrahepatic bile duct system composed of cholangiocytes. The molecular orchestration of multiple signaling pathways and epigenetic factors is required to set up lineage restriction of the bipotential hepatoblast progenitor into the hepatocyte and cholangiocyte cell lineages, and to further refine cell fate heterogeneity within each cell lineage reflected in the functional heterogeneity of hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In addition to the complex molecular regulation, there is a complicated morphogenetic choreography observed in building the refined hepatic epithelial architecture. Given the multifaceted molecular and cellular regulation, it is not surprising that impairment of any of these processes can result in acute and chronic hepatobiliary diseases. To enlighten the development of potential molecular and cellular targets for therapeutic options, an understanding of how the intricate hepatic molecular and cellular interactions are regulated is imperative. Here, we review the signaling pathways and epigenetic factors regulating hepatic cell lineages, fates, and epithelial architecture.",Consider the lung as a sensory organ: A tip from pulmonary neuroendocrine cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797518,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 05 08,"While the lung is commonly known for its gas exchange function, it is exposed to signals in the inhaled air and responds to them by collaborating with other systems including immune cells and the neural circuit. This important aspect of lung physiology led us to consider the lung as a sensory organ. Among different cell types within the lung that mediate this role, several recent studies have renewed attention on pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs). PNECs are a rare, innervated airway epithelial cell type that accounts for <1% of the lung epithelium population. They are enriched at airway branch points. Classical in vitro studies have shown that PNECs can respond to an array of aerosol stimuli such as hypoxia, hypercapnia and nicotine. Recent in vivo evidence suggests an essential role of PNECs at neuroimmunomodulatory sites of action, releasing neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and facilitating asthmatic responses to allergen. In addition, evidence supports that PNECs can function both as progenitor cells and progenitor niches following airway epithelial injury. Increases in PNECs have been documented in a large array of chronic lung diseases. They are also the cells-of-origin for small cell lung cancer. A better understanding of the specificity of their responses to distinct insults, their impact on normal lung function and their roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary ailments will be the next challenge toward designing therapeutics targeting the neuroendocrine system in lung.","Development, repair, and regeneration of the limb musculoskeletal system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797517,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 04 24,"The limb musculoskeletal system provides a primary means for locomotion, manipulation of objects and protection for most vertebrate organisms.

Each of these tissues also have mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells that function in maintenance and repair.

Thus, the neurons associated with motor control are generally located in, or adjacent to, the ventral horn whereas the interneurons (INs) that mediate sensory activities are present within the dorsal horn. Here, we review classic and recent studies examining the developmental mechanisms that establish the dorsal-ventral axis in the embryonic spinal cord. Intriguingly, while the cellular organization of the dorsal and ventral halves of the spinal cord looks superficially similar during early development, the underlying molecular mechanisms that establish dorsal vs ventral patterning are markedly distinct. For example, the ventral spinal cord is patterned by the actions of a single growth factor, sonic hedgehog (Shh) acting as a morphogen, i.e., concentration-dependent signal. Recent studies have shed light on the mechanisms by which the spatial and temporal gradient of Shh is transduced by cells to elicit the generation of different classes of ventral INs, and motor neurons (MNs). In contrast, the dorsal spinal cord is patterned by the action of multiple factors, most notably by members of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Wnt families. While less is known about dorsal patterning, recent studies have suggested that the BMPs do not act as morphogens to specify dorsal IN identities as previously proposed, rather each BMP has signal-specific activities. Finally, we consider the promise that elucidation of these mechanisms holds for neural repair."

The purified recombinant enzyme had a specific activity of 2802 U/mg and displayed optimum activity at pH 6.0 and 55 °C. To obtain an enzyme with high specific activity and facilitate its industrial applications, molecular engineering of Bman26 was undertaken using random mutagenesis in Bacillus subtilis WB800. Three positive mutants with substantially improved specific activities were selected and studied.

Fp was found to be the dominant variable affecting the degree of lipase deactivation, and residual activity was not associated with increasing te below a certain Fp energy density (2.66 mJ/cm2), implying a critical threshold for IPL-induced deactivation of lipase. From the results of fluorescence spectroscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), we determined that IPL-induced deactivation was caused by fragmentation, leading to lipase tertiary structural changes.

When colloidal chitin was used as the substrate, the chitooligosaccharides detected by ion chromatography were (GlcNAc)1-5, and the total yield of chitooligosaccharides was 14.4%. Our results indicate that strategies for increasing Chisb expression contribute to the study and application of chitinase and the production of chitooligosaccharides.",Biochemical characterization of peptidylarginine deiminase-like orthologs from thermotolerant Emericella dentata and Aspergillus nidulans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797478,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 04 12,"Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are a group of hydrolases, mediating the deimination of peptidylarginine residues into peptidyl-citrulline. Equivocal protein citrullination by PADs of fungal pathogens has a strong relation to the progression of multiple human diseases, however, the biochemical properties of fungal PADs remain ambiguous. Thus, this is the first report exploring the molecular properties of PAD from thermotolerant fungi, to imitate the human temperature. The teleomorph Emericella dentata and anamorph Aspergillus nidulans have been morphologically and molecularly identified, with observed robust growth at 37-40 °C, and strong PAD productivity. The physiological profiles of E. dentata and A. nidulans for PADs production in response to carbon, nitrogen sources, initial medium pH and incubation temperature were relatively identical, emphasizing the taxonomical proximity of these fungal isolates. PADs were purified from E. dentata and A. nidulans with apparent molecular masses 41 and 48 kDa, respectively. The peptide fingerprints of PADs from E. dentata and A. nidulans have been analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS, displaying a higher sequence similarity to human PAD4 by 18% and 31%, respectively. The conserved peptide sequences of E. dentata and A. nidulans PADs displayed a higher similarity to human PAD than A. fumigatus PADs clade. PADs from both fungal isolates have an optimum pH and pH stability at 7.0-8.0, with putative pI 5.0-5.5, higher structural denaturation at pH 4.0-5.5 and 9.5-12 as revealed from absorbance at λ280nm. E. dentata PAD had a higher conformationally thermal stability than A. nidulans PAD as revealed from its lower Kr value. From the proteolytic mapping, the orientation of trypsinolytic recognition sites on the PADs surface from both fungal isolates was very similar. PADs from both isolates are calcium dependent, with participation of serine and cysteine residues on their catalytic sites. PADs displayed a higher affinity to deiminate the peptidylarginine residues with a feeble affinity to work as ADI. So, PADs from E. dentata and A. nidulans had a relatively similar conformational and kinetic properties. Further molecular modeling analysis are ongoing to explore the role of PADs in citrullination of human proteins in Aspergillosis, that will open a new avenue for unraveling the vague of protein-protein interaction of human A. nidulans pathogen.",Identification of enzyme(s) capable of degrading endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate using in silico techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797477,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 04 12,"Endosulfan is one of the most widely used organochlorine cyclodiene insecticides. Microbial oxidation of endosulfan forms endosulfan sulfate, which is more or less toxic and persistent as endosulfan. Due to lack of specificity and efficiency of microbial bioremediation technique in the field conditions, enzymatic bioremediation is receiving huge attention to clean-up the environment. In the present study, X-ray crystal structures of enzymes from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank were screened for their potential to degrade endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. A phenol hydroxylase, 1PN0 from Trichosporon cutaneum was found to have the potential to degrade both α-endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate while a bacterial CotA laccase, 3ZDW from Bacillus subtilis has the potential to degrade α-endosulfan. The in silico result correlate with in vitro degradation study using two different strains of Trichosporon cutaneum. In vitro degradation study found that the fungal strain was capable of degrading 60.36% α-endosulfan, 70.73% β-endosulfan, and 52.08% endosulfan sulfate. The presence of phenol hydroxylase inhibitor in the sulfur-free medium with endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate as sole sulfur source inhibits the growth of both the fungal strains. Such in silico techniques can provide an easy and reliable way to speed up the development of bioremediation processes through rapid identification of potential enzymes and microbes to counter the ever-increasing number of toxic compounds in the environment.",The modular arabinanolytic enzyme Abf43A-Abf43B-Abf43C from Ruminiclostridium josui consists of three GH43 modules classified in different subfamilies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797476,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 04 12,"The abnA gene from Ruminiclostridium josui encodes the large modular arabinanolytic enzyme, Abf43A-Abf43B-Abf43C, consisting of an N-terminal signal peptide, a Laminin_G_3 module, a GH43_22 module, a Laminin_G_3 module, a Big_4 module, a GH43_26 module, a GH43_34 module and a dockerin module in order with a calculated molecular weight of 204,108. Three truncated enzymes were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli and biochemically characterized, RjAbf43A consisting of the first Laminin_G_3 module and GH43_22 module, RjAbf43B consisting of the second Laminin_G_3 module, Big_4 module and GH43_26 module, and RjAbf43C consisting of the GH43_34 module. RjAbf43A showed a strong α-l-arabinofuranosidase activity toward sugar beet arabinan, highly branched arabinan but not linear arabinan, thus it acted in the removal of arabinose side chains from sugar beet arabinan. By contrast, RjAbf43B showed a strong exo-α-1,5-l-arabinofuranosidase activity toward linear arabinan and arabinooligosaccharides whereas RjAbf43C showed low activity toward these substrates. Although RjAbf43B was activated by the presence of some metal ions such as Zn2+, Mg2+ and Ni2+, RjAbf43A was inhibited by these ions. RjAbf43A and RjAbf43B attacked sugar beet arabinan in a synergistic manner. By comparison, RjAbf43A-Abf43B containing both GH43_22 and GH43_26 modules showed lower hydrolytic activity toward sugar beet arabinan but higher activity toward sugar beet fiber than the sum of the individual activities of RjAbf43A and RjAbf43B, suggesting that the coexistence of two distinct GH43 modules in a single polypeptide is important for the efficient hydrolysis of an insoluble and natural polysaccharide but not a soluble substrate.",Producing alcohol and salt stress tolerant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by heterologous expression of pprI gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797475,Enzyme and microbial technology,2019 04 12,"Ethanol is considered a comparatively clean biofuel, and its large scale production has been a long time concern.

The CXFeNGO catalyst was characterized using a scanning electron microscope, and X-ray diffraction, and the catalytic activity was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry studies. At the anode, colonization of bacterial cells on the electrode surface, forming a biofilm, was observed. When the CXFeNGO-modified electrode was used at the cathode in the MFC, a maximum power density of 176.5 ± 6 mW m-2 was obtained, compared to that of plain graphite electrode, which produced 139.1 ± 4 mW m-2.

Then the composites were firstly utilized to selectively separate malachite green (MG) and crystal violet (CV) coupled with magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE). A response surface methodology (RSM) based on Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was selected to analytically optimize the extraction parameters including initial concentration of dyes, extraction time, pH value and extraction temperature. The maximum extraction amount and optimal extraction conditions predicted by the RSM model matched well with the actual experimental results, and the extraction amount was 966.93 mg g-1 for MG and 788.90 mg g-1 for CV,respectively. The results indicated that the model possessed higher calculation accuracy through analyzing fewer sample points, thereby achieving theoretical prediction of extraction amount and conditions and being a prefect supplementary to actual experiments.

The selected drugs represent more than 12 different classes of drugs characterized by varying physical and chemical properties. A Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) extraction phase, prepared using HLB particles synthesized in-house, yielded the best extraction/desorption performance among four different SPME extraction phases evaluated in the current work. The developed SPME method was optimized in terms of SPME coating and geometry, desorption solvent, extraction and rinsing conditions, and extraction and desorption times.

Herein, a label-free near-infrared (NIR) Ag2S quantum dots (QDs)-based fluorescent strategy was constructed for the sensitive and selective detection of Cyt c. In this system, Cyt c was hydrolyzed by trypsin, and the resulting heme-peptide fragment exhibited peroxidase-like activity for catalytic decomposition of H2O2 into hydroxyl radical (·OH). The presence of caffeic acid in this system resulted into the formation of caffeic acid-quinone due to the strong oxidizing ability of ·OH. The production of caffeic acid-quinone led to the fluorescence quenching of Ag2S QDs through electron transfer mechanism. Based on the cascade reaction, we successfully developed a label-free approach to detect Cyt c using Ag2S QDs as nanoprobes. Under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence intensity of Ag2S QDs was linearly relative to the concentration of Cyt c over the range from 2.0 to 150 nM with a detection limit of 1.7 nM. In addition, this strategy was successfully applied for quantitative detection of Cyt c in cell lysates of H2O2 or etoposide (anticancer drug)-induced apoptotic cells, providing great potential application for cell-based oxidation pressure determination and screening of anticancer drugs.","Colorimetric detection of normetanephrine, a pheochromocytoma biomarker, using bifunctionalised gold nanoparticles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797455,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 20,"A simple and effective colorimetric method for the detection of normetanephrine (NMN), an O-methylated metabolite of norepinephrine, using functionalised gold nanoparticles is described. This metabolite is an important biomarker in the diagnosis of adrenal tumours such as pheocromocytoma or paraganglioma. The colorimetric probe consists of spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalised with two different ligands, which specifically recognize different functional groups in normetanephrine. Thus, a benzaldehyde-terminated ligand was used for the recognition of the amino alcohol moiety in NMN, by forming the corresponding oxazolidine. On the other hand, N-acetyl-cysteine was chosen for the recognition of the phenolic hydroxyl group through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The selective double molecular recognition between the probe and the hydroxyl and the amino-alcohol moieties of normetanephrine led to interparticle-crosslinking aggregation resulting in a change in the color of the solution, from red to blue, which could be observed by naked eye. The probe was highly selective towards normetanephrine and no color changes were observed in the presence of other neurotransmitter metabolites such as homovanillic acid (HVA) (dopamine metabolite), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (serotonin metabolite), or other biomolecules present in urine such as glucose (Glc), uric acid (U.A), and urea.

In the array-based sensing platform, DNA-ligand ensembles adsorbed on the surface of MnO2 nanosheets were used as sensing probes. Instead of aptamers from cell-SELEX, the randomly designed DNA strands were used, offering versatile interactions with cells. The property that MnO2 nanosheets can be degraded by intracellular glutathione makes the platform avoid the washing step. Eight types of cell lines were distinguished from each other after the data were treated with principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, a 95% of identification accuracy for the randomly selected unknown samples was achieved.

The Combined Regenerative Organic food Production® project of the German Aerospace Center aims for recycling human metabolic waste products to produce useful resources. A biofiltration process based on natural communities of microorganisms has been developed and tested. The processed aqueous solution is, among others, rich in nitrogen present as nitrate. Nitrate is one of the main nutrients required for plant cultivation, resulting in strong synergies between the developed recycling process and plant cultivation. The latter is envisaged as the basis of future bio-regenerative life support systems, because plants do consume carbon dioxide, water and nutrients in order to produce oxygen, water, food and inedible biomass. This paper describes a series of plant cultivation experiments performed with synthetic urine processed in a bioreactor. The aim of the experiments was to investigate the feasibility of growing tomato plants with this solution. The results of the experiments show that such cultivation of tomato plants is generally feasible, but that the plants are less productive. The fruit fresh weight per plant is less compared to plants grown with the half-strength Hoagland reference solution. This lack in production is caused by imbalances of sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium and ammonium in the solution gained from recycling the synthetic urine.

Re-mineralization of the sediment in the mixture of hydrogen peroxide and nitric acid in the wet combustion reactor converts mineral elements bound in the sediment into the form available to plants. Using mineralized fish waste as an additional source of mineral elements in the nutrient solutions for growing plants based on mineralized human waste is a way to reduce the amounts of mineral elements added to the solution to replenish it, enabling fuller closure of material loops in the BTLSS.","Failure modes, causes, and effects of algal photobioreactors used to control a spacecraft environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797433,Life sciences in space research,2019 02 24,"Bioregenerative technologies, in particular algae photobioreactors, have the potential to provide closed-loop environmental control and life support for human space flight, if robust enough for long-duration deep space missions.

Failure modes can stem from either the algae cellular physiology or the engineered system needed for the application and are grouped in this paper accordingly.",Why did carbon become the pseudo-limiting factor in aquatic closed ecological systems?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797432,Life sciences in space research,2019 02 24,"Closure from the earth's atmosphere is a critical test of an ecosystem's ability to function. In our earlier testing of autotrophic Closed Ecological Systems (CESs), a C:N ratio of 26.4 (3.3 mM NaHCO3 and 0.125 mM NaNO3) supported algal and Daphnia populations for months, but developed extreme pH values (∼11 ungrazed, >10, grazed), suggesting that the systems were carbon-limited. Only approximately half the HCO3- (bicarbonate) would be expected to be available to green algae, the other portion becoming CO3-2 (carbonate). In an experiment described here, CESs were developed to explore a greater range of C:N ratios. To keep the medium from becoming too osmotically concentrated, NaNO3 was reduced to 0.0312 mM and NaHCO3 tested at 3.3, 13.2, and 26.4 mM, resulting in nominal C:N ratios of 105, 422, and 845. However, additional carbon was not beneficial to long-term survival of the organisms. The algal abundance was relatively insensitive to C:N ratio; greater concentrations of C were not beneficial. Daphnia populations were sensitive to C:N ratio and persisted longer at the lowest C:N ratio of 105. All of the C:N ratios tested in these CESs are outside of the expected range suggested from ecological studies, which is based on the Redfield Ratio of 6.625 C:N, the expected chemical composition of algae. Two potential explanations for the apparent high C demand in our CESs are suggested by the literature. The first is production of fatty algal cells, e.g., one of the algal species, Scenedesmus obliquus, is reported to produce high-lipid cells that could have a higher C:N ratio than the Redfield Ratio. The second is ""carbon overconsumption,"" which has been suggested for N-limited marine phytoplankton communities dominated by diatoms or nutrient deficient algal communities dominated by small cells that are under-represented by chlorophyll a measurements. The unexpected C dynamics found in our CES tests could be relevant to the design of biological life support systems that must be provisioned with adequate elements for long-term ecosystem functionality. If the actual demand for C is underestimated, its storage may be inadequate.",Nucleic acid bases in Titan tholins and possible genetic systems in the Titan liquidosphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797431,Life sciences in space research,2019 02 24,"Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and possesses a dense atmosphere composed of nitrogen and methane. Various types of organic compounds (hydrocarbons, nitriles, etc.) have been found on Titan, which were generated by reactions taking place in its atmosphere. These reactions are considered to provide crucial evidence for chemical reactions which may have occurred in the atmosphere of primitive Earth. Cassini discovered several lakes of liquid methane and ethane on Titan's surface; in addition, the presence of ammonia water in its sub-surface was implied. In order to simulate the chemical reactions in Titan's atmosphere, gas mixtures of nitrogen and methane have been exposed to plasma discharges to synthesize complex organic matters. In this study, we focused on the formation of nucleic acid bases and related compounds recovered from synthesized Titan tholins. The five nucleic acid bases that terrestrial life uses (adenine, cytosine, thymine, guanine, and uracil) have already been reported to be present in synthesized Titan tholins. Purines and pyrimidines, including the five aforementioned nucleic acid bases, were extracted from synthesized Titan tholins and analyzed by HPLC and LC/MS. As a result, the pyrimidine bases of isocytosine and 2, 4-diaminopyrimidine were detected together with the terrestrial nucleic acid bases of adenine, uracil, and cytosine. The results obtained in conjunction with those from previous studies show that some nucleic acid bases and related pyrimidine bases are found in synthesized Titan tholins, suggesting that chemical evolutions toward xenogenetic systems could occur in Titan's environment.",An investigation of the single and combined effects of hypogravity and ionizing radiation on brain monoamine metabolism and rats' behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797429,Life sciences in space research,2019 02 24,"Ionizing radiation and hypogravity can cause central nervous system (CNS) dysfunctions. This is a key limiting factor for deep space missions. Up until now, the mechanisms through which they affect the neural tissue are not completely understood.",Biological effects of space environmental factors: A possible interaction between space radiation and microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30797428,Life sciences in space research,2019 02 24,"In the mid-1980s, space experiments began to examine if microgravity could alter the biological effects of space radiation. In the late 1990s, repair of DNA strand breaks was reported to not be influenced by microgravity using the pre-irradiated cells, because the exposure doses of space radiation were few due to the short spaceflight. There were, however, conflicting reports depending on the biological endpoints used in various systems. While almost no attempts were made to assess the possibility that the microgravity effects could be altered by space radiation. This was probably due to the general understanding that microgravity plays a major role in space and works independently from space radiation. Recent ground-based simulation studies focusing on DNA oxidative damage and signal transduction suggested that combined effects of microgravity and space radiation might exist. These studies also implicated the importance of research focusing not only on chromosomal DNA but also on cytoplasm, especially mitochondria. Therefore, we propose a new model which accounts for the combined-effects through the window of cellular responses. In this model, the interactions between microgravity and space radiation might occur during the following cellular-responses; (A) damaging and signaling by ROS, (B) damage responses on DNA (repair, replication, transcription, etc.), and (C) expression of gene and protein (regulation by chromatin, epigenetic control, etc.)."
