Process-based models accounting for the effect of bioturbation are needed for the modelling of erosion dynamics. With this work, we explore whether the fundamental allometric principles of metabolic activity scaling with individual and population size may provide a framework to derive general patterns of bioturbation effect on cohesive sediment resuspension. Experimental flumes were used to test this scaling approach across different species of marine, soft-sediment bioturbators. The collected dataset encompasses a range of bioturbator functional diversity, individual densities, body sizes and overall population metabolic rates. Measurements were collected across a range of hydrodynamic stress from 0.02 to 0.25 Pa. Overall, we observed that bioturbators are able to slightly reduce the sediment resuspension at low hydrodynamic stress, whereas they noticeably enhance it at higher levels of stress. Along the whole hydrodynamic stress gradient, the quantitative effect of bioturbators on sediment resuspension can be efficiently described by the overall metabolic rate of the bioturbating benthic communities, with significant variations across the bioturbators' taxonomic and functional diversity. One of the tested species (the gallery-builder Polychaeta Hediste diversicolor) had an effect that was partially deviating from the general trend, being able to markedly reduce sediment resuspension at low hydrodynamic stress compared to other species. By combining bioturbators' influence with hydrodynamic force, we were able to produce a process-based model of biota-mediated sediment resuspension.",Neurogenic pulmonary edema following seizures: A retrospective computed tomography study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901571,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 05 19,Data on the frequency and clinical relevance of neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) following epileptic seizures are limited.

Here, we show that mammalian ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1) is a previously unrecognized component of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) receptor 1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) and attenuates TNFα-induced NF-κB signaling. Genetic ablation of MST1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages potentiated the TNFα-induced increase in IκB kinase (IKK) activity, as well as the expression of NF-κB target genes. TNFα induced the recruitment of MST1 to TNF-RSC and its interaction with HOIP, the catalytic component of the E3 ligase linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC). Furthermore, MST1 activated in response to TNFα stimulation mediates the phosphorylation of HOIP and thereby inhibited LUBAC-dependent linear ubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ.

A decade ago, there were few reproducible findings, and now there are hundreds. In this review, we focus on the findings that have illuminated the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders and the challenges of using these findings to inform our understanding of pathophysiology. The evidence is now overwhelming that psychiatric disorders are ""polygenic""-that many genetic loci contribute to risk. With the exception of a subset of those with ASD, few individuals with a psychiatric disorder have a single, deterministic genetic cause; rather, developing a psychiatric disorder is influenced by hundreds of different genetic variants, consistent with a polygenic model. As progressively larger studies have uncovered more about their genetic architecture, the need to elucidate additional architectures has become clear. Even if we were to have complete knowledge of the genetic architecture of a psychiatric disorder, full understanding requires deep knowledge of the functional genomic architecture-the implicated loci impact regulatory processes that influence gene expression and the functional coordination of genes that control biological processes. Following from this is cellular architecture: of all brain regions, cell types, and developmental stages, where and when are the functional architectures operative? Given that the genetic architectures of different psychiatric disorders often strongly overlap, we are challenged to re-evaluate and refine the diagnostic architectures of psychiatric disorders using fundamental genetic and neurobiological data."

The pathogens, if left untreated, can compromise tree health and economically impact entire commercial fruit productions. Historically, the choice of effective control methods has been limited. The use of antibiotics was proposed as an effective control method. The identification of these pathogens and screening for the presence of antibiotic resistance is paramount in the adoption and implementation of disease control methods. Molecular tests have been developed and accepted for identification and characterization of these disease-causing organisms. We improved existing molecular tests by developing methods that are equal or superior in robustness for identifying E. amylovora or P. syringae while being faster to execute. In addition, the real-time PCR-based detection method for E. amylovora provided complementary information on the susceptibility or resistance to streptomycin of individual isolates.

We show that bacterial isolates exhibit different behaviors when brought into contact with various apple varieties and that the hierarchical clustering of symptom severity indicates a population structure, suggesting a genetic basis for host cultivar specificity.",Growth of Salmonella enterica Serovars Typhimurium and Enteritidis in Iron-Poor Media and in Meat: Role of Catecholate and Hydroxamate Siderophore Transporters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901525,Journal of food protection,2019 03 27,"Enteritidis and Typhimurium are among the top Salmonella enterica serovars implicated in human salmonellosis worldwide. This study examined the individual and combined roles of catecholate-iron and hydroxamate-iron transporters in the survival in meat of Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium. Catecholate-iron-III (Fe3+) and hydroxamate-Fe3+ transporter genes fepA, iroN, and fhuACDB were deleted in isolates of these serovars to generate single, double, and triple mutants. Growth rate in high- and low-iron media was compared among mutants, complements, and their wild-type parents. Susceptibility to 14 antibiotics, the ability to produce and utilize siderophores, and survival on cooked chicken breast were evaluated. In iron-poor liquid media, differences were observed between the growth characteristics of mutant Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium. The double Δ iroNΔ fepA and the triple Δ fhuΔ iroNΔ fepA mutants of Salmonella Enteritidis exhibited prolonged lag phases (λ = 9.72 and 9.53 h) and a slow growth rate (μmax = 0.35 and 0.25 h-1) similar to that of its Δ tonB mutant (λ = 10.12 h and μmax = 0.30 h-1). In Salmonella Typhimurium, double Δ iroNΔ fepA and triple Δ fhuΔ iroNΔ fepA mutations induced a similar growth pattern as its Δ tonB mutant. Double deletions of fepA and iroN reduced the siderophore production and the use of enterobactin as an iron source. In the Δ iroNΔ fepA mutant, but not in Δ fhuΔ iroNΔ fepA, the ferrichrome or deferrioxamine promoted growth for both serovars, confirming the specific role of the FhuACDB system in the uptake and transport of hydroxamate Fe3+. Survival of the mutants was also evaluated in a meat assay, and no difference in survival was observed among the mutants compared with wild type. This study showed differences between serovars in the importance of catecholate-iron and hydroxamate-iron uptake on Salmonella growth in iron-restricted media. Data also confirmed that both Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium are well equipped to survive on cooked chicken meat, offering a rich iron condition.",Olive oil promotes wound healing of mice pressure injuries through NOS-2 and Nrf2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901524,"Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",2019 03 22,"The pressure injury environment is characterized by overproduction of reactive oxygen species and exacerbated inflammation, which impair the healing of these lesions. Mediterranean-like diet may be a good intervention to improve the healing of pressure injury due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant components. So, this study evaluated the hypothesis that olive oil, as a main source of lipid in Mediterranean diet, could improve cutaneous wound healing of pressure injury in mice. Male Swiss mice were randomly divided into standard, olive oil or soybean oil plus olive oil groups and fat represented 10% of total calories in all groups. Four weeks after the beginning of diet administration, two cycles of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) by external application of two magnets disks were performed in the dorsal skin to induce pressure injury formation. Fourteen days after the end of the second IR cycle, olive oil based diet reduced neutrophils cells and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression, increased nitric oxide synthase-2 and protein and lipid oxidation. Olive oil based diet also increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 protein expression and collagen type I precursor protein expression. In addition, olive oil based diet administration promoted wound closure 7, 10 and 14 days after the end of the second IR cycle. These findings support the hypothesis that olive oil based diet improves cutaneous wound healing of pressure injury in mice through the reduction of inflammation and stimulation of redox equilibrium.",Modifying Surfaces with the Primary and Secondary Faces of Cyclodextrins To Achieve a Distinct Anti-icing Capability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901523,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 16,"Heterogenous ice nucleation (HIN) induced by organic materials is a long-lasting issue in wide-ranging fields from cryobiology to atmospheric physics, but efforts for controlling HIN are still restricted by incomplete understanding of its mechanism. In this work, distinct anti-icing capabilities were achieved by experimentally investigating the HIN behavior on the surfaces modified with the primary face (PF) and secondary face (SF) of cyclodextrins (CDs) (i.e., α-1,4-linked d-(+)-glucopyranose with two relatively flat and hydroxylated faces). To achieve this, CDs were first immobilized to the surfaces through selectively binding the PF and SF of CDs onto the solid surfaces; as such, either PF or SF is exposed to liquid water. Interestingly, HIN temperature and delay time assays indicate that HIN is depressed when the PF of CDs (which matches with the ice lattice) is exposed to liquid water whereas the HIN is facilitated when the SF of CDs (which mismatches with the ice lattice) is exposed to liquid water. This deviates from the common thought that surfaces with a template of ice lattice match facilitate the HIN. Instead, 1H NMR studies show that the resonances of hydroxyl (OH) in the SF of CDs are most deshielded due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, in comparison to that of OH in the PF of CDs, which weakens the interaction between the OH groups on the SF and water molecules. Thus, the distinct anti-icing capabilities of the PF and SF of CDs can be achieved and established by the distinct interactions between OH groups on the two faces and water, which is of great potential for practical applications. The molecular-level interactions between surfaces and water molecules may be a more appropriate criterion for forecasting materials' HIN ability.",Water Uptake and Loss in Viscous Aerosol Particles with Concentration-Dependent Diffusivities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901522,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 24,"An accurate understanding of the equilibration timescale of organic aerosol particles with surrounding water vapor is difficult because of the strong concentration-dependent diffusivities that are present in these systems. We examine this problem along with the closely related problem of the time-dependent radius of a binary aerosol particle during the uptake or loss of water. The governing equations and boundary conditions are discussed and a boundary value problem is formulated and solved. The resulting expressions are applied to water uptake and loss in two systems of atmospheric importance: aqueous-inorganic particles and high-viscosity organic particles. Accuracy is evaluated through a comparison with numerical solutions. For particles whose diffusivity has a strong dependence on water concentration and whose viscosity remains above 1 Pa·s during water uptake or loss, the expression for the characteristic equilibration time is found to be in excellent agreement with numerical results. Moreover, it provides physical insights into mass transport processes.",Tunable Silver-Containing Stationary Phases for Multidimensional Gas Chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901521,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 16,"To achieve high separation power of complex samples using multidimensional gas chromatography (MDGC), the selectivity of the employed stationary phases is crucial. The nonpolar × polar column combination remains the most popular column set used in MDGC. However, resolution of mixtures containing light analytes possessing very similar properties remains a formidable challenge. The development of stationary phases that offer unique separation mechanisms have the potential to significantly improve MDGC separations, particularly in resolving coeluting peaks in complex samples. For the first time, a stationary phase containing silver(I) ions was successfully designed and employed as a second-dimension column using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) for the separation of mixtures containing alkynes, dienes, terpenes, esters, aldehydes, and ketones. Compared with a widely used nonpolar and polar column set, the silver-based column exhibited superior performance by providing better chromatographic resolution of coeluting compounds. A mixture of unsaturated fatty acids was successfully separated using a GC × GC method in which the elution order in the second dimension was highly dependent on the number of double bonds within the analytes.",Structural Characterization of a Synthetic Tandem-Domain Bacterial Microcompartment Shell Protein Capable of Forming Icosahedral Shell Assemblies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901520,ACS synthetic biology,2019 04 19,"Bacterial microcompartments are subcellular compartments found in many prokaryotes; they consist of a protein shell that encapsulates enzymes that perform a variety of functions. The shell protects the cell from potentially toxic intermediates and colocalizes enzymes for higher efficiency. Accordingly, it is of considerable interest for biotechnological applications. We have previously structurally characterized an intact 40 nm shell comprising three different types of proteins. One of those proteins, BMC-H, forms a cyclic hexamer; here we have engineered a synthetic protein that consists of a tandem duplication of BMC-H connected by a short linker. The synthetic protein forms cyclic trimers that self-assemble to form a smaller (25 nm) icosahedral shell with gaps at the pentamer positions. When coexpressed in vivo with the pentamer fused to an affinity tag we can purify complete icosahedral shells. This engineered shell protein constitutes a minimal shell system to study permeability; reducing symmetry from 6- to 3-fold will allow for finer control of the pore environment. We have determined a crystal structure of this shell to guide rational engineering of this microcompartment shell for biotechnological applications.",A Yeast System for Discovering Optogenetic Inhibitors of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901519,ACS synthetic biology,2019 04 19,"The precise spatiotemporal regulation of protein synthesis is essential for many complex biological processes such as memory formation, embryonic development, and tumor formation. Current methods used to study protein synthesis offer only a limited degree of spatiotemporal control. Optogenetic methods, in contrast, offer the prospect of controlling protein synthesis noninvasively within minutes and with a spatial scale as small as a single synapse. Here, we present a hybrid yeast system where growth depends on the activity of human eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) that is suitable for screening optogenetic designs for the down-regulation of protein synthesis. We used this system to screen a diverse initial panel of 15 constructs designed to couple a light switchable domain (PYP, RsLOV, AsLOV, Dronpa) to 4EBP2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 2), a native inhibitor of translation initiation. We identified cLIPS1 (circularly permuted LOV inhibitor of protein synthesis 1), a fusion of a segment of 4EBP2 and a circularly permuted version of the LOV2 domain from Avena sativa, as a photoactivated inhibitor of translation. Adapting the screen for higher throughput, we tested small libraries of cLIPS1 variants and found cLIPS2, a construct with an improved degree of optical control. We show that these constructs can both inhibit translation in yeast harboring a human eIF4E in vivo, and bind human eIF4E in vitro in a light-dependent manner. This hybrid yeast system thus provides a convenient way for discovering optogenetic constructs that can regulate human eIF4E-dependent translation initiation in a mechanistically defined manner.",Preparation of a Ruthenium-Complex-Functionalized Two-Photon-Excited Red Fluorescence Silicon Nanoparticle Composite for Targeted Fluorescence Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy in Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901518,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 17,"Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs), especially those emitting red fluorescence, have been widely applied in the field of bioimaging. However, harsh synthetic conditions and strong biological autofluorescence caused by short wavelength excitation restrict the further development of SiNPs in the field of biological applications. Here, we report a method for synthesizing a ruthenium-complex-functionalized two-photon-excited red fluorescence silicon nanoparticle composite (SiNPs-Ru) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer under mild experimental conditions. In the prepared SiNPs-Ru composite, silicon nanoparticles synthesized by atmospheric pressure microwave-assisted synthesis served as a fluorescence energy donor, which had two-photon fluorescence properties, and tris(4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) dichloride (LRu) acted as a fluorescence energy acceptor, which could emit red fluorescence as well as had the ability to produce singlet-oxygen for photodynamic therapy. Therefore, the synthesized SiNPs-Ru could emit red fluorescence by two-photon excitation based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer, which could effectively avoid the interference of biological autofluorescence. Fluorescence imaging tests in zebrafish and nude mice indicated that the as-prepared SiNPs-Ru could act as a new kind of fluorescence probe for fluorescence imaging in vivo. By coupling folic acid (FA) to SiNPs-Ru, the prepared composite (FA-SiNPs-Ru) could not only serve as a targeted two-photon fluorescence imaging probe but also kill cancer cells via photodynamic therapy in vitro.",Chemo- and Diastereoselective Synthesis of N-Propargyl Oxazolidines through a Copper-Catalyzed Domino A3 Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901517,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 05 04,"Herein we describe a highly chemoselective A3-coupling/annulation of amino alcohols, formaldehyde, two kinds of aldehydes and alkynes, catalyzed by copper(II). This cascade reaction, employing readily available materials, provides a new and highly effective access to chiral N-propargyl oxazolidines with good diastereoselectivity (up to >20:1). In the case of ortho-substituted aromatic aldehydes, an intriguing steric effect is observed: a bulky group exhibits a remarkably adverse effect on the diastereoselectivity for the formation of the title molecule."

It is considered as a homogenous epidemiological unit and a defined study area. In 2012, all cattle and sheep of 40 selected HH were sampled to determine sero-prevalence of antibodies to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and of FMDV. The overall sero-prevalence of antibodies to the non-structural 3ABC protein (NSP-3ABC ELISA) was 28.9% (380/1,315) (30.6% cattle; 16.3% sheep), and in 4.5% (62/1,380) (5% cattle; 0.6% sheep) of the examined sera FMD viral RNA could be detected by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). Additionally, in 2012 and 2014 serum, epithelium and probang samples were collected from cattle in reported FMD outbreaks and the causative FMDVs were molecularly characterized. Approximately half (28/59) of the outbreak sera reacted positive in NSP-3ABC ELISA, and 88% (52/59) of the outbreak sera contained detectable viral RNA. Overall, antibodies against five FMDV serotypes (O, A, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3) were detected by solid phase competitive ELISA with combinations of two or more serotypes being common. Of the 21 FMDVs that could be isolated 19 were sequenced and 18 were confirmed as SAT2 (lineage VII) while one was characterized as serotype O (EA-3 topotype). Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close relationship between Nigerian FMDV strains and strains in this region and even with strains in North-Africa. Our findings indicate that FMD constitutes an endemic health problem to cattle rearing in the agro-pastoralist community in the KGR and that the KGR is not a closed epidemiological unit. Insight into the local FMDV epidemiology and in the circulating FMDV serotypes/strains is of support to the relevant authorities in Nigeria when considering the need for an FMD control policy to improve animal production in grazing reserves.",Alteration of gut microbiota by a Westernized lifestyle and its correlation with insulin resistance in non-diabetic Japanese men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901505,Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 04 19,"The severity of insulin resistance is higher in Japanese-American people with American lifestyles than in native Japanese people with Japanese lifestyles.

In addition, gut microbiota alterations have been suggested to contribute to pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The principle aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a Westernized lifestyle on the gut microbiota of Japanese-Americans versus native Japanese, and its correlation with insulin resistance.",Current weight of evidence of viruses associated with peri-implantitis and peri-implant health: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901504,Reviews in medical virology,2019 05 30,"The pathological role of human herpesviruses (HHVs) (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], Human cytomegalovirus [CMV], and Herpes simplex virus [HSV]) in peri-implant health needs clarification quantitatively. To determine the weight of evidence for HHVs in patients with peri-implantitis (PI) and substantiate the significance of HHVs in peri-implant inflammation, electronic databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1964 up to and including November 2018. Meta-analyses were conducted for prevalence of HHVs in PI and healthy controls. Forest plots were generated that recorded risk difference (RD) of outcomes and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Five clinical studies were considered and included. Four clinical studies reported data on EBV while three clinical studies reported data on CMV. Considering the risk of these viruses in PI, significant heterogeneity for CMV (χ2  = 53.37, p < 0.0001, I2  = 96.25%) and EBV (χ2  = 14.14, p = 0.002, I2  = 78.79%) prevalence was noticed between PI and healthy control sites. The overall RD for only EBV (RD = 0.20, 95% CI, 0.01-0.40, p = 0.03) was statistically significant between both groups. Frequencies of the viruses were increased in patients with PI compared with healthy nondiseased sites.

Aspects of its biology are documented extensively in the literature; however, knowledge of P. clavata internal morphology, specifically of exocrine glands, is restricted to the venom apparatus. The objective of this study was to describe the mandibular gland morphology of P. clavata workers. The mandibular gland is composed of a reservoir connected to a cluster of Type III secretory cells with cytoplasm rich in mitochondria and lipid droplets, similar to that of other ants. Notably, the glandular secretion is rich in protein and has a solid aspect. This is the first morphological description of the mandibular gland of P. clavata. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: This study presents the morphological description of the mandibular gland of Paraponera clavata (Hymenoptera: Paraponerinae). Singular characteristics of the gland are described: the glandular secretion is rich in protein and has a solid aspect.","Effects of immunoadsorption combined with membrane filtration on complement markers - results of a randomized, controlled, crossover study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901502,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,2019 04 05,"The complement system has been implicated in several kidney diseases, such as antibody-mediated rejection after kidney transplantation. Antibody-depletion techniques allow successful ABO- and/or HLA-incompatible transplantation. Considering the IgG removal, the use of semi-selective immunoadsorption (IA) has been advocated. However, because of results on incomplete IgM depletion, the adjunctive use of membrane filtration (MF) has been proposed to enhance the removal of macromolecules and to interfere with complement activation. This secondary endpoint analysis of a recently published randomized, controlled, cross-over trial was designed to investigate the effect of combined treatment IA + MF compared to IA alone on complement depletion. Two treatment sequences, a single session of IA + MF followed by IA (and vice versa), were analyzed with regard to C5b-9, properdin, and mannose-binding lectin (MBL) levels. Neither IA alone nor IA + MF provoked complement activation as demonstrated by stable low levels of C5b-9 after the procedure as compared to the previous. The combined treatment substantially lowered properdin (77% vs. 26% reduction, P < 0.0001) as well as MBL concentrations (81% vs. 11% reduction, P < 0.0001). Recovery of properdin and MBL levels appears to be longer after IA alone compared to IA + MF. Depletion of properdin and MBL levels may have potential clinical implications in the setting of kidney transplantation.",Tunable model promoters in DFT simulations of catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901501,Journal of computational chemistry,2019 06 03,"Promoter atoms can tune a catalyst's activity and selectivity by transferring charge to and from the active site. Rational design of promoted catalysts, using density functional theory calculations, is today limited by the need to simulate many catalyst and promoter configurations. We present a simple approximation that rapidly captures some trends in promoter effects, at a cost of complexity comparable with simulating unpromoted catalysts. Negative (positive) noninteger point charges introduced into the catalyst simulate how electropositive (electronegative) promoters might affect each predicted intermediate. Calculations return Sabatier plots, relating promoters' predicted efficacy to readily measured properties such as catalyst work functions. We illustrate our approach for two reactions associated with the Fischer-Tropsch process, hydrogen-deuterium scrambling, and carbon monoxide dissociation over ruthenium. Consistent with experiment, electropositive promoters are predicted to accelerate hydrogen scrambling and unassisted CO dissociation. Simulations also provide a new prediction: electronegative promoters accelerate hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation over hydrogen-precovered surfaces by stabilizing the initial CO adsorption. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Efficacy of targeted liposomes and nanocochleates containing imatinib plus dexketoprofen against fibrosarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901500,Drug development research,2019 03 22,"The main challenges in treating cancer using chemotherapeutics are insufficient dose at the target site and the development of drug resistance, while higher doses can induce side effects by damaging nontarget tissues. Combinatorial drug therapy may overcome these limitations by permitting lower doses and more specific targeting, thereby mitigating drug resistance and nontarget side effects. Recent reports indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have anticancer potential and can be used together with conventional chemotherapeutics to improve efficacy and safety. In the present study, imatinib mesylate and dexketoprofen trometamol were selected as model drugs to develop targeted surface-modified liposome and nanocochleate formulations for fibrosarcoma treatment. The physicochemical properties and in vitro efficacy of various formulations were evaluated by measurement of particle size distribution, polydispersity index, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, diffusion through Caco-2 cells, and toxicity in culture. Selected formulations were then evaluated in fibrosarcoma-bearing model mice by histopathological observations and tyrosine kinase receptor inhibition assays. The most effective formulation on the fibrosarcoma model was a PEGylated nanocochleate formulation. These findings provide a foundation for developing more effective formulations and chemotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of fibrosarcoma and other types of cancer.",A meta-analysis of whole genome duplication and the effects on flowering traits in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901499,American journal of botany,2019 03 25,"Polyploidy, or whole genome duplication (WGD), is common in plants despite theory suggesting that polyploid establishment is challenging and polyploids should be evolutionarily transitory. There is renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms that could facilitate polyploid establishment and explain their pervasiveness in nature. In particular, premating isolation from their diploid progenitors is suggested to be a crucial factor. To evaluate how changes in assortative mating occur, we need to understand the phenotypic effects of WGD on reproductive traits.","CyaC, a redox-regulated adenylate cyclase of Sinorhizobium meliloti with a quinone responsive diheme-B membrane anchor domain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901498,Molecular microbiology,2019 04 10,"The nucleotide cyclase CyaC of Sinorhizobium meliloti is a member of class III adenylate cyclases (AC), a diverse group present in all forms of life. CyaC is membrane-integral by a hexahelical membrane domain (6TM) with the basic topology of mammalian ACs. The 6TM domain of CyaC contains a tetra-histidine signature that is universally present in the membrane anchors of bacterial diheme-B succinate-quinone oxidoreductases. Heterologous expression of cyaC imparted activity for cAMP formation from ATP to Escherichia coli, whereas guanylate cyclase activity was not detectable. Detergent solubilized and purified CyaC was a diheme-B protein and carried a binuclear iron-sulfur cluster. Single point mutations in the signature histidine residues caused loss of heme-B in the membrane and loss of AC activity. Heme-B of purified CyaC could be oxidized or reduced by ubiquinone analogs (Q0 or Q0 H2 ). The activity of CyaC in bacterial membranes responded to oxidation or reduction by Q0 and O2 , or NADH and Q0 H2 respectively. We conclude that CyaC-like membrane anchors of bacterial ACs can serve as the input site for chemical stimuli which are translated by the AC into an intracellular second messenger response.","Paclitaxel-coated balloon in the treatment of recurrent dysfunctional arteriovenous access, real-world experience and longitudinal follow up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901497,"Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2019 04 30,Dysfunctional arteriovenous (AV) access remains a significant cause of morbidity and hospital admission for patients with end stage renal failure on haemodialysis.

Conventional content analysis revealed patient-, caregiving task-, caregiver-, and home environment-related themes consistent with the Theory of Dependent Care. Caregivers highlighted the dynamics and contributors of PF needs for older patients in the post-acute HHC setting and depicted the enormity of caregiving tasks needed to manage older patients' PF needs. Caregivers also described their perceived roles and challenges in managing PF deficits, including a sense of isolation when they were the sole caregiver.

Both models are developed from high-resolution CT and MRI scans and the latest low-to-high strain rate mechanical data available in the literature to represent tissue component material behaviors. Both models are validated against experiments from the literature and used to complete an initial interspecies correspondence rule development study for blast overpressure effects. The results indicate the similarities in the way injury develops in the pig brain and human brain but these similarities occur at very different insult levels.

A paired t-test revealed that c-kit and Rb are significantly over-represented in AA cancer serum when compared to CA cancer serum. Interestingly, VEGFR2, a protein linked to BrCa metastasis and poor prognosis, was significantly over-represented in AA cancer serum compared to AA controls; however, this was not found in CA cancer serum compared to CA controls, suggesting a possible explanation for the higher incidence of aggressive BrCa in AA versus CA patients.

Considering that the exposure is not predictable, it is imperative that strategies to counteract radiation damage must be discovered. Recent in vitro studies performed in our laboratory demonstrated that the vitamin E analog gamma-tocotrienol (GT3) in combination with cholesterol-lowering drugs (Statins), synergistically induced endothelial thrombomodulin, an anticoagulant with radio-protective efficacy. It was hypothesized that the combination of treatment with both GT3 along with Statins would provide better radiation protection in vivo than each drug individually. CD2F1 mice were injected subcutaneously with either vehicle or single dose of GT3 (200 mg/kg body weight) 24 hours before irradiation followed by oral or subcutaneous administration of various doses of simvastatin (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg body weight) before exposure to lethal doses (11.5 and 12 Gy) of Cobalt-60 (60Co) gamma-irradiation.

It is currently being implemented within the Veterans Health Administration (VA) as a manualized, trauma-focused psychotherapy in line with recommendations from the most recent VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline for the management of PTSD. While research on CPT implementation has focused on individual factors that facilitate or hinder adoption, little is known on whether trainees retain core concepts of CPT. The present research addresses this gap in the literature by conducting a validation study of the Knowledge Assessment of CPT Critical Skills (KACCS) Scale among known user groups of CPT (no experience, immediate user, expert user) and, subsequently, an implementation study of the KACCS Scale among clinician trainees participating in an online CPT training. The validation study found that the KACCS Scale can discriminate among various CPT user groups (no experience, intermediate, expert), while the implementation study found that the KACCS Scale provides specific information on core concepts that have been learned at the end of training. The KACCS Scale could benefit from further validation studies and, subsequently, be added to the current CPT instrumentation to monitor learning and retention of core concepts at various training periods (initial workshop, consultation, booster workshop).","The Joint Pathology Center/Vision Center of Excellence Approach to Analyzing Intra-Ocular ""Foreign Bodies"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901458,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"The Military Health System recognizes the importance of analyzing ""foreign bodies"" removed from US service members through several policy documents.

As such, the Departments of Defense (DoD) and Veterans Affairs built the Practice-Based Implementation (PBI) Network as an infrastructure to facilitate more rapid translation of psychological health (PH) research into clinical practice changes to improve the quality of care for military and Veteran patients. To regularly identify research findings appropriate for enterprise implementation, the DoD PBI Network developed a model aligned with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to select and pilot PH practice change. Within this model, practice change pilots were selected following a survey of field clinicians, a public call for proposals, annual meeting of implementation science subject matter experts, and final pilot selection by PH strategic leaders. These components facilitated commitment and engagement from Military Health System PH leadership, as well as clinicians, leading to increased stakeholder buy-in and efficiency with selecting and piloting PH practice change. The DoD PBI Network model has been refined for future PH research translation pilots. It serves as a first operational model for annual implementation of PH research findings in the DoD and may be of use to other entities engaged in practice change implementation."

In an effort to provide military-specific tasks for use in the decision making regarding return-to-duty, a battery developed from the set of basic soldier skills, the Military Functional Assessment Program (MFAP), was evaluated for construct validity using clinical assessment outcomes as well as the relationships between MFAP performance and indicators of long-term performance and satisfaction. A total of 48 participants were enrolled in the study providing baseline and post-treatment clinical assessment, and MFAP performance data. Twenty participants provided follow-up data at 6-month post-MFAP. Correlational analyses suggest significant relationships between MFAP performance ratings and clinical measures of vestibular and cognitive functions and psychological well-being. These findings are consistent with those from previous research on construct validity of the MFAP tasks. Performance on one MFAP task related to perceptions of performance and overall MFAP ratings related to satisfaction reported at 6 months. These findings provide preliminary, however limited, support for these tasks being indicative of the motivation and mental state of the program participant.",Maximizing the Resilience of Healthcare Workers in Multi-hazard Events: Lessons from the 2014-2015 Ebola Response in Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901435,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"There is increasing knowledge that health care workers (HCWs) can experience a variety of emotional impacts when responding to disasters and terrorism events. The Anticipate, Plan and Deter (APD) Responder Risk and Resilience Model was developed to provide a new, evidence-informed method for understanding and managing psychological impacts among HCWs. APD includes pre-deployment development of an individualized resilience plan and an in-theater, real-time self-triage system, which together allow HCWs to assess and manage the full range of psychological risk and resilience for themselves and their families. The inclusion of objective mental health risk factors to prompt activation of a coping plan, in connection with unit leadership real-time situational awareness, enables the first known evidence-driven ""targeted action"" plan to address responder risk early before Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and impairment become established.

Although supportive ventilation is often required in patients with PBLI, maldistribution of gas flow in mechanically heterogeneous lungs may lead to further injury due to increased parenchymal strain and strain rate, which are difficult to predict in vivo. In this study, we developed a computational lung model with mechanical properties consistent with healthy and PBLI conditions. PBLI conditions were simulated with bilateral derecruitment and increased perihilar tissue stiffness. As a result of these tissue abnormalities, airway flow was heterogeneously distributed in the model under PBLI conditions, during both conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. PBLI conditions resulted in over three-fold higher parenchymal strains compared to the healthy condition during CMV, with flow distributed according to regional tissue stiffness. During high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, flow distribution became increasingly heterogeneous and frequency-dependent. We conclude that the distribution and rate of parenchymal distension during mechanical ventilation depend on PBLI severity as well as ventilatory modality. These simulations may allow realistic assessment of the risks associated with ventilator-induced lung injury following PBLI, and facilitate the development of alternative lung-protective ventilation modalities.",Characteristics of Iraqi Patients Treated During Operation Inherent Resolve by a Forward Surgical Team.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901432,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"The combat experience during the re-entry stages of Operation Inherent Resolve was distinct from other recent operations, but there is no published literature regarding these ""initial entry operations"" experiences among forward surgical teams (FSTs) deployed to Role 2 facilities A descriptive analysis of patients treated by FSTs may provide valuable information for Role 2 surgical teams preparing to deploy in support of initial entry operations.

The impetus for interest in aviation LIT-LEP is driven in part by the fact that easily accessible 0.5-2.0 W high-power laser pointers exceed safety standards for direct on-axis viewing. A repeated-measures experimental design was used to assess LIT-LEP performance relative to a no-LEP control for the following tasks: Near- and far contrast acuity, night vision goggle far-contrast acuity, emissive and non-emissive light source color-vision screening, and USCG multifunctional display color symbol discrimination reaction time and accuracy. Near- and far-contrast acuity results demonstrated good LIT-LEP performance for typical in- and out-of-cockpit lighting conditions. Night vision goggle performance suffered marginally at only one contrast level (85%; 20/30 acuity line). Color vision test results showed good color balance in that S-, M-, and L-cone performance did not demonstrate a clinical diagnostic color defect for emissive or non-emissive light sources when wearing LIT-LEP. Color symbol discrimination reaction-time-task results based on inverse efficiency scores revealed that some non-primary flight display colors exhibited a combination of slower speed and decreased accuracy. The findings will contribute to an acquisition decision as well as guide future LEP designs."

The present study evaluates the effect of a reduction in particle size assessed by homogenization, sonication, and homogenization plus sonication on the bioavailability of imidazolidinedione (IZ), an antimalarial compound with known causal prophylactic activity and radical cure of relapsing malaria. Formulations were administrated intragastrically to mice, and blood samples were collected for LC-MS/MS analysis. The homogenization method manually decreased particle size with minimal variance, resulting in a mean particle diameter of 42.22 μm, whereas the probe sonication method evenly distributed pulses of sound to break apart particles, resulting in a mean diameter of 1.50 μm. Homogenization plus sonication resulted in a mean particle diameter of 1.44 μm, which was similar to that of the sonication method alone. The compound suspensions did not show a significant difference in mean particle size between the different vehicles. The sonically engineered microparticle delivers high sonic energy to the suspension leads to faster breakdown and stabilizing of the micronized particles when compared with homogenizer. The bioavailability of the small particle IZ formulation was 100%, compared to the 55.79% relative bioavailability of IZ with larger particle size. These initial data clearly show that a reduction in particle size of orally administered IZ with probe sonication could significantly increase bioavailability in rodent animals that is affected by a high first-pass effect.",A Mobile Device Dual-Task Paradigm for the Assessment of mTBI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901418,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"Dual-task performance, in which individuals complete two or more activities simultaneously, is impaired following mild traumatic brain injury.

DCGS operations are global, synergistic, Total Force (TF) endeavors by active duty, Air National Guard (ANG) and Reserve units, providing combatant commanders with critical real-time intelligence and shaping operational and tactical decisions. Continual surveillance of this community's psychological health is important to its military leaders. This study re-examines the most frequently reported occupational stressors, as well as the prevalence of occupational burnout (i.e., high-emotional exhaustion and cynicism, and low professional efficacy), and psychological distress within this population. Active duty (n = 1717), ANG (n = 139), and Reserve (n = 173) Intel operators participated in a comprehensive, online, occupational health assessment. Results reveal that occupational stressors contributing to elevated rates of distress, regardless of TF status (i.e., low manning, long work hours, excessive workload, and organizational communication concerns) are consistent with previous research. The prevalence of high-emotional exhaustion (AD: 29%/ANG: 25%/RES: 14%) and psychological distress (AD: 19%/ANG: 17%/RES: 5%) are above estimates for other military communities. These findings combined with demographic and occupational risk factors lay the foundation for improving psychological health within this Total Force community.","Evaluation of the Commercial, Off-the-Shelf (COTS) King-Devick Eye Tracking System.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901416,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"Concussion biomarkers are important guides for diagnosis and return-to-duty decisions. Recent literature describes the King-Devick (KD) test as a sensitive sports-related concussion screener. This test involves timing an individual reading aloud 120 digits printed on three test cards. The test is commonly considered to evaluate the effects of concussion and other factors on reading-related eye movements (EMs). However, the extent to which the KD test reflects EMs remains a matter of conjecture since the test reports only reading speed and number of errors. An off-the-shelf, computerized KD with eye tracking system recently became commercially available. Two early model KD with eye tracking systems were purchased in 2015 and evaluated before deploying them for research. The evaluation consisted of two studies; one with 20 volunteers assessing the comparability of the two systems and the other with 5 volunteers to quantify the systems' stability and repeatability over 5 successive days. The results showed that several of the systems' reported EM response parameters lacked face validity; consequently, the systems could not be used for scientific research. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of systematic test and evaluation of new equipment before it is used for research.",Perceptions and Response to Conservative Treatment of Low Back Pain in Soldiers During Initial Entry Training: A Convergence Mixed Methods Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901415,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"Low back pain (LBP) is a common condition suffered by military personnel. Psychosocial factors play a role in LBP prognosis and can be addressed with self-management tools. This study's purpose was to (1) describe clinical changes in psychosocial factors of LBP following a self-management intervention and (2) explore the LBP experience of military trainees. Ten participants in Initial Entry Training (IET) were included in this mixed methods study. A self-management intervention of exercises and psychosocial education was provided. Quantitative instruments assessing psychosocial factors were delivered at baseline and 6 weeks. Qualitative data were gathered after treatment and analyzed using a phenomenological approach. Low levels of psychosocial risk factors were reported. Patient satisfaction (COPM-Satisfaction subscale) was the only outcome that achieved statistical significance at 6 weeks (p = 0.037). Three themes emerged from the qualitative results: the influence of the military culture on recovery from LBP, the LBP experience of a trainee, and promoting the self-management of LBP. While this cohort of IET soldiers exhibited low levels of psychosocial risk factors, qualitative reports indicate that LBP has a negative impact on participation in training, academics, and interpersonal relationships.

The reasons for these persistent symptoms in a percentage of even mild TBI are poorly understood. The existence of comorbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder or other traumatic injuries may be factors that impact the presence of PCS. We expect that greater levels of affective symptoms will be associated with increases in PCS assessed on the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). TBI subjects (N = 69) who were seen 1 year post-injury were recruited from a larger cohort study of TBI. Subjects were administered the NSI, Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL). Data were analyzed using Spearman's rho correlations and analysis of variances. We found significant correlations between the four NSI factors and the three BSI factors and the PCL total score. Mild TBI subjects were found to have the highest correlations between affective and somatic symptoms. These findings support our hypothesis that affective states are associated with higher PCS reporting and that early identification and treatment may decrease PCS.",Utilizing Plasma Composition Data to Help Determine Procoagulant Dynamics in Patients with Thermal Injury: A Computational Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901410,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"The development of methods that generate individualized assessments of the procoagulant potential of burn patients could improve their treatment.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea cases among active duty personnel were identified from laboratory results and ambulatory encounter records in the Military Health System from fiscal years October 2006 through September 2015; these were linked to personnel and deployment records to ascertain demographic characteristics, unit of country assignment, and if the case was captured during a period of deployment. Case rates were higher for chlamydia (1,321.7 per 100,000) than gonorrhea (222.7 per 100,000). Approximately 2% of both chlamydia and gonorrhea cases were identified during deployment, with significant differences by service, sex, and age. Elevated rates were identified in several countries of unit assignment outside the USA, warranting further assessment to better understand implications of screening programs or increased morbidity.

The purpose of this effort was to conduct an archival data review of injuries and events leading to injury during recruit training. An archival dataset of Marine recruits from 2011 to 2016 was reviewed and included 43,004 observations from 28,829 unique individuals. Injuries were classified as mild, moderate, and severe and categorized into new overuse, preexisting overuse, and traumatic. Injury classification and categorization were stratified by event in which the injury occurred. The majority of injuries were due to overuse, and the most common types were sprains, strains, iliotibial band syndrome, and stress fractures, which constituted over 40% of all injuries. Conditioning hikes were the primary event leading to injury, with 31% of all injuries occurring during this training; running claimed 12%. Most injuries sustained during basic training comprised sprains and strains. Marines who remained uninjured during basic training outperformed those who reported at least one injury on fitness tests.

The objective of this report is to summarize the findings of case series of a non-opioid therapy-percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) - and describe its potential for postoperative analgesia, early opioid cessation, and improved function following orthopedic trauma. Percutaneous PNS has been evaluated for the treatment of multiple types of pain, including two case series on postoperative pain following total knee replacement (n = 10 and 8, respectively) and a case series on postamputation pain (n = 9). The orthopedic trauma induced during TKR is highly representative of multiple types of orthopedic trauma sustained by Service members and frequently produces intense, prolonged postoperative pain and extended opioid use following surgery. Collectively, the results of these three clinical studies demonstrated that percutaneous PNS can provide substantial pain relief, reduce opioid use, and improve function. These outcomes suggest that there is substantial potential for the use of percutaneous PNS following orthopedic trauma.",Augmented Reality as a Medium for Improved Telementoring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901394,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"Combat trauma injuries require urgent and specialized care. When patient evacuation is infeasible, critical life-saving care must be given at the point of injury in real-time and under austere conditions associated to forward operating bases. Surgical telementoring allows local generalists to receive remote instruction from specialists thousands of miles away. However, current telementoring systems have limited annotation capabilities and lack of direct visualization of the future result of the surgical actions by the specialist. The System for Telementoring with Augmented Reality (STAR) is a surgical telementoring platform that improves the transfer of medical expertise by integrating a full-size interaction table for mentors to create graphical annotations, with augmented reality (AR) devices to display surgical annotations directly onto the generalist's field of view. Along with the explanation of the system's features, this paper provides results of user studies that validate STAR as a comprehensive AR surgical telementoring platform. In addition, potential future applications of STAR are discussed, which are desired features that state-of-the-art AR medical telementoring platforms should have when combat trauma scenarios are in the spotlight of such technologies.",An Association Between Herpes Zoster Vaccination and Stroke Reduction Among Elderly Individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901393,Military medicine,2019 04 23,"Herpes zoster (HZ, shingles) affects individuals (60+ years) by reactivation of varicella virus from primary infection. Approximately one-third of the general population will develop HZ and are at increased risk of stroke. Our objective was describing possible associations between self-reported HZ vaccination and stroke with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System, a cross-sectional nationwide telephone survey. Non-institutionalized U.S. adults answered items concerning health risk behaviors. 2014 survey data were from 265,568 adults 50-79 years old. Multivariable Cox regressions adjusted for standard demographics, body mass index, and coronary heart disease showed that HZ-vaccinated individuals had lower risk of reporting stroke those not vaccinated (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.73). After stratification of participants into six 5-year age groups, adjusted weighted binary logistic regressions were conducted for each age group with stroke as outcome. The HZ-vaccinated group aged 65-69 years reported stroke approximately 50% less than those unvaccinated (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.51; 99% confidence interval [CI]:1.21,1.88). Secondary analyses indicated that this benefit was among HZ-vaccinated whites (aOR = 1.6, 95%CI:1.4,2.0), but not African Americans or Hispanics. These possible protective effects are not detected 10 years after recommended vaccine uptake.

In austere environments, typical methods of counting drops from gravity drips or infusion pumps both have limitations such as accuracy, weight, and need for power. The DripAssist device calculates drip rates by counting drops in IV tubing drip chambers and may provide a useful patient safety monitor adjunct. The protocol was IRB approved, prospective, and designed as a pilot study involving 28 Madigan Army Medical Center Emergency Department personnel. After a brief didactic introduction to the device for clinical staff with no prior experience using the device, participants were timed setting three normal saline infusions at rates of 250 mL/h, 125 mL/h and 83 mL/h with 15gtt/mL tubing. Participants filled out a survey on perceived ease of use and utility of the device compared to pumps and manual counting. Most participants felt the DripAssist device was easy to understand and set up, but nurses and physician assistants were more likely than medics to perceive a benefit versus IV pumps or gravity drips. The DripAssist device may offer a safe, low-weight, functional tool which could improve care in a variety of resource-limited environments.

Aggregation of the pre-synaptic protein α-synuclein (aSN) into oligomers (αSOs) is believed to play a key role in PD pathology, but little is known about αSO formation in vivo and how they induce neurodegeneration. Both the naturally occurring polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), strongly upregulated during ROS conditions, stimulate the formation of αSOs, highlighting a potential role in PD. Yet, insight into αSOs structure and biological effects is still limited as most oligomer preparations studied to date are heterogeneous in composition. Here we have aggregated aSN in the presence of HNE and DHA and purified the αSOs using size exclusion chromatography. Both compounds stimulate formation of spherical αSOs containing anti-parallel β-sheet structure which have the same shape as unmodified αSOs though ca. 2-fold larger. Furthermore, the yield and stabilities of these oligomers are significantly higher than for unmodified aSN. Both modified and unmodified αSOs permeabilize synthetic vesicles, show high co-localisation with glutamatergic synapses and decrease Long Term Potentiation (LTP), in line with the reported synaptotoxic effects of αSOs. We conclude that DHA- and HNE-αSOs are convenient models for pathogenic disease-associated αSOs in PD.",Trends in polypharmacy and dispensed drugs among adults in the Netherlands as compared to the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901377,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Polypharmacy is becoming increasingly common owing to the ageing population, which can pose problems for patients and society.

This paper attempts to reconcile these findings by arguing that the belief and social behavior dimensions of religiosity affect support for redistribution via different mechanisms, and that these effects are moderated by state welfare generosity. Using multilevel path analysis models on data from the World Values Survey, we show that the effect of the religious belief on attitudes towards redistribution is mediated by competing personal orientations-prosocial values and conservative identification-while the religious social behavior dimension significantly decreases support for redistribution via increased levels of happiness. Lower levels of welfare generosity increase the positive effect of prosocial orientations and weaken the negative effect conservative identification, leading to positive or null indirect effect of religiosity. These findings show the importance of taking into account the multiple dimensions of religiosity and institutional context when studying the relationship between religion and redistribution attitudes.",Inflammatory status and severity of disease in dengue patients are associated with lipoprotein alterations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901375,PloS one,2019 04 02,"The triggering of severe dengue has been associated with an exacerbated inflammatory process characterized by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β/IL-18, which are the product of inflammasome activation.

While HDL would be expected to counteract hyperactivation of the inflammasome, the relationship between HDL and dengue severity, has not previously been explored.","Legacy habitat contamination as a limiting factor for Chinook salmon recovery in the Willamette Basin, Oregon, USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901374,PloS one,2019 04 02,"In the western United States, the long-term recovery of many Pacific salmon populations is inextricably linked to freshwater habitat quality. Industrial activities from the past century have left a legacy of pollutants that persist, particularly near working waterfronts. The adverse impacts of these contaminants on salmon health have been studied for decades, but the population-scale consequences of chemical exposure for salmonids are still poorly understood. We estimated acute and delayed mortality rates for seaward migrating juvenile Chinook salmon that feed and grow in a Superfund-designated area in the Lower Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. We combined previous, field-collected exposure data for juvenile Chinook salmon together with reduced growth and disease resistance data from earlier field and laboratory studies. Estimates of mortality were then incorporated into a life cycle model to explore chemical habitat-related fish loss. We found that 54% improved juvenile survival-potentially as a result of future remediation activities-could increase adult Chinook salmon population abundance by more than 20%. This study provides a framework for evaluating pollution remediation as a positive driver for species recovery.",Quality of life and burnout among faculty members: How much does the field of knowledge matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901373,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Faculty members face demands such as research, outreach programs, and management activities.

As the first cryptocurrency created, the behavior of this new asset is characterized by great volatility. The lack of a proper definition or classification under existing theory exacerbates this property in such a way that explosive periods followed by a rapid decline have been observed along the series, meaning bubble episodes. By detecting the periods in which a bubble rises and collapses, it is possible to study the statistical properties of such segments. In particular, adjusting a theoretical distribution may help to determine better strategies to hedge against these episodes. The NIG is an appropriate candidate not only because of its heavy-tailed property but also because it has been proven to be closed under convolution, a characteristic that can be implemented to measure multivariate value at risk. Using data on the price of BTC with respect to seven of the main global currencies, the NIG was able to fit every time segment despite the bubble behavior. In the out-of-sample tests, the NIG was proven to have an adjustment similar to that of a generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution. This result could serve as a starting point for future studies regarding the statistical properties of cryptocurrencies as well as their multivariate distributions.",Derivation of a clinical decision-making aid to improve the insertion of clinically indicated peripheral intravenous catheters and promote vessel health preservation.

However, they were not widespread in China until the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Limited in research methods, previous studies failed to make convincing arguments on this phenomenon. We collected, organized and analyzed relevant historical documents to reconstruct the spatio-temporal process of the construction of masonry walls from 1st to 17th century in China. We conducted a time series analysis primarily based on factors such as wars, garrisons, economy, and natural disasters. Analysis of the correlation among the construction of masonry walls and these factors provides insights into this process. From the 1st to 14th century, only 125 masonry city walls were built in China and the annual average number was below 0.1. While in the Ming Dynasty, a total of 1,493 masonry walls were built, with an annual average of 5.41. The construction activities in 1368-1456 spread throughout the country, but mainly appeared in the high-grade administrative cities and garrisons, as a result of the planned implementation of the central government. The construction activities in 1457-1644 had corresponding cluster areas during different periods, mainly at county-level. We found that the wall construction was stimulated by external factors such as wars and disasters. We believe that the mass construction of masonry walls in the Ming Dynasty is a phenomenon of cultural diffusion. The central government plan, the complex interactions between local governments and community, and the stimulation of external factors worked together to contribute to the diffusion of masonry city walls in the Ming Dynasty."

However, biotic factors are rarely factored into agricultural management models. Today it is possible to identify specific microbiomes and define biotic components that contribute to soil quality. We assessed the bacterial diversity of soils in 51 potato production plots. We describe a strategy for identifying a potato-crop-productivity bacterial species balance index based on amplicon sequence variants. We observed a significant impact of soil texture balances on potato yields; however, the Shannon and Chao1 richness indices and Pielou's evenness index poorly correlated with these yields. Nonetheless, we were able to estimate the portion of the total bacterial microbiome related to potato yield using an integrated species balances index derived from the elements of the bacterial microbiome that positively or negatively correlate with residual potato yields. This innovative strategy based on a microbiome selection procedure greatly enhances our ability to interpret the impact of agricultural practices and cropping system management choices on microbial diversity and potato yield. This strategy provides an additional tool that will aid growers and the broader agricultural sector in their decision-making processes concerning the soil quality and crop productivity.",Prognostic impact of persistent lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio during preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer patients: A propensity score matching analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901357,PloS one,2019 04 02,This study investigated the significance of change in neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) during preoperative chemoradiotherapy (preop-CRT) in patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer using a propensity score matching method (PSM).,Effect of vacuum-release teat versus standard teat use on feeding milestones and breastfeeding outcomes in very preterm infants: A randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901356,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Breast milk is important to infant health, yet shorter breastfeeding duration is reported for preterm infants. Both breast and bottle feeds are given in the neonatal unit, with full oral feeding often the last milestone to be achieved prior to discharge home.

Recruitment success is therefore indispensable for coral reef recovery after disturbances. Recruitment processes are governed by a variety of factors occurring at all spatial and temporal scales, from centimetres to hundreds of kilometres. In the present context of rising disturbances, it is thus of major importance to better understand the relative importance of different scales in this variation, and when possible, the factors associated with these scales. Multiscale spatio-temporal variability of scleractinian coral recruitment was investigated at two of the Mascarene Islands: Reunion and Rodrigues. Recruitment rates and taxonomic composition were examined during three consecutive six-month periods from regional to micro-local scales (i.e. from hundreds of kilometres to few centimetres) and between two protection levels (no-take zones and general protection zones). Very low recruitment rates were observed. Rodrigues displayed lower recruitment rates than Reunion. Recruit assemblage was dominated by Pocilloporidae (77.9%), followed by Acroporidae (9.9%) and Poritidae (5.2%). No protection effect was identified on coral recruitment, despite differences in recruitment rates among sites within islands. Recruits were patchily distributed within sites but no aggregative effect was detected, i.e. the preferentially colonised tiles were not spatially grouped. Recruits settled mainly on the sides of the tiles, especially at Rodrigues, which could be attributed to the high concentration of suspended matter. The variability of recruitment patterns at various spatial scales emphasises the importance of micro- to macro-local variations of the environment in the dynamics and maintenance of coral populations. High temporal variability was also detected, between seasons and years, which may be related to the early 2016 bleaching event at Rodrigues. The low recruitment rates and the absence of protection effect raise questions about the potential for recovery from disturbances of coral reefs in the Mascarene Islands.",A mark-recapture approach for estimating population size of the endangered ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901354,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Reliable population estimates are fundamental to the conservation of endangered species. We evaluate here the use of photo-identification (photo-ID) and mark-recapture techniques for estimating the population size of the endangered Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis). Photo-ID data based on the unique pelage patterns of individuals were collected by means of camera traps and boat-based surveys during the molting season in two of the species' main breeding areas, over a period of five years in the Pihlajavesi basin and eight years in the Haukivesi basin. An open model approach provided minimum population estimates for these two basins. The results indicated high survival rates and site fidelity among the adult seals. More accurate estimates can be obtained in the future by increasing the surveying effort both spatially and temporally. The method presented here proved effective for evaluating population size objectively, whereas the results of the current snow lair censuses are dependent on varying winter conditions, for instance. We therefore suggest that a photo-ID-based non-invasive mark-recapture method should be used for estimating Saimaa ringed seal abundances in order to ensure reliable, transparent population monitoring under changing climatic conditions.",Cost-effectiveness of an integrated 'fast track' rehabilitation service for multi-trauma patients: A non-randomized clinical trial in the Netherlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901353,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been recommended for multi-trauma patients, but there is only low-quality evidence to support its use with these patients.

Here we show that the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA (histone cell cycle regulator) associates with promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) to stimulate the induction of innate immune defences against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Following the activation of innate immune signalling, HIRA localized at PML-NBs in a Janus-Associated Kinase (JAK), Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK), and Sp100-dependent manner. RNA-seq analysis revealed that HIRA promoted the transcriptional upregulation of a broad repertoire of host genes that regulate innate immunity to HSV-1 infection, including those involved in MHC-I antigen presentation, cytokine signalling, and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that PML, the principle scaffolding protein of PML-NBs, was required for the enrichment of HIRA onto ISGs, identifying a role for PML in the HIRA-dependent regulation of innate immunity to virus infection. Our data identifies independent roles for HIRA in the intrinsic silencing of viral gene expression and the induction of innate immune defences to restrict the initiation and propagation of HSV-1 infection, respectively. These intracellular host defences are antagonized by the HSV-1 ubiquitin ligase ICP0, which disrupts the stable recruitment of HIRA to infecting viral genomes and PML-NBs at spatiotemporally distinct phases of infection. Our study highlights the importance of histone chaperones to regulate multiple phases of intracellular immunity to virus infection, findings that are likely to be highly pertinent in the cellular restriction of many clinically important viral pathogens.",Zooplankters' nightmare: The fast and efficient catching basket of larval phantom midges (Diptera: Chaoborus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901351,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Filter feeding zooplankton are a crucial component of limnic food webs. Copepods and cladocerans are important prey organisms for first-level predators like the common and abundant larvae of phantom midges (Chaoborus sp.). The latter possess a complex catching basket built of head appendages specialized to capture small crustaceans. The predator-prey-relationship of Chaoborus (Diptera, Nematocera) and Daphnia (Crustacea, Cladocera) has been studied in particular detail owing to the daphniids' ability to react upon the threat of predation with inducible defenses. Daphnia pulex expresses so-called 'neckteeth' in the presence of Chaoborus larvae that are discussed as a defensive trait that interferes with the larval head appendages and their effectiveness has been shown in several studies. Nonetheless, mode of function of these neckteeth is not understood and the hypothesis that they interfere with the predator's head appendages still has to be confirmed. To clarify the role of neckteeth in Daphnia, an understanding of the Chaoborus capture apparatus is essential. Here, we present a detailed three-dimensional analysis of Chaoborus obscuripes' larval head morphology as well as a kinematic analysis of the attack motion, which revealed an impressive strike velocity (14 ms to prey contact). The movement of the larvae's head appendages is reconstructed in the three-dimensional space using a combination of high-speed videography, micro-computed tomography and computer animation. Furthermore, we provide predation trial data to distinguish between pre- and post-attack defensive effects in D. pulex. Our findings suggest a combination of pre- and post-attack defenses with an average effectiveness of 50% each. With this study, we quantitatively describe prey capture kinematics of C. obscuripes and take a further step to reveal the neckteeth' mode of function in D. pulex.",Changes in ankle joint alignment after proximal fibular osteotomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901350,PloS one,2019 04 02,"The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO) on ankle joint. 49 patients or 53 lower limbs were included and followed-up with a minimum of one year in the study prospectively.

The questionnaires of the American Knee Society Score (KSS), the Ankle-Hindfoot Scale of the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), Visual Analogue Scale/Score (VAS) were used to assess the patients clinically. Radiographic evaluations were measured by the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), the femoro-tibial angle (FTA), tibial inclination (TI), distal tibial articural surface (TAS), talar tilt (TT), length of fibular (FL), and hind foot alignment such as hindfoot alignment view angle (HAVA), hindfoot alignment ratio (HAR), and hindfoot moment arm (HMA). Of the 53 subjects, no significant differences were exhibited in AOFAS, VAS scores and FL in ankle joint, but a significant differences were demonstrated in KSS score, HKA, FTA, TI, TT, HAVA, HAR and HMA after PFO. Due to the structural improvements of ankle joint, PFO not only improves joint function but also the alignment of ankle joint radiographically, and is still recommended as a safe surgery in treating medial compartment osteoarthritis of knee.",Type I ROP16 regulates retinal inflammatory responses during ocular toxoplasmosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901349,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), mostly retinochorioditis, is a major feature of infection with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The pathophysiology of this infection is still largely elusive; especially mouse models are not yet well developed. In contrast, numerous in vitro studies showed the highly Toxoplasma strain dependent nature of the host-parasite interactions. Some distinct polymorphic virulence factors were characterized, notably the rhoptry protein ROP16. Here, we studied the strain-dependent pathophysiology in our OT mouse model. Besides of two wild type strains of the canonical I (RH, virulent) and II (PRU, avirulent) types, we used genetically engineered parasites, RHΔROP16 and PRU ROP16-I, expressing the type I allele of this virulence factor. We analyzed retinal integrity, parasite proliferation and retinal expression of cytokines. PRU parasites behaved much more virulently in the presence of a type I ROP16. In contrast, knockout of ROP16 in the RH strain led to a decrease of intraocular proliferation, but no difference in retinal pathology. Cytokine quantification in aqueous humor showed strong production of Th1 and inflammatory markers following infection with the two strains containing the ROP16-I allele. In strong contrast, immunofluorescence images showed that actual expression of most cytokines in retinal cells is rapidly suppressed by type I strain infection, with or without the involvement of its homologous ROP16 allele. This demonstrates the particular immune privileged situation of the retina, which is also revealed by the fact that parasite proliferation is nearly exclusively observed outside the retina. In summary, we further developed a promising OT mouse model and demonstrated the specific pathology in retinal tissues."

Their virulence is largely determined by chemical communication driven by quorum sensing systems (QS), and the cross perception of their quorum sensing molecules (QSM) can modulate the prevalence of one microorganism over the other. Aiming to investigate whether some of the protein components dissolved in the mucus layering the respiratory mucosa might interfere with virulence and cross-communication of these, and eventually other microorganisms, ligand binding assays were carried out to test the scavenging potential of the bovine and porcine forms of the Lipocalin odorant binding protein (OBP) for several QSMs (farnesol, and acylhomoserine lactones), and for pyocyanin, a toxin produced by PA. In addition, the direct antimicrobial activity of the OBPs was tested by time kill assay (TKA) against CA, PA and other bacteria and yeasts. The positivity of all the ligand binding assays and the antimicrobial activity determined for CA, and for some of the other microorganisms tested, let hypothesize that vertebrate OBPs might behave as humoral components of innate immunity, active against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. In addition, TKAs with mutants of bovine OBP with structural properties different from those of the native form, and with OBP forms tagged with histidines at the amino terminal, provided information about the mechanisms responsible of their antimicrobial activity and suggested possible applications of the OBPs as alternative or co-adjuvants to antibiotic therapeutic treatments.",Rapid interpretation of small-angle X-ray scattering data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901335,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 03,"The fundamental aim of structural analyses in biophysics is to reveal a mutual relation between a molecule's dynamic structure and its physiological function. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an experimental technique for structural characterization of macromolecules in solution and enables time-resolved analysis of conformational changes under physiological conditions. As such experiments measure spatially averaged low-resolution scattering intensities only, the sparse information obtained is not sufficient to uniquely reconstruct a three-dimensional atomistic model. Here, we integrate the information from SAXS into molecular dynamics simulations using computationally efficient native structure-based models. Dynamically fitting an initial structure towards a scattering intensity, such simulations produce atomistic models in agreement with the target data. In this way, SAXS data can be rapidly interpreted while retaining physico-chemical knowledge and sampling power of the underlying force field. We demonstrate our method's performance using the example of three protein systems. Simulations are faster than full molecular dynamics approaches by more than two orders of magnitude and consistently achieve comparable accuracy. Computational demands are reduced sufficiently to run the simulations on commodity desktop computers instead of high-performance computing systems. These results underline that scattering-guided structure-based simulations provide a suitable framework for rapid early-stage refinement of structures towards SAXS data with particular focus on minimal computational resources and time.",'It was nothing that you would think was anything': Qualitative analysis of appraisal and help seeking preceding brain cancer diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901334,PloS one,2019 04 02,"The patient's interpretation of the events and decisions leading up to consultation with a healthcare professional for symptoms of brain cancer is under researched.

Nest-based monitoring is a common, useful approach, but the difficulty and expense of monitoring raptor nests and importance of reliable trend data to conservation requires that limited resources are allocated efficiently. Power analyses offer a helpful tool to ensure that monitoring programs have the ability to detect trends and to optimize financial resources devoted to monitoring. We evaluated alternative monitoring designs for raptors to identify appropriate survey effort to detect population trends. We used data collected from a territory-occupancy study of ferruginous hawks throughout Wyoming to guide simulations and evaluate the ability to detect trends in occupancy rates. Results suggest that greater gains in precision of trend estimation may be achieved through the addition of more sites and not more visits; statistical power was ≥80% when monitoring lasted 20 years and population declines were 20%; and probability of detection affected statistical power less than rates of population decline. Monitoring at least 150 sites for 20 years would provide reasonable estimates of trend in occupancy given certain rates of detection and occupancy, but only for population declines of 20%. Removal sampling did not result in substantial changes of any metrics used to evaluate simulations, providing little justification for employing the standard design if territory occupancy is the variable of interest. Initial rates of territory occupancy may be biased high, a problem inherent to many studies that monitor territory occupancy. We explored the effects of lower rates of initial occupancy on the ability to detect trends. Although we present data from a study of ferruginous hawks, our simulations can be applied to other raptor species with similar life history and population dynamics to provide guidance for future trend estimation of territory occupancy.",Functional interaction of human Ssu72 with RNA polymerase II complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901332,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of human RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is regulated during the transcription cycle by the combined action of specific kinases and phosphatases. Pol II enters into the preinitiation complex (PIC) unphosphorylated, but is quickly phosphorylated by Cdk7 during initiation. How phosphatases alter the pattern and extent of CTD phosphorylation at this early stage of transcription is not clear. We previously demonstrated the functional association of an early-acting, magnesium-independent phosphatase with early elongation complexes. Here we show that Ssu72 is responsible for that activity. We found that the phosphatase enters the transcription cycle during the formation of PICs and that Ssu72 is physically associated with very early elongation complexes. The association of Ssu72 with elongation complexes was stable to extensive washing with up to 200 mM KCl. Interestingly, Ssu72 ceased to function on complexes that contained RNA longer than 28 nt. However, when PICs were washed before initiation, the strict cutoff at 28 nt was lost. This suggests that factor(s) are important for the specific regulation of Ssu72 function during the transition between initiation and pausing. Overall, our results demonstrate when Ssu72 can act on early transcription complexes and suggest that Ssu72 may also function in the PIC prior to initiation.",Keeping phase III tuberculosis trials relevant: Adapting to a rapidly changing landscape.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901331,PLoS medicine,2019 04 02,"In a Collection Review, Patrick Phillips and colleagues discuss developments in clinical trial design for the evaluation of TB therapeutics.",Landscape correlates of space use in the critically endangered African wild dog Lycaon pictus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901330,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Human-carnivore conflict can threaten human life and livelihoods, leading to retaliation that negatively affects carnivore conservation. The endangered African wild dog Lycaon pictus is prone to human-carnivore conflict. Therefore, it is imperative to understand which landscape features are associated with African wild dog occurrence since selection or avoidance of these features could predict the levels of conflict. We investigated resource selection in the African wild dog in relation to four anthropogenic landscape features (livestock density, agriculture, roads and human land use) within the landscape that may pose a mortality risk, as well as one natural feature (nature reserves). We compared spatio-temporal space use patterns of four African wild dog packs in north-eastern South Africa. Data were collected from one collared individual per pack. These packs constituted approximately 10% of the total remaining African wild dog population in South Africa. Two packs occurred outside of the Kruger National Park and had access to multiple areas with farmland and other anthropogenic features, whereas the remaining two packs mainly occurred within the boundaries of the Kruger National Park but made occasional forays outside of park boundaries. Utilising Resource Selection Functions and GIS analyses, we found that agricultural landscape features, roads and nature reserves were important predictors of African wild dog occurrence for all four packs. In addition to potential conflict with farmers, high odds of occurrence on roads with fast-moving traffic and road mortality was highlighted as a concern for three of the packs. While farms and areas that house livestock were readily available, pack presence occurred in areas with few farms and low livestock densities, pointing to avoidance of areas where human-carnivore conflict and resulting mortality could occur. Our study highlights potential threats to the persistence of the African wild dog, which can be used to inform future conservation efforts of the species.",Guideline for improving the reliability of Google Ngram studies: Evidence from religious terms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901329,PloS one,2019 04 02,"The Google Books Ngram Viewer (Google Ngram) is a search engine that charts word frequencies from a large corpus of books and thereby allows for the examination of cultural change as it is reflected in books. While the tool's massive corpus of data (about 8 million books or 6% of all books ever published) has been used in various scientific studies, concerns about the accuracy of results have simultaneously emerged. This paper reviews the literature and serves as a guideline for improving Google Ngram studies by suggesting five methodological procedures suited to increase the reliability of results. In particular, we recommend the use of (I) different language corpora, (II) cross-checks on different corpora from the same language, (III) word inflections, (IV) synonyms, and (V) a standardization procedure that accounts for both the influx of data and unequal weights of word frequencies. Further, we outline how to combine these procedures and address the risk of potential biases arising from censorship and propaganda. As an example of the proposed procedures, we examine the cross-cultural expression of religion via religious terms for the years 1900 to 2000. Special emphasis is placed on the situation during World War II. In line with the strand of literature that emphasizes the decline of collectivistic values, our results suggest an overall decrease of religion's importance. However, religion re-gains importance during times of crisis such as World War II. By comparing the results obtained through the different methods, we illustrate that applying and particularly combining our suggested procedures increase the reliability of results and prevents authors from deriving wrong assumptions.",An open-source software analysis package for Microspheres with Ratiometric Barcode Lanthanide Encoding (MRBLEs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901328,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Multiplexed bioassays, in which multiple analytes of interest are probed in parallel within a single small volume, have greatly accelerated the pace of biological discovery. Bead-based multiplexed bioassays have many technical advantages, including near solution-phase kinetics, small sample volume requirements, many within-assay replicates to reduce measurement error, and, for some bead materials, the ability to synthesize analytes directly on beads via solid-phase synthesis. To allow bead-based multiplexing, analytes can be synthesized on spectrally encoded beads with a 1:1 linkage between analyte identity and embedded codes. Bead-bound analyte libraries can then be pooled and incubated with a fluorescently-labeled macromolecule of interest, allowing downstream quantification of interactions between the macromolecule and all analytes simultaneously via imaging alone. Extracting quantitative binding data from these images poses several computational image processing challenges, requiring the ability to identify all beads in each image, quantify bound fluorescent material associated with each bead, and determine their embedded spectral code to reveal analyte identities. Here, we present a novel open-source Python software package (the mrbles analysis package) that provides the necessary tools to: (1) find encoded beads in a bright-field microscopy image; (2) quantify bound fluorescent material associated with bead perimeters; (3) identify embedded ratiometric spectral codes within beads; and (4) return data aggregated by embedded code and for each individual bead. We demonstrate the utility of this package by applying it towards analyzing data generated via multiplexed measurement of calcineurin protein binding to MRBLEs (Microspheres with Ratiometric Barcode Lanthanide Encoding) containing known and mutant binding peptide motifs. We anticipate that this flexible package should be applicable to a wide variety of assays, including simple bead or droplet finding analysis, quantification of binding to non-encoded beads, and analysis of multiplexed assays that use ratiometric, spectrally encoded beads."

This study was undertaken to assess the 2-year treatment outcomes in HIV-positive patients initiated on ART in a tertiary-care hospital. Methods After approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee, adult HIV-positive patients from a tertiary-care hospital, initiated on ART between January 2013 and February 2015, were included in the study. Data on clinical and immunological parameters were obtained from medical case records over a period of 2 years after initiation of therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis was done using a descriptive approach, using SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc. Released 2006. SPSS for Windows, Version 15.0. Chicago, SPSS Inc.). A logistic regression analysis was done to assess the predictors for poor outcomes. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results ART was initiated in 299 adult patients. At 1 and 2 years, the median (interquartile range) change in CD4+ cell count was 65 (39, 98) cells/mm3 and 160 (95, 245) cells/mm3. The change observed after 2 years of treatment initiation was statistically significant compared with that after 1 year. Three deaths occurred during the study period and 28 were lost to follow-up. Male sex, presence of at least one opportunistic infection at the start of therapy, and baseline CD4+ count <50 cells/mm3 were associated with poor immunological recovery.

Scientific evidence reports that some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes involved in the immune response and in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of immunosuppressive drugs are associated with rejection in renal transplant patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate some SNPs located in six genes: interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1), uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A9 (UGT1A9), inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1) and IMPDH2. Methods We enrolled cases with at least one AR after KT and two groups of controls: patients without any AR after KT and healthy blood donors. Genetic analysis on DNA was performed. The heterozygosity (HET) was determined and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test was performed for each SNP. The sample size was calculated using the QUANTO program and the genetic associations were calculated using the SAS program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Results In our previous preliminary study (sample size was not reached for cases), the results showed that patients with the C allele in the SNP rs1045642 and the A allele in the SNP rs2032582 of the ABCB1 gene had more frequent AR. In contrast, with the achievement of sample size, the trend of the previous data was not confirmed. Conclusions Our study highlights a fundamental aspect of scientific research that is generally presumed, i.e. the sample size of groups enrolled for a scientific study. We believe that our study will make a significant contribution to the scientific community in the discussion of the importance of the analysis and the achievement of sample size to evaluate the associations between SNPs and the studied event.",Development and evaluation of a clinical reasoning curriculum as part of an Internal Medicine Residency Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901312,"Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)",2019 05 29,"Background Errors in medicine are common and often tied to diagnosis.

The authors developed and delivered a clinical reasoning curriculum to 47 PGY2 residents in an Internal Medicine Residency Program at a large urban hospital. The clinical reasoning curriculum consists of six to seven sessions with the specific aims of: (1) educating residents on cognitive steps and reasoning strategies used in clinical reasoning; (2) acknowledging the pitfalls of clinical reasoning and learning how cognitive biases can lead to clinical errors; (3) expanding differential diagnostic ability and developing illness scripts that incorporate discrete clinical prediction rules; and (4) providing opportunities for residents to reflect on their own clinical reasoning (also known as metacognition).

Given its pivotal role as a central hub in mediating the transcriptional output of Hippo signaling, there is great interest in understanding the molecular regulation of the Sd-Yki complex. In this study, we identify Nerfin-1 as a transcriptional repressor that antagonizes the activity of the Sd-Yki complex by binding to the TEA DNA-binding domain of Sd. Consistent with its biochemical function, ectopic expression of Nerfin-1 results in tissue undergrowth in an Sd-dependent manner. Conversely, loss of Nerfin-1 enhances the ability of winner cells to eliminate loser cells in multiple scenarios of cell competition. We further show that INSM1, the mammalian ortholog of Nerfin-1, plays a conserved role in repressing the activity of the TEAD-YAP complex. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mode converging on the transcriptional output of the Hippo pathway that may be exploited for modulating the YAP oncoprotein in cancer and regenerative medicine.",Coenzyme Q2 is a universal substrate for the measurement of respiratory chain enzyme activities in trypanosomatids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901308,"Parasite (Paris, France)",2019 04 18,"The measurement of respiratory chain enzyme activities is an integral part of basic research as well as for specialized examinations in clinical biochemistry.

There is, however, a lack of studies outside this context, and empirical studies based on individual data. This study is a contribution by exploring the variability in clinical practice from a Swedish perspective. It is based on documentation from one oncology social worker's (OSW's) patient contacts over the course of one year. The essence of the majority of contacts was counseling and the patients displayed a wide variety of motives for seeing an OSW. The function of the OSW is thus multifaceted, and the findings suggest that the OSW, in addition to guiding patients in social legislation issues, also should be prepared to act as an anchor in an acute crisis, contain despair in different phases of the trajectory, and facilitate the 'carrying on as before' or finding a 'new normal'. The paper discusses the importance of the OSW being acquainted with different counseling/psychotherapy perspectives in the illness context, but primarily the importance of having the ability to establish a 'working alliance' with their patients.",Abbreviated MRI Protocols for the Abdomen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901285,"Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",2019 05 06,"Technical advances in MRI have improved image quality and have led to expanding clinical indications for its use. However, long examination and interpretation times, as well as higher costs, still represent barriers to use of MRI. Abbreviated MRI protocols have emerged as an alternative to standard MRI protocols. These abbreviated MRI protocols seek to reduce longer MRI protocols by eliminating unnecessary or redundant sequences that negatively affect cost, MRI table time, patient comfort, image quality, and image interpretation time. However, the diagnostic information is generally not compromised. Abbreviated MRI protocols have already been used successfully for hepatocellular carcinoma screening, for prostate cancer detection, and for screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as well as monitoring patients with this disease. It has been reported that image acquisition time and costs can be considerably reduced with abbreviated MRI protocols, compared with standard MRI protocols, while maintaining a similar sensitivity and accuracy. Nevertheless, multiple applications still need to be explored in the abdomen and pelvis (eg, surveillance of metastases to the liver; follow-up of cystic pancreatic lesions, adrenal incidentalomas, and small renal masses; evaluation of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women; staging of cervical and uterine corpus neoplasms; evaluation of müllerian duct anomalies). This article describes some successful applications of abbreviated MRI protocols, demonstrates how they can help in improving the MRI workflow, and explores potential future directions. ©RSNA, 2019.",Four-dimensional Flow MRI: Principles and Cardiovascular Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901284,"Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",2019 05 06,"In-plane phase-contrast (PC) imaging is now a routine component of MRI of regional blood flow in the heart and great vessels. In-plane PC MRI provides a volumetric, isotropic, time-resolved cine sequence that enables three-directional velocity encoding, a technique known as four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI. Recent advances in 4D flow MRI have shortened imaging times, while progress in big-data processing has improved dataset pre- and postprocessing, thereby increasing the feasibility of 4D flow MRI in clinical practice. Important technical issues include selection of the optimal velocity-encoding sensitivity before acquisition and preprocessing of the raw data for phase-offset corrections. Four-dimensional flow MRI provides unprecedented capabilities for comprehensive analysis of complex blood flow patterns using new visualization tools such as streamlines and velocity vectors. Retrospective multiplanar navigation enables flexible retrospective flow quantification through any plane across the volume with good accuracy. Current flow parameters include forward flow, reverse flow, regurgitation fraction, and peak velocity. Four-dimensional flow MRI also supplies advanced flow parameters of use for research, such as wall shear stress. The vigorous burgeoning of new applications indicates that 4D flow MRI is becoming an important imaging modality for cardiovascular disorders. This article reviews the main technical issues of 4D flow MRI and the different parameters provided by it and describes the main applications in cardiovascular diseases, including congenital heart disease, cardiac valvular disease, aortic disease, and pulmonary hypertension.

Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 05 08,"Maternal obesity is correlated with cardiovascular disease in offspring, with a 1.3-fold increase in events observed in offspring of obese women. We have observed that obesity-exposed oocytes demonstrate impaired mitophagy and transmit damaged mitochondria to the offspring. Accordingly, we hypothesized that maternal obesity induces cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in the offspring via transgenerational inheritance of abnormal oocyte mitochondria. We mated female mice fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFS) diet (or chow) with chow-fed males and assessed cardiac structure and function in their descendants that were chow fed in each generation. All F1 to F3 descendants bred via the female in each generation were nonobese and demonstrated cardiac mitochondrial abnormalities with crystal rarefaction and reduced oxygen consumption pointing to a transgenerational effect, while obese F0 dams' hearts were unaffected. Furthermore, male offspring from F1 to F3 generations and female F1 and F2 offspring developed increased left ventricular (LV) mass (vs. chow-fed controls). Increased LV mass was also observed in offspring generated by in vitro fertilization of obesity-exposed oocytes and gestation in nonobese surrogates, ruling out a gestational environment effect. Contrary to our hypothesis, male F1 also transmitted these effects to their offspring, ruling out maternal mitochondria as the primary mode of transmission. We conclude that transmission of obesity-induced effects in the oocyte nucleus rather than abnormal mitochondria underlie transgenerational inheritance of cardiac mitochondrial defects in descendants of obese females. These findings will spur exploration of epigenetic alterations in the oocyte genome as potential mechanisms whereby a family history of maternal obesity predisposes to cardiovascular disease in humans.",MK5 haplodeficiency decreases collagen deposition and scar size during post-myocardial infarction wound repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901279,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 05 15,"MK5 is a protein serine/threonine kinase activated by p38, ERK3, and ERK4 MAPKs. MK5 mRNA and immunoreactivity are detected in mouse cardiac fibroblasts, and MK5 haplodeficiency attenuates the increase in collagen 1-α1 mRNA evoked by pressure overload. The present study examined the effect of MK5 haplodeficiency on reparative fibrosis following myocardial infarction (MI). Twelve-week-old MK5+/- and wild-type littermate (MK5+/+) mice underwent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LADL). Surviving mice were euthanized 8 or 21 days post-MI. Survival rates did not differ significantly between MK5+/+ and MK5+/- mice, with rupture of the LV wall being the primary cause of death. Echocardiographic imaging revealed similar increases in LV end-diastolic diameter, myocardial performance index, and wall motion score index in LADL-MK5+/+ and LADL-MK5+/- mice. Area at risk did not differ between LADL-MK5+/+ and LADL-MK5+/- hearts. In contrast, infarct size, scar area, and scar collagen content were reduced in LADL-MK5+/- hearts. Immunohistochemical analysis of mice experiencing heart rupture revealed increased MMP-9 immunoreactivity in the infarct border zone of LADL-MK5+/- hearts compared with LADL-MK5+/+. Although inflammatory cell infiltration was similar in LADL-MK5+/+ and LADL-MK5+/- hearts, angiogenesis was more pronounced in the infarct border zone of LADL-MK5+/- mice. Characterization of ventricular fibroblasts revealed reduced motility and proliferation in fibroblasts isolated from MK5-/- mice compared with those from both wild-type and haplodeficient mice. siRNA-mediated knockdown of MK5 in fibroblasts from wild-type mice also impaired motility. Hence, reduced MK5 expression alters fibroblast function and scar morphology but not mortality post-MI. NEW & NOTEWORTHY MK5/PRAK is a protein serine/threonine kinase activated by p38 MAPK and/or atypical MAPKs ERK3/4. MK5 haplodeficiency reduced infarct size, scar area, and scar collagen content post-myocardial infarction. Motility and proliferation were reduced in cultured MK5-null cardiac myofibroblasts.",Vascular phenotype of amyloid precursor protein-deficient mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901278,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 05 15,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is expressed in the blood vessel wall, but the physiological function of APP is not completely understood. Previous studies established that APP has amine oxidase activity responsible for degradation of catecholamines. In the present study, we characterized the vascular phenotype of APP-knockout (APP-/-) mice. We demonstrate that circulating levels of catecholamines are significantly increased in male as compared with female APP-/- mice. Studies of vasomotor function in isolated aortas revealed that contractions to the α1-receptor agonist phenylephrine were significantly reduced in male APP-/- mice but not in females. In addition, contractions to G protein activation with sodium fluoride were reduced exclusively in male APP-/- mice aortas. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were not affected by the loss of APP in mice of both sexes. Further analysis of the mechanisms underlying endothelium-dependent relaxations revealed that inhibition of cyclooxygenase by indomethacin significantly impaired relaxations to acetylcholine exclusively in male APP-/- mice. Furthermore, acetylcholine-induced production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was significantly reduced in male APP-/- mice aortas while acetylcholine-induced production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was enhanced. We concluded that altered vascular reactivity to phenylephrine appears to be in part the result of chronic exposure of male APP-/- aorta to high circulating levels of catecholamines. The mechanisms responsible for the impairment of endothelium-dependent cGMP signaling and adaptive enhancement of endothelium-dependent production of cAMP remain to be defined. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Male amyloid precursor protein (APP)-deficient mice have higher circulating levels of catecholamines as compared with female APP-deficient mice. As a consequence, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasomotor functions of male APP-deficient mice are significantly altered. Under physiological conditions, expression of APP appears to play an important role in vascular function.",Role of T-cell activation in salt-sensitive hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901277,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 05 24,"The contributions of T lymphocytes to the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension has been well established. Under hypertensive stimuli, naive T cells develop into different subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, depending on the surrounding microenviroment in organs. Distinct subsets of T cells may play totally different roles in tissue damage and hypertension. The underlying mechanisms by which hypertensive stimuli activate naive T cells involve many events and different organs, such as neoantigen presentation by dendritic cells, high salt concentration, and the milieu of oxidative stress in the kidney and vasculature. Infiltrating and activated T subsets in injured organs, in turn, exert considerable impacts on tissue dysfunction, including sodium retention in the kidney, vascular stiffness, and remodeling in the vasculature. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of T-cell actions in hypertension may provide novel insights into the development of new therapeutic strategies for patients with hypertension."

The objective of this paper is to propose a definition for remission for use as an outcome to evaluate the long-term efficacy of therapies for chronic pain. Methods: Data from a randomized clinical trial (NCT01609972) testing the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation in low back and leg pain subjects was used to evaluate the association between pain and functional outcomes and identify the cut-off value to predict remission. Available data over 24-month assessment period included visual analog score (VAS), disability (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), patient and clinician global impression of change (PGIC and CGIC), and patient satisfaction. Cluster analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficients, sensitivity, and specificity analyses were used to evaluate its utility in predicting higher patient functionality and satisfaction. Results: Though the term remission has been used in the chronic pain field, a consistent definition has not been previously established. Based on the analysis of the clinical data, we propose that a sustained (≥6 months) pain score of ≤3.0 cm out of 10 cm on VAS be defined as remission. Applying this definition to the clinical trial data: subjects in remission at 24 months versus non-remitters were significantly more likely to be in the highest functional category of minimally disabled according to the ODI (31.5 vs. 8.2%, respectively, p = 0.001), and be 'very satisfied' (75.7 vs 22.6%, respectively, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The validity of the proposed definition of remission is supported by the persistence of remission in this study group, and its correspondence with patient satisfaction, and reduced disability. Further evaluation of the definition using clinical data from other long-term studies is needed.",Technology for Discovery of Antifibrotic Drugs: Phenotypic Screening for LARP6 Inhibitors Using Inverted Yeast Three Hybrid System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901265,Assay and drug development technologies,2019 04 08,"Fibrosis is defined by excessive production of type I collagen in various organs. Excessive type I collagen production in fibrosis is stimulated by binding of RNA protein LARP6 to the structural element of collagen mRNAs, the 5' stem loop (5'SL). The LARP6-dependent regulation is specific for type I collagen and critical for fibrosis development. Inhibitors of LARP6 binding have potential to be specific antifibrotic drugs, as evidenced by the discovery of one such inhibitor. To create technology for phenotypic screening of additional compounds we developed an inverted yeast three hybrid system. The system is based on expression of human LARP6 and a short RNA containing the 5'SL of human collagen α1(I) mRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The cells were engineered in such a way that when LARP6 is bound to 5'SL RNA they fail to grow in a specific synthetic medium. Dissociation of LARP6 from 5'SL RNA permits the cell growth, allowing identification of the inhibitors of LARP6 binding. The assay simply involves measuring optical density of cells growing in multiwall plates and is pertinent for high throughput applications. We describe the specificity of the system and its characteristics for high throughput screening. As a proof of principle, the result of one screen using collection of FDA approved drugs is also presented. This screen demonstrates that using this technology discovery of novel LARP6 inhibitors is possible.",Cancer Treatment in the Genomic Era.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901264,Annual review of biochemistry,2019 03 22,"The complexity of human cancer underlies its devastating clinical consequences.

Here, we review the genomic landscape of cancer, how genomic data can provide much more than a sum of its parts, and the approaches developed to identify and validate genomic alterations with potential therapeutic value. We highlight notable successes and pitfalls in predicting the value of potential therapeutic targets and discuss the use of multi-omic data to better understand cancer dependencies and drug sensitivity. We discuss how integrated approaches to collecting, curating, and sharing these large data sets might improve the identification and prioritization of cancer vulnerabilities as well as patient stratification within clinical trials. Finally, we outline how future approaches might improve the efficiency and speed of translating genomic data into clinically effective therapies and how the use of unbiased genome-wide information can identify novel, predictive biomarkers that can be either simple or complex.

The lipid molecules that surround them play crucial roles in maintaining their full structural and functional integrity. Research directed at investigating these critical lipid-protein interactions is developing rapidly. Advancements in both instrumentation and software, as well as in key biophysical and biochemical techniques, are accelerating the field. In this review, we provide a brief outline of structural techniques used to probe protein-lipid interactions and focus on the molecular aspects of these interactions obtained from native mass spectrometry (native MS). We highlight examples in which lipids have been shown to modulate membrane protein structure and show how native MS has emerged as a complementary technique to X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy.

F-type ATP synthases have been investigated for more than 50 years, but a full understanding of their molecular mechanisms has become possible only with the recent structures of complete, functionally competent complexes determined by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). High-resolution cryo-EM structures offer a wealth of unexpected new insights. The catalytic F1 head rotates with the central γ-subunit for the first part of each ATP-generating power stroke. Joint rotation is enabled by subunit δ/OSCP acting as a flexible hinge between F1 and the peripheral stalk. Subunit a conducts protons to and from the c-ring rotor through two conserved aqueous channels. The channels are separated by ∼6 Å in the hydrophobic core of Fo, resulting in a strong local field that generates torque to drive rotary catalysis in F1. The structure of the chloroplast F1Fo complex explains how ATP synthesis is turned off at night by a redox switch. Structures of mitochondrial ATP synthase dimers indicate how they shape the inner membrane cristae. The new cryo-EM structures complete our picture of the ATP synthases and reveal the unique mechanism by which they transform an electrochemical membrane potential into biologically useful chemical energy.

The large range of sampled timescales and the fact that many of the conformers that are continually explored are only transiently formed and sparsely populated challenge current biophysical approaches. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful method for characterizing biomolecular dynamics in detail, even in cases where excursions involve short-lived states. Here, we briefly review a number of NMR experiments for studies of biomolecular dynamics on the microsecond-to-second timescale and focus on applications to protein and nucleic acid systems that clearly illustrate the functional relevance of motion in both health and disease.",Tadalafil for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901259,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,2019 05 08,"In men, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are primarily attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Therapeutic options are targeted to relax prostate smooth muscle and/or reduce prostate enlargement. Areas covered: This article reviews the major preclinical and clinical data on PDE5 inhibitors with a specific focus on tadalafil. It includes details of the role of the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) - PDE5 pathway in the LUT organs (bladder and prostate) in addition to the available data on tadalafil in patients with LUTS secondary to BPH with or without erectile dysfunction (ED). Expert opinion: Preclinical and clinical data have clearly demonstrated that PDE5 inhibitors induce bladder and prostate relaxation, which contributes to the improvement seen in storage symptoms in both animal models of bladder and prostate hypercontractility. Tadalafil is effective both as a monotherapy and add-on therapy in patients with LUTS secondary to BPH. Furthermore, as LUTS-BPH and ED are urological disorders that commonly coexist in aging men, tadalafil is more advantageous than α1-adrenoceptors and should be used as the first option. Tadalafil is a safe and tolerable therapy and unlike α1- adrenoceptors and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, which can cause sexual dysfunctions, tadalafil improves sexual function.",Thermodynamic Principles for the Design of Polymers for Drug Formulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901257,Annual review of chemical and biomolecular engineering,2019 06 07,"Polymers play an essential role in drug formulation and production of medical devices, implants, and diagnostics. Following drug discovery, an appropriate formulation is selected to enable drug delivery. This task can be exceedingly challenging owing to the large number of potential delivery methods and formulation and process variables that can interact in complex ways. This evolving solubility challenge has inspired an increasing emphasis on the developability of drug candidates in early discovery as well as various advanced drug solubilization strategies. Among the latter, formulation approaches that lead to prolonged drug supersaturation to maximize the driving force for sustained intestinal absorption of an oral product, or to allow sufficient time for injection after reconstitution of a parenteral lyophile formulation, have attracted increasing interest. Although several kinetic and thermodynamic components are involved in stabilizing amorphous dispersions, it is generally assumed that maximum physical stability, defined in terms of inhibition of drug crystallization, requires that the drug and excipient remain intimately mixed. Phase separation of the drug from its excipient may be the first step that ultimately leads to crystallization. We discuss the role of advanced thermodynamics using two examples: ASD and vitamin E-stabilized ultrahigh-molecular weight polyethylene implants.",Preferred Terms and Icons for Labels on Electrosurgical Units: Survey of VA Nurses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901247,Biomedical instrumentation & technology,2019 04 11,"Electrosurgical units (ESUs) developed by different manufacturers use varying terminology and icons to label the same components, which can result in confusion among users and the potential for erroneous ESU configuration. The objective of the current study was to identify nurse-preferred terms and icons for labeling ESU components. A total of 165 operating room (OR) nurses from Veterans Health Administration facilities across the United States were surveyed regarding terms and icons found on 25 ESU models. The results showed that 81% of OR nurses preferred ESUs that included both a term and an icon for labeling each component. In addition, greater consensus existed among OR nurses regarding preferred terms, rather than preferred icons, for representing each component. These findings on OR nurses' preferred terms and icons can be leveraged to improve ESU labeling practices and inform the development of a standardized, user-centered set of labels for ESU components.",Novel two-chain fatty acid-based lipids for development of vancomycin pH-responsive liposomes against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901236,Journal of drug targeting,2019 04 10,"The development of bacterial resistance against antibiotics is attributed to poor localisation of lethal antibiotic dose at the infection site.

The formulated liposomes were characterised for their size, polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge and morphology. The drug-loading capacity, drug release, cell viability, and in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the formulations were investigated. A sustained VAN release profile was observed and in vitro antibacterial studies against S. aureus and MRSA showed superior and prolonged activity over 72 h at both pH 7.4 and 6.0. Enhanced antibacterial activity at pH 6.0 was observed for the DOAPA-VAN-Lipo and DLAPA-VAN-Lipo formulations. Flow cytometry studies indicated a high killing rate of MRSA cells using DOAPA-VN-Lipo (71.98%) and DLAPA-VN-Lipo (73.32%). In vivo studies showed reduced MRSA recovered from mice treated with formulations by four- and two-folds lower than bare VN treated mice, respectively.

To reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying macrovascular invasion (MaVI) in HCC, we performed an iTRAQ based proteomic study to identify notably dysregulated proteins from eight HCC patients with differential vascular invasion and further confirmed them in the other 53 HCC patients. Forty-seven proteins were found significantly down-regulated in HCC with MaVI. More importantly, 30 of them were not changed in HCC without MaVI. Gene ontology analysis of these 47 proteins shows the top three enriched biological processes are urea cycle, gluconeogenesis, and arginine biosynthetic process. We validated nine remarkably dysregulated candidates in HCC patients with MaVI by Western blot including eight down-regulated proteins (CPS1, ASS1, ASL, ARG1, BHMT, DMGDH, Annexin A6, and CES1) and one up-regulated protein (CKAP4). Furthermore, dysregulation of CPS1, ASL, and ARG1, key enzymes involved in urea cycle, together with Annexin A6 and CES1, major proteins in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and fatty acid ester metabolism, was verified using immunohistochemical staining. The significant down-regulation of urea cycle generates clinically relevant proteomic signature in HCC patients with macrovascular invasion, which may provide possible insights into the molecular mechanisms of metastasis and new therapeutic targets of HCC.",Influence of Ammonia and Water on the Fate of Sulfur Trioxide in the Troposphere: Theoretical Investigation of Sulfamic Acid and Sulfuric Acid Formation Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901223,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 12,"Reaction of ammonia with SO3 as a potential source of sulfamic acid in the troposphere has been investigated by means of electronic structure and chemical kinetic calculations. Besides, the hydrolysis reaction, which is known to be a major atmospheric decay channel of SO3, has also been investigated. The catalytic effects of ammonia and water on both the reactions have been studied. Rate coefficients for all the studied reaction channels were calculated using the transition state theory employing pre-equilibrium approximation. Calculated rate coefficients for a number of catalyzed hydrolysis and ammonolysis processes were found to be much higher (by ∼105 to ∼109 times) than the gas kinetic limit at ambient temperature. With decrease in temperature because of negative temperature dependence of rate coefficients, that difference became even larger (up to ∼1016 times). Therefore, in order to remove the discrepancies, rate coefficients for all the studied reaction channels were calculated by means of the master equation. The results showed marked improvements, with only one channel showing a slightly higher rate coefficient above the gas kinetic limit. The rate coefficients for catalyzed channels obtained from the master equation also showed negative temperature dependence, albeit to a much smaller extent. The uncatalyzed ammonolysis reaction, similar to the corresponding hydrolysis, was found to be too slow to have any practical atmospheric implication. For both reactions, ammonia-catalyzed pathways have higher rate coefficients than water-catalyzed ones. Between hydrolysis and ammonolysis, the latter showed a higher rate coefficient. In spite of that, ammonolysis is expected to have negligible contribution in the tropospheric loss process of SO3 because of large difference in concentration values between water and ammonia in the troposphere.",Thermal Excitation Control over Photon Emission Rate of CdSe Nanocrystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901222,Nano letters,2019 04 15,"Temperature-dependent photoluminescence lifetimes of electron-hole pairs (excitons) in CdSe nanocrystals are governed by the energetic ordering and spacing of slowly emitting, spin-forbidden ""dark"" exciton states and rapidly emitting ""bright"" states. Here, infrared pulses that are resonant with hydrocarbon surface ligand vibrational transitions are shown to offer a route to manipulate the instantaneous emission rate of CdSe nanocrystals at cryogenic temperature. Transient heating of the inorganic nanocrystal core is achieved via resonant excitation of ligand vibrations, followed by heat flow to the nanocrystal lattice. Heating of the nanocrystal core is demonstrated using transient absorption spectroscopy, which shows a time-dependent red-shift of the quantum dot electronic absorption resonances, consistent with heating. Transient heating of the nanocrystal above the bath temperature increases the instantaneous radiative rate of the nanocrystals via a combination of thermal occupation of bright states as well as phonon-assisted emission. The lifetime of this infrared-pumped, fast-emitting sample condition is dictated by particle thermalization, which is multiple orders of magnitude shorter lived than the dark exciton state. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using heat control pulses to manipulate electronic recombination rates of excitons.",Photochemical Relaxation Pathways of 9 H-8-Azaguanine and 8 H-8-Azaguanine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901221,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 12,"The photochemical reaction path approach, the MS-CASPT2 quantum-chemical method, and double-ζ basis sets (cc-pVDZ) were used to study 9 H-8-azaguanine and 8 H-8-azaguanine relaxation pathways. Several potential energy hypersurfaces were characterized by means of equilibrium geometries, surface crossings (conical intersections and singlet-triplet intersystem crossings), minimum energy paths, and linear interpolation in internal coordinates. The 9 H-8-azaguanine main photochemical event begins with the direct population of the 1(ππ* La) state, which evolves toward a conical intersection with the ground state after surmounting a small energy barrier, explaining why it is nonfluorescent. For 8 H-8-azaguanine, two relaxation mechanisms are possible, depending on the excitation energy. If the S11(ππ*) state is initially populated (lower-energy region), the system evolves barrierless to the S11(ππ*)min region, from where the excess energy is released. If the 1(ππ* La) state is populated (higher-energy radiation), the system will encounter conical intersections with the S21(nOπ*) and S11(ππ*) states before evolving to the 1(ππ* La)min region, from where a conical intersection with the ground state is accessible, favoring radiationless deactivation to the ground state. However, because a fraction of the population can be transferred from 1(ππ* La) to the S11(ππ*) state, emission from the S11(ππ*)min region is also expected, although weaker than it would be if the S11(ππ*) state were populated directly. Irrespective of the excitation energy, the emissive state is the same and a single fluorescence band is observed, with the strongest emission occurring upon excitation in the lower-energy region, as observed experimentally. Therefore, our computational study corroborates experimental results, attributing the emission of the neutral form of 8-azaguanine in solution to the presence of the minor 8 H-8-azaguanine tautomer, while the 9 H-8-azaguanine major tautomer is nonfluorescent.",Nature's Shortcut to Protein Folding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901220,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 05 30,"This Feature Article presents a view of the protein folding transition based on the hypothesis that Nature has built features within the sequences that enable a Shortcut to efficient folding. Nature's Shortcut is proposed to be the early establishment of a set of nonlocal weak contacts, constituting protein loops that significantly constrain regions of the collapsed disordered protein into a native-like low-resolution fluctuating topology of major sections of the backbone. Nature's establishment of this scaffold of nonlocal contacts is claimed to bypass what would otherwise be a nearly hopeless unaided search for the final three-dimensional structure in proteins longer than ∼100 amino acids. To support this main contention of the Feature Article, the loop hypothesis (LH) description of early folding events is experimentally tested with time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer techniques for adenylate kinase, and the data are shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions from the sequential collapse model (SCM). The experimentally based LH and the theoretically founded SCM are argued to provide a unified picture of the role of nonlocal contacts as constituting Nature's Shortcut to protein folding. Importantly, the SCM is shown to reliably predict key nonlocal contacts utilizing only primary sequence information. This view on Nature's Shortcut is open to the protein community for further detailed assessment, including its practical consequences, by suitable application of advanced experimental and computational techniques.",X-ray and Neutron Reflectometry of Thin Films at Liquid Interfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901219,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 12,"In the 1980s, Helmuth Möhwald studied lipid monolayers at the air/water interface to understand the thermodynamically characterized phases at the molecular level. In collaboration with Jens Als-Nielsen, X-ray reflectometry was used and further developed to determine the electron density profile perpendicular to the water surface. Using a slab model, parameters such as thickness and density of the individual molecular regions, as well as the roughness of the individual interfaces, were determined. Later, X-ray and neutron reflectometry helped to understand the coverage and conformation of anchored and adsorbed polymers. Nowadays, they resolve molecular properties in emerging topics such as liquid metals and ionic liquids. Much is still to be learned about buried interfaces (e.g., liquid/liquid interfaces). In this Article, a historical and theoretical background of X-ray reflectivity is given, recent developments of X-ray and neutron reflectometry for polymers at interfaces and thin layers are highlighted, and emerging research topics involving these techniques are emphasized.",Biodegradable and pH-Responsive Acetalated Dextran (Ac-Dex) Nanoparticles for NIR Imaging and Controlled Delivery of a Platinum-Based Prodrug into Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901218,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 05 06,"Nanoparticles (NPs) based on the biodegradable acetalated dextran polymer (Ac-Dex) were used for near-infrared (NIR) imaging and controlled delivery of a PtIV prodrug into cancer cells. The Ac-Dex NPs loaded with the hydrophobic PtIV prodrug 3 (PtIV/Ac-Dex NPs) and with the novel hydrophobic NIR-fluorescent dye 9 (NIR-dye 9/Ac-Dex NPs), as well as Ac-Dex NPs coloaded with both compounds (coloaded Ac-Dex NPs), were assembled using a single oil-in-water nanoemulsion method. Dynamic light scattering measurements and scanning electron microscopy images showed that the resulting Ac-Dex NPs are spherical with an average diameter of 100 nm, which is suitable for accumulation in tumors via the enhanced permeation and retention effect. The new nanosystems exhibited high drug-loading capability, high encapsulation efficiency, high stability in physiological conditions, and pH responsiveness. Drug-release studies clearly showed that the PtIV prodrug 3 release from Ac-Dex NPs was negligible at pH 7.4, whereas at pH 5.5, this compound was completely released with a controlled rate. Confocal laser scanning microscopy unambiguously showed that the NIR-dye 9/Ac-Dex NPs were efficiently taken up by MCF-7 cells, and cytotoxicity assays against several cell lines showed no significant toxicity of blank Ac-Dex NPs up to 1 mg mL-1. The IC50 values obtained for the PtIV prodrug encapsulated in Ac-Dex NPs were much lower when compared with the IC50 values obtained for the free PtIV complex and cisplatin in all cell lines tested. Overall, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that Ac-Dex NPs constitute a promising drug delivery platform for cancer therapy.",Unprecedented Intramolecular Association-Induced Fluorescence in Tryptophan-Conjugated Peptidomimetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901217,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 04 11,We report herewith tryptophan (Trp)-conjugated peptidomimetics that show intramolecular through-space association between the Trp units. Our investigation revealed that the proximal placement of Trp can lead to the emergence of a new and unanticipated fluorescent entity constituting a Trp-Trp dimer. Proton-induced modulation of fluorescence is a consequence of this work. Investigations with control compounds unequivocally revealed that the fluorescence property is not originated from the localized excited state but from the unprecedented Trp-Trp intramolecular dimer in the ground state itself. The present findings will initiate the biophysical scientists to have a relook at the fluorescence properties of Trp-containing proteins.,Chiral Cyclopentadienyl Cobalt(III) Complexes Enable Highly Enantioselective 3d-Metal-Catalyzed C-H Functionalizations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901216,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 10,"The synthesis of a set of cobalt(III)-complexes equipped with trisubstituted chiral cyclopentadienyl ligands is reported, and their steric and electronic parameters are mapped.

The transformation proceeds with excellent enantioselectivities of up to 99.5:0.5 er and high regioselectivities. The observed values outperform the best rhodium(III)-based methods for this reaction type. Moreover, challenging substrates such as alkyl alkenes also react with high regio- and enantioselectivities."

This originates in part from the complete lack of exchange terms that would otherwise cancel Pauli exclusion principle violating (EPV) contributions. The uncanceled EPV contributions also manifest themselves in form of an unphysical negative pair density of spin-parallel electrons close to electron-electron coalescence. We follow considerations of many-body perturbation theory to propose an exchange correction that corrects the largest set of EPV contributions, while having the lowest possible computational complexity. The proposed method exchanges adjacent particle/hole pairs in the RPA diagrams, considerably improving the pair density of spin-parallel electrons close to coalescence in the uniform electron gas (UEG). The accuracy of the correlation energy is comparable to other variants of second-order screened exchange (SOSEX) corrections although it is slightly more accurate for the spin-polarized UEG. Its computational complexity scales as [Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text] in orbital space or real space, respectively.

Many metal-rich phosphides and monophosphides function as heterogeneous electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction. This paper describes the direct and tin flux-assisted synthesis of phosphorus-rich metal phosphides with MP2 or MP3 compositions. The facile synthesis of FeP2, CoP3, NiP2, and CuP2 is thermochemically driven by PCl3 formation from reactions of anhydrous metal halides and P4 vapor at 500 °C. Well-crystallized micrometer-sized particles result from these solvent-free reactions. A tin flux leads to more complete reactions at lower temperature for FeP2 and enables synthesis of a monoclinic polymorph of NiP2 rather than the kinetic cubic product formed by direct reaction. These crystalline metal phosphides are investigated as electrocatalyts for hydrogen evolution in acidic and buffered aqueous solutions. All phosphorus-rich products show very good stability in strongly acidic media. The catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution ordered by higher current at a fixed electrode geometric area and low onset potential is CoP3 > NiP2 (cubic and monoclinic) > FeP2 ≫ CuP2. At high applied potentials, CuP2 undergoes surface reactions and roughening that improve its electrocatalytic activity. Correlations of the observed electrocatalytic activity with electrochemically active surface area, particle size, metallic versus semiconducting properties, and local metal coordination environment are noted for these phosphorus-rich 3d metal phosphides.",Revisiting the Synthesis and Nucleophilic Reactivity of an Anionic Copper Superoxide Complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901201,Inorganic chemistry,2019 06 10,"The addition of 1 equiv of KO2 and Kryptofix222 (Krypt) in CH3CN to a solution of LCu(CH3CN) [L = N, N'-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-2,6-pyridinecarboxamide] in tetrahydrofuran at -80 °C yielded [K(Krypt)][LCuO2], the enhanced stability of which enabled reexamination of its reactivity with 2-phenylpropionaldehyde (2-PPA). Mechanistic and product analysis studies revealed that [K(Krypt)][LCuO2] reacts with wet 2-PPA to form [LCuOH]-, which then deprotonates 2-PPA to yield the copper(II) enolate complex [LCu(OC═C(Me)Ph)]-.

In the particular case of metallophore-dependent metal uptake, there is a need to quickly adjust the production of these metallophores to the metal level outside the cell, to avoid metal shortage or overload, as well as waste of metallophores. In Staphylococcus aureus, CntM catalyzes the last biosynthetic step in the production of staphylopine, a broad-spectrum metallophore, through the reductive condensation of a pathway intermediate (xNA) with pyruvate. Here, we describe the chemical synthesis of this intermediate, which was instrumental in the structural and functional characterization of CntM and confirmed its opine synthase properties. The three-dimensional structure of CntM was obtained in an ""open"" form, in the apo state or as a complex with substrate or product. The xNA substrate appears mainly stabilized by its imidazole ring through a π-π interaction with the side chain of Tyr240. Intriguingly, we found that metals exerted various and sometime antagonistic effects on the reaction catalyzed by CntM: zinc and copper are moderate activators at low concentration and then total inhibitors at higher concentration, whereas manganese is only an activator and cobalt and nickel are only inhibitors. We propose a model in which the relative affinity of a metal toward xNA and an inhibitory binding site on the enzyme controls activation, inhibition, or both as a function of metal concentration. This metal-dependent regulation of a metallophore-producing enzyme might also take place in vivo, which could contribute to the adjustment of metallophore production to the internal metal level.",Covalent Interaction between Rice Protein Hydrolysates and Chlorogenic Acid: Improving the Stability of Oil-in-Water Emulsions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901199,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 19,"Protein hydrolysates, as surfactants, can scavenge radicals, but their poor distributions at the oil-water interface limit their storage stability. Therefore, we studied covalent interaction between rice protein hydrolysates and chlorogenic acid under alkaline conditions to improve the physical and oxidative stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Turbidity and particle size measurements demonstrated the formation of hydrolysates-chlorogenic acid complexes, and their covalent interaction resulted in the decrease and redshift of the fluorescence intensity. The emulsifying activity of the hydrolysates could be effectively improved after the covalent interaction with 0.025% chlorogenic acid. The modified emulsions possessed a notable physical stability according to the least changes in size (0.08 μm) and ζ-potential (3.34 mV) of the emulsion ( P > 0.05). Moreover, the covalent interaction endowed modified emulsions with high oxidative stability to effectively inhibit lipid oxidative deterioration during storage. The adsorption of hydrolysates to the emulsion interface was increased by the adequate addition of chlorogenic acid, which resulted in the oil droplet being surrounded by a thicker interfacial film. The covalent interaction between the protein hydrolysates and chlorogenic acid could be used to construct natural emulsion systems with a higher physical and oxidative stability during storage.",Atomically Precise Noble Metal Nanoclusters as Efficient Catalysts: A Bridge between Structure and Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901198,Chemical reviews,2019 06 11,"Improving the knowledge of the relationship between structure and properties is fundamental in catalysis. Recently, researchers have developed a variety of well-controlled methods to synthesize atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs). NCs have shown high catalytic activity and unique selectivity in many catalytic reactions, which are related to their ultrasmall size, abundant unsaturated active sites, and unique electronic structure different from that of traditional nanoparticles (NPs). More importantly, because of their definite structure and monodispersity, they are used as model catalysts to reveal the correlation between catalyst performance and structure at the atomic scale. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the recent progress on NCs in catalysis and provide potential theoretical guidance for the rational design of high-performance catalysts. First a brief summary of the synthetic strategies and characterization methods of NCs is provided. Then the primary focus of this review-the model catalyst role of NCs in catalysis-is illustrated from theoretical and experimental perspectives, particularly in electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, photoelectric conversion, and catalysis of organic reactions. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities are examined for a deep understanding of the key catalytic steps with the goal of expanding the catalytic application range of NCs.",Influence of Cellulose Charge on Bacteria Adhesion and Viability to PVAm/CNF/PVAm-Modified Cellulose Model Surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901196,Biomacromolecules,2019 05 13,"A contact-active antibacterial approach based on the physical adsorption of a cationic polyelectrolyte onto the surface of a cellulose material is today regarded as an environment-friendly way of creating antibacterial surfaces and materials. In this approach, the electrostatic charge of the treated surfaces is considered to be an important factor for the level of bacteria adsorption and deactivation/killing of the bacteria. In order to clarify the influence of surface charge density of the cellulose on bacteria adsorption as well as on their viability, bacteria were adsorbed onto cellulose model surfaces, which were modified by physically adsorbed cationic polyelectrolytes to create surfaces with different positive charge densities. The surface charge was altered by the layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly of cationic polyvinylamine (PVAm)/anionic cellulose nanofibril/PVAm onto the initially differently charged cellulose model surfaces. After exposing the LbL-treated surfaces to Escherichia coli in aqueous media, a positive correlation was found between the adsorption of bacteria as well as the ratio of nonviable/viable bacteria and the surface charge of the LbL-modified cellulose. By careful colloidal probe atomic force microscopy measurements, it was estimated, due to the difference in surface charges, that interaction forces at least 50 nN between the treated surfaces and a bacterium could be achieved for the surfaces with the highest surface charge, and it is suggested that these considerable interaction forces are sufficient to disrupt the bacterial cell wall and hence kill the bacteria.",DNA-Templated Silver Nanocluster/Porphyrin/MnO2 Platform for Label-Free Intracellular Zn2+ Imaging and Fluorescence-/Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Photodynamic Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901195,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 17,"Developing a theranostic platform that integrates diagnosis and treatment in one single nanostructure is necessary for efficient tumor treatment.

MnO2 nanosheets adsorbed hairpin DNA-silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) and porphyrin (P) by facile physisorption, which accelerate the transfection of nanoprobes and P into tumor cells. After entering the cells, the biodegradation of MnO2 nanosheets by glutathione and acidic hydrogen peroxide released AgNCs for label-free Zn2+ fluorescence imaging by the hairpin DNA-fueled dynamic self-assembly of three-way DNA junction architectures, and the released Mn2+ could act as an effective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent. In addition, MnO2 was decomposed in the acidic H2O2-ample environment and produced O2 to overbear hypoxia-related PDT resistance, highly efficient PDT was obtained by excess singlet oxygen (1O2) release of P-AgNCs-MnO2 nanoprobes under light irradiation compared with free P.

The composite photosensitizer was prepared by simply mixing DNA G-quadruplexes with a hydrophilic porphyrin (TMPipEOPP)4+·4I-. Compared with the conventional porphyrin photosensitizers, the excitation wavelength of the composite one has been ∼50 nm redshifted (from 650 to 700 nm), which is beneficial to the penetration of the light. Moreover, the composite photosensitizer showed an about 7.4-fold increase of light absorption efficiency, thus greatly enhancing the singlet oxygen (1O2) generation capacity and PDT efficacy. What is more, the introduction of nucleic acids in the composite photosensitizer could also provide some extra charming properties, such as the targeted recognition ability conferred by aptamer and high capability to assemble with various drug carriers. We demonstrated that the composite photosensitizer could be easily assembled with MnO2 nanosheet. The obtained nanodevice integrated the merits of a composite photosensitizer and MnO2 nanosheet, thus showing strong near-infrared absorption, high 1O2 generation efficiency, avoidance of nonideal 1O2 consumption by glutathione, and in situ O2 generation to relieve tumor hypoxia.

The issue is particularly critical in rural areas, where building of centralized water treatment systems and pipe infrastructure to connect dispersed populations is not always practical. Point-of-use (POU) water supply systems provide cost-effective and energy-efficient approaches to store, treat, and monitor the quality of water. Currently available POU systems have limited success in dealing with the portfolio of emerging contaminants, particularly those present at trace concentrations. A site-to-site variation in contaminant species and concentrations also requires versatile POU systems to detect and treat contaminants and provide on-demand clean water. Among different technologies for developing rapid and sensitive water purification processes and sensors, enzymes offer one of the potential solutions because of their strong activity and selectivity toward chemical substrates. Many enzyme-nanomaterial composites have recently been developed that enhance enzymes' stability and activity and expand their functionality, thus facilitating the application of nanosupported enzymes in advanced POU systems. In this Account, we highlight the strengths and limitations of nanosupported enzymes for their potential applications in POU systems for water treatment as well as detection of contaminants, even at trace levels. We first summarize the mechanisms by which silica, carbon, and metallic nanosupports improve enzyme stability, selectivity, and catalysis. The unique immobilization properties and potential advantages of novel bioderived nanosupports over non-bioderived nanomaterials are emphasized. We illustrate prospective applications of nanosupported enzymes in POU systems with different roles: water purification, disinfection, and contaminant sensing. For each type of application, nanosupported enzymes offer higher performance than free enzymes. Nanosupports prolong enzymes' lifetimes and improve the rates of contaminant removal by concentrating contaminants near the enzymes. Nanosupports also stabilize antimicrobial enzymes while facilitating their attachment to bacterial surfaces, thereby increasing their potential uses for disinfection and prevention of biofouling in water purification and storage devices. As enzyme-based electrochemical sensors rely on electrochemical reactions of enzymatically generated species, the ability of conductive nanosupports to enhance enzyme activity and stability and to promote transfer of electrons onto the electrode greatly improves the sensitivity and durability of electroenzymatic contaminant sensors. Despite the promising results in laboratory settings, the application of nanosupported enzymes in real-world POU systems requires the implementation of multiple enzyme combinations and strategies for minimizing health risks associated with unintended releases of nanomaterials. Finally, we identify multidisciplinary research gaps in the development of nanosupported enzyme treatment systems and provide frameworks for the early adopters to make informed decisions on whether and how to use such POU systems."

They allow to multilayer regulation of fragile balance between transcriptionally active euchromatin and inactive heterochromatin. The newest research describe new chromatin elements, e.g. half nucleosomes, bivalent chromatin marker and pointed to few intermediate states between euchromatin and heterochromatin.

Due to the important functional implications of non-histone chromosomal protein HMG-14 (HMGN1) in regulating chromatin structure and tumor immunity, gene knockout of HMGN1 is performed by CRISPR in cancer cells and the following proteomic regulation events are studied. In particular, DIA mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) is utilized, and more than 6200 proteins (protein- FDR 1%) and more than 82 000 peptide precursors are reproducibly measured in the single MS shots of 2 h. HMGN1 protein deletion is confidently verified by DIA-MS in all of the clone- and dish- replicates following CRISPR. Statistical analysis reveals 147 proteins change their expressions significantly after HMGN1 knockout. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis indicate the deletion of HMGN1 induces histone inactivation, various stress pathways, remodeling of extracellular proteomes, cell proliferation, as well as immune regulation processes such as complement and coagulation cascade and interferon alpha/ gamma response in cancer cells. These results shed new lights on the cellular functions of HMGN1.

Protein phosphorylation, as one of the most important post-translational modifications, can regulate spermiogenesis; however, the phosphorylation events taking place during this process have not been systematically analyzed. In order to better understand the role of phosphorylation in spermiogenesis, large-scale phosphoproteome profiling is performed using IMAC and TiO2 enrichment. In total, 13 835 phosphorylation sites, in 4196 phosphoproteins, are identified in purified mouse spermatids undergoing spermiogenesis in two biological replicates. Overall, 735 testis-specific proteins are identified to be phosphorylated, and are expressed at high levels during spermiogenesis. Gene ontology analysis shows enrichment of the identified phosphoproteins in terms of histone modification, cilium organization, centrosome and the adherens junction. Further characterization of the kinase-substrate phosphorylation network demonstrates enrichment of phosphorylation substrates related to the regulation of spermiogenesis. This global protein phosphorylation landscape of spermiogenesis shows wide phosphoregulation across a diverse range of processes during spermiogenesis and can help to further characterize the process of sperm generation.

Thirty-three structures were evaluated for fungicidal activity against three Colletotrichum species using direct bioautography assays. Active compounds were subsequently tested against C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, Phomopsis obscurans, P. viticola, Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium oxysporum. The study identified 2-chloro-N-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]acetamide (7a) as showing the strongest antifungal activity, and the broadest activity spectrum in this set against Colletotrichum acutatum (at 48 and 72 h) and Phomopsis viticola (at 144 h). The presence of triethylamine in its complex with N-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropanamide (7b') played an important role in the bioactivity, and depending on the concentration or fungal species it showed higher or lower activity than the parent amide.

In women, heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), recurrent ovulation bleeding with haemoperitoneum and bleeding complications in pregnancy such as retroplacental haematoma and postpartum haemorrhage have been reported. The aim of this review was to examine gynaecological problems and obstetric complications in women with congenital FXD. A total number of 49 relevant articles were identified, including 332 women, dating from 1960 to 2018. Heavy menstrual bleeding was reported in 72/284 (25%) women in total, 14/30 (47%) in case reports and 58/254 (23%) in 11 case series, 64% and 10% required blood products and blood transfusion, respectively. Haemoperitoneum from ovulation bleeding or ruptured haemorrhagic ovarian cyst requiring blood transfusion occurred in 8/322 (2.4%) women, six required surgical intervention, including oophorectomy in two. 31 pregnancies were reported in 19 women. There were four miscarriages (including a late miscarriage at 21 weeks). There was a high rate of preterm birth and neonatal death occurring in eight (30%) and three (11%) of pregnancies reaching viability stage. Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) occurred in six (22%) of deliveries, one requiring hysterectomy. In conclusion, women with FXD are at an increased risk of heavy bleeding during menstruation and ovulation as well as adverse pregnancy outcome and postpartum haemorrhage.

Recently, its presence in wild boar has been demonstrated at high prevalence. This evidence is surprising since the lower density of wild populations might not be expected to sustain such efficient viral transmission. Porcine circoviruses were proven to exhibit a certain plasticity in the host tropism and were detected in unrelated species, like mice, dogs and ruminants. However, if this scenario applies also to wild animals remains to be established. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the presence of PCV-3 in wild ungulates other than wild boar and in related hematophagous ectoparasites. One hundred and nine animals were sampled from different hilly and mountain areas of Friuli Venezia Giulia, including 9 chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), 17 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 4 mouflons (Ovis musimon), 50 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and 29 wild boars (Sus scrofa). Additionally, host-matched ectoparasites were collected when present. Porcine circovirus 3 was diagnosed using molecular techniques and sequencing. This study results confirmed the high PCV-3 occurrence in wild boar and reported for the first time its presence, at low prevalence, in chamois and roe deer. Moreover, two ticks (Ixodes ricinus), one of which non-engorged, collected from PCV-3 negative roe deer, tested PCV-3 positive. The genetic characterization of some of the strains collected from non-swine hosts allowed to prove that, albeit clearly part of PCV-3 species, they were genetically unique, demonstrating the absence of among-samples contamination and thus confirming the actual presence of PCV-3 genome in these new hosts. Therefore, this study highlights an unexpected broad PCV-3 distribution and circulation in the wild, rising further questions on porcine circoviruses infectious cycle, epidemiology and origin, which will deserve additional investigations.",Organic additives used in beef cattle feedlot: Effects on metabolic parameters and animal performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901139,Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,2019 05 28,"Organic additives are recently being used in animal diets owing to their ability to control metabolic issues and result in better animal performance.

This disorder results in an accumulation of glycoasparagines in the lysosomes of virtually all cell types, with severe clinical symptoms affecting the central nervous system, skeletal abnormalities, and connective tissue lesions. GA is synthesized as a single-chain precursor that requires an intramolecular autoprocessing to form a mature amidase. Previously, we showed that a Canadian AGU mutation disrupts this obligatory intramolecular autoprocessing with the enzyme trapped as an inactive precursor. Here, we report biochemical and structural characterization of a model enzyme corresponding to a new American AGU allele, the T99K variant. Unlike other variants with known 3D structures, this T99K model enzyme still has autoprocessing capacity to generate a mature form. However, its amidase activity to digest glycoasparagines remains low, consistent with its association with AGU. We have determined a 1.5-Å-resolution structure of this new AGU model enzyme and built an enzyme-substrate complex to provide a structural basis to analyze the negative effects of the T99K point mutation on KM and kcat of the amidase.

Knockdown of miR-155-5p and miR-760 can attenuate radiation suppressed proliferation of NSCLC cells. Among the various targets of miR-155-5p, radiation can decrease the expression of HIF-1α. Similarly, radiation can also suppress the expression of IL-6 via a miR-760 dependent pathway.

In particular, fluorescent probes with far-red to near-infrared (FR-NIR) emissions are very attractive for biomedical applications. However, many available FR-NIR fluorophores suffer from small Stokes shifts and sometimes low quantum yields, resulting in self-quenching and low contrast. In this work, we describe the rational design and engineering of FR-NIR 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium-based fluorophores (TPP-Fluors) with the help of theoretical calculations. Our strategy is based on the appending of electron-donating substituents and fusing groups onto 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium. In contrast to the parent TPP with short emission wavelength, weak quantum yields, and low chemical stability, the obtained novel TPP-Fluors display some favorable properties, such as long-wavelength emission, large Stokes shifts, moderate to high quantum yields, and chemical stability. TPP-Fluors demonstrate their biological value as mitochondria-specific labeling reagents due to their inherently positive nature. In addition, TPP-Fluors can also be applied to develop ratiometric fluorescent probes, as the electron-donating ability of the 2,6-phenyl substituents is closely correlated with their emission wavelength. A proof-of-concept ratiometric probe has been developed by derivatizing the amino groups of TPP-Fluor for the detection and imaging of nitroreductase in vitro and in hypoxic cells.",Use of a sequential chimeric perforator flap for one-stage reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects of the extremities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901118,Microsurgery,2019 03 22,"One-stage reconstruction of complex soft tissue defects of the extremities is a challenging problem.

Yet, hybridization can occasionally offer unprecedented opportunity for species recovery if the genome of an extinct taxon is present among living hybrids such that selective breeding could recapture it. We explored the design elements for establishing a captive-breeding program for Galapagos tortoises (Chelonoidis spp.) built around individuals with admixed ancestry involving an extinct species. The target individuals were hybrids between the extinct species from Floreana Island, C. niger, and an extant species, C. becki, which were recently found in the endemic range of C. becki, from Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island. We combined genotypic data from 35 tortoises with high ancestry from C. niger with forward-in-time simulations to explore captive breeding strategies that maximized overall genetic diversity and ancestry from C. niger while accommodating resource constraints, species biology, and the urgency to return tortoises to Floreana Island for facilitating ecosystem restoration. Overall genetic diversity was maximized when in the simulation tortoises were organized in relatively small breeding groups. Substantial amounts of the C. niger genome were captured despite limited resources available for selectively breeding tortoises in captivity. Genetic diversity was maximized when captive-bred offspring were released to the wild rather than being used as additional breeders. Our results provide genetic-based and practical guidance on the inclusion of hybrids with genomic representation from extinct taxa into species restoration programs and informs the ongoing debate on the value of hybrids in biodiversity conservation.",Postsystolic index for distinguishing coronary artery disease in left bundle branch block.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901114,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",2019 04 18,"Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is associated with a high risk of death, particularly from ventricular tachyarrhythmia and myocardial infarction.

Although microplastics have been widely detected in biota, there currently are few standardized detection and identification methods. The present study developed a novel one-step digestion method which was evaluated with mussel and fish samples. This method employed nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide (HNO3 :H 2 O 2 = 4:1 by volume) as digestion reagents, which completely digested biota samples <5 g weight within 30 min at 50 °C. A density separation step was subsequently used to remove organic residues as necessary. The efficiency and suitability of this method were tested by spiking microplastics of 7 different types and of various sizes (1000, 900, 675, 300, 250, and 150 μm) into mussel and gastrointestinal tracts of fish. The recoveries of microplastics ranged from 90 to 100%. No significant changes in weight, surface area, and particle size ( t test, p > 0.05) were observed for all tested polymers. Fourier transform infrared spectral analyses demonstrated that the method did not degrade any of the polymers except for polyethylene terephthalate. The method was demonstrated with mussel and fish samples collected from the Pearl River delta, south China, and was able to recover microplastics effectively. Overall, the present method is time-saving and easy to operate, with low procedural cross-contamination. The properties of microplastics recovered by the present method remained largely intact, greatly benefiting subsequent qualitative and quantitative analyses.",Effects of mine tailings exposure on early life stages of Atlantic cod.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901098,Environmental toxicology and chemistry,2019 05 06,"In Norway, mine tailings waste can be deposited by coastal submarine dispersal. Mine tailings slurry include fine particles <10 µm with elevated levels of metals (e.g. copper, iron) from residual mineral ore. Prolonged suspension of small particles in the water column may bring them into contact with locally spawned pelagic fish eggs, including Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Newly-fertilised cod embryos were exposed to suspended mine tailings particles up to 3.2 mg/L in flow-through aquaria for a total of 21 days. Significantly more particles adhered to the surface of the chorion from the high treatment after 11 days exposure, and dissolved Cu concentrations increased in the water (up to 0.36 ± 0.06 µg/L). There was no adverse effect on embryo mortality, but an 8 % elevation in larval mortality. There were no differences with treatment on timing of hatching, embryo and larvae morphometrics, abnormalities, or cardiac activity. There was a treatment-dependent up-regulation of stress marker genes (hspa8, cyp1c1) but no indication of metal-induced activation of metallothionien (mt gene transcription). Transcription markers for DNA and histone methyltransferases did show treatment-related up-regulation, indicative of altered methylation in larvae when developmental methylation patterns are determined, indicating some level of chronic toxicity that may have longer term effects.

An understanding of how food webs and bioaccumulation dynamics respond to these challenges requires the quantification of energy flow. We present a combined, multitracer approach using both polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and stable isotopes to trace energy flow, and to quantify how lake trout feeding strategies have adapted to changes in food web structure in 3 basins of Lake Huron (ON, Canada). This combined tracer approach allows the quantification of dietary proportions (using stable isotopes), which are then integrated using a novel PCB tracer approach that employs knowledge of PCB bioaccumulation pathways, to estimate consumption and quantify energy flow between age cohorts of individual fish across Lake Huron. We observed basin-specific differences in ultimate energy sources for lake trout, with Georgian Bay lake trout deriving almost 70% of their energy from benthic resources compared with 16 and 33% for Main Basin and North Channel lake trout, respectively. These differences in resource utilization are further magnified when they are contrasted with age. The dependency on pelagic energy sources in the Main Basin and North Channel suggests that these populations will be the most negatively affected by the ongoing trophic collapse in Lake Huron. Our study demonstrates the utility of a multitracer approach to quantify the consequences of food web adaptations to changes in aquatic ecosystems.

However, a detailed description of the effects of cumulative sulfate loads on sulfide and iron (Fe) porewater geochemistry, plant exposure, and ecological response is lacking. Over 4 yr, we experimentally manipulated sulfate loads to self-perpetuating wild rice (Zizania palustris) populations and monitored increases in the ratio of sulfur (S) to Fe in sediment across a range of sulfide loading rates driven by overlying water sulfate. Because natural settings are complicated by ongoing Fe and S loads from surface and groundwater, this experimental setting provides a tractable system to describe the impacts of increased S loading on Fe-S porewater geochemistry. In the experimental mesocosms, the rate of sulfide accumulation in bulk sediment increased linearly with overlying water sulfate concentration up to 300 µg-SO4 cm-3 . Seedling survival at the beginning of the annual life cycle and seed mass and maturation at the end of the annual life cycle all decreased at porewater sulfide concentrations between 0.4 and 0.7 µg cm-3 . Changes to porewater sulfide, plant emergence, and plant nutrient uptake during seed production were closely related to the ratio of S to Fe in sediment. A mass balance analysis showed that porewater sulfide remained a small and relatively transient phase compared to sulfate in the overlying water and Fe in the sediment solid phase. The results illuminate the evolution of the geochemical setting and timescales over which 4 yr of cumulative sulfate loading resulted in a wholesale shift from Fe-dominated to sulfide-dominated porewater chemistry. This shift was accompanied by detrimental effects to, and eventual extirpation of, self-perpetuating wild rice populations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1231-1244. © 2019 The Authors.

In all, 28 Br3 -Br8 -PBDEs and 24 HOCs (10 of which had not been targeted previously) were analyzed. Average concentrations of Σ28 PBDEs in fish ranged between 79.7 ± 54.2 ng/g lipid weight in alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and 815 ± 695 ng/g lipid weight in lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). For invertebrates, concentrations were between 13.4 ng/g lipid weight (net plankton; >110 μm) and 41.9 ng/g lipid weight in Diaporeia (Diaporeia hoyi). Detection frequency (DF) for HOCs was highest for anti-Dechlorane Plus (anti-DDC-CO), 1,3-diiodobenzene (1,3-DiiB), tribromo-methoxy-methylbenzene (ME-TBP), allyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (TBP-AE), pentabromocyclododecene (PBCYD), α+β-tetrabromocylcooctane (TBCO), 2-bromoallyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (BATE), and pentabromotoluene (PBT; DF for all = 100% in lake trout). Tetrabromoxylene (TBX), dibromopropyl 2,4,6-tribromophenyl ether (TBP-DBPE), and syn-DDC-CO were also frequently detected in trout (DF = 70-78%), whereas 2,3,4,5,6-pentabromoethyl benzene (PBEB) was detected only in plankton. Several HOCs were reported in aquatic biota in the Great Lakes (USA/Canada) for the first time in the present study, including PBCYD, 1,3DiiB, BATE, TBP-DBPE, PBT, α + β-TBCO, and ME-TBP. The Br4-6 -BDEs (-47, -85, -99, -100, -153, and -154) all had prey-weighted biomagnification factors (BMFPW ) values >6, whereas BMFPW values for Br7-8 -BDEs were <1. The highest BMFPW values of non-PBDEs were for TBP-DBPE (10.6 ± 1.34) and ME-TBP (4.88 ± 0.60), whereas TBP-AE had a BMFPW value of <1. Significant (p ≤ 0.05) trophic magnification factors (TMFs), both positive and negative, were found for Br4-8- BDEs (BDE 196 = 0.4; BDE 154 = 9.5) and for bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE; 0.53), PBCYD (1.8), 1,3-DiiB (0.33), and pentabromobenzene (PBB; 0.25). Food chain length was found to have a significant influence on the TMF values.

The aim of this study was to examine the association of MHC class II haplotypes in a flock of Texel sheep with faecal egg counts and antibody responsiveness. Two haplotypes carried the DRB1*11:01 allele which has previously been associated with reduced egg counts in Scottish Blackface and Suffolk sheep. One of the two haplotypes was associated with reduced egg counts in the Texel breed, and both haplotypes were associated with reduced IgA activity against an extract from fourth-stage larvae. The reduced IgA activity is probably a consequence of reduced numbers of fourth-stage larvae in sheep carrying the resistance allele. The association of specific MHC alleles with reduced egg counts, reduced worm numbers and decreased IgA activity provides a mechanism for the density-dependent regulation of parasite growth and fecundity.",Posture-related stiffness mapping of paraspinal muscles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901090,Journal of anatomy,2019 05 24,"The paraspinal compartment acts as a bone-muscle composite beam of the spine. The elastic properties of the paraspinal muscles play a critical role in spine stabilization. These properties depend on the subjects' posture, and they may be drastically altered by low back pain. Supersonic shear wave elastography can be used to provide quantitative stiffness maps (elastograms), which characterize the elastic properties of the probed tissue. The aim of this study was to challenge shear wave elastography sensitivity to postural stiffness changes in healthy paraspinal muscles. The stiffness of the main paraspinal muscles (longissimus, iliocostalis, multifidus) was measured by shear wave elastography at the lumbosacral level (L3 and S1) for six static postures performed by volunteers. Passive postures (rest, passive flexion, passive extension) were performed in a first shear wave elastography session, and active postures (upright, bending forward, bending backward) with rest posture for reference were performed in a second session. Measurements were repeated three times for each posture. Sixteen healthy young adults were enrolled in the study. Non-parametric paired tests, multiple analyses of covariance, and intra-class correlations were implemented for analysis. Shear wave elastography showed good to excellent reliability, except in the multifidus at S1, during bending forward, and in the multifidus at L3, during bending backward. Yet, during bending forward, only poor quality was recorded for nine volunteers in the longissimus. Significant intra- and inter-muscular changes were observed with posture. Stiffness significantly increased for the upright position and bending forward with respect to the reference values recorded in passive postures. In conclusion, shear wave elastography allows reliable assessment of the stiffness of the paraspinal muscles except in the multifidus at S1 and longissimus, during bending forward, and in the multifidus at L3, during bending backward. It reveals a different biomechanical behaviour for the multifidus, the longissimus, and the iliocostalis.",Differential effect on myelination through abolition of activity-dependent synaptic vesicle release or reduction of overall electrical activity of selected cortical projections in the mouse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901089,Journal of anatomy,2019 03 22,"Myelination of axons by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system is crucial for fast, saltatory conduction of action potentials. As myelination is central for brain development and plasticity, and deficits are implicated in several neural disorders such as multiple sclerosis, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, it is important to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating myelination. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed by which the communication between oligodendrocytes and active axons may regulate the onset and maintenance of activity-dependent myelination. We compared two models of 'silencing' layer V and/or VI cortical projection neurons from early stages by either decreasing their excitability through Kir2.1 expression, an inward rectifying potassium channel, introduced through in utero electroporation at embryonic day (E)13.5, or inhibiting regulated vesicular release through Cre-dependent knock-out of synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDA (SNAP25). SNAP25 is a component of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which, among others, is needed for calcium-dependent regulated vesicle release from synapses. In layer VI cortical projection neurons in the Ntsr1-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 fl/fl mouse, we found that inhibiting regulated vesicular release significantly decreased the amount of myelin basic protein (MBP, used as marker for myelination) and the amount of myelinated projections at postnatal day (P)14 without affecting the initial timing of onset of myelination in the brain (at P7/P8). Additionally, overall oligodendrocyte maturation appears to be affected. A strong trend towards reduced node of Ranvier (NoR) length was also observed in Ntsr1-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 fl/fl corpus callosum. An equally strong trend towards reduced NoR length was observed in Rbp4-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 fl/fl corpus callosum at P14, and the g-ratio in the spinal cord dorsal column was reduced at P18. However, no measurable differences in levels of MBP were detected in the striatum when comparing Rbp4-Cre;Ai14;Snap25 fl/fl and control brains. Conversely, Kir2.1 in utero electroporation at E13.5 did not significantly affect the amount of MBP or number of myelinated callosal axons at P14 but did significantly decrease the NoR length measured in the corpus callosum. It therefore seems likely that the excitability of the neuron can potentially perform a modulating function of myelin characteristics, whereas regulated vesicular release has the potential to have a more pronounced effect on overall myelination, but in a cell-type specific manner.","The bioelements, the elementome, and the biogeochemical niche.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901088,Ecology,2019 04 29,"Every living creature on Earth is made of atoms of the various bioelements that are harnessed in the construction of molecules, tissues, organisms, and communities, as we know them. Organisms need these bioelements in specific quantities and proportions to survive and grow. Distinct species have different functions and life strategies, and have therefore developed distinct structures and adopted a certain combination of metabolic and physiological processes. Each species is thus also expected to have different requirements for each bioelement. We therefore propose that a ""biogeochemical niche"" can be associated with the classical ecological niche of each species. We show from field data examples that a biogeochemical niche is characterized by a particular elementome defined as the content of all (or at least most) bioelements. The differences in elementome among species are a function of taxonomy and phylogenetic distance, sympatry (the bioelemental compositions should differ more among coexisting than among non-coexisting species to avoid competitive pressure), and homeostasis with a continuum between high homeostasis/low plasticity and low homeostasis/high plasticity. This proposed biogeochemical niche hypothesis has the advantage relative to other associated theoretical niche hypotheses that it can be easily characterized by actual quantification of a measurable trait: the elementome of a given organism or a community, being potentially applicable across taxa and habitats. The changes in bioelemental availability can determine genotypic selection and therefore have a feedback on ecosystem function and organization, and, at the end, become another driving factor of the evolution of life and the environment.",Nonmetropolitan residence and other factors affecting clinical trial enrollment for adolescents and young adults with cancer in a US population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901085,Cancer,2019 05 08,"Cancer survival rates in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) have shown slow improvements in comparison with other age groups, and this may be due to lower participation in clinical trials.

This is a non-systematic review article focusing on the psychopathological features of hair pulling. It is speculated that hair pulling may function to provide short-term relief from stress and other unwanted emotional states, thus serving as a method of emotion regulation. The prevalence of trichotillomania ranges from 1 to 3%. The most targeted site is the scalp, and other common areas include pubic hair and facial regions such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard. Individuals suffering from this disorder tend to avoid social environments due to embarrassment regarding their appearance and fears of being judged by peers.

However, in order to overcome the endogenous contrast arising from interfering endogenous species such as haemoglobin and melanin, specific contrast agents need to be developed, allowing PAI to successfully identify targeted contrast in the range of wavelengths in which interference from the biomatrix is minimized. This has been first performed by small molecule dyes, which, however, suffer from some important limitations such as low hydrophilicity and short circulation times. For this reason, scientific research has recently directed its efforts towards the development of nanostructured contrast agents capable of providing efficient PA contrast at low concentrations with low toxicity and high biocompatibility. The principal nanostructures are based on (1) metal and semiconducting nanoparticles, amongst which variously shaped nano-gold plays the main role, (2) carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, and (3) conjugated polymer nanoparticles. In this review, the principal characteristics of this class of materials are reported and greater focus is directed towards in vivo studies.

Collectively, our results demonstrate the applicability of short-chain lipid-conjugated sensors for in vivo and in vitro studies and thus pave the way for the design of lipid-conjugated sensors selective to other biologically relevant ions, e.g. calcium and sodium.",Selective growth of monolayer and bilayer graphene patterns by a rapid growth method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901015,Nanoscale,2019 04 05,"The use of next-generation graphene requires the control of the number of deposition layers together with its fast synthesis for its use in advanced and miniaturized devices. Here, this article describes a novel technique for the selective growth of a continuous film of a graphene pattern (controlled monolayer/multilayer design) by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method on Cu foils modified by different plasma treatments. Ex situ Ar plasma treatment is the preferred treatment for monolayer graphene (I2D/IG = 1.81) synthesis. Bilayer graphene (I2D/IG = 1.05) growth was influenced by applying an additional oxygen plasma treatment, which led to different morphologies and control of the surface-active nature of Cu. The required design was achieved by a photolithography process. Graphene synthesis was performed by a short annealing process (60 s) followed by a single-step short burst of graphene growth (60 s). Relatively high density graphene nuclei with faster graphene growth resulted in monolayer graphene in the Ar plasma-treated area. Ex situ oxygen plasma treatment in selected areas was capable of controlling the amount of graphene nuclei formation, while the kink structure was capable of bolstering the adsorption of a relatively high amount of carbon adatoms, resulting in bilayer graphene.",Homogeneous silver colloidal substrates optimal for metal-enhanced fluorescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901014,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 05,"Homogeneous silver colloidal films (SCFs), composed of silver nanoparticles 67-193 nm in diameter, were synthesized by a seeded-growth method as the substrates for metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF). The homogeneity and uniform particle distribution of the SCFs showed many advantages for the exploration of the MEF mechanism. The fluorescence enhancement of 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) and rhodamine 700 (Rh700) dyes dispersed in a thin layer of polystyrene (PS) with the SCFs was observed by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence enhancements of DCM and Rh700 become larger when the surface plasmon resonance bands of SCFs overlap the emission bands of dyes. The particle-size-dependent changes of the radiative and non-radiative rate constants of both dyes with the SCFs are estimated by an improved analysis combining the fluorescence intensity and lifetime measurements and the finite-difference time-domain method simulations.",Crystal structures and electronic properties in 3d transition metal doped SrRuO3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901013,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 03,"The synthesis of polycrystalline samples of B-site doped SrRu1-xMxO3 with x≤ 0.2 by solid state methods is described for a number of dopants (M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, or Zn) and the structures of these established using Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction, and for SrRu0.8Cu0.2O3 high resolution neutron diffraction. With the exception of M = Cu, samples with x = 0.2 form an orthorhombic Pbnm type perovskite structure at room temperature and these exhibit a sequence of phase transitions upon heating associated with the gradual reduction in the cooperative tilting of the corner sharing octahedra. SrRu0.8Cu0.2O3 forms a unique monoclinic structure at low temperatures and this transforms to the cubic Pm3[combining macron]m structure via an I4/mcm intermediate upon heating. The magnetic and electronic properties of the samples have been studied. Doping results in a decrease in the Curie temperature and at x = 0.2 all the samples are insulators. This is a consequence of the partial oxidation of the Ru cation that narrows the Ru 4d bands coupled with the suppression of the itinerant nature of the Ru 4d electrons due to the random distribution of the dopant cations. Ru L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the Cu doped samples reveal a gradual increase in the average Ru oxidation sate upon doping. Electrical resistivity measurements show that doping increases the resistivity of the samples, and the temperature dependence of the resistivities are consistent with Arrhenius-type charge conduction.",Implementing the mechanical force into the conceptual DFT framework: understanding and predicting molecular mechanochemical properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30901012,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 04 05,"In molecular mechanochemistry, the chemical properties of a reactant system are modified through the absorption of mechanical energy at the single molecular level, as opposed to thermochemistry (heat), electrochemistry (electrical current) and photochemistry (light).

By considering perturbations to the total molecular energy due to Fext, a series of mechanochemical response indices are obtained within the framework of conceptual density functional theory (DFT). Trends in these indices monitoring the change in hardness and electrophilicity among others, were rationalized for a number of diatomic molecules in terms of the ground-state geometry and the frontier molecular orbitals of the molecule.

Unlike other complexes, in 1[(B@C59B)2] and 1[(B@C59N-N@C59B)] the spin density is transferred from the guest to the host followed by anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the monomers. The thermodynamic feasibility of formation of the complexes is also examined. The electron affinity, ionization potential and dipole moment of the above systems are determined.

With the development of telemedicine and telemedicine services, online feedback has been widely applied, helping other patients to identify quality services. Recently, in China, a new type of service feedback has been applied to the telemedicine markets, namely, paid feedback. Patients who are satisfied with a physician's online service can buy a virtual gift or give a tip to the physicians. This paid feedback can improve the reliability of service feedback and reduce the proportion of false information because it increases the cost for feedback providers. Paid online feedback can benefit the physicians, such as by providing them with monetary incentives; however, research on the impacts and value of such paid feedback from the physician perspective in the telemedicine markets is scant.

Among these, mobile phone call detail records (CDRs) present novel opportunities for research and are being used in a variety of health geography studies. Research suggests that the public is amenable to the use of anonymized CDRs for research; however, further work is needed to show that such data can be used appropriately. This study works toward an ethically founded data governance framework with social acceptability. Using a multifaceted approach, this study draws upon data governance arrangements in published health research using CDRs, with a consideration of public views and the public's information expectations from mobile network operators, and data use scenarios of CDRs in health research. The findings were considered against a backdrop of legislative and regulatory requirements. CDRs can be used at various levels of data and geographic granularity and may be integrated with additional, publicly available or restricted datasets. As such, there may be a significant risk of identity disclosure, which must be mitigated with proportionate control measures. An indicative relative risk of the disclosure model is proposed to aid this process. Subsequently, a set of recommendations is presented, including the need for greater transparency, accountability, and incorporation of public views for social acceptability. This study addresses the need for greater clarity and consistency in data governance for CDRs in health research. While recognizing the need to protect commercial interests, we propose that these recommendations be used to contribute toward an ethically founded practical framework to promote the safe, socially acceptable use of CDR data for public benefit.

We investigated the effect of substrates on the conformational dynamics of six SBPs and the impact on transport. Using single-molecule FRET, we reveal an unrecognized diversity of plasticity in SBPs. We show that a unique closed SBP conformation does not exist for transported substrates. Instead, SBPs sample a range of conformations that activate transport. Certain non-transported ligands leave the structure largely unaltered or trigger a conformation distinct from that of transported substrates. Intriguingly, in some cases, similar SBP conformations are formed by both transported and non-transported ligands. In this case, the inability for transport arises from slow opening of the SBP or the selectivity provided by the translocator. Our results reveal the complex interplay between ligand-SBP interactions, SBP conformational dynamics and substrate transport.",Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900990,eLife,2019 04 10,"Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be reinstated with varying precision.

Participants learned color, spatial, and emotion associations of objects, later reconstructing the visual features using a continuous color spectrum and 360-degree panorama scenes. Behaviorally, dependencies in memory were observed for the gist but not precision of event associations. Supporting this integration, hippocampus, AT, and PM regions showed increased connectivity and reduced modularity during retrieval compared to encoding. These inter-network connections tracked a multidimensional, objective measure of memory quality. Moreover, distinct patterns of connectivity tracked item color and spatial memory precision. These findings demonstrate how hippocampal-cortical connections reconfigure during episodic retrieval, and how such dynamic interactions might flexibly support the multidimensional quality of remembered events.",Analysis of the genomic architecture of a complex trait locus in hypertensive rat models links Tmem63c to kidney damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900988,eLife,2019 04 26,"Unraveling the genetic susceptibility of complex diseases such as chronic kidney disease remains challenging. Here, we used inbred rat models of kidney damage associated with elevated blood pressure for the comprehensive analysis of a major albuminuria susceptibility locus detected in these models. We characterized its genomic architecture by congenic substitution mapping, targeted next-generation sequencing, and compartment-specific RNA sequencing analysis in isolated glomeruli. This led to prioritization of transmembrane protein Tmem63c as a novel potential target. Tmem63c is differentially expressed in glomeruli of allele-specific rat models during onset of albuminuria. Patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis exhibited specific TMEM63C loss in podocytes. Functional analysis in zebrafish revealed a role for tmem63c in mediating the glomerular filtration barrier function. Our data demonstrate that integrative analysis of the genomic architecture of a complex trait locus is a powerful tool for identification of new targets such as Tmem63c for further translational investigation."

We found sequential emergence of the spike mutations in 2 superspreaders. In vivo virulence of the mutant viruses seems to decline in human patients, as assessed by fever duration in affected persons. In addition, neutralizing activity against these 2 mutant viruses in serum samples from mice immunized with wild-type spike antigen were gradually reduced, suggesting emergence and wide spread of neutralization escapers during the outbreak.","Molecular Evidence of Human Monkeypox Virus Infection, Sierra Leone.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900976,Emerging infectious diseases,2019 06 10,"Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic disease endemic to Africa.

The migration tests were carried out at different time-temperature conditions, and the concentration of additives in polymer matrix and food simulants were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). With all data, the mass transport properties for migration kinetics (partition and diffusion coefficients) were determined. Results showed that the partition coefficient was affected significantly by the temperature and simulants' properties, whereas little affected by the types of PP film and molecular weight of substance. The polarity, structure and shape of substances can also have an influence in their partition between the polymer matrix and food simulants. Additionally, comparison results between the experimental diffusion coefficients and the calculated values by Piringer model suggested that the current migration model with the default modelling parameters for PP does not describe realistically the diffusion coefficients of additives. The calculated diffusion coefficients were greater than the experimental values, as a consequence, the migration of chemical additives will be overestimated. For more realistic migration calculations, more accurate modelling parameters in Piringer model should be established and the effect of food on migration should be high interest in future work.",Children's metabolic expenditure during object projection skill performance: New insight for activity intensity relativity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900951,Journal of sports sciences,2019 05 20,To examine children's energy expenditure (EE) during object projection skill performance at three intensity intervals.,Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and prognostic analysis identifies hub genes and the molecular mechanism related to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900950,Cancer biology & therapy,2019 04 26,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a lethal disease with suboptimal survival outcomes. In this study, we aimed to find an independent prognostic factor of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and investigate its effect on tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration progress and cell cycle phase. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) is an analysis method for mining module information in chip data through soft threshold. In this article, it was used to divide differential genes into different modules and determined the ten hub genes. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) analyses as well as univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to figure out HMGA2 as the independent prognostic factor. RT-qPCR and western blot results revealed the HMGA2 expression levels. Via colony formation, flow cytometry and wound healing assays, we tested the involvement of HMGA2 knockdown in corresponding cancer cell biological behaviors. HMGA2 level was up-regulated in HNSCC tissues and cell lines (SCC-25 and FaDu) in comparison with their normal counterparts. HMGA2 knockdown decreased cancer cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, blocked cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, and inhibited cell migration. We regarded HMGA2 as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target of HNSCC.",Heterocellular Contact Can Dictate Arterial Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900949,Circulation research,2019 06 10,"Resistance arteries and conduit arteries rely on different relative contributions of endothelial-derived hyperpolarization versus nitric oxide to achieve dilatory heterocellular signaling.

Mutations in LMNA have been linked to premature aging disorders, including Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS is caused by progerin, an aberrant form of lamin A that leads to premature death, typically from the complications of atherosclerotic disease. A key characteristic of HGPS is a severe loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the arteries. Various mouse models of HGPS have been created, but few of them feature VSMC depletion and none develops atherosclerosis, the death-causing symptom of the disease in humans. We recently generated a mouse model that recapitulates most features of HGPS, including VSMC loss and accelerated atherosclerosis. Furthermore, by generating cell-type-specific HGPS mouse models, we have demonstrated a central role of VSMC loss in progerin-induced atherosclerosis and premature death.",Evaluation of Rectal Vancomycin Irrigation for Treatment of Clostridioides difficile Infection in Patients Post-Colectomy for Toxic Colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900947,Surgical infections,2019 03 22,"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) accounts for as many as 25% of episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and is the most common cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea.

One consequence is that monoclonal antibody (mAb) leads often lack the necessary affinity for therapeutic applications, thus requiring labor-intensive and time-consuming affinity in vitro engineering optimization steps. Here, we show that high-affinity variants of mouse-derived mAbs can be rapidly obtained by testing of somatic sequence variants obtained by deep sequencing of antibody variable regions in immune repertories from immunized mice, even with a relatively sparse sampling of sequence variants from large sequence datasets. Affinity improvements can be achieved for mAbs with a wide range of affinities. The optimized antibody variants derived from immune repertoire mining have no detectable in vitro off-target binding and have in vivo clearance comparable to the parental mAbs, essential properties in therapeutic antibody leads. As generation of antibody variants in vitro is replaced by mining of variants generated in vivo, the procedure can be applied to rapidly identify affinity-optimized mAb variants.",Species of Contracaecum Parasitizing the Magellanic Penguin Spheniscus magellanicus (Spheniscidae) from the Argentinean Coast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900944,The Journal of parasitology,2019 03 22,"Anisakid nematodes have a worldwide distribution and are associated with fishes, birds, and marine mammals from freshwater, brackish, and marine systems. The aims of this work are to report for the first time Contracaecum mirounga parasitizing the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, to report another Contracaecum species in the same host species, and to discuss the validity of Contracaeceum spheniscus. Several dead chicks, juveniles, and adults of S. magellanicus were collected along the Argentinean coast from 2002 to 2009. Nematodes were removed from digestive tracts and studied using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Nematode prevalences were 2.38% for C. mirounga and 12.5% for Contracaecum sp. Contracaecum mirounga was found in 1 penguin from Península Valdés, Chubut. This species is known as a specific parasite of marine mammals such as Pinnipedia, thereby suggesting that this nematode is not as specific as believed. Another species of Contracaecum sp. was found parasitizing 1 penguin from the Río de la Plata coast. It possessed an unusual interlabial morphology and arrangement of male caudal papillae. Despite the low prevalence, the distinct morphological features are convincing and support the presence of a new Contracaecum species. However, a formal description is not presented because sufficient male specimens are lacking. Finally, C. spheniscus is considered a junior synonym of Contracaecum pelagicum. Future molecular studies might be helpful to determine the real diversity of Contracaecum species parasitizing S. magellanicus considering the number of sibling species recognized among the anisakids.","Genome sequence resource for Stemphylium vesicarium, causing Brown Spot Disease of Pear.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900943,Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,2019 03 22,"Stemphylium vesicarium is the causal agent of several plant diseases as well Brown Spot of Pear (BSP), which is one of the most economically important fungal diseases in European pear-production areas.

Here, we report the first genome of a S. vesicarium strain, the 173-1a13FI1M3, isolated from pear and sensitive to the mostly used fungicide classes currently authorized in Europe against BSP. The availability of this draft genome could represent a first important step in understanding the physiology and the infection mechanism of the pathogen. Furthermore, this contribution could be fundamental in order to design more effective and sustainable strategies to control the disease."

Purpose:
 In young adult cancer survivors (YACSs) to explore the rate of being nonemployed and having low work ability, and to identify factors associated with these two outcomes. 
Methods:
 All Norwegian YACSs (N = 3558) diagnosed at ages 19-39 years and treated between 1985 and 2009 for breast or colorectal cancer, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or melanoma, and alive in 2015, were mailed a questionnaire. The response rate was 42%. For treatment, a minimal surgery-only group (N = 198) was defined as reference group, and 1000 YACSs represented the local, systemic, and systemic plus other treatment groups. Work status was compared with normative data. 
Results:
 The sample included 63% females. Median age at survey was 49 years (range 27-65), and median time since first cancer diagnosis was 16 years (range 6-31). At survey, 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22-27) of YACSs were nonemployed, and 38% (95% CI: 35-41) reported low work ability. The rate of being nonemployed was similar to normative data. More female YACSs held disability pension compared with normative data. In multivariable analyses, an increasing number of adverse effects (AEs), cardiovascular diseases, lower basic education, reduced level of self-rated health, and increased level of depression were significantly associated with both being nonemployed and having low work ability. 
Conclusions:
 In YACSs surveyed at median 49 years of age, 25% were nonemployed and 38% had low current work ability. An increased mean number of long-term AEs and several other health-related factors were significantly associated with both these outcomes. Health care providers responsible for YACSs should be attentive to such factors and work ability.",A New Generalized Partition Crossover for the Traveling Salesman Problem: Tunneling Between Local Optima.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900928,Evolutionary computation,2019 03 22,"Generalized Partition Crossover (GPX) is a deterministic recombination operator developed for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

However, as the network architectures become deeper and more complex, designing CNN architectures requires more expert knowledge and trial and error. In this article, we attempt to automatically construct high-performing CNN architectures for a given task. Our method uses Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) to encode the CNN architectures, adopting highly functional modules such as a convolutional block and tensor concatenation, as the node functions in CGP. The CNN structure and connectivity, represented by the CGP, are optimized to maximize accuracy using the evolutionary algorithm. We also introduce simple techniques to accelerate the architecture search: rich initialization and early network training termination. We evaluated our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art models. Remarkably, our method can find competitive architectures with a reasonable computational cost compared to other automatic design methods that require considerably more computational time and machine resources.","Nutritional Status of Patients with Cancer: A Prospective Cohort Study of 1,588 Hospitalized Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900926,Nutrition and cancer,2019 04 09,We aimed to assess the nutritional status of cancer patients according to site or treatment type.,A Systematic Review of Professionals' Experiences of Discussing Fertility Issues with Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900925,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,2019 03 22,"Impaired fertility is one potential late effect of cancer, with 15% of adolescents and young adults with cancer (AYAC) at a high risk. Guidelines state that fertility advice should be available at diagnosis; however, research shows that this is not routinely provided. This can negatively affect patients' emotional well-being, mental health, and satisfaction with care. This review aimed to synthesize and critically evaluate studies investigating professionals' experiences of discussing fertility issues with AYAC patients and to understand the barriers and facilitating factors to having these conversations with this specific age group. Peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies were identified by systematically searching eight databases. Fifteen articles reporting from 14 studies were included in the review. Participants reported patient, parent, professional, and institutional factors that influenced fertility discussions. The most commonly reported barriers were the lack of patient educational materials and staff training. Participants were more likely to discuss fertility with patients who were male; had less severe disease; and raised the issue of fertility themselves. The findings suggest that professionals' own values and opinions influence the likelihood of fertility being discussed, with implications for guidance and training. Further, institutional barriers lead to a lack of consistent provision for patients both nationally and internationally. A paucity of research looking solely at AYA populations was noted. A need for research comparing the experiences of different professional groups and exploring the extent to which reported barriers impact on fertility discussions was highlighted. There is also a need for higher-quality qualitative research adopting stronger methodology.","Humanitarianism from Below: Sowa Rigpa, the Traditional Pharmaceutical Industry, and Global Health.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900923,Medical anthropology,2019 03 26,"In this article I explore, for the first time, the relationship between Sowa Rigpa (Tibetan medicine) and global health, tracing ""the global"" in ethical discourses and pharmaceutical innovation practices of Tibetan medical practitioners.

Along with HCV cure, benefits are recognized in terms of regression of liver fibrosis and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, beyond hepatic outcomes, several extrahepatic benefits may result from sustained HCV eradication, including improvements in the neurocognitive function and reduced cardiovascular disease risk. Finally, there is no doubt that the individual success of direct-acting antivirals is largely contributing to halt HCV transmission globally, in the absence of an effective HCV prophylactic vaccine."

Here, we present a new method for automated and quantitative stable isotope sampling of GEM (ISO-GEM) at the outlet of a commercial Hg analyzer. A programmable multivalve manifold selects Hg at the analyzer inlet and outlet based on specific criteria (location, time, GEM concentration, auxiliary threshold). Outlet Hg recovery was tested for gold traps, oxidizing acidic solution traps, and activated carbon traps. We illustrate the ISO-GEM method in an exploratory study on the effect of building walls on local GEM. We find that GEM concentrations directly at the building surface (wall inlet) are significantly enhanced (mean 3.8 ± 1.8 ng/m3) compared to 3 m from the building wall (free inlet) (mean 1.5 ± 0.4 ng/m3). GEM δ202Hg (-1.26‰ ± 0.41‰, 1 SD, n = 16) and Δ199Hg (-0.05‰ ± 0.10‰, 1 SD, n = 16) at the wall inlet were different from ambient GEM δ202Hg (0.76‰ ± 0.09‰, 1 SD, n = 16) and Δ199Hg (-0.21‰ ± 0.05‰, 1 SD, n = 16) at the free inlet. The isotopic fingerprint of GEM at the wall inlet suggests that GEM emission from the aluminum building surface affected local GEM concentration measurements. These results illustrate the versatility of the automated Hg isotope sampling.","Bonding, Reactivity, and Dynamics in Confined Systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900895,The journal of physical chemistry.

Quantization is a direct consequence of confinement. Confinement modifies the electronic energy levels, orbitals, electronic shell filling, etc. of a system, thereby affecting its reactivity as well as various response properties as compared to the cases of corresponding unconfined systems. Confinement may force two rare gas atoms to form a partly covalent bond. Gas storage is facilitated through confinement and unprecedented optoelectronic properties are observed in certain cases. Some slow reactions get highly accelerated in an appropriate confined environment.

A,2019 04 24,"Proposing and testing mechanistic hypotheses stands as one of the key applications of contemporary computational chemistry. In the majority of computational mechanistic analyses, the individual elementary steps leading from reactants to products are proposed by the user, based on learned chemical knowledge, intuition, or comparison to an existing well-characterized mechanism for a closely related chemical reaction. However, the prerequisite of prior chemical knowledge is a barrier to automated (or ""black box"") mechanistic generation and assessment, and it may simultaneously preclude mechanistic proposals that lie outside the ""standard"" chemical reaction set. In this Article, we propose a simple random-walk algorithm that searches for the set of elementary chemical reactions that transform defined reactant structures into target products. Our approach operates exclusively in the space of molecular connectivity matrices, seeking the set of chemically sensible bonding changes that link connectivity matrices for input reactant and product structures. We subsequently illustrate how atomic coordinates for each elementary reaction can be generated under the action of a graph-restraining potential, prior to further analysis by quantum chemical calculations.

High values of goodness-of-fit indices (GFIs) were obtained using the double-first-order in parallel (DFOP) model and the single-first-order (SFO) model to fit the degradation kinetics of LNG and QUN in soils, respectively. The end-points (DT50 and DT90) of LNG and QUN were positively correlated with soil total organic carbon (TOC). Soil water content and temperature were observed to be critical factors in degradation of LNG and QUN. The degradation rates of LNG and QUN were very slow under sterile and flooded conditions, indicating that the aerobic microbial degradation was dominant in the degradation of LNG and QUN. Moreover, major transformation products were identified, and biodegradation pathways of LNG and QUN were proposed.

A,2019 05 03,"Global and target analysis techniques are ubiquitous tools for interpreting transient absorption (TA) spectra. However, characterizing uncertainty in the kinetic parameters and component spectra derived from these fitting procedures can be challenging. Furthermore, fitting TA spectra of inorganic nanomaterials where the component spectra of different excited states are nearly or completely overlapped is particularly problematic. Here, we present a target analysis model for extracting excited-state spectra and dynamics from TA data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to visualize and understand uncertainty in the model fits. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by extracting the overlapping component spectra and dynamics of single- and biexciton states in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Significantly, refinement of the component spectra is accomplished by fitting the entire fluence-dependent series of ensemble TA data using the Poisson statistics of photon absorption, providing multiple checks for internal consistency. The MCMC method itself is highly general and can be applied to any data set or model framework to accurately characterize uncertainty in the fit and aid model selection when choosing between different models."

Stress biomarker (hormones and neurotransmitters) concentrations in bodily fluids (blood, sweat, urine, saliva) predict the physical and mental state of the individual. The stress biomarkers primarily focused on in this manuscript are cortisol, serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and neuropeptide Y. UV spectroscopy of stress biomarkers performed in the 190-400 nm range has revealed primary and secondary absorption peaks at near-UV wavelengths depending on their molecular structure. UV characterization of individual and multiple biomarkers is reported in various biofluids. A microfluidic/optoelectronic platform for biomarker detection is reported, with a prime focus toward cortisol evaluation. The current limit of detection of cortisol in sweat is ∼200 ng/mL (∼0.5 μM), which is in the normal (healthy) range. Plasma samples containing both serotonin and cortisol resulted in readily detectable absorption peaks at 203 (serotonin) and 247 (cortisol) nm, confirming feasibility of simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in biofluid samples. UV spectroscopy performed on various stress biomarkers shows a similar increasing absorption trend with concentration. The detection mechanism is label free, applicable to a variety of biomarker types, and able to detect multiple biomarkers simultaneously in various biofluids. A microfluidic flow cell has been fabricated on a polymer substrate to enable point-of-use/care UV measurement of target biomarkers. The overall sensor combines sample dispensing and fluid transport to the detection location with optical absorption measurements with a UV light emitting diode (LED) and photodiode. The biomarker concentration is indicated as a function of photocurrent generated at the target wavelength.",Ultrasound Facilitates Naturally Equipped Exosomes Derived from Macrophages and Blood Serum for Orthotopic Glioma Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900870,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 24,"Exosomes (Exos) are endogenous nanocarriers that have utility as novel delivery systems for the treatment of brain cancers. However, in general, natural Exos show limited BBB-crossing capacity and lack specific targeting. Further modifications including targeting peptides and genetic engineering approaches can circumvent these issues, but the process is time-consuming. Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases due to its noninvasive nature, reversibility, and instantaneous local opening of the BBB. In this study, we developed a natural and safe transportation system using FUS to increase the targeted delivery of Exos for glioma therapy. We also compared the advantages of macrophage-derived Exos (R-Exos) and blood serum-derived Exos (B-Exos) to screen for an improved platform with scope for clinical transformation. In vitro, both R-Exos and B-Exos were transported through BBB models and accumulated in glioma cells with the assistance of ultrasound exposure. R-Exos and B-Exos displayed no obvious differences in physical characteristics, drug release, tumor targeting, and cytotoxicity when combined with FUS. In vivo animal imaging studies suggested that the fluorescence intensity of B-Exos plus single FUS in brains was 4.45-fold higher than that of B-Exos alone. Furthermore, B-Exos plus twice FUS treatment efficiently suppressed glioma growth with no obvious side effects. We therefore demonstrate that the combination of FUS and naturally abundant B-Exos is a potent strategy for brain cancer therapeutics.",Aptamer-Based Sandwich Assay for Measurement of Thymidine Kinase 1 in Serum of Cancerous Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900869,Biochemistry,2019 05 07,"Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) is traditionally a serum biomarker that is elevated in the early stages of malignancies. The diagnostic and prognostic role of TK1 for screening and monitoring human malignancies has recently been investigated. Anti-human TK1 aptamers were selected through 12 iterative rounds of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment from a DNA library. The aptamer pool of round 12 was amplified, and the polymerase chain reaction product was cloned on the TA vector. Of the 85 colonies obtained, 52 were identified as positive clones. These aptamers were screened for TK1 with surface plasmon resonance, where apta37 and apta69 showed the highest affinity for TK1. The TK1_apta37 and TK1_apta69 aptamers were used in a sandwich assay platform and successfully detected TK1 in the concentration range of 54-3500 pg mL-1. Clinical samples from 60 cancerous patients were also tested with this assay system and compared using the conventional antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The aptamer sandwich assay demonstrated a dynamic range for TK1 at clinically relevant serum levels, covering subpicogram per milliliter concentrations. The new approach offers a simple and robust method for detecting serum biomarkers that have low and moderate abundance. The results of this study demonstrate the screening capability of the aptamer sandwich assay platform and its potential applicability to the point-of-care testing system.",Controlling Preanalytical Process in High-Coverage Quantitative Metabolomics: Spot-Sample Collection for Mouse Urine and Fecal Metabolome Profiling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900868,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 16,"Compared to conventional MS and NMR techniques, high-performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS provides accurate relative quantification of many more metabolites in biological samples. However, to apply this technique for urine and fecal metabolomics studies of animal models, the entire workflow, including the preanalytical process, needs to be strictly controlled to avoid or minimize quantitative errors. In this study, we report our investigation of the effects of mouse urine and fecal sample collection methods on CIL LC-MS metabolome analysis. Metabolic-cage collection and spot-sample collection of urine and feces were compared in a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver disease. 13C-/12C-dansylation LC-MS was used for quantitative profiling of the amine-/phenol-submetabolome changes. A total of 5026, 4963, 4238, and 4600 peak pairs or metabolites were detected from spot urine, spot feces, cage-collected urine, and cage-collected feces, respectively. It was found that samples collected using metabolic cages, widely used in low coverage metabolomics, could be contaminated with food as well as cross-specimen (urine in feces or feces in urine) to the extent that metabolomic comparison of different groups of mice could be seriously compromised in high-coverage metabolomics. In contrast, spot urine and spot feces could be collected without contamination and should be used in CIL LC-MS metabolomics.",Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater by Biofunctionalized Exfoliated MoS2 Quantum Dot Aerogel Electrocatalysts That Is Superior to Pt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900867,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 24,"As a source of clean and sustainable energy, reliable hydrogen production requires highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts. In recent years, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has been demonstrated as a promising electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). Here, we demonstrate that a three-dimensional (3D) MoS2 quantum dot (MoS2QD) aerogel is an efficient cathode electrocatalyst that can be used to enhance the HER in acid, neutral, and alkaline (e.g., real seawater) environments. In studying the effects of the exfoliated MoS2 dimension for the HER, we found that the biofunctionalized exfoliated MoS2QD shows much higher cathodic density, a more lower energy input, and a lower Tafel slope for the HER than the larger size of the chlorophyll-assisted exfoliated MoS2, highlighting the importance of the size of the MoS2 aerogel support for accelerating the HER performance. Moreover, the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2QD-aerogel is superior to that of Pt in neutral conditions. In real seawater, the MoS2QD-aerogel sample exhibits stable HER performance after consecutive scanning for 150 cycles, while the HER activity of the Pt dramatically decreases after 50 cycles. These results showed for the first time how the 3D MoS2 configuration in MoS2 aerogel can be used to effectively produce hydrogen for clean energy applications.",Ratiometric Phosphorescent Silver Sensor: Detection and Quantification of Free Silver Ions within Silver Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900866,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 29,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have well-known antibacterial properties that have stimulated their widespread production and usage, which nonetheless concomitantly raises concerns regarding their release into the environment. Understanding the toxicity of AgNPs to biological systems, the environment, and the role that each silver species (Ag+ ions vs AgNPs) plays in that toxicity has received significant attention. One of the critical objectives of this research is the development of a reliable method that can sense and differentiate free silver ions from AgNPs and is able to characterize silver ions leaching from nanosilver. A number of analytical methods described in the literature that are available for sensing silver ions are costly, time consuming, tedious, and, more importantly, destroy the AgNP sample. To address these issues, a phosphorescent gold(I)-pyrazolate cyclic trinuclear complex (AuT) known to detect free silver ions was employed to detect and differentiate silver ions from AgNPs within an AgNP sample. The advantage of the proposed silver sensor is its ratiometric emission capability that undermines any background interference. The sensor exhibits a strong red emission (λmax = ∼690 nm) that, in the presence of Ag+ ions, will form a bright-green emissive adduct with a blue-shifted peak maximum near 475 nm yet red-shifted excitation peak. The presence of AgNPs did not inhibit the silver detection and quantification ability of the phosphorescent silver sensor. To understand the chemical transformation of nanosilver, the leaching of silver ions from AgNPs over a period of 35 days was monitored and quantified by measuring the I/ Io changes of the sensor. Furthermore, through adduct formation, the AuT molecular system was able to remediate free silver ions from the solution. The stronger affinity of the AuT complex to ""sandwich"" free silver ions than AgNPs was demonstrated in the presence of KCl salt that is well documented to form AgCl in the presence of silver ions. To our knowledge, this is the only ratiometric luminescence-based silver sensor able to successfully differentiate between Ag+ ions and AgNPs, sense the silver leakage from AgNPs, and remediate toxic silver ions from an aqueous solution. The synthesis and characterization of this sensor is a simple, single-step process-anticipating its viability for various applications.",[Determination of 25 preservatives in cosmetics by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900864,Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,2019 03 22,"A method was developed for the simultaneous determination of benzoic acid and its esters, parabens, phenoxyisopropanol, chlorphenesin, dehydroacetic acid, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, methylchloroisothiazolone, methylisothiazolone and other preservatives in cosmetics by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).

Six fingerprint similarity calculation methods that reflect the differences between grades of tea to different extents were employed, and the new improved extent similarity method was demonstrated to be the best among them. The results for the similarity evaluation displayed good correlation with the actual grades, especially for the series of tea of higher qualities, and the differences between the different grades of teas could be quantified.",[Determination of seven monosaccharides in aloe polysaccharide using ion chromatography with pulsed amperometric detector].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900862,Se pu = Chinese journal of chromatography,2019 03 22,"Aloe polysaccharide was extracted by water extraction and ethanol precipitation.

In this study the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of single and multiple doses of generic sofosbuvir were investigated in healthy Chinese subjects. Twelve subjects (6 male and 6 female) were enrolled in this study. The PK parameters of sofosbuvir and its metabolite (GS-331007) in both blood and urine samples were analyzed after dosing by the established liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analytical method. The safety/tolerability assessment consisted of documenting adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory test results. Sofosbuvir was well tolerated. Major PK parameters of the generic formulation of sofosbuvir were similar to those found in previous reports. These data support further clinical evaluation of this generic formulation of sofosbuvir."

Countless studies have proposed methods to infer these interactions from empirical data, yet models parameterised using such data often fail to recover observed coexistence patterns. Here, we propose a method to reconcile empirical parameterisations of community dynamics with species-abundance data, ensuring that the predicted equilibrium is consistent with the observed abundance distribution. To illustrate the approach, we explore two case studies: an experimental freshwater algal community and a long-term time series of displacement in an intertidal community. We demonstrate how our method helps recover observed coexistence patterns, capture the core dynamics of the system, and, in the latter case, predict the impacts of experimental extinctions. Collectively, these results demonstrate an intuitive approach for reconciling observed and empirical data, improving our ability to explore the links between species interactions and coexistence in natural systems.",Sensitization of Human Liver Cells Toward Fas-Mediated Apoptosis by the Metabolically Activated Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Lasiocarpine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900802,Molecular nutrition & food research,2019 04 01,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are common phytotoxins.

Due to their location, riparian zones often share long borders with agricultural fields where herbicides are commonly applied to eliminate unwanted plants. There is a general concern that exposure of riparian vegetation to off-target drifted herbicides may adversely impact their health and diversity. We utilized the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the long-term (between 1992 and 2011) trend of riparian vegetation health at 17 locations in the Midwest and Great Plains areas where herbicide usage was likely most intense. Assessment of NDVI data demonstrated that long-term vegetation health did not decline for the studied riparian zones located in proximity to croplands during spring months (April and May). During summer (June and July), while the long-term vegetation health did not decline for the majority of the sites, there were few cases in Kansas and Nebraska with a decline in vegetation health (negative-trending NDVI). Cluster analysis of the negative-trending NDVI pixels showed that the majority of these pixels were randomly distributed throughout these riparian sites, indicating a lack of shared common causing factors. Similarly, proximity analysis suggested that distance from croplands was not associated with the decline of vegetation health found in these sites, suggesting that exposure to herbicide drift may not be a plausible factor as this would have shown higher impact on pixels closer to the cropland. Changes in canopy coverage and vegetation diversity, also did not show any dependence on distance from croplands. Finally, the remote-sensing-based NDVI datasets used, provide only an indirect way of assessing the impact of herbicide drift, and therefore, further work based on field survey data is recommended to completely isolate the impacts of herbicides.

As one of its mandatory components, stakeholder participation (SP) is designed to contribute to the implementation of EIAs as well as the relevant decision-making with regard to a proposed project. SP ranges from being a token process to being a very effective practice; it has been criticized as ineffective in an authoritarian context. This research investigates the SP process of project environmental impact assessments (EIA) via three case studies. A developed State-Attribution-Motivation- Interaction-Re-engineering (SAMIR) framework is used to identify the causes, results, and substantive changes among three main actors/organizations: citizens, enterprises, and local governments. It demonstrates that the endogenous interactions among three institution pillars-regulative, normative, and cognitive-are the root for institutional change. Initial cognitive actions can lead to regulative and normative social institutional change, thus stimulate the re-engineering of the institutions' system relevant to SP. To facilitate institutional innovation and re-engineering of SP with Chinese characteristics, it is of crucial importance to deeply reform and detail institutional design, to promote the SP governance structural change from a closed model to an open model: Move from government to governance, institutional innovations following the mass line, pay more attention to fairness, rather than focus on efficiency. In addition, disseminate science and promote actors' communication is foothold; benefits and advantages are instruments to overcome the ""not in my backyard"" (NIMBY) impact. And the re-engineering government structural change from administration paradigm to governance paradigm plays a primary role. This article is protected by copyright.

The molecular mechanisms by which perennial mosses interact with these fungal partners along their senescence gradients are unknown, yet this is an ideal system to study variation in gene expression associated with trophic state transitions. We investigated differentially expressed genes of fungal communities and their host Dicranum scoparium across its naturally occurring senescence gradient using a metatranscriptomic approach. Higher activity of fungal nutrient-related (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) transporters and Carbohydrate-Active enZyme (CAZy) genes was detected toward the bottom, partially decomposed, layer of the moss. The most prominent variation in the expression levels of fungal nutrient transporters was from inorganic nitrogen-related transporters, whereas the breakdown of organonitrogens was detected as the most enriched gene ontology term for the host D. scoparium, for those transcripts having higher expression in the partially decomposed layer. The abundance of bacterial rRNA transcripts suggested that more living members of Cyanobacteria are associated with the photosynthetic layer of D. scoparium, while members of Rhizobiales are detected throughout the gametophytes. Plant genes for specific fungal-plant communication, including defense responses, were differentially expressed, suggesting that different genetic pathways are involved in plant-microbe crosstalk in photosynthetic tissues compared to partially decomposed tissues.",The independent association of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile function scores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900792,BJU international,2019 04 19,To evaluate the association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and erectile function.,Arabidopsis seedlings display a remarkable resilience under severe mineral starvation using their metabolic plasticity to remain self-sufficient for weeks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900791,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2019 04 30,"During the life cycle of plants, seedlings are considered vulnerable because they are at the interface between the highly stress tolerant seed embryos and the established plant, and must develop rapidly, often in a challenging environment, with limited access to nutrients and light. Using a simple experimental system, whereby the seedling stage of Arabidopsis is considerably prolonged by nutrient starvation, we analysed the physiology and metabolism of seedlings maintained in such conditions up to 4 weeks. Although development was arrested at the cotyledon stage, there was no sign of senescence and seedlings remained viable for weeks, yielding normal plants after transplantation. Photosynthetic activity compensated for respiratory carbon losses, and energy dissipation by photorespiration and alternative oxidase appeared important. Photosynthates were essentially stored as organic acids, while the pool of free amino acids remained stable. Seedlings lost the capacity to store lipids in cytosolic lipid droplets, but developed large plastoglobuli. Arabidopsis seedlings arrested in their development because of mineral starvation displayed therefore a remarkable resilience, using their metabolic and physiological plasticity to maintain a steady state for weeks, allowing resumption of development when favourable conditions ensue."

Upon PAMP engagement, TLRs activate a signaling cascade that leads to the production of inflammatory mediators. The localization of TLRs, either on the plasma membrane or in the endolysosomal compartment, has been considered to be a fundamental aspect to determine to which ligands the receptors bind, and which transduction pathways are induced. However, new observations have challenged this view by identifying complex trafficking events that occur upon TLR-ligand binding. These findings have highlighted the central role that endocytosis and receptor trafficking play in the regulation of the innate immune response. Here, we review the TLR4 and TLR9 transduction pathways and the importance of their different subcellular localization during the inflammatory response.

Chlorpyrifos affects the survival of some larval decapod crustaceans, but no data exist on the impacts to the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The purpose of the present study was to assess the levels at which chlorpyrifos affects the survival of postlarval H. americanus. Using acute saltwater exposures, the 24- and 48-h median lethal concentrations were established for stage IV H. americanus (1.56 and 1.33 µg/L, respectively). Movement, acetylcholinesterase activity, intermoult period, specific growth rate, and moult increment were measured during exposure to sublethal concentrations. Movement patterns were assessed to establish a 48-h median inhibition concentration for cessation of normal movement (0.66 µg/L). Acetylcholinesterase activity was found to be inhibited immediately post-exposure to 0.50, 0.57, and 0.82 µg/L chlorpyrifos but could be recovered within a period (9-15 d) in clean seawater. Sublethal growth effects of increased intermoult period, decreased specific growth rate, and decreased moult increment were observed during exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration (0.82 µg/L). The present study suggests that H. americanus stage IV larvae were marginally less sensitive to chlorpyrifos compared with other decapods and that acute lethality of H. americanus postlarvae is not likely to occur with chlorpyrifos concentrations previously reported from aquatic environments.

However, in natural aquatic environments, it is very rapidly degraded, with a DT50 (half-life) typically in hours, reducing exposure of aquatic organisms and the potential for effects. In standard regulatory studies looking at the chronic toxicity of chlorothalonil to fathead minnow, the most sensitive endpoint was fecundity. A standard fish full-life-cycle study, where chlorothalonil concentrations were maintained constant throughout, resulted in a No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) of 1.4 µg/L. Comparing peak modelled exposure concentrations to this NOEC can result in the chronic risk to fish being considered unacceptable. This current study investigated the effect on fecundity in fathead minnow using a fish short-term reproduction assay. Five different exposure profiles were employed with time varying concentrations based on realistic worst-case modelled environmental exposure profiles, multiplied by an assessment factor of 10, which resulted in maximum measured concentrations up to 15.5 µg/L. There were no effects on fecundity from any of the exposure profiles tested. Therefore, based on these more realistic exposure profiles, the chronic risk to fish could be considered acceptable, if these exposures were deemed to be representative worse-case.

Ninety-eight young adults (range: 21-60 years; median: 49 years) with CK/MK AML were studied. They received standard induction, consolidation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from siblings or matched unrelated donors if available. Chromosomal abnormalities most commonly affected chromosome 5 (30%), 7 (22%) and 17 (21%). Next generation sequencing of a 54-myeloid gene panel were available in 76 patients.

Consequently, assessments of the risk of contaminants to marine biota in polar environments typically include extrapolations from temperate and/or tropical species. This is problematic because the taxonomic composition of organisms differs between polar and temperate/tropical waters, and both the toxicity of chemicals and the physiology of organisms are very different at the stable low temperatures experienced in polar marine systems. Collecting high-quality sensitivity data for a wide range of marine polar organisms using traditional toxicity assessment approaches is a time-consuming and difficult process, especially in remote and hostile environments. We applied a rapid toxicity testing approach, which allowed a much larger number of species to be tested than would be possible with traditional toxicity test methods, albeit with lower replications and fewer exposure concentrations. With this rapid approach, sensitivity estimates are less precise, but more numerous. This is important when constructing species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), which aim to represent the sensitivity of communities. We determined the approximate sensitivity (4- and 10-d median lethal concentration [LC50] values) of a large and representative sample of Antarctic marine invertebrates to copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium (Cd). Up to 88 LC50 values (from 88 different taxa) were used in the construction of SSDs. The hazardous concentrations for 1% of taxa (HC1) based on 10-d LC50 values were 37, 346, and 792 μg/L for Cu, Zn, and Cd, respectively.

Pregnant women (n = 44) were recruited in Geita during antenatal clinic visits, and DBS from capillary blood were collected on filter paper. As a gold-standard comparison, venous blood was sampled from the same participants and compared with the DBS. Venous blood, DBS, and quality control samples were analyzed for chemical elements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Field blanks were very clean for most elements, generally only twice as high as corresponding laboratory filter blanks. No significant differences were found between duplicate DBS samples taken from the same participants, with near perfect intraclass correlation coefficients (0.99) for Cd, Hg, and Pb, indicating excellent reliability. Moreover, correlation was strong (r2 > 0.9) and significant (p < 0.0001) between DBS and the quantitative venous blood, with regression line slopes close to 1.0 (0.847, 0.976, and 0.969 for Cd, Hg, and Pb, respectively), indicating high accuracy of the DBS method compared with the gold-standard approach. The DBS method is minimally invasive and was a feasible, precise, and accurate means of measuring exposure to Cd, Hg, and Pb in pregnant women in a low-resource setting.

A common garden experimental approach using freshwater green macroalgae, the cosmopolitan charophyte species Chara hispida and C. vulgaris, allowed us to test whether the beneficial increases in water temperature (T) and nitrate concentration (N) mitigate negative UVR effects. Also, whether these interactions would be not only species-specific but also according to the origin of the population; therefore, two populations of each species were used: one from a coastal wetland and the other from a mountain lake. Two factorial-design experiments were performed: (i) the presence and absence of UVR × lower and higher T × four populations, and (ii) the presence and absence of UVR × lower and higher N × four populations. Response variables were: growth, morphometry, UVR-protective compounds, photosynthetic pigments, and stoichiometric composition. There were consistent response patterns in the key variables that represent different organization levels. Our main results showed that both warming and, to a lesser extent, the increase in nutrients ameliorated the negative effects of UVR on the molecular processes involved in acclimation to UVR, and that such a mitigating effect depended on the different phenotypic plasticity of each species and each ecotype. The coastal populations, being from a more variable environment, were more resilient than the mountain populations, mainly because of changes in growth and morphology.",Respiratory syncytial virus infection among adults during influenza season: A frequently overlooked diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900745,Journal of medical virology,2019 04 02,"Our objective is to assess the characteristics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in adult patients and to establish differences with influenza viruses. Fifty-four patients diagnosed with RSV and 198 with influenza were prospectively included. Compared with influenza, empirical antimicrobial therapy was more frequent in patients diagnosed with RSV, whereas antibiotic withdrawal at the time of diagnosis confirmation was lower (OR, 0.12; CI, 95% 0.01-0.90; P = 0.040). RSV-positive patients were more likely to need hospital readmission (OR, 3.00; CI, 95% 0.98-9.09; P = 0.053). The role of RSV infection in adults is often overlooked, leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and a probable increase in nosocomial RSV transmission.","Morphological variability, molecular phylogeny, and biological characteristics of the nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900744,Journal of basic microbiology,2019 06 14,"This study aims to investigate the molecular phylogenetic analysis, morphological variability, nematode-capturing ability, and other biological properties of Chinese Duddingtonia flagrans isolates. We isolated 13 isolates of D. flagrans and found features that have never been reported before, such as two to three septa incluing club-shaped conidia. Meanwhile, we conducted molecular phylogenetic analysis of the seven isolates and tested the radical growth of the isolates under different pH values, temperatures, and media. The capturing ability against infective larvae (L3) of Cooperia spp. in yak was detected in vitro. Finally, one isolate was selected for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to investigate the trap formation process. The fungal sequence was obtained and submitted to GenBank (Accession no. KY288614.1, KU881774.1, KP257593.1, KY419119.1, MF488979.1, MF488980.1, and MF488981.1), and the tested isolates were identified as D. flagrans. Except for three isolates, the radial growth of the other isolates on 2% corn meal agar and 2% water agar exhibited faster growth than on other media. The fungus could not grow at 10 and 40°C but grew within 11 to 30°C. Moreover, it did not grow at pH 1-3 and 13-14, but instead at pH 4-12. In the in vitro experimental, L3s were reduced by 94.36%, 88.15%, and 91.04% for SDH035, DH055, and F088, respectively. SEM results showed that at 8 hr post addition of nematodes, some of the latter were captured. In the later stages of the interaction of the fungus with nematodes, a large number of chlamydospores were produced, especially on the predation trap. Results of the present study provided information about the molecular phylogenetic analysis, morphological variability, nematode-capturing ability, and other biological properties of Chinese Arthrobotrys flagrans isolates before administering them for biocontrol.",Biodegradation of fenpropathrin by Rhodopseudomonas sp. strain PSB07-21 cultured under three different growth modes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900743,Journal of basic microbiology,2019 06 14,"This study aimed at the biodegradation of fenpropathrin by Rhodopseudomonas sp. strain PSB07-21 cultured under different growth modes. The biomass production, cell surface hydrophobicity and fenpropathrin biodegradation efficiency of the strain PSB07-21 cultured under the photoheterotrophic growth mode were better than that shown by the strain PSB07-21 cultured under the photoautotrophic or the chemotrophic growth mode. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis using cell-free protein extracts showed several distinct protein bands in the gels representing the strain PSB07-21 cultured under the photoheterotrophic growth mode. The fenpropathrin enzymatic degradation was clearly affected the bacterial growth mode. Results obtained from this study should improve our knowledge regarding fenpropathrin biodegradation under field conditions. Our findings can also be used to optimize the usage of Rhodopseudomonas sp.

The effects of particle concentration, ammonia concentration, organic carbon source and concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration, and pH were investigated on ammonia transformation rate (ammonia removal rate and NO2-  + NO3- accumulation rate) and abundance of particle-attached ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). All these factors significantly influenced ammonia transformation rates. Our results provided direct evidence that microorganisms attached on riverine suspended particles were associated with ammonia oxidation. Sequencing revealed that the AOA genus Nitrososphaera, and the AOB genus Nitrosomonas were the most dominant in particle-attached ammonia-oxidizing microbial communities. Further analysis showed that AOB communities had higher species richness and diversity compared with AOA communities. Additionally, AOB amoA genes were ~10-100 times more abundant than AOA amoA genes, and AOB abundance was more strongly correlated with ammonia transformation rates than AOA abundance in most experiments, indicating that particle-attached AOB were more important than AOA in the hypereutrophic urban river. This study adds to our knowledge of particle-attached microorganism oxidation of ammonia.",Impact of nanoencapsulated natural bioactive phenolic metabolites on chitosan nanoparticles as aflatoxins inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900741,Journal of basic microbiology,2019 06 14,"Aflatoxins are part of fungal secondary metabolites which become serious health, environmental, and economic problems and can cause corruption of many crops and agricultural grains that used as food and feed for human and animal. Aflatoxins mainly produce by Aspergillus spp. especially Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. The present work aimed to study the effect of nanoencapsulation of chitosan (CS) nanoparticles with two phenolic compounds 1-(2-ethyl,6-heptyl)phenol (EHP) extracted from Cuminum cyminum and 5-ethyl-2-(methoxymethyl)phenol (EMMP) extracted from black pepper on growth and aflatoxins production of A. flavus and A. parasiticus. A. flavus growth was completely inhibited by 0.6 mg/ml of EHP and EMMP as well as A. parasiticus which showed the same minimal inhibition concentration with the first compound and 0.8 mg/ml with the second one. CS nanoparticles inhibited the growth of the tested organisms more than CS especially with A. parasiticus and this potency became much better when nanoencapsulated with the two extracted phenolic compounds. In inhibition of aflatoxins production, EHP reduced the production of aflatoxin B1 and B2 of A. flavus by 68.6% and 69.7%, respectively. In the same manner EMMP reduce the production of the two toxins by 87.3% and 82.6%, respectively. The reduction effect of CS nanoparticles is much more than that of CS as it record in most cases about twofold increase. Nanoencapsulation of CS nanoparticles by the extracted phenolic compounds is much more effective with complete inhibition of aflatoxin B1 of both fungi and aflatoxin G1 of A. parasiticus."

Besides epidemiological problems, political conflicts, economic crisis and austerity policies are jeopardizing progress towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), affecting the most vulnerable populations. During the 22nd International Union for Health Promotion and Education (IUHPE) World Conference on Health Promotion held in Curitiba, Brazil, in 2016, challenges and threats for global health, in addition to a wide range of innovative experiences in health promotion, were discussed with participants from 65 countries. At the end of the conference, a public statement was approved claiming for Democracy and Human Rights in all countries around the world as essential conditions for the promotion of health and equity. In this paper, we explore challenges, threats and innovations in global health promotion. We use scientific literature, analysis of the current situation of the Brazilian health system, and material presented during the 22nd IUHPE World Conference. Also, we discuss strategies to strengthen health systems, policies and practices through the approach of STI and illustrative local experiences presented at the congress mentioned above, including examples developed in the city of Curitiba. We conclude that STI is crucial to support strengthening local health systems, design effective intersectoral public policies, scaling up innovative initiates, and skilling staff in addressing the contemporary challenges. Finally, the Declaration of the 22nd World Conference on Health Promotion of the IUHPE is a fundamental policy statement based on the prioritization of democracy and human rights as essential conditions for the promotion of health and equity.",Health and equity in Latin America: utopias and reality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900728,Health promotion international,2019 03 22,"Curitiba's Declaration during the 22nd World Conference on Health Promotion of the IUHPE highlighted equity as a prerequisite for health and as an essential element of health promotion, though not as an isolated aim. Latin America today is facing the loss of civil rights, austerity policies and social inequities, which together are increasing the gap between rich and poor and putting the health sector on alert. As health professionals, it is therefore our responsibility to provide cross-cutting analyses on how inter-sectoral public policies might represent utopias and realities in such a dramatic period of our history. This article not only represents the implementation of brutal neoliberalism policies in Brazil, but also an opportunity to focus on utopias and realities re-emerging from the layers of social and community-based territorial movements. We aim to demonstrate how the attempts of political deconstruction of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) might as well be confronted with strategic perspectives of working from the bottom up, to reorganize the health reform which led to its implementation. We use utopias and realities to illustrate how territorial networks might be used as tools of empowerment, along with constant flow of dialogues with the academic sector. Theoretical contributions of social sciences and critical epidemiology pinpoint that concepts of interculturality and emancipation might help Latin America overcome health inequities, whereas the social reconstruction of democracy occurs as both a reality and utopia within the public sector.",Curitiba Statement on Health Promotion and Equity: voices from people concerned with global inequities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900726,Health promotion international,2019 03 22,"This Statement represents the voice of participants in the 22nd IUHPE World Conference on Health Promotion, held in Curitiba, Brazil, in May 2016. The Brazilian political context at that time greatly influenced the drafting of the Curitiba Statement, which was considered by many participants as an opportunity to categorically express that Brazilian democracy was threatened, as well as the danger of fiscal austerity implemented by many governments of the world. The conference organizers also perceived the launching of this Statement as an opportunity to influence the WHO Shanghai Declaration, since it very strongly stated the influence of commercial interests and corporate practices of the market that are harmful to health. The Curitiba Statement gathers 120 suggestions made by conference participants and focuses on how strengthening health promotion and equity can improve people's lives. The 21 recommendations were summarized and resulted in appeals to International Organizations, all levels of Governments, Health Sector, Citizens, Health Professionals and Researchers. Unlike a declaration from government summit that are restricted by governments negotiations from different ideological spectrum, the Curitiba Statement was developed in a free environment to foster professional activism. We reaffirm that the objectives of Health Promotion in the Sustainable Development will only be fully achieved by incorporating these four fundamental principles: democracy, social justice, social mobilization and equity. Health Promotion in the twenty-first century needs new narratives and inputs from professional associations, which can be more assertive and to influencing the official declarations of government.",The Potential Global Distribution and Voltinism of the Japanese Beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) Under Current and Future Climates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900722,Journal of insect science (Online),2019 05 02,"Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica (Newman), is a severe invasive insect pest of turf, landscapes, and horticultural crops. It has successfully colonized much of the United States and has recently established in mainland Europe. The distribution and voltinism of P. japonica will undoubtedly change as a consequence of climate change, posing additional challenges to the management of this species. To assess these challenges, a process-oriented bioclimatic niche model for P. japonica was developed to examine its potential global distribution under current (1981-2010) and projected climatic conditions (2040-2059) using one emission scenario (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5) and two global climate models, ACCESS1-0 and CNRM-CM5. Under current climatic conditions, the bioclimatic niche model agreed well with all credible distribution data. Model projections indicate a strong possibility of further range expansion throughout mainland Europe under both current and future climates. In North America, projected increases in temperature would enable northward range expansion across Canada while simultaneously shifting southern range limits in the United States. In Europe, the suitable range for P. japonica would increase by 23% by midcentury, especially across portions of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, cumulative growing degree-days increased, thereby reducing the probability of biannual life cycles in northern latitudes where they can occur, including Hokkaido, Japan, northeastern portions of the United States, and southern Ontario, Canada. The results of this study highlight several regions of increasing and emerging risk from P. japonica that should be considered routinely in ongoing biosecurity and pest management surveys.",Orientational distribution of DPH in lipid membranes: a comparison of molecular dynamics calculations and experimental time-resolved anisotropy experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900721,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 04 12,"Characterization of the membrane phases is a crucial task in cell biology. Cells differ in composition of the lipids and consequently in adopted phases. The phases can be discriminated based upon lipid ordering and molecular diffusion and their identification could be used for characterization of cell membranes. Here we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the behavior of the fluorescent reporter molecule diphenylhexatriene (DPH) in different lipid phases - liquid disordered (Ld), liquid ordered (Lo), and solid ordered (So) composed of phosphatidylcholines (Ld and So) or a sphingomyelin/cholesterol (SM/Chol) mixture (Lo). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first simulation of DPH in Lo SM/Chol and So DPPC membranes. For the considered membrane compositions DPH is mostly oriented parallel to lipid tails. In the Lo phase we observed a significant fraction of DPH positioned in between membrane leaflets, which agrees with experimental findings, but which has not been observed in previous MD simulations of DPH in phosphatidylcholine membranes. Further, we calculated rotational autocorrelation functions (ROTACF) from our MD simulations in order to model the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay. We observed that order parameters P2 and P4 are sufficient to fully describe the orientation distribution of DPH. We analyzed the ROTACFs by a so-called general model for the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy [W. van der Meer et al., Biophys. J., 1984, 46, 515] and observed an overestimation of P4. We suggest a rescaling of the recovered P4 yielding an orientation distribution of DPH close to the one observed in our MD simulations.",Synthesis and thermal characterization of novel phase change materials (PCMs) of the Se-Te-Sn-Ge (STSG) multi-component system: calorimetric studies of the glass/crystal phase transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900720,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 05,"According to recent literature, germanium-containing chalcogenide glasses (ChGs) show improvement in thermal stability and glass-forming ability because of the self-organization of the glass network towards a more rigid structure. The Ge-containing ChGs play a potential role as PCMs in phase-change optical memory (PCOM) applications. This endeavor reports the synthesis of some novel PCMs with Ge as the chemical modifier to improve the kinetic parameters of glass/crystal phase transition. The compositional variation of the various kinetic parameters in the present STSG chalcogen-rich non-oxide glasses Se78-yGeyTe20Sn2 (0 ≤ y ≤ 6) has been studied by means of the state-of-the-art differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) technique in the non-isothermal mode. The thermally assisted glass transition and crystallization phenomena have been investigated by examining the variation in various kinetic parameters like the characteristic kinetic temperatures (glass transition temperature Tg, on-set crystallization temperature To and peak crystallization temperature Tc), the activation energies involved in both phenomena, the thermal stability factor S and the glass-forming ability (GFA). The thermal stability factor S and GFA increase appreciably at higher concentrations of Ge as a signature of stiffness transition followed by the self-organization of the corner-sharing and the edge-sharing arrangements of the GeSe4 phase.",A self-assembled DNA-nanoparticle with a targeting peptide for hypoxia-inducible gene therapy of ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900719,Biomaterials science,2019 04 24,"A self-assembled nanoparticle composed of hypoxia-specific anti-RAGE peptide (HSAP), heme oxygenase-1 plasmid (pHO1), and deoxycholate-conjugated polyethylenimine-2k (DP2k) was developed for ischemic stroke therapy. RAGE is over-expressed and induces inflammation in the ischemic brain. To inhibit RAGE-mediated signal transduction, HSAP was produced by recombinant DNA technology, based on the RAGE-binding domain of high mobility group box-1. Because of the specific binding to RAGE, the nanoparticle with HSAP (HSAP-NP) may have dual roles as a cytoprotective reagent and a specific ligand to RAGE for receptor-mediated transfection. As a cytoprotective reagent, the HSAP-NP reduced RAGE expression on the surface of the brain cells by inhibiting the positive feedback of RAGE-mediated signal transduction. As a result, inflammation, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species were decreased in hypoxic cells. As a gene carrier, HSAP-NP showed a higher transfection efficiency than polyethylenimine-25k, DP2k, and Lipofectamine. Particularly, HSAP-NP enhanced gene delivery to hypoxic cells. In the stroke animal models, HSAP-NP reduced the levels of RAGE, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and inflammation. Additionally, HSAP-NP with pHO1 (HSAP-NP/pHO1) increased HO1 expression in the ischemic brain. Gene expression was higher in hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)-positive cells than in HIF-1α-negative cells, suggesting that HSAP-NP delivered the genes to ischemic tissues more efficiently. Cell death and infarct volume in the stroke models were significantly decreased by HSAP-NP/pHO1 compared with HSAP alone or the DP2k/pHO1 complex. Therefore, HSAP-NP may be a useful gene and peptide therapy system for stroke therapy with dual functions of hypoxia-specific gene delivery and cytoprotective effects.",Supramolecular strategy for smart windows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900718,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 06,"Smart windows are a promising solution to improve energy-saving efficiency and indoor comfort due to their potential functionalities including solar modulation, coloration, self-cleaning, self-power, and moisture scavenging.

Herein, photothermal-triggered NO nanogenerators NO-Hb@siRNA@PLGA-PEG (NHsPP) were constructed by assembling photothermal-agents and NO molecules within nanoparticles. In the NHsPP nanoparticles the hemoglobin (Hb) nanoparticles can act as a NO carrier which can absorb near-infrared light at 650 nm (0.5 W cm-2) and convert it into heat to trigger the release of NO. Moreover, after loading Notch1-siRNA, precise treatment can be achieved. Furthermore, using the synergistic effect of photothermal therapy, the NHsPP nanoparticles achieved simultaneous treatment with NO, siRNA and PTT. Through this combination therapy, the therapeutic effect of the NHsPP nanoparticles was significantly enhanced compared to the treatment groups using only NO, siRNA or PTT. This combination therapy inhibits the inflammatory response effectively by reducing the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the macrophage response. Subsequently, guided by dual-modal imaging, the NHsPP nanoparticles can not only accumulate effectively in OA mice, but can also reduce the inflammatory response and efficiently prevent cartilage erosion, without causing toxic side effects in the major organs. Therefore, this novel photothermal nanoparticle-based NO-releasing system is expected to be a potential alternative for clinical inflammatory disease therapy and may provide image guidance when combined with other nanotherapy systems.",Animal study of the anti-diarrhea effect and microbial diversity of dark tea produced by the Yao population of Guangxi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900716,Food & function,2019 04 17,"Chinese dark teas (CDTs) are a special type of tea traditionally consumed by ethnic minorities around the border regions of China. Dark tea produced by the Yao population of Guangxi could help prevent diarrhea following the heavy consumption of food. However, the underlying mechanisms behind this effect are not clear. This study aimed to investigate the function and underlying mechanisms of dark tea by examining the effects of different doses of dark tea on diarrhea in mice caused by Folium Sennae. It was found that dark tea could significantly improve the rate of loose stools and diarrhea index, and had an inhibitory effect on intestine peristalsis in high- and moderate-dose groups. Compared with green tea, significantly decreased levels of water extract, tea polyphenol and amino acid were found in dark tea, whereas the content of both caffeine and gallocatechin was increased. The result of dilution plating showed that Aspergillus niger and Byssochlamys fulva were consistent with microbial diversity as assessed by high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 12 metabolites related to an anti-diarrhea effect were identified by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). These findings provide a physiological basis for developing dark tea produced by the Yao population of Guangxi as a drink that can regulate and improve the intestinal flora in humans."

Different from the previously reported work that involved the oxidation of Ag and deposition of Pd at random sites on the surface for the generation of Ag-Pd hollow nanocrystals, we demonstrate that the Cl- ions from CTAC can confine the oxidation of Ag atoms to the side faces of a nanocube while the resultant Pd atoms are deposited on the edges in an orthogonal manner. By controlling the amount of the Pd(ii) precursor involved in a synthesis, we can transform Ag nanocubes into Ag-Pd nanocrystals with different degrees of concaveness for the side faces and controllable Pd contents. We characterize the outermost layer of concave surfaces for the as-obtained Ag-Pd nanocrystals by surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) through the use of an isocyanide probe. This facile approach would enable the fabrication of Ag-based concave nanocrystals for applications in plasmonics and catalysis.",Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer in a bioactive flavonoid provides fluorescence observables for recognizing its engagement with target proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900698,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,2019 03 22,"A benzothiophene-substituted chromenone with promising activity against Leishmania and Trypanosoma species exhibits peculiar fluorescence properties useful for identifying its complexes with target proteins in the microorganism proteomes. The emission spectra, anisotropy and time profiles of this flavonoid strongly change when moving from the free to the protein-bound forms. The same two types of emission are observed in organic solvents and their mixtures with water, with the relative band intensities depending on the solvent ability to establish hydrogen bonds with the solute. The regular emission prevails in protic solvents, while in aprotic solvents the anomalously red-shifted emission occurs from a zwitterionic tautomeric form, produced in the excited state by proton transfer within the intramolecularly H-bonded form. This interpretation finds support from an experimental and theoretical investigation of the conformational preferences of this compound in the ground and lowest excited state, with a focus on the relative twisting about the chromenone-benzothiophene interconnecting bond. An analysis of the absorption and emission spectra and of the photophysical properties of the two emitting tautomers highlights the relevance of the local microenvironment, particularly of the intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds in which this bioactive compound is involved, in determining both its steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence behaviour.","The mediating role of self-efficacy in the relationship between workplace bullying, mental health and an intention to leave among nurses in Taiwan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900697,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,2019 05 21,"The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between workplace bullying, mental health and an intention to leave among nurses, and the mediating role of self-efficacy.",Factors determining the effectiveness of conservative treatment in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900696,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,2019 05 21,The study aims to assess selected factors contributing to the long-term effects of the conservative treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

This study aimed to investigate the proteomic profiles of the glomerulus in the NZB/W F1 hybrid mouse model of mild and severe lupus nephritis using two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). MATERIAL AND METHODS Female NZB/WF1 mice (n=60) at 28 weeks of age were divided into the mild proteinuria group (+1), the moderate proteinuria group (+2), and the severe proteinuria group (+3) using paper strip urine testing, and then later divided into a mild (≤1+) and severe (≥3+) proteinuria group to allow comparison of upregulation and down-regulation of proteins between the two groups. Renal glomeruli were isolated following renal perfusion with magnetic beads. Protein expression was determined by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, 2D-DIGE, and MALDI-TOF-MS. RESULTS A total of 56 differentially expressed proteins were identified from 133 protein spots, of which 18 were upregulated and 23 were down-regulated between groups 1 and 2. Expression of the proteins Ras-related GTP-binding protein B (RRAGB), serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (SMG1), angiopoietin 2 (ANGP2), methylmalonate semialdehyde (MMSA), and ATP beta chain (ATPB) were identified by Western blot and SMG1, ANGP2, and MMSA were identified by immunohistochemistry.

We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to examine the association between out-of-pocket costs and nonadherence. Results indicated that patients filled the equivalent of 13 monthly prescriptions and paid $76 out of pocket over the calendar year; the likelihood of nonadherence increased as out-of-pocket costs increased (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.04 to 1.78; P < .001).

Once secreted, lipoproteins are quickly acylated, anchoring them into the plasma membrane. Recent work has shown that Gram-positive bacteria are able to generate considerable diversity in the acylation of their lipoproteins, though the mechanisms involved are only just beginning to emerge. In Gram-negative organisms, most lipoproteins are subsequently trafficked to the outer membrane (OM). Lipoprotein trafficking is an essential pathway in these bacteria. At least one OM lipoprotein component is required by each of the essential machines that assemble the OM (such as the Bam and Lpt machines) and build the peptidoglycan cell wall (Lpo-penicillin-binding protein complexes). The Lol pathway has been the paradigm for OM lipoprotein trafficking: a complex of LolCDE extracts lipoproteins from the plasma membrane, LolA shuttles them through the periplasmic space, and LolB anchors them into the OM. The peptide signals responsible for OM-targeting via LolCDE have long been known for Escherichia coli. Remarkably, production of novel lipoprotein acyl forms in E. coli has reinforced the idea that lipid signals also contribute to OM targeting via LolCDE. Moreover, recent work has shown that lipoprotein trafficking can occur in E. coli without either LolA or LolB. Therefore, current evidence suggests that at least one additional, LolAB-independent route for OM lipoprotein trafficking exists. This chapter reviews the posttranslocation modifications of all lipoproteins, with a focus on the trafficking of lipoproteins to the OM of Gram-negative bacteria.",Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900541,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 29,"Invasive disease due to group B Streptococcus infection (Streptococcus agalactiae) results in a wide spectrum of clinical disease. In North America, serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, and V are most frequently associated with invasive disease. Group B Streptococcus remains a continuing source of morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations, including pregnant women, neonates, and the elderly; an increasing incidence of invasive disease has been observed in nonpregnant adults. Group B Streptococcus remains the most common culture-confirmed neonatal bacterial infection in the United States and is a significant source of neonatal morbidity globally. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal disease without a notable impact on the incidence of late-onset neonatal disease. Penicillin G remains the mainstay of therapy, although reduced penicillin susceptibility has been observed in select isolates. Increased frequency of resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics, including clindamycin, erythromycin, and fluoroquinolones, has been observed, with some isolates demonstrating resistance to vancomycin.

Biological sciences,2019 04 16,"Information about predators can mean the difference between life and death, but prey face the challenge of integrating personal information about predators with social information from the alarm calls of others. This challenge might even affect the structure of interspecific information networks: species vary in response to alarm calls, potentially because different foraging ecologies constrain the acquisition of personal information. However, the hypothesis that constrained personal information explains a greater response to alarm calls has not been experimentally tested. We used a within-species test to compare the antipredator responses of New Holland honeyeaters, Phylidonyris novaehollandiae, during contrasting foraging behaviour. Compared with perched birds, which hawk for insects and have a broad view, those foraging on flowers were slower to spot gliding model predators, showing that foraging behaviour can affect predator detection. Furthermore, nectar-foraging birds were more likely to flee to alarm call playbacks. Birds also assessed social information relevance: more distant calls, and those from another species, prompted fewer flights and slower reaction times. Overall, birds made flexible decisions about danger by integrating personal and social information, while weighing information relevance. These findings support the idea that a strategic balance of personal and social information could affect community function.",Network modularity influences plant reproduction in a mosaic tropical agroecosystem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900537,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 04 16,"Biodiversity influences ecosystem function, but there is limited understanding of the mechanisms that support this relationship across different land use types in mosaic agroecosystems. Network approaches can help to understand how community structure influences ecosystem function across landscapes; however, in ecology, network analyses have largely focused on species-species interactions. Here, we use bipartite network analysis in a novel way: to link pollinator communities to sites in a tropical agricultural landscape. We used sentinel plants of Brassica rapa to examine how the structure of the community network influences plant reproduction. Diptera was the most common order of flower visitors at every site. Syrphidae visits were the strongest contributor to the number of fertilized pods, while visits by Syrphidae, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera had the strongest effect on the number of seeds per pod. Sentinel pots at forest sites were visited by more unique species (i.e. species with higher d') than sites in other land uses, and dairy sites had more visitors that were common across the network. Participation coefficients, which indicate how connected a single node is across network modules, were strong predictors of ecosystem function: plant reproduction increased at sites with higher participation coefficients. Flower visitor taxa with higher participation coefficients also had the strongest effect on plant reproduction. Hymenoptera visits were the best predictor for participation coefficients but an Allograpta sp. (Diptera: Syrphidae) was the most influential flower visitor species in the landscape network. A diverse insect community contributed to plant reproduction and connection among nodes in this system. Identifying the 'keystone' flower visitor species and sites that have a strong influence on network structure is a significant step forward to inform conservation priorities and decision-making in diverse agroecosystems."

Methods In total, 220 patients with stroke were recruited to complete the scale. The reliability of the SSCI was evaluated using internal consistency and test-retest methods. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify domains of the SSCI. Convergent validity was determined by analyzing the correlation between SSCI scores, activities of daily living (ADL) and depression. Results Construct validity was determined by factor analysis, extracting three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1, explaining 30.5%, 25.7%, and 8.5% of the variance, respectively, and accounting for 64.8% of the variance. All items had factor loadings above 0.40. The first factor comprised questions related to 'self-stigma' (items 1-13). The second (items 14-22) and third (items 23-24) factors aggregated questions related to 'enacted stigma'. In terms of convergent validity, the SSCI total scale was moderately correlated to the Barthel Index (BI) and the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). Cronbach's alpha value (internal reliability) for the total SSCI score was 0.949, and the intraclass correlation coefficient value (test-retest reliability) was 0.802.

Although past research has explored the risk factors for sexual violence, few studies have considered multileveled factors associated with sexual violence. This study uses the ecological model to investigate the risk factors for sexual violence among college students in dating relationships. Domains of individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels were examined for their associations with sexual victimization. A prevalidated survey was conducted among 361 undergraduates in dating relationships from a public university in the south central United States. Chi-square tests and negative binomial regression analysis were conducted. Approximately 35% of the college students reported experiencing some form of sexual violence perpetrated by their dating partner including attempted and completed rapes. College women reported having experienced significantly higher rates of sexual violence in comparison with college men. On the contrary, this study documents the significant higher prevalence of sexual violence among heterosexual students than among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer college students for experiencing at least one type of sexual violence or unwanted sexual contacts in a dating relationship. Sexual victimization is associated with gender, sexual assertiveness, the frequency of hookups, peer deviance, parental involvement, and perceived discrimination. Participants' gender, frequent hookups, and lower sexual assertiveness are positively associated with risk of sexual victimization across all types of sexual violence. Multilevel prevention programs and strategies are needed on campuses to reduce sexual victimization among college students in dating relationships.",Common Audiological Functional Parameters (CAFPAs): statistical and compact representation of rehabilitative audiological classification based on expert knowledge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900518,International journal of audiology,2019 03 22,"As a step towards objectifying audiological rehabilitation and providing comparability between different test batteries and clinics, the Common Audiological Functional Parameters (CAFPAs) were introduced as a common and abstract representation of audiological knowledge obtained from diagnostic tests.",Successful role of adjuvant radiotherapy in a rare case of tracheal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900517,Tumori,2019 03 22,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare benign cancer that can express a more aggressive phenotype related to the genetic mutation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase receptor (ALK).

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying this process have not been elucidated. Here, we investigate the possible role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the D-serine-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor function and the induction of neuropathic pain in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. Intrathecal administration of the serine racemase inhibitor, L-serine O-sulfate potassium salt (LSOS) or the D-serine degrading enzyme, D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) on post-operative days 0-3 significantly reduced the CCI-induced increase in nitric oxide (NO) levels and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase staining in lumbar dorsal horn neurons, as well as the CCI-induced decrease in phosphorylation (Ser847) of nNOS (pnNOS) on day 3 post-CCI surgery. LSOS or DAAO administration suppressed the CCI-induced development of mechanical allodynia and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent (Ser896) phosphorylation of GluN1 on day 3 post-surgery, which were reversed by the co-administration of the NO donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1). In naïve mice, exogenous D-serine increased NO levels via decreases in pnNOS. D-serine-induced increases in mechanical hypersensitivity, NO levels, PKC-dependent pGluN1, and NMDA-induced spontaneous nociception were reduced by pretreatment with the nNOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole or with the NMDA receptor antagonists, 7-chlorokynurenic acid and MK-801. Collectively, we show that spinal D-serine modulates nNOS activity and concomitant NO production leading to increases in PKC-dependent pGluN1 and ultimately contributing to the induction of mechanical allodynia following peripheral nerve injury.",Risk of herpes zoster with IL-17 inhibitor therapy for psoriasis and other inflammatory conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900514,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 04 02,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that has been associated with a significantly higher risk of herpes zoster (HZ).

The leading challenge in their structural and functional characterization has been the need for a lipid environment to accommodate their hydrophobic cores. Here, we report an antibody scaffold mimetic (ASM) platform where we have recapitulated the extracellular functional domains of the GPCR, C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on a soluble antibody framework. The engineered ASM molecule can accommodate the N-terminal loop and all three extracellular loops of CXCR4. These extracellular features are important players in ligand recruitment and interaction for allostery and signal transduction. Our study shows that ASMCXCR4 can be recognized by the anti-CXCR4 antibodies, MEDI3185, 2B11, and 12G5, and that ASMCXCR4 can bind the HIV-1 glycoprotein ligand gp120, and the natural chemokine ligand SDF-1α. Further, we show that ASMCXCR4 can competitively inhibit the SDF-1α signaling pathway, and be used as an immunogen to generate CXCR4-specific antibodies. This platform will be useful in the study of GPCR biology in a soluble receptor context for evaluating its extracellular ligand interactions."

Small molecules that are able to regulate endogenous miRNAs hold great potential in both elucidation of miRNA networks and treatment of miRNA-related diseases. Herein, we summarize current strategies for discovery of small molecule modifiers of miRNAs, and we highlight aspects of miRNA cellular biology elucidated by using these small molecules and miRNA-targeted therapeutics realized by these small molecules. We envision that this area will expand dramatically in the near future and will ultimately contribute to a better understanding of miRNA-involved cellular processes and development of therapeutic agents for miRNA-associated diseases.","Pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosis: systematic review and meta-analysis of case reports, 1970-2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900501,Postgraduate medicine,2019 04 05,"Pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosis (PLC) is a life-threating complication in patients suffering from malignancies. Misleading and nonspecific symptoms often result in a delayed diagnosis. This review was aimed at evaluating epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and survival of patients with PLC reported in the literature. According to our knowledge, this study is the first such extensive analysis of PLC. We searched for the literature in the PubMed database for articles published from 1970 to 2018 using keywords: lung, pulmonary, lymphangitic, carcinoma, carcinomatosis. Pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosis rarely occurs, thus all data were extracted from case reports and case series consisted of a method for identifying individual-level patient data. In the final analysis, 108 articles (139 individual patient cases) were included. The mean age of PLC occurrence is 49.21 years. There is no difference in the prevalence between men and women. The most common underlying primary tumors coexisting with PLC are breast (17.3%), lung (10.8%), and gastric cancers (10.8%). Dyspnea and dry cough were the most common symptoms occurring in 59.0% and 33.8% of patients, respectively. In half the patients, PLC developed in fewer than ten months after first diagnosis of cancer. Pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosis diagnosis is associated with a poor prognosis: approximately half of patients die within two months of their first respiratory symptoms and three weeks from admission to hospital. Regarding survival time, we observed better results achieved in patients described between 2000 and 2018 compared to 1970 through 1999. In the presence of progressive dyspnea, cough, and lesions comparable to interstitial lung disease, diagnosis of PLC should be considered. Pulmonary lymphangitis carcinomatosis can be the first manifestation of primary occult neoplasm and may occur at any age.

The various experiences of diagnosis, treatment, and recovery from cancer during adolescence and young adulthood are complex and disruptive. Emphasis on treatment and recovery often overshadows other social and developmental imperatives for adolescents and young adults. Acknowledging, exploring, and crafting one's own sexual identity is a significant milestone achieved during this time, and it is one that is interrupted by the arrival and treatment of cancer. There is value in understanding how adolescents and young adults compose sexuality amid cancer experiences, and how this composition contributes to their ongoing stream of life experiences after recovery. As part of a larger study of sexuality and adolescent cancer, we undertook a narrative inquiry with Anna and Mark, two young adults who experienced cancer during adolescence. Over 14 months, we met with Anna and Mark, drawing on different narrative inquiry approaches to explore their past and ongoing experiences and to build negotiated stories of those experiences. We explored resonant threads between the stories, which help show the depth and complexity of sexuality as it is experienced in the midst of and after cancer. Two resonant threads are discussed: inward and outward looking, and sexuality and survival. The inquiry reveals the richness of self-composition amid competing stories of cancer treatment, disruptions to family and socialization, survivorship, what it means to be a young man or woman in the world, and the sense of a developing sexual self.","Outcomes, accreditation, interprofessional education, and the Tower of Babel.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900497,Journal of interprofessional care,2019 03 27,"Effective education necessitates a shared mental model of what and how learners should be taught. Students in various healthcare professions education programs learn together most effectively when programs have a shared mental model for education. Because healthcare professions education programs must satisfy their respective accreditation standards, the terminology of those standards reflects that body's shared mental model for education. Thus, interprofessional education (IPE) would be facilitated by common educational lexicon across accrediting bodies. In this study, the terminology used in the accreditation standards from several healthcare professions educational programs was measured. An analysis was conducted to illustrate whether terms used by accreditors were internally consistent and whether there was consistency across professions. Counts of learning outcomes terms used revealed little internal consistency within each set of standards. Additionally, the terms in the various standards documents used to describe educational outcomes were not consistent across accreditors. Individual healthcare professions educational programs find IPE difficult to implement and maintain for pre-professional students. This study suggests that these programs' learning outcomes, which are regulated by accreditation standards, probably conflict with implementation of IPE initiatives. Strategies to normalize learning outcomes language and develop shared mental models for IPE are needed.",Impact of jasmonic acid on lignification in the hemp hypocotyl.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900496,Plant signaling & behavior,2019 06 16,"Phytohormones are crucial molecules regulating plant development and responses to environmental challenges, including abiotic stresses, microbial and insect attacks.

In this study, a MSN-based nanocarrier was fabricated and gold nanoparticle (GNP)-biotin conjugates were successfully grafted onto the pore outlets of the prepared MSN. This bioconjugate served as a capping agent with a peptide-cleavable linker sensitive to matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are overexpressed extracellular proteolytic enzymes in cancerous tissue. The prepared nanocarriers were fully characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption/desorption, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). In vitro release studies showed efficient capping of MSNs with gold gate and controlled release of Doxorubicin (DOX) in the presence of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and acidic pH values. High DOX-loading capacity (21%) and encapsulation efficiency (95.5%) were achieved using fluorescence technique. DOX-loaded nanocarriers showed high cytocompatibility and could efficiently induce cell death and apoptosis in the MMP-2 overexpressed cell lines. Moreover, Haemolysis, platelet activation and inflammatory responses assessment approved excellent hemocompatibility and minimal side effects by encapsulation of DOX in MSNs carrier.",N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide as biomarker for diagnosis of Kawasaki disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900472,Biomarkers in medicine,2019 03 26,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic childhood vasculitis with peculiar tropism for the heart. Coronary artery aneurysms are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. The timely administration of gammaglobulin decreases the risk for development of coronary artery aneurysms, highlighting the importance of early KD recognition. However, the most significant dilemma in the management of KD is the diagnosis itself. In this article, we review the recent literature focusing on the diagnostic utility of N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide as a biomarker for diagnosis of KD. The main conclusion is that N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide is an useful biomarker for KD diagnostic that represents a valuable addition to the current diagnostic workup of patients with suspected KD, increasing the diagnostic accuracy.",Effect of physical exercise on young anesthesiologists with on-call-related fatigue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900471,"Psychology, health & medicine",2019 03 22,"To explore whether exercise can effectively relieve the fatigue state of overnight shift anesthesiologists with chronic fatigue. 78 anesthesiologists between 30 and 40 years of age at four hospitals in China were analyzed in the investigation. The Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) were used to assess psychological symptoms and fatigue respectively, and data regarding demographics, health, exercise and work-related variables were also collected. The total and physical fatigue score were highest among those who seldom do exercise compared to those who always do exercise (p < .05, respectively). Moreover, anesthesiologists who exercised 30-60 min everyday had the lowest total and physical fatigue score. When exercise for more than 60 min, the total and physical fatigue scores then increased. After completing a night shift, the post-on-call total Profile of Mood States scores of those who seldom do exercise was significantly increased (t = -4.9, p < .001). These study findings suggested that regular exercise 30-60 min everyday could effectively reduce anesthesiologists' physical fatigue and decrease their negative psychological state, and anesthesiologists should positively adjust working and exercise time.",The Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Promoter Improves the Efficacy of an AAV Vector for the Treatment of MNGIE.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900470,Human gene therapy,2019 04 24,"MNGIE (mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy) is a devastating disease caused by mutations in TYMP, which encodes thymidine phosphorylase (TP). In MNGIE patients, TP dysfunction results in systemic thymidine and deoxyuridine overload, which interferes with mitochondrial DNA replication. Preclinical studies have shown that gene therapy using a lentiviral vector targeted to hematopoietic stem cells or an adeno-associated vector (AAV) transcriptionally targeted to liver are feasible approaches to treat MNGIE. Here, we studied the effect of various promoters (thyroxine-binding globulin [TBG], phosphoglycerate kinase [PGK], hybrid liver-specific promoter [HLP], and alpha-1-antitrypsin [AAT]) and DNA configuration (single stranded or self complementary) on expression of the TYMP transgene in the AAV8 serotype in a murine model of MNGIE. All vectors restored liver TP activity and normalized nucleoside homeostasis in mice. However, the liver-specific promoters TBG, HLP, and AAT were more effective than the constitutive PGK promoter, and the self-complementary DNA configuration did not provide any therapeutic advantage over the single-stranded configuration. Among all constructs, only AAV-AAT was effective in all mice treated at the lowest dose (5 × 1010 vector genomes/kg). As use of the AAT promoter will likely minimize the dose needed to achieve clinical efficacy as compared to the other promoters tested, we propose using the AAT promoter in the vector eventually designed for clinical use.",Re-evaluating the self-report habit index: the cases of physical activity and snacking habits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900469,Psychology & health,2019 03 22,"The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) was originally reported as one-dimensional; however, habit has been described as characterised by several features.

National VHA administrative data from Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 (N = 5.4 million) were used to: (1) evaluate the unadjusted risk of homelessness among veterans with HIV; (2) identify common multi-morbid correlates of both HIV diagnosis and homelessness; and (3) to assess the independent risk of homelessness among veterans with HIV after adjusting for risk factors common to both conditions. Veterans with HIV were at substantial risk of homelessness (OR = 4.23 (95% CI 4.07-4.39)). However, with adjustment for shared co-variates (especially black race, low income, substance use, and psychiatric disorders) this risk declined substantially to 1.41 (95% CI 1.35-1.48). The high risk of homelessness among HIV positive veterans is largely attributable to multi-morbid risk factors common to both HIV and homelessness rather than to an independent effect of HIV, and requires multi-dimensional preventive psychosocial interventions.",Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder Demonstrate Regionally Specific Altered Resting-State Phase-Amplitude Coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900464,Brain connectivity,2019 06 10,"Studies suggest that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit altered electrophysiological alpha to gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC).

The present study examined resting-state activity throughout the brain in a relatively large sample of 119 children with ASD and 47 typically developing children. Children with ASD demonstrated regionally specific abnormalities in alpha to low-gamma PAC, with increased alpha to low-gamma PAC for a central midline source and decreased PAC at lateral sources. Group differences in local gamma-band power did not account for the regional group differences in alpha to low-gamma PAC. Moreover, local alpha power did not significantly modulate alpha to low-gamma PAC estimates. Finally, PAC estimates were correlated with Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) indicating clinical relevance of the PAC metric.

To assess the occurrence and treatment of these pesticides in stormwater runoff, an approach combining field sampling and watershed-scale modeling was employed. Stormwater samples were collected at four locations in the lower San Diego River watershed during a storm event and analyzed for fipronil, three of its degradation products, and eight pyrethroids. All 12 compounds were detected with frequency ranging from 50 to 100%. Field results indicate pesticide pollution is ubiquitous at levels above toxicity benchmarks and that runoff may be a major pollutant source to urban surface waters. A watershed-scale stormwater model was developed, calibrated using collected data, and evaluated for pesticide storm load and concentrations under several management scenarios. Modeling results show that enhanced stormwater control measures, such as biochar-amended biofilters, reduce both pesticide storm load and toxicity benchmark exceedances, while conventional biofilters reduce the storm load but provide minimal toxicity benchmark exceedance reduction. Consequently, biochar amendment has the potential to broadly improve water quality at the watershed scale, particularly when meeting concentration-based metrics such as toxicity benchmarks. This research motivates future work to demonstrate the reliability of full-scale enhanced stormwater control measures to treat pollutants of emerging concern.",Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv Electrochemical Sensor Mediated by Aptamer and AuNPs-DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900450,ACS sensors,2019 04 26,"The accurate and rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis) is essential for the effective treatment of tuberculosis. In this article, we propose an electrochemical sensor to detect M. tuberculosis reference strain H37Rv. The sensor contains an H37Rv aptamer and oligonucleotides modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-DNA). An H37Rv aptamer screened by our laboratory was used as the recognition probe. The change in frequency shift mediated by AuNPs-DNA in the presence of H37Rv was detected using a multichannel series piezoelectric quartz crystal (MSPQC) system. Three oligonucleotides modified with gold nanoparticles were designed. These oligonucleotides contained 12, 12, and 13 bases that hybridized with the 37-nt H37Rv aptamer. H37Rv aptamer was immobilized on the gold electrode surface by Au-S bonds. A conductive-layer was then formed by sequential hybridization of the aptamer with the three designed AuNPs-DNAs. When H37Rv was present, it specifically bound to the aptamer, resulting in the detachment of AuNPs-DNA from the electrode. The conductive layer was thereby replaced by a nonconductive complex of aptamer and bacteria. These changes were monitored by the MSPQC system. The proposed sensor is rapid, specific and sensitive, the detection time was 2 h. The detection limit was 100 cfu/mL. This sensor would be of great benefit for the early clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.",How β-Phase Content Moderates Chain Conjugation and Energy Transfer in Polyfluorene Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900449,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 04 26,"Poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO) is a blue-light-emitting polymer exhibiting two distinct phases, namely, the disordered ""glassy"" phase and a more ordered β-phase. We investigate how a systematic increase in the fraction of β-phase present in PFO films controls chain conformation, photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE), and the resonant energy transfer from the glassy to the β-phase. All films are prepared by the same technique, using paraffin oil as an additive to the spin-coating solution, allowing systematic tuning of the β-phase fraction. The PFO films exhibit high PLQE with values increasing to 0.72 for increasing fractions of β-phase present, with the β-phase chain conformation becoming more planar and including more repeat units. Differences in Förster radii calculated from the overlap of steady-state absorptance and emission spectra and from time-resolved ultrafast photoluminescence transients indicate that exciton diffusion within the glassy phase plays an important role in the energy transfer process.",Metal-Organic Framework Co-MOF-74-Based Host-Guest Composites for Resistive Gas Sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900448,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 03,"Increasing demands in the field of sensing, especially for gas detection applications, require new approaches to chemical sensors.

The Co-MOF-74-TTF crystal morphology has been characterized via X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, while the successful incorporation of TTF into the MOF has been validated via X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, UV/vis, infrared (IR), and Raman investigations. We demonstrate a reduced yet ample uptake of CO2 in the pores of the new material by IR imaging and adsorption isotherms.

The observed improvements are related to an enhancement of the open circuit voltage VOC, that is, the suppression of the VOC deficit. The VOC monotonically increases with treatment time up to 0.460 V. The origin of this improvement is discussed, and it is concluded that the effectiveness of the surface treatment is not due to oxygen-related alloying but instead to the homogeneous oxidation and removal of the oxidized CZTSe surface layer. The surface oxygen content increases with surface treatment time, although surface oxides are fully removed after ammonia treatment, which is conducted in a similar manner to CdS buffer deposition. The reduction of surface recombination is confirmed by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, and the minority carrier lifetime deduced using the fast decay component increases with increasing treatment time. The relationship between photovoltaic properties and lifetime is clearly demonstrated.

However, virtually every study of sarcopenia has measured lean body mass (LBM) or fat free mass (FFM) rather than muscle mass, specifically. In a number of published sarcopenia studies, LBM or FFM is referred to as muscle mass, leading to an incorrect assumption that measuring LBM or FFM is an accurate measure of muscle mass. As a result, the data on the effects of changes in LBM or FFM in older populations on outcomes such as functional capacity, disability, and risk of injurious falls have been inconsistent resulting in the conclusion that muscle mass is only weakly related to these outcomes. We review and describe the assumptions for the most commonly used measurements of body composition. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has become an increasingly common tool for the assessment of LBM or FFM and appendicular lean mass as a surrogate, but inaccurate, measurement of muscle mass. Other previously used methods (total body water, bioelectric impedance, and imaging) also have significant limitations. D3 -Creatine (D3 -Cr) dilution provides a direct and accurate measurement of creatine pool size and skeletal muscle mass. In a recent study in older men (MrOS cohort), D3 -Cr muscle mass was associated with functional capacity and risk of injurious falls and disability, while assessments of LBM or appendicular lean mass by DXA were only weakly or not associated with these outcomes. Inaccurate measurements of muscle mass by DXA and other methods have led to inconsistent results and potentially erroneous conclusions about the importance of skeletal muscle mass in health and disease. The assessment of skeletal muscle mass using the D3 -Cr dilution method in prospective cohort studies may reveal sarcopenia as a powerful risk factor for late life disability and chronic disease.",Cytological features of basal cell adenocarcinoma of the salivary glands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900399,Diagnostic cytopathology,2019 06 11,"The cytological features of basal cell adenocarcinoma (BAC) of the salivary gland, a rare carcinoma, have not been well described. This study included patients who were histopathologically diagnosed with BAC and who underwent preoperative fine-needle aspiration cytological examination. Cytological characteristics, including background, arrangement and shape of the neoplastic cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic features, and presence of stromal spindle cells, were reviewed. Seven patients were enrolled in the study. The cytological specimens were cellular and composed of large or small clusters with occasional discohesive neoplastic cells at the periphery. The predominant cellular morphology was spindle-shaped in four cases, and small round-shaped in three cases. These neoplastic cells were tightly packed, showed high cellularity and overlapping nuclei, and had mildly to moderately enlarged round to oval nuclei with occasional small nucleoli and scant cytoplasm. Stromal spindle cells were observed around the basaloid cells in three cases (42.9%). All histology-proven stromal spindle cell-positive cases had stromal spindle cells in the cytological specimens. The study findings clearly demonstrate the relatively high frequency of stromal spindle cells in cytological specimens of BAC. This finding is characteristic of BAC, although basal cell adenoma of salivary gland frequently has stromal spindle cells in the cytological specimens. The characteristic that differentiates BAC from basal cell adenoma is the presence of tightly packed and high cellular clusters with discohesive neoplastic cells. An understanding of these cytological features can aid the cytodiagnosis of BAC.",Polymorphism of MTHFR 1298A>C in relation to adverse pregnancy outcomes in Chinese populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900398,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,2019 06 09,"Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) are involved in a series of abnormal pregnancies like embryo growth arrest, spontaneous abortion, premature birth, stillbirth, fetal malformation, birth defects and other pathological pregnancy, and childbirth complications.

Second-generation radiotracers show variance in affinity amongst subjects (low-, mixed-, and high-affinity binders) caused by the genetic polymorphism (rs6971) of the TSPO gene. To overcome these limitations, a new structural scaffold was explored based on the TSPO pharmacophore, and the analogue with a low-affinity binder/high-affinity binder (LAB/HAB) ratio similar (1.2 vs. 1.3) to that of (R)-[11 C]PK11195 was investigated.

Compromised mitochondrial quality, reflected by loss of membrane potential, collapse of ATP production, abnormal morphology, burst of reactive oxygen species generation, and impaired Ca2+ buffering capacity, can alter mitochondrial transport. Mitochondrial transport in turn maintains axonal mitochondrial homeostasis in several ways. Newly generated mitochondria are anterogradely transported along with axon from soma to replenish axonal mitochondrial pool, while damaged mitochondria undergo retrograde transport for repair or degradation. Besides, mitochondria are also arrested in axon to quarantine damages locally. Accumulating evidence suggests abnormal mitochondrial transport leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and axon degeneration in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Further investigations into the details of this process would help to extend our understanding of various neurological diseases and shed light on the corresponding therapies."

Orthostatic hypotension is considered a manifestation of dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, caused or facilitated by several neurological or non-neurological diseases and conditions, while its clinical significance is increasingly recognized as a cause of impairment of quality of life and potentially of worse outcomes. Indeed, OH has been extensively studied and numerous prospective cohort studies support its association with adverse events, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, cognitive dysfunction, and, most importantly, mortality rates. Specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been established for the treatment of OH. However, randomized data evaluating the impact of therapeutic interventions on morbidity and mortality outcomes are lacking. Thus, despite that OH seems to have important prognostic implications indicated by several reported associations with adverse events, it remains unclear whether OH treatment could improve prognosis.

Few case reports have focused on other types of histological transformation. We report a case of transformation of ALK rearrangement-positive adenocarcinoma to NSCLC with neuroendocrine differentiation during alectinib therapy. A 36-year-old woman presented with a tumor in the left lower lobe and bone metastases. She was diagnosed with ALK rearrangement-positive adenocarcinoma by histopathology of the primary tumor. Alectinib had been effective for 8 months before new lesions appeared. Histopathological re-examination of a recurrent tumor revealed poorly differentiated carcinoma with insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) expression, which remained ALK-positive. Expression of CD133, BCL-2, and SOX2 was positive in comparison to the initial tumor. Expression of SOX2 became more strongly positive than it was before treatment. The immunohistochemical findings of these markers associated with cancer stem-like cells and/or neuroendocrine differentiation suggest that cancer stem cells play a role in the mechanisms of histological transformation and acquired resistance of ALK rearrangement-positive cancer.

The first-line treatment for OAB includes behavioral therapy, such as caffeine reduction, fluid intake modification, weight reduction, bladder training, and pelvic floor muscle training, as well as treatment with antimuscarinic or β3 -adrenoceptor agonist medications. However, less than half of all cases achieve satisfactory outcomes following first-line treatment. Second-line therapy considered if satisfactory responses are not achieved after 8 to 12 weeks treatment with first-line therapy include intradetrusor botulinum toxin injection, neuromodulation, and surgical treatment.

However, the association of antihypertensive drugs with β-cell function has not been well studied. To investigate this question, the authors performed a cross-sectional study involving 882 hypertensive T2DM patients. To assess β-cell function, patients were given 75g glucose orally and C-peptide levels before and 1, 2, and 3 hours after glucose intake were measured. Homa-β was computed by Homeostasis Model Assessment model to evaluate β-cell function using fasting C-peptide and glucose levels in the plasma. Multivariable-adjusted analysis was performed to evaluate the association of antihypertensive drugs with C-peptide levels, HbA1c, and Homa-β. Among 882 hypertensive patients, 547 (62.0%) received antihypertensive treatment. Multivariate-adjusted analysis demonstrated that use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) was negatively associated with HbA1c levels (CCBs: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92-0.98], P = 0.002). Our data further illustrated that the C-peptide levels before and 1, 2, and 3 hours of OGTT were 1.10-, 1.18-, 1.19-, and 1.15-fold increase in T2DM patients taking CCBs (P = 0.084 for fasting C-peptide levels; P ≤ 0.024 for C-peptide levels at 1, 2, and 3 hours after OGTT) in comparison with non-CCB users. Nevertheless, usage of any other antihypertensive drugs did neither associated with HbA1c nor associated with C-peptide levels (P ≥ 0.11). In conclusion, CCB treatment was negatively associated with HbA1c levels but positively associated with β-cell function in hypertensive T2DM patients, implying that CCBs could be considered to treat hypertensive T2DM patients with reduced β-cell function.",The role and competence of midwives in supporting women with mental health concerns during the perinatal period: A scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900371,Health & social care in the community,2019 03 22,"Perinatal mental health problems are linked to poor outcomes for mothers, babies and families. Despite a recognition of the significance of this issue, women often do not receive the care they need and fall between the gap of maternity and mental health services. To address this, there is a call for reform in the way in which perinatal mental healthcare is delivered. This paper responds to this by exploring the role and competence of midwives in delivering mental healthcare. Using a scoping review methodology, quantitative and qualitative evidence were considered to answer the research question 'what is the nature of the evidence relevant to the provision of mental health interventions by midwives?' To identify studies, the databases PubMed, Maternity and Infant Care, Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Medline, Science Direct and CINAHL were searched from 2011 to 2018, and reference lists of included studies were examined. Studies relevant to the role of midwives in the management and treatment of perinatal mental health issues were included; studies focussed on screening and referral were excluded. Thirty papers met inclusion criteria, including studies about the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of midwives and student midwives; the effectiveness of educational interventions in improving knowledge and skills; the delivery of counselling or psychosocial interventions by midwives; and barriers and enablers to embedding midwife-led mental healthcare in practice. Synthesis of the included studies indicates that midwives are interested in providing mental health support, but lack the confidence, knowledge and training to do so. This deficit can be addressed with appropriate training and organisational support, and there is some evidence that midwife-led counselling interventions are effective. Further research is needed to test midwife-led interventions for women with perinatal mental health problems , and to develop and evaluate models of integrated perinatal mental healthcare.",The smart negative pressure (SNaP) wound care system: A case series from Singapore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900370,International wound journal,2019 03 22,"The Smart Negative Pressure (SNaP) wound care system is a novel device that is single-patient use, ultra-portable, and light weight and does not rely on battery or need recharging.

Ten studies were identified, showing that the SNaP wound care system is an effective tool in treating small-sized wounds and may serve as an alternative to current electrically powered modalities. Furthermore, the system's small size and convenience leads to greater patient satisfaction and improves quality of life. Finally, we report our initial positive experiences with two cases in our institution. Although the evidence thus far has been encouraging, and patient satisfaction is higher than other wound care systems, further evidence is required to determine its superiority over current systems in terms of wound-healing outcomes."

Virtually all of the studies define recidivism as a new legal charge or conviction for a sexual crime, and these studies tend to find recidivism rates of the order of 5-15% after 5 years and 10-25% after 10+ years. It is uncontroversial that such a definition of recidivism underestimates the true rate of sexual recidivism because most sexual crime is not reported to legal authorities, a principle known as the ""dark figure of crime."" To estimate the magnitude of the dark figure of sexual recidivism, this paper uses a probabilistic simulation approach in conjunction with the following: (i) victim self-report survey data about the rate of reporting sexual crime to legal authorities; (ii) offender self-report data about the number of victims per offender; and (iii) different assumptions about the chances of being convicted of a new sexual offense given that it is reported. Under any configuration of assumptions, the dark figure is substantial, and as a consequence the disparity between recidivism defined as a new legal charge or conviction for a sex crime and recidivism defined as actually committing a new sexual crime is large. These findings call into question the utility of recidivism studies that rely exclusively on official crime statistics to define sexual recidivism, and highlight the need for additional, long-term studies that use a variety of different measures to assess whether or not sexual recidivism has occurred.",Suicide Crisis Syndrome: A review of supporting evidence for a new suicide-specific diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900347,Behavioral sciences & the law,2019 06 03,"Suicide is a major public health problem, and suicide rates are still on the rise. Current strategies for identifying individuals at risk for suicide, such as the use of a patient's self-reported suicidal ideation or evidence of past suicide attempts, have not been sufficient in reducing suicide rates. Recently, research groups have been focused on determining the acute mental state preceding a suicide attempt. The development of an acute suicidal diagnosis, the Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS), is aimed at capturing this state to better treat individuals. The SCS has five main evidence-based components-entrapment, affective disturbance, loss of cognitive control, hyperarousal, and social withdrawal. The SCS may provide clinicians with the ability to identify individuals who are experiencing an acute pre-suicidal mental state, regardless of their self-reported suicidal ideation. Future research leading to the incorporation of this diagnosis into clinical practice could improve the quality of care and reduce the personal, societal, and legal burden of suicide.",Reversible Nature of Coke Formation on Mo/ZSM-5 Methane Dehydroaromatization Catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900346,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 13,"Non-oxidative dehydroaromatization of methane over Mo/ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of abundant natural gas into liquid aromatics. Rapid coking deactivation hinders the practical implementation of this technology. Herein, we show that catalyst productivity can be improved by nearly an order of magnitude by raising the reaction pressure to 15 bar. The beneficial effect of pressure was found for different Mo/ZSM-5 catalysts and a wide range of reaction temperatures and space velocities. High-pressure operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrated that the structure of the active Mo-phase was not affected by operation at elevated pressure. Isotope labeling experiments, supported by mass-spectrometry and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, indicated the reversible nature of coke formation. The improved performance can be attributed to faster coke hydrogenation at increased pressure, overall resulting in a lower coke selectivity and better utilization of the zeolite micropore space.","Development and validation of the 22-item Tarumi's Modern-Type Depression Trait Scale: Avoidance of Social Roles, Complaint, and Low Self-Esteem (TACS-22).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900331,Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2019 04 29,"Understanding premorbid personality is important, especially when considering treatment selection.

However, almost all of the studies related to SpLDs deal with the difficulties that said disorders cause during childhood or adolescence. An interest in adults with SpLDs is only recent, especially in university students like those in this study. In Italy, research on SpLDs in higher education is rather limited. This study aims to rectify this lack of data by making a brief analysis of the data on SpLDs prevalence in higher education and of the courses chosen by university students with SpLDs. Our sample consisted of 585 students with SpLDs enrolled at 19 public universities that communicated the number of students who contacted their offices of service for students with SpLDs. The prevalence of students with SpLDs in the higher education populations we sample had a mean of 0.13% (SD = 0.11) and ranged from 0.03% to 0.48%. The data showed that the higher education faculties with the highest number of reported SpLDs students in our sample were Statistics, Agriculture, Veterinary Science, Education, and Architecture.

The current update now includes a discussion of cryptococcosis, which is the third most common invasive fungal infection in SOT recipients. Infection often occurs a year after transplantation; however, early infections occur and donor-derived infections have been described within 3 months after transplant. There are two main species that cause infection, Cryptococcus neoformans and C gattii. Clinical onset may be insidious, but headaches, fevers, and mental status changes should warrant diagnostic testing. The lateral flow cryptococcal antigen assay is now the preferred test from serum and cerebrospinal fluid due to its rapidity, accuracy, and cost. A lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure is recommended for patients with suspected or proven cryptococcosis. Lipid amphotericin B plus 5-flucytosine is used as initial treatment of meningitis, disseminated infection, and moderate-to-severe pulmonary infection, followed by fluconazole as consolidation therapy. Fluconazole is effective for mild-to-moderate pulmonary infection.

Here, we have addressed the mechanisms underlying structural diversification upon damage-induced activation of glucosinolates, a group of thioglucosides found in the Brassicales. The classical pathway of glucosinolate activation involves myrosinase-catalyzed hydrolysis and rearrangement of the aglucone to an isothiocyanate. Plants of the Brassicaceae possess specifier proteins, i.e. non-heme iron proteins that promote the formation of alternative products by interfering with this reaction through unknown mechanisms. We have used structural information available for the thiocyanate-forming protein from Thlaspi arvense (TaTFP), to test the impact of loops protruding at one side of its β-propeller structure on product formation using the allylglucosinolate aglucone as substrate. In silico loop structure sampling and semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations identified a 3L2 loop conformation that enabled the Fe2+ cofactor to interact with the double bond of the allyl side chain. Only this arrangement enabled the formation of allylthiocyanate, a specific product of TaTFP. Simulation of 3,4-epithiobutane nitrile formation, the second known product of TaTFP, required an alternative substrate docking arrangement in which Fe2+ interacts with the aglucone thiolate. In agreement with these results, substitution of 3L2 amino acid residues involved in the conformational change as well as exchange of critical amino acid residues of neighboring loops affected the allylthiocyanate versus epithionitrile proportion obtained upon myrosinase-catalyzed allylglucosinolate hydrolysis in the presence of TaTFP in vitro. Based on these insights, we propose that specifier proteins are catalysts that might be classified as Fe2+ -dependent lyases.",Dietary palmitate cooperates with Src kinase to promote prostate tumor progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900312,The Prostate,2019 05 08,"Numerous genetic alterations have been identified during prostate cancer progression. The influence of environmental factors, particularly the diet, on the acceleration of tumor progression is largely unknown. Expression levels and/or activity of Src kinase are highly elevated in numerous cancers including advanced stages of prostate cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that high-fat diets (HFDs) promoted pathological transformation mediated by the synergy of Src and androgen receptor in vivo. Additionally, a diet high in saturated fat significantly enhanced proliferation of Src-mediated xenograft tumors in comparison with a diet high in unsaturated fat. The saturated fatty acid palmitate, a major constituent in a HFD, significantly upregulated the biosynthesis of palmitoyl-CoA in cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. The exogenous palmitate enhanced Src-dependent mitochondrial β-oxidation. Additionally, it elevated the amount of C16-ceramide and total saturated ceramides, increased the level of Src kinase localized in the cell membrane, and Src-mediated downstream signaling, such as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and focal adhesion kinase. Our results uncover how the metabolism of dietary palmitate cooperates with elevated Src kinase in the acceleration of prostate tumor progression.",piRNA-DQ722010 contributes to prostate hyperplasia of the male offspring mice after the maternal exposed to microcystin-leucine arginine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900311,The Prostate,2019 04 17,Microcystin-leucine arginine (MC-LR) could disrupt prostate development and cause prostate hyperplasia.

Half of the cultivated samples was analysed after 14 days, and the rest after 21 days. Round cell subpopulations were identified with FITC-DBA by flow cytometry: strongly positive DBA (sDBA+) as SSC, weakly positive DBA (wDBA+) as in early differentiation and negative DBA as differentiated. At the beginning, 4.16% of the cells were SSC, 37.61% wDBA+ while 54.12% were DBA-. After 14 days, 42.28% of SSC, 44.68% wDBA+ and 11.07% DBA- were found in DMEM while 47.09% of SSC, 32.57% wDBA+ and 18.48% DBA- in STEMPRO.

An open question is how different types of cues are combined at retrieval to create a single retrieval probe (""cue combinatorics""). This study addresses this question by testing whether retrieval for antecedent-reflexive dependencies combines cues in a linear (i.e., additive) or nonlinear (i.e., multiplicative) fashion. Results from computational simulations and a reading time experiment show that target items that match all the cues of the reflexive are favored more than target items that mismatch these cues, and that different degrees of mismatches slow reading times in comparable amounts. This profile is consistent with the predictions of a nonlinear cue combination and provides evidence against models in which all cues combine in a linear fashion. A follow-up set of simulations shows that a nonlinear rule also captures previous demonstrations of interference from nontarget items during retrieval for reflexive licensing. Taken together, these results shed new light on how different types of cues combine at the retrieval site and reveal how the method of cue combination impacts the accessibility of linguistic information in memory.",From Context to Code: Information Transfer Constrains the Emergence of Graphic Codes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900292,Cognitive science,2019 03 22,"Humans commit information to graphic symbols for three basic reasons: as a memory aid, as a tool for thinking, and as a means of communication. Yet, despite the benefits of transmitting information graphically, we still know very little about the biases and constraints acting on the emergence of stable, powerful, and accurate graphic codes (such as writing). Using a reference game, where participants play as Messengers and Recipients, we experimentally manipulate the function of the task (communicative or non-communicative) and investigate whether this shapes the emergence of stable, powerful, and accurate codes for both synchronous and asynchronous modes of information transfer. Only in the Dialogue condition, where Messenger and Recipient are two different persons communicating within the same time frame (i.e., synchronously), do we consistently observe the emergence of stable, powerful, and accurate graphic codes. Such codes are unnecessary for participants in Recall, where Messenger and Recipient are the same person transferring information within the same time frame, and they fail to emerge in Correspondence, where Messenger and Recipient are two different persons communicating across time frames (i.e., asynchronously). Lastly, in the Mnemonic condition, where Messenger and Recipient are the same person at different points in time, participants achieve high accuracy but with codes that are suboptimal in terms of power and stability. Our results suggest that the rarity and late arrival of stable, powerful, and accurate graphic codes in human history largely stems from strong constraints on information transfer. In particular, we suggest that these constraints limit a code's ability to reach an adequate tradeoff between information that needs to be explicitly encoded and information that needs to be inferred from context.",Do Additional Features Help or Hurt Category Learning? The Curse of Dimensionality in Human Learners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900291,Cognitive science,2019 03 22,"The curse of dimensionality, which has been widely studied in statistics and machine learning, occurs when additional features cause the size of the feature space to grow so quickly that learning classification rules becomes increasingly difficult. How do people overcome the curse of dimensionality when acquiring real-world categories that have many different features? Here we investigate the possibility that the structure of categories can help. We show that when categories follow a family resemblance structure, people are unaffected by the presence of additional features in learning. However, when categories are based on a single feature, they fall prey to the curse, and having additional irrelevant features hurts performance. We compare and contrast these results to three different computational models to show that a model with limited computational capacity best captures human performance across almost all of the conditions in both experiments.",Processing Negation in a Miniature Artificial Language.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900290,Cognitive science,2019 03 22,"In two miniature artificial language learning experiments, we compare the processing of narrow and broad negation, corresponding to prefixal negation (unhappy) and free-standing negation (not happy) respectively, with that of non-negation (happy). Three artificial prefixes were invented to express the three meanings above. The meaning scope expressed by the negation types was manipulated in the experiments, and the processing of the three forms was tested through a picture-word verification task. In Experiment 1, the scope expressed by prefixal negation was included in the scope expressed by free-standing negation, while in Experiment 2, there was no overlap between the two negation types and the scope of free-standing negation was limited to the intermediate range of a scale. Experiment 1 showed that narrow negation is more difficult to process than the non-negated meanings, but not as difficult as broad negation. Experiment 2 showed that when the meaning scope of broad negation was restricted to the middle range, the processing difficulty found in Experiment 1 disappeared, as it did not take longer for participants to identify the middle range compared to the ends of the scale. We show that the chunking of the negated meanings relative to one another plays a role in the processing cost of these forms.",Complex Communication Dynamics: Exploring the Structure of an Academic Talk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900289,Cognitive science,2019 03 22,"Communication is a multimodal phenomenon. The cognitive mechanisms supporting it are still understudied. We explored a natural dataset of academic lectures to determine how communication modalities are used and coordinated during the presentation of complex information. Using automated and semi-automated techniques, we extracted and analyzed, from the videos of 30 speakers, measures capturing the dynamics of their body movement, their slide change rate, and various aspects of their speech (speech rate, articulation rate, fundamental frequency, and intensity). There were consistent but statistically subtle patterns in the use of speech rate, articulation rate, intensity, and body motion across the presentation. Principal component analysis also revealed patterns of system-like covariation among modalities. These findings, although tentative, do suggest that the cognitive system is integrating body, slides, and speech in a coordinated manner during natural language use. Further research is needed to clarify the specific coordination patterns that occur between the different modalities.",Entrainment and Modulation of Gesture-Speech Synchrony Under Delayed Auditory Feedback.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900288,Cognitive science,2019 03 22,"Gesture-speech synchrony re-stabilizes when hand movement or speech is disrupted by a delayed feedback manipulation, suggesting strong bidirectional coupling between gesture and speech. Yet it has also been argued from case studies in perceptual-motor pathology that hand gestures are a special kind of action that does not require closed-loop re-afferent feedback to maintain synchrony with speech. In the current pre-registered within-subject study, we used motion tracking to conceptually replicate McNeill's () classic study on gesture-speech synchrony under normal and 150 ms delayed auditory feedback of speech conditions (NO DAF vs. DAF). Consistent with, and extending McNeill's original results, we obtain evidence that (a) gesture-speech synchrony is more stable under DAF versus NO DAF (i.e., increased coupling effect), (b) that gesture and speech variably entrain to the external auditory delay as indicated by a consistent shift in gesture-speech synchrony offsets (i.e., entrainment effect), and (c) that the coupling effect and the entrainment effect are co-dependent. We suggest, therefore, that gesture-speech synchrony provides a way for the cognitive system to stabilize rhythmic activity under interfering conditions.",Consequences of interleukin 1β-triggered chronic inflammation in the mouse prostate gland: Altered architecture associated with prolonged CD4+ infiltration mimics human proliferative inflammatory atrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900284,The Prostate,2019 04 17,"Elevated expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β) has been observed in expressed prostatic secretions of patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, and genetic polymorphisms associated with the IL1B gene are linked to increased risk for aggressive prostate cancer.",Withdrawn: How to investigate an accused serial sexual harasser.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900282,Statistics in medicine,2019 06 14,"Withdrawal: Shuster, JJ, Handler, M.

However, repeated glaciation and a long history of agriculture may lead to different results in regions such as western Europe. We compared the consequences of land sparing and land sharing on breeding bird species in 2 lowland regions of England, The Fens, with 101 species, and Salisbury Plain, with 83. We derived density-yield responses for each species and then estimated regional population size under regional food production strategies, including land sharing and land sparing, a range of intermediate strategies, and a novel mixed strategy. In both regions, more species achieved maximum regional population size under land sparing than land sharing. In The Fens, the majority of birds were loser species (estimated to have smaller populations under all food production strategies than in the preagricultural baseline scenario), whereas in Salisbury Plain the majority were winners (smaller populations in the preagricultural baseline scenario). Loser species overwhelmingly achieved maximum regional population size under land sparing, whereas winner species achieved maximum regional population size under either land sharing or an intermediate strategy, highlighting the importance of defining which groups of species are the target of conservation. A novel 3-compartment strategy (combining high-yield farming, natural habitat, and low-yield farming) often performed better than either land sharing or land sparing. Our results support intermediate or 3-compartment land-sparing strategies to maximize bird populations across lowland agricultural landscapes. To deliver conservation outcomes, any shift toward land sparing must, however, ensure yield increases are sustainable in the long term, do not entail increased negative effects on surrounding areas, and are linked to allocation of land for nature.",No genome is an island: toward a 21st century agenda for evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900279,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2019 03 22,"Conventional 20th century evolution thinking was based on the idea of isolated genomes for each species. Any possibility of life-history inputs to the germ line was strictly excluded by Weismann's doctrine, and genome change was attributed to random copying errors. Today, we know that many life-history events lead to rapid and nonrandom evolutionary change mediated by specific cellular functions. There are many ways that genomes, viruses, cells, and organisms interact to generate evolutionary variation. These include cell mergers and activation of natural genetic engineering by stress, infection, and interspecific hybridization. In addition, we know molecular mechanisms for transmitting life-history information across generations through gametes. These discoveries require a new agenda for evolutionary theory and novel experimental designs to investigate the genomic impacts of stresses, biotic interactions, and sensory inputs coming from the environment. The review will offer some generic recommendations for enriching evolution experiments to incorporate new knowledge and find answers to previously excluded questions."

The function of MR in angiogenesis is still controversial. This study aimed to explore the role of endothelial MR in angiogenesis and to delineate the underlying mechanism. Endothelial-hematopoietic MR knockout (EMRKO) mice were generated and subjected to hindlimb ischemia and injection of melanoma cells. Laser Doppler measurements showed that EMRKO mice had improved blood flow recovery and increased vessel density in ischemic limbs. In addition, EMRKO accelerated growth and increased the vessel density of tumors. Matrigel implantation, aortic ring assays, and tube formation assays demonstrated that MRKO endothelial cells (ECs) manifested increased angiogenic potential. MRKO ECs also displayed increased migration ability and proliferation. MRKO and MR knockdown both upregulated gene expression, protein level, and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Stattic, a selective STAT3 inhibitor, attenuated the effects of MRKO on tube formation, migration, and proliferation of ECs. At the molecular level, MR interacted with CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) to suppress the transcription of STAT3. Furthermore, interactions between MR and STAT3 blocked the phosphorylation of STAT3. Finally, stattic abolished the pro-angiogenic phenotype of EMRKO mice. Taken together, endothelial MR is a negative regulator of angiogenesis, likely in a ligand-independent manner.

One session was carried out with normal breathing (RSN) and the other with voluntary hypoventilation at low lung volume (RSH-VHL). Prefrontal and vastus lateralis muscle oxyhemoglobin ([O2Hb]) and deoxyhemoglobin ([HHb]) were monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), gas exchange and maximal blood lactate concentration ([La]max) were also assessed. SpO2 was significantly lower in RSH-VHL than in RSN whereas there was no difference in HR. Muscle oxygenation was not different between conditions during the entire exercise. On the other hand, in RSH-VHL, cerebral oxygenation was significantly lower than in RSN (-6.1±5.4 vs-1.5±6.6 µm). Oxygen uptake was also higher during the recovery periods whereas [La]max tended to be lower in RSH-VHL. The time of the sprints was not different between conditions. This study shows that repeated shuttle-run sprints with VHL has a limited impact on muscle deoxygenation but induces a greater fall in cerebral oxygenation compared with normal breathing conditions. Despite this phenomenon, performance is not impaired, probably because of a higher oxygen uptake during the recovery periods following sprints.",Tracheoscopic Findings and Their Impact on Respiratory Symptoms in Children with Esophageal Atresia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900225,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios, and interaction terms of the treatment group and geriatric status (defined by age ≥75 years, frailty, ≥ 4 co-morbidities and polypharmacy) were entered into the model. A total of 42,562 and 27,939 patients initiated NOAC and phenprocoumon treatment (mean age 74 years ± 11, 51% male) with a follow-up time of 147,785 person-years.

RO is characterized by severe hypoplasia of enamel and dentin, and teeth affected are friable and more susceptible to caries and fractures. Most of the lesions occur in the anterior maxilla and correlation with clinical and radiographic features is essential to provide a correct diagnosis. The major criteria for diagnosis are predominantly based on radiography, which shows presence of large pulp chambers and a marked reduction in the radiopacity of enamel and dentin, making the distinction between these mineralized structures difficult. Early diagnosis is important to minimize future sequels and allow preventive or conservative treatment. The therapeutic approach of the RO should be based on the degree of severity of the anomaly and in the individual functional and aesthetic needs of each case. A classic case of RO affecting the maxilla is exemplified in this Sine Qua Non Radiology-Pathology article.","Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type in Guatemala: An 86-Case Series Emphasizing Clinical Presentation and Microscopic Characteristics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900209,Head and neck pathology,2019 03 22,"Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL-NT) is a lymphoid malignancy that mainly affects the nasopharynx and is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Increased incidence is seen in some Latin American and Asian countries. In this study, we describe a case series of 86 Guatemalan patients with ENKTCL-NT from a single diagnostic head and neck center. We emphasize the distinctive clinical, microscopic, and immunohistochemical (IHC) features, as well as EBV positivity by in situ hybridization (ISH). Most of the patients (90.6%) were of Mayan descent and low socioeconomic status (SES). Males were more often affected than females, comprising 68.3% of cases. Patient age ranged from 8 to 71, with a mean of 34.7 years. All cases arose in the upper aerodigestive tract and mainly presented as a rapidly progressive, necrotizing midfacial process affecting the nasal, nasopharyngeal, sinonasal, palatal, and oropharyngeal structures. Microscopically, ENKTCL-NT showed a diffuse polymorphic and atypical lymphoid infiltrate. Angiocentric and angiodestructive growth patterns were present with associated necrosis. Peripheral hyaline necrosis of blood vessels was a histologic hallmark. The ISH and IHC profiles included positivity of EBV, LCA, CD3, CD45RO, CD30 (focal in 39.2%), granzyme-B, TIA-1, perforin (in 82.3%), and CD56 (in 83.7%). CD20 was negative, and the Ki-67 index ranged from 70 to 90%. In Guatemala, this lymphoma is strongly associated with people of low SES and indigenous ethnicity. When affected, the palatal mucosa provides the best site to obtain a representative biopsy. Since ENKTCL-NT is highly aggressive, it is extremely important to recognize the spectrum of clinical presentations and microscopic features in order to avoid misdiagnosis and treatment delay.",Psychometric properties of the Mandarin Chinese version of the KIDSCREEN-52 health-related quality of life questionnaire in adolescents: a cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900208,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 05 20,To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Mandarin Chinese version of KIDSCREEN-52 health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire.,Health-related quality of life and perceived health status of Turkish population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900207,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 03 22,This study was conducted to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and perceived health status of the Turkish population.,Food-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900206,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 04 03,"Food-related quality of life (FRQoL) evaluates the impact of diet, eating behaviors, and food-related anxiety on a person's quality of life.

These pathological protein deposits, including Aβ peptides (which form senile plaques) and hyperphosphorylated tau (which aggregates into NFTs), have been assumed to be 'the cause of AD'. Aβ has been extensively targeted to develop an effective disease-modifying therapy, but with limited clinical success. Emerging therapies are also now targeting further pathological processes in AD, including neuroinflammation. This review focuses on the inflammatory and oxidative stress-related changes that occur in AD, and discusses some emerging anti-inflammatory natural products and phytomedicines. Many of the promising compounds are cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs), which target the proinflammatory AP1 and nuclear factor-κB signalling pathways and inhibit the expression of many proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α, or nitric oxide produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase. However, many of these phytomedicines have not been tested in rigorous clinical trials in AD patients. It is not yet clear if the active compounds reach an effective concentration in the brain (due to limited bioavailability) or if they can slow down AD progression in long-term trials. The authors suggest that it is crucial for both the pharmacological and complementary medicine industries to conduct and fund those studies to significantly advance the field.","Neotropical Species of Metaphycus (Hymenoptera, Encyrtidae) Parasitoids of Ceroplastes (Hemiptera, Coccidae): New Species, Interaction Records, and a Checklist.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900202,Neotropical entomology,2019 06 13,"Parasitoids of Ceroplastes Gray were surveyed in the State of São Paulo, Brazil.

The activity of ion channels can be modulated by direct interaction or/and functional coupling with other proteins including auxiliary subunits, scaffold proteins and the cytoskeleton. Here, we evaluated the influence of the actin-based cytoskeleton on the Kv2.1 channel using pharmacological and electrophysiological methods. We found that disruption of the actin-based cytoskeleton by latrunculin B resulted in the regulation of the Kv2.1 inactivation mechanism; it shifted the voltage of half-maximal inactivation toward negative potentials by approximately 15 mV, accelerated the rate of closed-state inactivation, and delayed the recovery rate from inactivation. The actin cytoskeleton stabilizing agent phalloidin prevented the hyperpolarizing shift in the half-maximal inactivation potential when co-applied with latrunculin B. Additionally, PIP2 depletion (a strategy that regulates Kv2.1 inactivation) after cytoskeleton disruption does not regulate further the inactivation of Kv2.1, which suggests that both factors could be regulating the Kv2.1 channel by a common mechanism. In summary, our results suggest a role for the actin-based cytoskeleton in regulating Kv2.1 channels.",Effect of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors on Cardiovascular Outcomes After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900189,Clinical drug investigation,2019 06 11,"Depression and coronary artery disease (CAD) are leading causes of death and disability and commonly co-occur.

Here, we report that heat-stable decoctosomes (ELNs) from decoctions have more therapeutic effects than the decoctions in vitro and demonstrate therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, sRNAs, such as HJT-sRNA-m7 and PGY-sRNA-6, in the decoctosome exhibit potent anti-fibrosis and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. Decoctosome is comprised of lipids, chemical compounds, proteins, and sRNAs. A medical decoctosome mimic is called bencaosome. A single lipid sphinganine (d22:0) identified in the decoctosome was mixed and heated with the synthesized sRNAs to form the simplest bencaosome. This simple bencaosome structure was identified by critical micelle concentration (cmc) assay that sRNAs coassembled with sphinganine (d22:0) to form the lipid layers of vesicles. The heating process facilitates co-assembly of sRNAs and sphinganine (d22:0) until a steady state is reached. The artificially produced sphinganine-HJT-sRNA-m7 and sphinganine- PGY-sRNA-6 bencaosomes could ameliorate bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and poly(I:C)-induced lung inflammation, respectively, following oral administration in mice. Our study not only demonstrates that the herbal decoctosome may represent a combinatory remedy in precision medicine but also provides an effective oral delivery route for nucleic acid therapy.",Epigenetic regulation of phosphodiesterase 4d in restrictive cardiomyopathy mice with cTnI mutations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900165,Science China. Life sciences,2019 03 22,"Epigenetic regulations play an important role in disease development. In this study, we have investigated epigenetic regulations in restrictive cardiomyopathy mice with cTnI 193His mutation. Our results demonstrated that phosphodiesterase (PDEs) 4d was down-regulated in the heart of these mice. Further studies showed that the epigenetic modifications were associated with enhanced acetylation of histone 3 lysine 4 and lysines 9, whereas tri-methylation of histone 3 lysine 4, were decreased in histones near the PDE4d gene promoter regions. The binding levels of histone transmethylase SMYD1 and histone deacetylase HDAC1 were increased in the gene promoter regions in cTnI193His transgenic hearts. Using immune-fluorescent labeling we found an evidence of cTnI existence in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes and Western blotting further confirmed that both wild type and mutated cTnI could be detected in the cell nucleus of the hearts. Furthermore, an interaction between cTnI and SMYD1, or cTnI and HDAC1 was observed. Overexpression of the mutated cTnI in cultured cardiomyocytes reduced the expression of PDE4d. Our data suggest that the decrease of PDE4d expression in RCM mice caused by cTnI mutations may be related to epigenetic regulation, i.e., histone acetylation and methylation, and cTnI might be involved in this procedure via an interaction with HDAC1 and SMAD1 in the hearts.",A spatialized digital database for all bird species in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900164,Science China. Life sciences,2019 05 07,"The lack of refined spatial detail on bird distribution in China has hindered further research due to the large geographic unit (provincial level) in existing national bird distribution data. Based on multi-source bird distribution data, we built a more spatially detailed distribution database for every bird species (1,371 species) in China, covering 2,908 counties. The sources on bird distribution are grouped into six categories: Handbooks, Literature; Fauna, Avifauna; Paper; Citizen Science data by ornithologists or birders; GPS tracing; and Website data. The database contains the following records: taxonomy, distribution data, suspicious species information, and data sources. Our database recorded 835 species (61%) appearing outside the distribution range previously known. The use of provincial boundaries as the smallest geographical unit has created misleading distribution results due to geographic aggregation for most species. The new database was built based on increased observational frequency and individuals observed in previously undetected areas particularly in Western China and towards higher altitudes and latitudes. They coincided with the discovery of the range expansion of some waterfowls into Xinjiang. The dataset provides a new base for Chinese and international ornithology studies, especially for those requiring more detailed distribution information for many taxa and large-scale regional research.",Integrated analysis of gene expression and methylation profiles of novel pancreatic cancer cell lines with highly metastatic activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900162,Science China. Life sciences,2019 06 12,"Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal human malignancies, partly because of its propensity for metastasis. However, highly metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell lines suitable for studies of metastasis are currently lacking. Here we established two highly metastatic human pancreatic cancer cell lines, MIA PaCa-2 In8 and Panc-1 In8, by Matrigel induction assay. The cell lines were further characterized both in vitro and in vivo. MIA PaCa-2 In8 and Panc-1 In8 cells demonstrated increased migration and invasion compared with their respective parental cells. Following injection into nude mice, MIA PaCa-2 In8 and Panc-1 In8 cells resulted in more pulmonary metastases compared with the parental cells. Furthermore, analyses of mRNA, long non-coding RNA, micro RNA, and methylation profiling revealed that these factors were aberrantly regulated in the highly metastatic cells, indicating that they probably affected metastasis. We thus established and characterized two highly metastatic human pancreatic cell lines that could be used as valuable tools for future investigations into the pathogenesis, metastasis, and potential treatment of human pancreatic cancer.",Loss of heterozygosity by SCRaMbLEing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900161,Science China. Life sciences,2019 03 26,"Genetic variation drives phenotypic evolution within populations. Genetic variation can be divided into different forms according to the size of genomic changes. However, study of large-scale genomic variation such as structural variation and aneuploidy is still limited and mainly based on the static, predetermined feature of individual genomes. Here, using SCRaMbLE, different levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events including short-range LOH, long-range LOH and whole chromosome LOH were detected in evolved strains. By contrast, using rapid adaptive evolution, aneuploidy was detected in the adaptive strains. It was further found that deletion of gene GLN3, long-range LOH in the left arm of synthetic chromosome X, whole chromosome LOH of synthetic chromosome X, and duplication of chromosome VIII (trisomy) lead to increased rapamycin resistance in synthetic yeast. Comparative analysis of genome stability of evolved strains indicates that the aneuploid strain has a higher frequency of degeneration than the SCRaMbLEd strain. These findings enrich our understanding of genetic mechanism of rapamycin resistance in yeast, and provide valuable insights into yeast genome architecture and function.",What Do We Have to Lose? Offloading Through Moral Technologies: Moral Struggle and Progress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900160,Science and engineering ethics,2019 03 22,"Moral bioenhancement, nudge-designed environments, and ambient persuasive technologies may help people behave more consistently with their deeply held moral convictions. Alternatively, they may aid people in overcoming cognitive and affective limitations that prevent them from appreciating a situation's moral dimensions. Or they may simply make it easier for them to make the morally right choice by helping them to overcome sources of weakness of will. This paper makes two assumptions. First, technologies to improve people's moral capacities are realizable. Second, such technologies will actually help people get morality right and behave more consistently with whatever the 'real' right thing to do turns out to be. The paper then considers whether or not humanity loses anything valuable, particularly opportunities for moral progress, when being moral is made much easier by eliminating difficult moral deliberation and internal moral struggle. Ultimately, the worry that moral struggle has value as a catalyst for moral progress is rejected. Moral progress is understood here as the discovery and application of new values or sensitization to new sources of harm.",Work after prostate cancer: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900159,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,2019 04 29,"Research in the field of vocational rehabilitation, specifically for prostate cancer, remains rare despite increasing recognition of the role of vocational interventions in other cancer groups.

These results revealed that a single facial injection of BoNT/A induced a rapid and prolonged improvement of depression-like behaviors in naïve and space-restriction-stressed (SRS) mice, reflected by a decreased duration of immobility in behavioral despair tests. BoNT/A significantly increased the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in several brain regions, including the hippocampus and hypothalamus, in SRS mice. BoNT/A increased the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B in the hippocampus, which were significantly decreased in SRS mice. Furthermore, BoNT/A significantly increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, which were decreased in SRS mice. Finally, BoNT/A transiently increased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB), which were suppressed in the hippocampus of SRS mice. Collectively, these results demonstrated that BoNT/A treatment has anti-depressant-like activity in mice, and this is associated with increased 5-HT levels and the activation of BDNF/ERK/CREB pathways in the hippocampus, supporting further investigation of BoNT/A therapy in depression.","Outbreaks of Norovirus and Acute Gastroenteritis Associated with British Columbia Oysters, 2016-2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900141,Food and environmental virology,2019 05 16,"Two outbreaks of norovirus and acute gastroenteritis took place in Canada between November 2016 and April 2017. Both outbreaks were linked to oysters from British Columbia (BC) coastal waters. This paper describes the multi-agency investigations to identify the source and control the outbreak. Public health officials conducted interviews to determine case exposures. Traceback was conducted by collecting oyster tags from restaurants and analyzing them to determine the most common farms. Oyster samples were collected from case homes, restaurants, and harvest sites and tested for the presence of norovirus. Potential environmental pollution sources were investigated to identify the source of the outbreak. Four hundred and 49 cases were identified as part of the two outbreak waves. The oysters were traced to various geographically dispersed farms in BC coastal waters. Twelve farms were closed as a result of the investigations. No environmental pollution sources could be identified as the cause of the outbreak. Similarities in the timeframe, genotype, and geographic distribution of identified oyster farms indicate that they may have been one continuous event. Genotype data indicate that human sewage contamination was the likely cause of the outbreak, although no pollution source was identified.","Predicting the restrictive eating, exercise, and weight monitoring compulsions of anorexia nervosa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900140,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2019 03 22,"Compulsions surrounding restrictive eating, exercise, and weight monitoring are thought to maintain abnormal eating behaviour in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN).

Here, we sought to systematically characterize the serum and fecal BA profiles and the linkage between BAs and gut microbiota in PBC. The serum and fecal BAs were compared between 65 UDCA treatment-naive PBC and 109 healthy controls using UPLC-MS in cross-sectional study. In a prospective study, a subgroup of patients was enrolled for BA and microbiota analysis before and after UDCA therapy. BA compositions in serum and feces significantly differed between treatment-naive PBC and controls. Particularly, PBC was associated with decreased conversions of conjugated to unconjugated, and primary to secondary BAs, indicating impaired microbial metabolism of BAs. PBC patients at advanced stage exhibited a more abnormal BA profile compared with early-stage patients. UDCA treatment led to a decreased level of taurine-conjugated BAs, thereby reversing the conjugated/unconjugated ratio in PBC. Moreover, the level of secondary BAs such as DCA and conjugated DCA inversely correlated with PBC-enriched gut microbes (e.g., Veillonella, Klebsiella), while positively correlated with control-enriched microbes (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Oscillospira). Microbiota analysis also revealed a significant increase of taurine-metabolizing bacteria Bilophila spp. in patients after UDCA, which was strongly correlated with decreased taurine-conjugated BAs. In addition, serum FGF19 was remarkably increased in treatment-naïve PBC and decreased after UDCA. Our study established specific alterations of BA compositions in serum and feces of PBC, suggesting the potential for using BAs for diagnosis, and highlighting the possibility of modulating BA profile by altering gut microbiota. Graphical Abstract.",Expression of interleukins 6 and 10 and population of inflammatory cells in the equine endometrium: diagnostic implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900135,Molecular biology reports,2019 04 11,"Endometritis consists of an acute or chronic inflammatory process involving the endometrium and together with endometrosis constitute the main causes of infertility in mares. The aim of this study was to associate the histopathological findings with the immunohistochemical markers interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10) to evaluate the inflammatory changes and progression of uterine tissue lesions of mares in the diestrus phase and their diagnostic implications. Twelve crossbred cyclic mares were used for endometrial biopsy collection. Samples were collected in the diestrus period (6 ± 1 day after ovulation) without previous artificial insemination. In the histopathological analysis the samples were classified according to the type and intensity of inflammation, alterations regarding endometrial fibrosis and biopsy categories (I, IIA, IIB and III). In the immunohistochemical analysis, the markers of IL-6 and IL-10 were evaluated by scores (0, 2, 4, 6) according to the intensity of the immunostaining and inflammatory cells (CD-3, CD-20, CD-68 and MPO antibodies) and were counted according to the number of cells immunostained in brown, in ten random fields. An association (p ≤ 0.05) occurred between low score (2) for IL-6 in the endometrial glandular area and moderate fibrotic nets; and between high scores (4 and 6) for IL-10 in sub-epithelial connective tissue and moderate periglandular fibrosis. In conclusion, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated an association between interleukins and inflammatory cells with endometrial lesions. In addition, this research may be useful in the future to evaluate the progress of the inflammatory process, contributing to the adequate optimization of the reproductive management of the mares.","TNF-α G-308A genetic variants, serum CRP-hs concentration and DNA damage in obese women.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900134,Molecular biology reports,2019 03 22,"Obesity is associated with inflammation, which can disturb genome stability. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) polymorphism was found to affect TNF-α protein production and inflammation. Therefore, the present study illustrates the relationship between TNF-α polymorphism, the degree of inflammation assessed by serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (CRP-hs) and basal DNA damage in patients with obesity (BMI 30-34.9 kg/m2) and control subjects with proper body mass (BMI < 25 kg/m2). A total of 115 participants (75 obese premenopausal women; and 40 age-, and gender-matched controls) were included. Biochemical parameters (serum concentrations of total-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, apolipoprotein AI, CRP-hs) and endogenous DNA damage (determined by comet assay) were measured. TNF-α G-308A polymorphism (rs1800629) was analyzed by PCR-RFLP (PCR-restriction fragments length polymorphism). An effect of TNF-α genotype on serum CRP-hs concentration was noted (p = 0.031). In general, carriers of the rare A allele of the TNF-α G-308A polymorphism had significantly lower endogenous DNA damage and serum CRP-hs concentrations than GG homozygotes, however, the protective effect of the A allele was especially visible in non-obese women. Serum CRP-hs concentrations and levels of DNA damage (% DNA in tail) were significantly higher in obese than in controls (p = 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). The adjusted multiple linear regression analyses revealed a significant, independent impact of obesity on DNA damage (p = 0.00000) and no effect of other covariates i.e. age, TNF-α genotype and serum CRP-hs concentration. Our study showed that obesity has a significant impact on the levels of endogenous DNA damage. Obesity abolished the protective effect of A allele of the TNF-α G-308A polymorphism on DNA damage and on inflammation development observed in non-obese A allele carriers.","Tetrahydrocurcumin-loaded vaginal nanomicrobicide for prophylaxis of HIV/AIDS: in silico study, formulation development, and in vitro evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900133,Drug delivery and translational research,2019 03 22,"A vaginal microbicide is a front-line women-dependent approach and an alternative to a condom for prevention of unprotected sexual intercourse-associated HIV. The microbicide research is still in its infancy with several products in the clinical studies being reported to have good efficacy, safe, but with poor adherence. One such molecule reported with an excellent efficacy when tested preclinically is curcumin, a natural polyphenol derived from Curcuma longa. Despite its potential HIV-1 inhibitory activity, it has intense yellow color staining properties, which would result in poor consumer compliance and adherence for vaginal application. To address this issue, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), a colorless derivative of curcumin, was subjected to in silico screening (molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies) using homology model of gp120-CD4 binding. It was found that THC exhibited equivalent gp120-CD4 binding inhibitory activity as compared with curcumin due to its stable hydrophobic interactions with residues Asp368 and Trp427 deeper in the Phe43 cavity of CD4 receptor. Hence, it can be effectively used as a potential microbicide candidate. THC, a BCS Class II molecule exhibits poor solubility, spreadability, and intracellular uptake when used in the conventional form. Thus, it was decided to develop a lipid-based nanomicrobicide gel for delivery of THC. The developed THC-loaded o/w microemulsion gel was characterized for physicochemical properties (globule size, drug content, drug release, and permeation) and further used for in vitro cell line studies (cell viability, cellular uptake, and anti-HIV activity). The developed formulation was found to be stable with coitus-independent release profile and exhibited a rapid time-independent intracellular uptake. In addition, it exhibited a fourfold increase in efficacy as compared with conventional THC. Thus, the novel THC-loaded o/w microemulsion gel exhibited the potential for prevention of HIV-1 infection associated with unprotected sexual intercourse."

Sampling was carried out at two sites of Lahore, Pakistan-Havalian Karbath (site I) and Mehmood Booti (site II)-over a period of 1 month in the winter season. Metal analyses of samples were carried out using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS). The trend of essential elements in liver and intestine of site I was noticed as Fe > Zn > Cu > B > Mn > Se > Ni and almost same for bone and muscle as Fe > Zn > B > Mn > Cu > Se > Ni. It was noticed that Cu was less deposited in bone and muscle tissues compared to liver and intestine from site I. The deposition of essential elements in liver and intestine from site II was noticed as Fe > Zn > Cu > Mn > B > Se > Ni. Similar trend was found for bone and muscle: Fe > Zn > B > Mn > Cu > Se > Ni with great deposition of B than Cu compared to liver and intestine. The findings of the present study revealed almost similar trend for essential elements deposition at both sites. However, a random trend was observed for deposition of non-essential elements (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb) in organs from both sites. Moreover, data showed higher levels of non-essential elements accumulation (particularly As, Ba, and Pb) in the body tissues/organs of cattle egret in an urban area (site II) as compared to rural area (site I) of Lahore. Furthermore, non-essential elements were more in intestine, bone, and muscles from site II showing more exposure to some non-essential elements at urban site due to human and natural activities. However, higher concentration of non-essential elements in liver from site I as compared to other organs not only reflect the land exposure to plant growth promoting fertilizers and sewage water for irrigation purpose but also better detoxification abilities of the rural birds. The study gave a new insight to inform contamination levels in the rural and urban sites.

The enhanced strategies are divided into two approaches. The first strategy focuses on the regulation of carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio by co-digestion of WAS with carbon-rich substrates, including municipal solid wastes (MSW), marine algae, agricultural residues, and animal manures. The other strategy is to enhance the solubilization and hydrolysis of WAS or inhibit the methanogenesis by applying various pretreatments, such as mechanical, chemical, enzymatic, and thermal pretreatment. Finally, the applications of WAS-derived VFAs are discussed. The future researches in enhancing VFAs production and wide application of the VFAs from both technical and economic perspectives are proposed.",Lower cadmium accumulation and higher antioxidative capacity in edible parts of Brassica campestris L. seedlings applied with glutathione under cadmium toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900120,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 26,"Glutathione (GSH) is involved in not only plant developmental processes but also plant responses to abiotic stresses. A hydroponic experiment was performed to explore the protective roles of exogenous GSH in mitigating cadmium (Cd) stress in Brassica campestris L. seedlings by analyzing the morphological and physiological parameters. Results showed that Cd caused severe growth inhibition and Cd accumulation. However, application of GSH significantly mitigated toxic symptoms induced by Cd, including the improvement of the photosynthesis-, plant growth-, and root morphology-related parameters in seedlings under Cd stress. These responses were associated with a striking increase in activities of representative antioxidative enzymes and contents of corresponding non-enzymatic antioxidants. In vivo imaging of O2.- and H2O2, and the detection of lipid peroxidation further demonstrated that increased ability by GSH for Brassica campestris L. seedlings to endure Cd stress was consistent with a striking elevation of ratios of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid (AsA/DHA). Additionally, GSH application increased Cd retained in roots, thus significantly decreased its translocation from root to shoot, ultimately decreased Cd accumulation in shoots. Taken together, our results proved evidence for GSH in ameliorating Cd toxicity via reducing Cd accumulation in shoots and increasing oxidation resistance. Accordingly, application of GSH could be a high-efficiency and promising strategy to decrease Cd concentration in edible parts of Brassica campestris L. in agricultural production.",Effectiveness of vermicomposting for bioconversion of grape marc derived from red winemaking into a value-added product.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900119,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 22,"Grape marc, the main solid by-product of the wine industry, can be used as a nutrient-rich organic amendment if treated appropriately before its application into soil. In this study, we evaluated the potential of vermicomposting to process grape marc derived from the red winemaking of Mencía grapes in order to yield a high-quality, polyphenol-free organic vermicompost that could be used as an environmentally friendly fertiliser. We observed that the grape marc from this cultivar appears to be an optimum substrate for feeding earthworms providing optimum conditions for growth and reproduction, and sufficient energy to sustain large populations. Moreover, earthworm activity favoured the stabilisation of the grape marc resulting in a final vermicompost characterised by a higher concentration of macro- and micro-nutrients and a reduced polyphenol content after 112 days of vermicomposting. Lower values of microbial activity, indicative of stabilised materials, were recorded at the end of the process. These findings highlight vermicomposting as an environmentally sound management system for processing grape marc that could easily be scaled up for industrial application.",Pre-treatment with microRNA-181a Antagomir Prevents Loss of Parvalbumin Expression and Preserves Novel Object Recognition Following Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900118,Neuromolecular medicine,2019 05 16,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can result in permanent impairment in memory and learning and may be a precursor to other neurological sequelae.

Brains were assessed immunohistologically for the neuronal marker NeuN, the perineuronal net marker wisteria floribunda lectin (WFA), cFos, and the interneuron marker parvalbumin. Protein quantification was performed with immunoblots for synaptophysin and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95). Fluorescent in situ hybridization was utilized to localize hippocampal miR-181a expression. MiR-181a antagomir treatment reduced neuronal miR-181a expression after mTBI, restored deficits in novel object recognition and increased hippocampal parvalbumin expression in the dentate gyrus. These changes were associated with decreased dentate gyrus hyperactivity indicated by a relative reduction in PSD95 and cFos expression. These results suggest that miR-181a inhibition may be a therapeutic approach to reduce hippocampal excitotoxicity and prevent cognitive dysfunction following mTBI.",Remote Monitoring of Patient-Reported Outcomes in Ulcerative Colitis: A Prospective Real-World Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900117,PharmacoEconomics - open,2019 03 22,The 6-point version of the Mayo score relies on two patient-reported outcomes (PRO2): stool frequency and rectal bleeding.

Therefore, we designed and synthesized new derivatives characterized by a nitrogen-containing scaffold and evaluated their antiproliferative properties in tumor cells. We herein report the effects of three newly synthesized compounds on cell lines from three different human cancers: triple-negative breast cancer, colon carcinoma and glioblastoma. We found that two of these compounds did not affect proliferation, while the third significantly inhibited replication of the three cell lines. Moreover, this third molecule at 20 μM led to the upregulation of p21 and p27 and blockage of the cell cycle at G0/G1; in addition, it induced apoptosis in all three cell lines when used at higher concentrations (30-50 μM). The results demonstrate that this compound is a potent inhibitor of replication, an inducer of apoptosis and a negative regulator of cell cycle progression for cancer cells of different histotypes. Our data suggest a potential role for this new molecule as an interesting and powerful tool for new approaches in treating various cancers.",The long non-coding road to endogenous cardiac regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900115,Heart failure reviews,2019 06 13,"The human heart has a markedly low regenerative capacity, leaving patients who suffered from cardiac insults vulnerable to heart failure. The inability to regenerate lost myocardium is accompanied by extensive remodeling that leads to further deterioration in cardiac functions and structure. Although adult mammals seem to lack the ability to regenerate, some lower vertebrates have a cardio-regenerative potential. Emerging studies revealed that mammals do have the ability to undergo endogenous cardiac regeneration during development and shortly after birth. Later, it was proven that the source of the new cardiomyocytes is the proliferation of the pre-existing cardiomyocyte pool. Research is currently focused on finding suitable methods to restore this lost potential in adulthood and enhancing the proliferative capacity of cardiomyocytes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical functionally diverse epigenetic regulators capable of either activating or repressing gene expression. LncRNAs have been previously implicated in cardiac development, lineage commitment, and aging. Recent reports suggest that lncRNAs are capable of inducing endogenous cardiac regeneration through manipulating gene expression in cardiomyocytes. This review gives a concise overview of endogenous cardiac regeneration. It further summarizes and critically appraises the current literature on the roles of lncRNAs in endogenous cardiac regeneration and the challenges that face the field.",Estimation of tissue oxygen saturation from RGB images and sparse hyperspectral signals based on conditional generative adversarial network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900114,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2019 06 01,"Intra-operative measurement of tissue oxygen saturation ([Formula: see text]) is important in detection of ischaemia, monitoring perfusion and identifying disease.

Malignant catarrhal fever is a major cause of cattle loss in Africa with approximately 7% affected annually; and in North America has significant impact on bison farming. Research into the mechanisms by which OvHV-2 induces disease in susceptible species has been hampered by a lack of a cell culture system for the virus. Ov2 is a bZIP protein encoded by OvHV-2. Proteins with bZIP domains in other herpesviruses, such as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus K8 protein and the BZLF1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus are known to play important roles in lytic virus replication. Using a reporter based system, we demonstrate that Ov2 can modulate the activity of the major virus transactivator (Replication and Transcriptional Activator protein, RTA) to 1) drive expression of viral genes predicted to be required for efficient reactivation of the virus, including ORF49; and 2) differentially regulate the expression of the two virus encoded Bcl-2 homologues Ov4.5 and Ov9."

This overview aimed to assess the methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews that evaluated the diagnostic value of imaging modalities for lymph node involvement in patients with rectal cancer and to compare the diagnostic value of different modalities for lymph node involvement. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Literature were searched to identify relevant systematic reviews. The methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR checklist, and the reporting quality was assessed using PRISMA-DTA checklist. The indirect comparison was conducted to compare the accuracy of different imaging modalities. Seven systematic reviews involving 353 primary studies were included. The median (Range) AMSTAR scores were 6.0 (4.0-9.0); the median (Range) PRISMA-DTA scores were 18.0 (11.0-23.0). Sensitivity of MRI [0.69 (95% CI 0.63, 0.77)] was significantly higher than that of ERUS [0.57 (95% CI 0.53, 0.62)].

Several factors are critical to the prediction of aphasia recovery, including acute stroke management and subsequent language rehabilitation. A comprehensive assessment of language skills with appropriate instruments in different phases of post stroke months and years is needed in patients, in order to monitor their language improvement and to guide speech therapies over time. Beyond spontaneous recovery, the effects of speech and language therapy in terms of time and dosage of administration during the course of post stroke aphasia are still under investigation. Data point to its efficacy either in the early or in the chronic (> 6 months) post stroke phase, with greater effects if intensive treatments are provided. Tailored interventions for single patients' aphasia characteristics are recommended, with different levels of evidence for specific techniques.

Isolated headache is the most common symptom of ICH, while missing may be signs such as papilledema or sixth nerve palsy. This fact makes difficult the clinical diagnosis of headache attributable to ICH in headache sufferers. Another source of confusion stems from the CSF pressure measurement. It has been observed that a single-spot CSF opening pressure measurement may be insufficient to identify elevated CSF pressure in headache sufferers. A new method of CSF pressure measurement has been able to identify pressure-related features of isolated CSF hypertension (ICH). In fact, nocturnal or postural headache and abnormal pressure pulsations are the more common pressure-related features of ICH in patients with chronic headache. The compressive action of these abnormal pressure pulsations causes the periventricular white matter microstructure alterations leading to the focal diffusion tensor imaging findings in patients with ICH. Abnormal pressure pulsations are a marker of ICH in chronic headache. The identification of the CSF pressure-related features may be useful for differentiating headache sufferers with ICH from those with primary headache disorder in clinical practice. The therapeutic strategy in these headache sufferers with ICH includes the CSF removal and a medical treatment.",Severe Transitory Neonatal Neutropenia Associated with Maternal Autoimmune or Idiopathic Neutropenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900095,Journal of clinical immunology,2019 04 06,"Neonatal immune neutropenia is observed in rare cases in newborns from mothers with idiopathic or autoimmune neutropenia, secondary to passive transfer of maternal granulocyte auto-antibodies.",Abnormal change of paravertebral muscle in adult degenerative scoliosis and its association with bony structural parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900094,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",2019 03 22,"While many studies have explored the association between paravertebral muscle (PVM) change and low back pain/lumbar spinal stenosis, little is known about PVM change in adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS).

We use a three-dimensional or social approach to understanding wellbeing, which includes subjective and relational aspects in addition to the more traditional material dimension of wellbeing (e.g. financial resources, a healthy environment). Indigenous business leaders engaged in forestry, energy, and related resource sectors were recruited through our partner organization, the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, as a representative sample of key people to be engaged in the scoping of existing and future bioenergy partnerships in Canada. Participants often responded in ways that did not discretely fit into categories, but instead reflected a perspective on their own and their community's dimensions of social wellbeing, which we captured through open coding for emergent themes. Our findings on material wellbeing illustrate that relationships between different wellbeing dimensions need to be considered for community-appropriate bioenergy development.",Functional brain changes associated with cognitive training in healthy older adults: A preliminary ALE meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900077,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 22,"Accumulating evidence suggests that cognitive training (CT) programs may provide healthy older adults (OAs) with cognitive benefits that are accompanied by alterations in neural activity. The current review offers the first quantitative synthesis of the available literature on the neural effects of CT in healthy aging. It was hypothesized that OAs would evidence increased and decreased neural activations across various challenging CTs, and that these effects would be observed as significantly altered clusters within regions of the frontoparietal network (FPN). Online databases and reference lists were searched to identify peer-reviewed publications that reported assessment of neural changes associated with CT programs in healthy OAs. Among the 2097 candidate studies identified, 14 studies with a total of 238 participants met inclusionary criteria. GingerALE software was used to quantify neural effects in a whole-brain analysis. The activation likelihood estimation technique revealed significant increases in activation following CT in the left hemisphere middle frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex, extending to the superior occipital gyrus. Two clusters of diminished neural activity following CT were identified within the right hemisphere middle frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, extending to the superior temporal gyrus. These results provide preliminary evidence of common neural effects of different CT interventions within regions of the FPN. Findings may inform future investigations of neuroplasticity across the lifespan, including clinical applications of CT, such as assessing treatment outcomes.","Bioavailability and mobility of arsenic, cadmium, and manganese in gold mine tailings amended with rice husk ash and Fe-coated rice husk ash.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900076,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 04 20,"This study was conducted to determine the effects of rice husk ash (RHA) and Fe-coated rice husk ash (Fe-RHA) on the bioavailability and mobility of As, Cd, and Mn in mine tailings. The amendments were added to the tailings at 0, 5, 10, or 20% (w/w) and the mixtures were incubated for 0, 7, 15, 30, 45, and 60 days. The CaCl2 extractable As, Cd, and Mn in the amended tailings were determined at each interval of incubation period. In addition, the tailings mixture was leached with simulated rain water (SRW) every week from 0 day (D 0) until day 60 (D 60). The results showed that both RHA and Fe-RHA application significantly decreased the CaCl2-extractable Cd and Mn but increased that of As in the tailings throughout the incubation period. Consequently, addition of both RHA and Fe-RHA leached out higher amount of As from the tailings but decreased Cd and Mn concentration compared to the controls. The amount of As leached from the Fe-RHA-amended tailings was less than that from RHA-amended tailings. Application of both RHA and Fe-RHA could be an effective way in decreasing the availability of cationic heavy metals (Cd and Mn) in the tailings but these amendments could result in increasing the availability of anionic metalloid (As). Therefore, selection of organic amendments to remediate metal-contaminated tailings must be done with great care because the outcomes might be different among the elements.",Measuring situation awareness and team effectiveness in pediatric acute care by using the situation global assessment technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900075,European journal of pediatrics,2019 06 10,"Situation awareness (SA) is an important human factor and necessary for effective teamwork and patient safety. Human patient simulation (HPS) with video feedback allows for a safe environment where health care professionals can develop both technical and teamwork skills. It is, however, very difficult to observe and measure SA directly. The Situation Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) was developed by Endsley to measure SA during real-time simulation. Our objective was to measure SA among team members during simulation of acute pediatric care scenarios on the medical ward and its relationship with team effectiveness. Twenty-four pediatric teams, consisting of two nurses, one resident, and one consultant, participated in three acute care scenarios, using high-fidelity simulation. Individual SAGAT scores contained shared and complimentary knowledge questions on different levels of SA. Within each scenario, two ""freezes"" were incorporated to assess SA of each team members' clinical assessment and decision-making. SA overlap within the team (team SA) was computed and compared to indicators of team effectiveness (time to goal achievement, consensus on primary problem, diagnosis, task prioritization, leadership, and teamwork satisfaction). In 13 scenarios (18%), the team failed to reach the primary goals within the prescribed time of 1200 s. There was no significant difference in failure of goal completion between the scripted scenarios; however, there was a significant difference between scenario 3 and the other scenarios in time to goal completion. In all three scenarios, SA overlap level 2 (consensus on primary problem during the first freeze and consensus on diagnosis during the second freeze) leads to significantly faster achievement of the predefined goals. There was a strong relationship between team SA on the primary problem and diagnosis and team SA on task prioritization. Consensus on leadership within the team was low. Teamwork satisfaction was more influenced by knowledge about the importance of the assigned task than outcome of the scenario.Conclusion: The use of SAGAT enables us to measure SA of team members during real-time simulation of acute care scenarios. Although there is no direct connection between team SA and goal achievement, SAGAT provides insight in differences in SA among team members, and the process of shared mental model formation. By measuring SA, issues that may improve team effectiveness (prioritizing tasks, enhancing shared mental models, and providing leadership) can be trained and assessed during medical team simulation, enhancing teamwork in health care settings. What is known? • Teamwork skills such as communication, leadership, and situational awareness have become increasingly recognized as essential for good performance in pediatric resuscitation. However, the assessment of pediatric team performance in these clinical situations has been traditionally difficult. • The Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) is a method of objectively and directly measuring SA during a team simulation using ""freezes"" at predetermined points in time with participants reporting on ""what is going on"" from their perspective on the situation. What is new? • We assessed SA, and its relationship with team effectiveness, in multidisciplinary pediatric teams performing simulated critical events in critically ill children on the medical ward using the SAGAT model, outside the emergency room setting. • In all three scenarios, consensus on the primary problem (shared mental model) leads to faster achievement of predefined goals. Consensus on leadership was overall low, without a significant impact on goal achievement.",Association of cerebral activity with MRI scans in infants with neonatal encephalopathy undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900074,European journal of pediatrics,2019 05 16,"We aimed to correlate amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) in neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) with early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this retrospective study, 32 neonates over 35 weeks' gestation with moderate/severe HIE who were treated with hypothermia were included. Early MRI scans and daily aEEG background were categorized to mild/normal, moderate, and severely abnormal. Time to sleep cycling was noted on aEEG. Mantel-Haenszel test for trends was used to explore associations between aEEG and MRI and outcome. LOESS regression was used for exploring the association of cycling with MRI scores. MRI was normal/mildly abnormal in 20 (63%) infants; in 9 (28%), moderately abnormal; and in 3 (9%), severely abnormal. Twenty-seven (84%) infants s urvived. MRI severity score was significantly associated with aEEG background score on the third and fourth days of life (p < 0.01). An increase in the MRI severity score was noted if sleep cycling appeared after the fifth day of life.Conclusions: Depressed aEEG at the third and fourth days of life and appearance of cycling beyond the fifth day of life are associated with cerebral MRI abnormalities and may be associated with increased risk of abnormal outcome. What is known: • Since therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to change long-term outcome, amplitude-integrated EEG in infants with hypoxic ischemic neonatal encephalopathy soon after birth have a limited predictive power for long-term outcome in treated infants. • Brain MRI after therapeutic hypothermia in the above infants has a significant predictive value for long-term outcome What is new: • Background amplitude-integrated EEG activity depression at the age of 3 and 4 days and delay of appearance of cycling activity are associated with worse MRI scores and may be predictive of worse long-term outcome.",Current Scenario of Pb Toxicity in Plants: Unraveling Plethora of Physiological Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900073,Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 03 22,"Lead (Pb) is an extremely toxic metal for all living forms including plants. It enters plants through roots from soil or soil solution. It is considered as one of the most eminent examples of anthropogenic environmental pollutant added in environment through mining and smelting of lead ores, coal burning, waste from battery industries, leaded paints, metal plating, and automobile exhaust. Uptake of Pb in plants is a nonselective process and is driven by H+/ATPases. Translocation of Pb metal ions occurs by apoplastic movement resulting in deposition of metal ions in the endodermis and is further transported by symplastic movement. Plants exposed to high concentration of Pb show toxic symptoms due to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through Fenton-Haber-Weiss reaction. ROS include superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and hydrogen peroxide, which reach to macro- and micro-cellular levels in the plant cells and cause oxidative damage. Plant growth and plethora of biochemical and physiological attributes including plant growth, water status, photosynthetic efficiency, antioxidative defense system, phenolic compounds, metal chelators, osmolytes, and redox status are adversely influenced by Pb toxicity. Plants respond to toxic levels of Pb in varied ways such as restricted uptake of metal, chelation of metal ions to the root endodermis, enhancement in activity of antioxidative defense, alteration in metal transporters expression, and involvement of plant growth regulators.",Characterization and genome annotation of a newly detected bacteriophage infecting multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900072,Archives of virology,2019 06 16,"A novel virulent bacteriophage, φAbp2, infecting multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii was isolated from the wastewater of a sewage management centre at Southwest Hospital, China. Transmission electron microscopy and phylogenetic analysis revealed that φAbp2 belongs to the subfamily Peduovirinae. A one-step growth curve demonstrated that φAbp2 had a latent period of 15 min, a lysis period of 35 min, and a burst size of 222 particles per infected host cell. Moreover, φAbp2 showed a relatively broad host range in local A. baumannii, and it also exhibited tolerance over a wider range of thermal and pH conditions. Genomic sequencing revealed that φAbp2 has a circular double-stranded DNA genome with no sequence similarity to our previously isolated φAbp1. Eighty-eight putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 41 proteins of known function and 47 of unknown function were identified, and the G/C content was 37.84%. φAbp2 is a new member of the subfamily Peduovirinae of the family Myoviridae.

JEV infection of swine, which are the main amplifying hosts for JEV, can cause reproductive failure in sows; in boars it can cause testitis and infertility. The prevalence of JEV in swine is a continuous threat to human health. A practical diagnostic method for monitoring JEV infection in swine herds is essential for control of the disease in both swine and humans. Here, we have identified a high-affinity anti-JEV NS1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) by indirect ELISA and utilized it for the development of a blocking ELISA (bELISA). The optimal NS1 protein coating concentration (2 μg/mL) and mAb working concentration (1 μg/mL) were determined by checkerboard titration. One hundred ten JEV-antibody-negative serum samples were used to establish 34.03% inhibition as the cutoff value for a negative result. By the bELISA, seroconversion in 80% of newly JEV-vaccinated pigs was detected by 7 days post-immunization, while by the commercial envelope-protein-based iELISA, seroconversion was detected in 20% of the newly vaccinated pigs. We found 98.7% agreement between the bELISA and the commercial iELISA when we tested 157 field samples using both methods.

BLASTp analysis of the translated sequences of ORFs 0, 1 and 2 revealed that their amino acid sequences differed by more than 10% from the corresponding protein sequences of other poleroviruses. These results suggest that this virus is a putative novel member of the genus Polerovirus, which has been provisionally named ""pumpkin polerovirus"" (PuPV)."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted. A proposal addressing a pathogen priority list (PPL) for ICU, arising from the TOTEM study, was compared with a sample of global experts in infections in critically ill patients. The survey was responded by 129 experts. Globally, ESBL Enterobacteriaceae, followed by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, were the main concerns. Some differences in opinion were identified between 63 (49%) ICU physicians (ICU/anesthesiology) and 43 (33%) infectious disease consultants (ID physicians/microbiologists). The pathogens most concerning in the ICU for intensivists were ESBL Enterobacteriaceae (38%) versus carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (48.3%) for ID consultants, (p < 0.05). Increasing number of ID consultants over intensivists (26% vs 14%) reported difficulty in choosing initial therapy for carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. For intensivists, the urgent measures to limit development of antibiotic resistance were headed by cohort measures (26.3%) versus increasing nurse/patient ratio (32.5%) for ID consultants, (p < 0.05). Regarding effectiveness to prevent MDR development and spread, education programs (42.4%) were the priority for intensivists versus external consultation (35.7%) for ID consultants. Finally, both groups agreed that carbapenem resistance was the most pressing concern (> 70%) regarding emerging resistance. Differences in priorities regarding organisms, infection control practices, and educational priorities were visualized between ID/clinical microbiologists and ICU/anesthesiologists.

In other words, only particular endophytic fungal taxa from the available inoculum pool may be able to colonize a given plant species. We tested that hypothesis in Bromus tectorum, an important invasive species in the arid, western United States. We collected seed from Bromus tectorum and sources of inoculum for endophytic fungi including soil and various kinds of plant litter at a field site in central Utah. We characterized, using Illumina sequencing, the endophytic fungal communities in the various inoculum sources, inoculated Bromus tectorum seedlings under gnotobiotic conditions with the various sources, and then characterized the communities of endophytic fungi that assembled in their roots and leaves. Different inoculum sources containing significantly different endophytic fungal communities produced complex communities of endophytic fungi in leaves and roots of Bromus tectorum. In leaves, the communities assembling from the various inoculum sources were not significantly different from each other and, in roots, they were only slightly different from each other, mainly due to variation in a single fungal OTU, Coprinopsis brunneofibrillosa. Consequently, there was significantly more variation in the structure of the communities of endophytic fungi among the inoculum sources than in the resultant endophytic fungal communities in the leaves and roots of Bromus tectorum. These results are consistent with biotic filtering playing a significant role in endophytic fungal community assembly.",Harnessing the knowledge of protein secretion for enhanced protein production in filamentous fungi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900052,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2019 04 24,"Filamentous fungi are important microorganisms used in industrial production of proteins and enzymes.

This article focuses on the modeling of one aspect of thrombosis, the coagulation cascade, which is initiated by the contact activation at the device surface and forms thrombin. Models exist representing the coagulation cascade by a series of reactions, usually solved in quiescent plasma. However, large parameter uncertainty involved in the kinetic models can affect the predictive capabilities of this approach. In addition, the large number of reactions of the kinetic models prevents their use in the simulation of complex flow configurations encountered in medical devices. In the current work, both issues are addressed to improve the applicability and fidelity of kinetic models. A sensitivity analysis is performed by two different techniques to identify the most sensitive parameters of an existing detailed kinetic model of the coagulation cascade. The results are used to select the form of a novel reduced model of the coagulation cascade which relies on eight chemical reactors only. Then, once its parameters have been calibrated thanks to the Bayesian inference, this model shows good predictive capabilities for different initial conditions.",A novel porous media-based approach to outflow boundary resistances of 1D arterial blood flow models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900050,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,2019 03 22,"In this paper we introduce a novel method for prescribing terminal boundary conditions in one-dimensional arterial flow networks.

First, we investigate model parameters that have a profound influence on the flow and pressure distributions of the system. The simulation results have been compared against the waveforms generated by three elements (RCR) Windkessel model. The proposed model is also integrated into a realistic arterial tree, and the results obtained have been compared against experimental data at different locations of the network.

We clarified the taxonomic position of Ochrobactrum cytisi strain IPA7.2 and investigated its tolerance for salinity, high temperature, and glyphosate pollution. We also tested the strain's potential to promote the growth of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) microplants. Using the IPA7.2 draft genome (no. NZ_MOEC00000000), we searched for housekeeping genes and also for the target genes encoding glyphosate tolerance and plant-growth-promoting ability. A multilocus sequence analysis of the gap, rpoB, dnaK, trpE, aroC, and recA housekeeping genes led us to identify isolate IPA7.2 as O. cytisi. The strain tolerated temperatures up to 50 °C and NaCl concentrations up to 3-4%, and it produced 8 µg ml-1 of indole-3-acetic acid. It also tolerated 6 mM glyphosate owing to the presence of type II 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase. Finally, it was able to colonize the roots and tissues of potato microplants, an ability preserved by several generations after subculturing. We identified the development phase of potato microplants that was optimal for inoculation with O. cytisi IPA7.2. Inoculation of in vitro-grown 15-day-old microplants increased the mitotic index of root meristem cells (by 50%), the length of shoots (by 34%), the number of leaves (by 7%), and the number of roots (by 16%). Under ex vitro conditions, the inoculated plants had a greater leaf area (by 77%) and greater shoot and root dry weight (by 84 and 61%, respectively) than did the control plants.

This paper presents automatic glioma tumor grade identification from magnetic resonant images using Wndchrm tool based classifier (Weighted Neighbour Distance using Compound Heirarchy of Algorithms Representing Morphology) and VGG-19 deep convolutional neural network (DNN). For experimentation, DICOM images are collected from reputed government hospital and the proposed intelligent system categorized the tumor into four grades such as low grade glioma, oligodendroglioma, anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma multiform. After preprocessing, features are extracted, optimized and then classified using Windchrm tool where the most significant features are selected on the basis of Fisher score. In the case of DNN classifier, data augmentation is also performed before applying the images into the deep learning network. The performance of the classifiers are analysed with various measures such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and F1-score. The results showed reasonably good performance with a maximum classification accuracy of 92.86% for the Wndchrm classifier and 98.25% for VGG-19 DNN classifier.

This study was designed to investigate the effects of artificial inoculation of seedlings of a major urban forest tree, Arizona cypress (Cupressus arizonica Greene) with beneficial microorganisms under the stress of air pollution caused by exhaust emissions from fuel pollutants (FP). We conducted this research as a completely randomized design in a form of split-factorial with three factors comprising arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis or Funneliformis mosseae or a mixture of both species, bacterial inoculation with Pseudomonas fluorescens and non-inoculated controls, and two levels of FP (fuel pollutants and non-fuel pollutants) using three replications of each treatment. Fuel pollutants significantly reduced root colonization, shoot and root dry weight, nutrient concentrations (N, P, K, and Fe), glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP), and chlorophyll concentration, while increasing proline content, enzyme activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations in Arizona cypress seedlings. Nevertheless, adverse effects of FP in the inoculated plants (especially AMF plants) were less than in the non-inoculated plants. Inoculations of AMF especially the mixture of both mycorrhizal species effectively alleviated the negative effects of FP on Arizona cypress seedlings. This promising effect was related to increased GRSP content in the media which improved concentrations of N, P, and Fe in plants, enhanced chlorophyll concentration, and elevated enzymatic antioxidants such as ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase which resulted in increased dry mass of the plants under air pollution stress.",Glioblastoma adhesion in a quick-fit hybrid microdevice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900024,Biomedical microdevices,2019 04 07,"Translational research requires reliable biomedical microdevices (BMMD) to mimic physiological conditions and answer biological questions. In this work, we introduce a reversibly sealed quick-fit hybrid BMMD that is operator-friendly and bubble-free, requires low reagent and cell consumption, enables robust and high throughput performance for biomedical experiments. Specifically, we fabricate a quick-fit poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PMMA/PDMS) prototype to illustrate its utilities by probing the adhesion of glioblastoma cells (T98G and U251MG) to primary endothelial cells. In static condition, we confirm that angiopoietin-Tie2 signaling increases the adhesion of glioblastoma cells to endothelial cells. Next, to mimic the physiological hemodynamic flow and investigate the effect of physiological electric field, the endothelial cells are pre-conditioned with concurrent shear flow (with fixed 1 Pa shear stress) and direct current electric field (dcEF) in the quick-fit PMMA/PDMS BMMD. With shear flow alone, endothelial cells exhibit classical parallel alignment; while under a concurrent dcEF, the cells align perpendicularly to the electric current when the dcEF is greater than 154 V m- 1. Moreover, with fixed shear stress of 1 Pa, T98G glioblastoma cells demonstrate increased adhesion to endothelial cells conditioned in dcEF of 154 V m- 1, while U251MG glioblastoma cells show no difference. The quick-fit hybrid BMMD provides a simple and flexible platform to create multiplex systems, making it possible to investigate complicated biological conditions for translational research.",Exogenous GDF11 attenuates non-canonical TGF-β signaling to protect the heart from acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30900023,Basic research in cardiology,2019 05 15,"Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is a member of the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) superfamily that reverses age-related cardiac hypertrophy, improves muscle regeneration and angiogenesis, and maintains progenitor cells in injured tissue. Recently, targeted myocardial delivery of the GDF11 gene in aged mice was found to reduce heart failure and enhance the proliferation of cardiac progenitor cells after myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). No investigations have as yet explored the cardioprotective effect of exogenous recombinant GDF11 in acute I-R injury, despite the convenience of its clinical application. We sought to determine whether exogenous recombinant GDF11 protects against acute myocardial I-R injury and investigate the underlying mechanism in Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that GDF11 reduced arrhythmia severity and successfully attenuated myocardial infarction; GDF11 also increased cardiac function after I-R, enhanced HO-1 expression and decreased oxidative damage. GDF11 activated the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway and inactivated the non-canonical pathways, ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Moreover, administration of GDF11 prior to reperfusion protected the heart from reperfusion damage. Notably, pretreatment with the activin-binding protein, follistatin (FST), inhibited the cardioprotective effects of GDF11 by blocking its activation of Smad2/3 signaling and its inactivation of detrimental TGF-β signaling. Our data suggest that exogenous GDF11 has cardioprotective effects and may have morphologic and functional recovery in the early stage of myocardial I-R injury. GDF11 may be an innovative therapeutic approach for reducing myocardial I-R injury."

According to the sediment risk assessment indices such as mean effects range-median quotient (M-ERM-Q), the ecological risk of multiple PAHs was low. Risk quotient (RQ) calculation of water samples suggested high ecological risk level for Benzo[a]anthracene (BaA), and low to moderate for other individual PAHs and ΣPAHs. The result of PAHs partitioning between sediment and water phases revealed that most PAHs prefer to accumulate in sediment.

Here we used low-intensity transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to suppress soleus EMG activity during push-off as an estimate of corticospinal drive in CP adults and neurologically intact (NI) adults. Ten CP adults (age 34 years, SD 14.6, GMFCS I-II) and ten NI adults (age 33 years, SD 9.8) walked on a treadmill at their preferred walking speed. TMS of the leg motor cortex was elicited just prior to push-off during gait at intensities below threshold for motor-evoked potentials. Soleus EMG from steps with and without TMS were averaged and compared. Control experiments were performed while standing and in NI adults during gait at slow speed. TMS induced a suppression at a latency of about 40 ms. This suppression was similar in the two populations when differences in control EMG and gait speed were taken into account (CP 18%, NI 16%). The threshold of the suppression was higher in CP adults. The findings suggest that corticospinal drive to ankle plantar flexors at push-off is comparable in CP and NI adults. The higher threshold of the suppression in CP adults may reflect downregulation of cortical inhibition to facilitate corticospinal drive. Interventions aiming to facilitate excitability in cortical networks may contribute to maintain or even improve efficient gait in CP adults.",Spinal reciprocal inhibition in the co-contraction of the lower leg depends on muscle activity ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899999,Experimental brain research,2019 06 10,"The spinal reciprocal inhibition during co-contraction remains unclear. Reports on the reciprocal Ia and D1 inhibitions in the co-contraction are lacking, and a point about the muscle activity amount during co-contraction is unclear. This study aimed to clarify the influence of changes in the ratio of soleus (Sol) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscle activities in co-contraction on reciprocal Ia and D1 inhibitions. Twenty healthy adults were subjected to four stimulatory conditions: a conditioning stimulus-test stimulation interval (CTI) of - 2, 2, or 20 ms or a test stimulus without a conditioning stimulus (single). Co-contraction [change in (Sol)/(TA) activity] was examined at task A, 0%/0% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC); task B, 5%/5% MVC; task C, 15%/15% MVC; task D, 5%/15% MVC; and task E, 15%/5% MVC. At 2-ms CTI, the H-reflex amplitude value was significantly lower in tasks A, B, C, and D than in the single condition. Among the tasks, the H-reflex amplitude values were lower for A, B, C, and D than for E. At 20-ms CTI, the H-reflex amplitude was significantly lower in tasks A, B, C, D, and E. Among the tasks, the H-reflex amplitude was significantly lower from task A and B to task E. The change in the muscle activity ratio during co-contraction could modulate reciprocal Ia inhibition depending on the Sol/TA muscle activity ratio. D1 inhibition at rest did not differ significantly when the Sol/TA ratio was equal or when TA muscle activity was high. During co-contraction with high Sol muscle activity, D1 inhibition decreased from rest."

For this purpose, a strong inducible promoter that allows protein accumulation without possible negative effects on cell multiplication and biomass accumulation is desirable. A previous study at our laboratory identified that the CrGPDH3 gene from C. reinhardtii was inducible under NaCl treatments. In this study, we cloned and characterized a 3012 bp sequence upstream of the start codon of the CrGPDH3 gene, including the 285 bp 5' untranslated region. This region was identified as the full-length promoter and named PromA (- 2727 to + 285). Deletion analysis of PromA using GUSPlus as a reporter gene enabled us to identify PromC (- 653 to + 285) as the core promoter, displaying basal expression. A region named RIA1 (- 2727 to - 1672) was suggested to contain the NaCl response elements. Moreover, deletion analysis of RIA1 enabled us to identify a region of 577 bp named RIA3 (- 2727 to - 2150) that, when cloned upstream of PromC, was able to drive the expression of GUSPlus in response to 5 and 100 mM NaCl, and 100 mM KCl, similar to the native CrGPDH3 promoter. These results expand our understanding of the transcriptional mechanism of CrGPDH3 and clearly show that CrGPDH3 promoter and its chimeric forms are highly salt-inducible and can be used as inducible promoters for the overexpression of transgenes in C. reinhardtii.","Rituximab dosing in hematological malignancies: an old question, revisited.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899984,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,2019 03 22,"Rituximab is the standard of care for most B-cell malignancies.

As a result, decomposition rates of different leaf species can show contrasting responses to stream nutrient enrichment resulting from human activities. It is unclear, however, whether the root cause of such discrepancies in field observations is the interspecific variation in either litter nutrient or litter lignin concentrations. To address this question, we conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with a known fungal community to determine decomposition rates of 38 leaf species exhibiting contrasting litter traits (N, P and lignin concentrations), which were exposed to 8 levels of dissolved N concentrations representative of field conditions across European streams (0.07 to 8.96 mg N L-1). The effect of N enrichment on decomposition rate was modelled using Monod kinetics to quantify N effects across litter species. Lignin concentration was the most important litter trait determining decomposition rates and their response to N enrichment. In particular, increasing dissolved N supply from 0.1 to 3.0 mg N L-1 accelerated the decomposition of lignin-poor litter (e.g. < 10% of lignin, 2.9× increase ± 1.4 SD, n = 14) more strongly than that of litter rich in lignin (e.g. > 15% of lignin, 1.4× increase ± 0.2 SD, n = 9). Litter nutrient concentrations were less important, with a slight positive effect of P on decomposition rates and no effect of litter N. These results indicate that shifts in riparian vegetation towards species characterized by high litter lignin concentrations could alleviate the stimulation of C turnover by stream nutrient enrichment.",Early evaluation of tumor response to 90Y-ibritumomab radioimmunotherapy in relapsed/refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma: what is the optimal timing for FDG-PET/CT?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899979,European radiology,2019 06 10,To determine the earliest optimal timing for assessment of early response following radioimmunotherapy in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients using FDG-PET/CT.,Comparison of prognostic values of primary tumor and nodal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in non-small cell lung cancer with N1 disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899978,European radiology,2019 03 22,"We hypothesized that, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with N1 metastasis, N1 nodal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) status offers independent and incremental prognostic value.",Predicting liver failure after extended right hepatectomy following right portal vein embolization with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899977,European radiology,2019 03 22,Predicting post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) after extended right hepatectomy following portal vein embolization (PVE) from serial gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).,Comparative reviews of diagnostic test accuracy in imaging research: evaluation of current practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899976,European radiology,2019 03 22,The purpose of this methodological review was to determine the extent to which comparative imaging systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) use primary studies with comparative or non-comparative designs.,MDCT findings predicting post-operative residual tumor and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899975,European radiology,2019 06 10,To predict residual tumor (R) classification and overall survival (OS) on preoperative MDCT in patients who underwent first-line surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).,Diagnostic value of MRI-PDFF for hepatic steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30899974,European radiology,2019 06 10,To systematically review studies about the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) in the classification of hepatic steatosis grade in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
