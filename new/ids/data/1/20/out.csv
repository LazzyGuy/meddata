This arose the question of the relationships between the endocrine and exocrine parts of the pancreas in T1D pathogenesis. Our review underlines that histological anomalies of the exocrine pancreas are common in patients with T1D: intralobular and interacinar fibrosis, acinar atrophy, fatty infiltration, leucocytic infiltration, and pancreatic arteriosclerosis are all frequent observations. Moreover, 25% to 75% of adult patients with T1D present with pancreatic exocrine dysfunction. Our review summarizes the putative causal factors for these structural and functional anomalies, including: 1/ alterations of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide secretion, 2/ global pancreatic inflammation 3/ autoimmunity targeting the exocrine pancreas, 4/ vascular and neural abnormalities, and 5/ the putative involvement of pancreatic stellate cells. These observations have also given rise to new theories on T1D: the primary event of T1D pathogenesis could be non-specific, e.g bacterial or viral or chemical, resulting in global pancreatic inflammation, which in turn could cause beta-cell predominant destruction by the immune system. Finally, this review emphasizes that it is advisable to evaluate pancreatic exocrine function in patients with T1D presenting with gastro-intestinal complaints, as a clinical trial has shown that pancreatic enzymes replacement therapy can reduce the frequency of hypoglycemia and thus might improve quality of life in subjects with T1D and exocrine failure.",Psychological well-being and weight-related teasing in childhood obesity: a case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077019,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2019 05 11,"The prevalence of childhood obesity continues to increase worldwide. The aims of this study were to (1) assess the psychological well-being and rates of teasing of Spanish children with obesity (OG) and compare them with their non-overweight peers (NG), and (2) analyze the mediating role of weight-related teasing on the relation between children's BMI z score and psychological well-being.",The development of a body comparison measure: the CoSS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077018,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2019 05 11,"This study reports on the development and validation of a brief and widely applicable measure of body comparison (the Comparison of Self-Scale-CoSS), which is a maintaining feature of eating disorders.",Family Emotional Climate and Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077017,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 05 11,"Little research has examined family emotional climate in the context of having a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The goal of the current study was to determine how the emotional quality of family subsystems (parent-child and parent couple relationships, for both mothers and fathers) combine to create various classes of family emotional climate and to identify predictors of class membership in 148 families of children with ASD. The emotional quality of family subsystems was assessed using Five Minute Speech Samples from mothers and fathers. In total, 148 families of children with ASD (86% male) aged 6-13 years were included in analyses. About one-third of parents did not have a college degree and more than two-thirds were of non-Hispanic White origin. Latent class analysis revealed that 43% of the sample was characterized by high levels of warmth and low levels of criticism in both the parent-child and parent couple relationships; 12% of the sample was characterized by low warmth and high criticism in both sets of relationships; and the rest of the sample was divided among three additional classes of emotional climate characterized by different configurations of warmth and criticism across both sets of relationships. Parent level of broader autism phenotype and child emotional and behavioral problems were associated with emotional climate class membership. Implications for interventions are discussed.",Maximum Likelihood Analysis of Linear Mediation Models with Treatment-Mediator Interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077016,Psychometrika,2019 05 11,"This research concerns a mediation model, where the mediator model is linear and the outcome model is also linear but with a treatment-mediator interaction term and a residual correlated with the residual of the mediator model. Assuming the treatment is randomly assigned, parameters in this mediation model are shown to be partially identifiable. Under the normality assumption on the residual of the mediator and the residual of the outcome, explicit full-information maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters are introduced given the correlation between the residual for the mediator and the residual for the outcome. A consistent variance matrix of these estimates is derived. Currently, the coefficients of this mediation model are estimated using the iterative feasible generalized least squares (IFGLS) method that is originally developed for seemingly unrelated regressions (SURs). We argue that this mediation model is not a system of SURs. While the IFGLS estimates are consistent, their variance matrix is not. Theoretical comparisons of the FIMLE variance matrix and the IFGLS variance matrix are conducted. Our results are demonstrated by simulation studies and an empirical study. The FIMLE method has been implemented in a freely available R package iMediate.",Where Is Dopamine and how do Immune Cells See it?: Dopamine-Mediated Immune Cell Function in Health and Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077015,Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2019 06 10,"Dopamine is well recognized as a neurotransmitter in the brain, and regulates critical functions in a variety of peripheral systems. Growing research has also shown that dopamine acts as an important regulator of immune function. Many immune cells express dopamine receptors and other dopamine related proteins, enabling them to actively respond to dopamine and suggesting that dopaminergic immunoregulation is an important part of proper immune function. A detailed understanding of the physiological concentrations of dopamine in specific regions of the human body, particularly in peripheral systems, is critical to the development of hypotheses and experiments examining the effects of physiologically relevant dopamine concentrations on immune cells. Unfortunately, the dopamine concentrations to which these immune cells would be exposed in different anatomical regions are not clear. To address this issue, this comprehensive review details the current information regarding concentrations of dopamine found in both the central nervous system and in many regions of the periphery. In addition, we discuss the immune cells present in each region, and how these could interact with dopamine in each compartment described. Finally, the review briefly addresses how changes in these dopamine concentrations could influence immune cell dysfunction in several disease states including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, as well as the collection of pathologies, cognitive and motor symptoms associated with HIV infection in the central nervous system, known as NeuroHIV. These data will improve our understanding of the interactions between the dopaminergic and immune systems during both homeostatic function and in disease, clarify the effects of existing dopaminergic drugs and promote the creation of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulating immune function through dopaminergic signaling. Graphical Abstract.","Determinants of Parental Intentions to Vaccinate Kindergarten Children Against Seasonal Influenza in Xiamen, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077014,The journal of primary prevention,2019 06 13,"Seasonal influenza epidemics occur almost every year, and children under 6 years of age constitute one of the most susceptible groups. While free vaccinations are offered to preschool children in some large cities in China, Xiamen lacks a free vaccination policy and other effective policies aimed at increasing parents' acceptance of the vaccine. Using the health belief model (HBM), we sought to: (1) investigate the determinants of parents' intentions to vaccinate their kindergarten children against seasonal influenza if the free policy were implemented, and (2) explore the possible interaction effects between ""cues to action"" and ""perceived susceptibility"" and/or ""perceived severity."" A total of 1350 parents with kindergarten children were selected by stratified random sampling from half the population in Xiamen, of whom 1211 responded effectively to our survey. Scobit models with testing for interactions among the key concepts of the HBM were used to investigate factors associated with parents' intentions to vaccinate their children. In total, 85.1% of 1211 parents reported that they were willing to vaccinate their children if free influenza vaccinations were offered, although only 37 children (3.1%) had received influenza vaccination in the previous year, and 261 (21.6%) had been vaccinated since birth. Parents' perceived susceptibility (AOR = 1.77), perceived benefits (AOR = 3.12), perceived barriers (AOR = 0.38) and cues to action (AOR = 3.54) in terms of childhood vaccination against influenza were significantly associated with their vaccination intentions. The only observed interaction effect was between perceived susceptibility and cues to action (AOR = 1.57), which had additive effects on strengthening parental intentions to vaccinate their children. Our findings can be used as a basis for formulating government strategies aimed at improving influenza vaccination coverage among children in kindergarten and guiding culturally informed primary prevention efforts among their parents.",On the activation and deactivation pathways of the Lck kinase domain: a computational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077013,Journal of computer-aided molecular design,2019 06 10,"Here we report the description of the conformational pathways connecting the Lck active and inactive states by means of all-atoms molecular dynamics simulations coupled to an enhancing sampling methodology. By such an approach, we describe the major structural determinants characterizing these large conformational transitions and compare such pathways to those obtained for a similar kinase, i.e. c-Src. Our results show that both the activation and deactivation processes could follow distinct pathways, differentiated by the order by which the A-loop and the C-helix regions rearrange.",Estrogen-independent role of ERα in ovarian cancer progression induced by leptin/Ob-Rb axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077012,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2019 05 11,"Leptin induces ovarian cancer cell invasion via overexpression of MMP7, MMP9, and upA. In addition, the key role of ERα in leptin-increased cell growth was indicated. However, the influence of ER on leptin-mediated cell invasion remains still unknown. The present study was designed to evaluate the E2-independent effect of ERα/β on leptin-mediated cell invasion and cell proliferation in ovarian cancer. We utilized SKOV3 cancer (expressing OB-Rb and ERα/β, insensitive to estrogen) and OVCAR3 (expressing OB-Rb) cell lines to show the involvement of ER in leptin-mediated effects in an E2-independent manner. MTT, BrdU, and BD matrigel invasion assays were applied to analyze cell growth, proliferation, and invasion. The siRNA approach was used to confirm the role of ERα/β in leptin effects. Moreover, western blotting and Real-time PCR were employed to detect the OB-Rb, ER, MMP9/7, and upA proteins and mRNAs. Leptin, in the absence of E2, increased ERα expression in SKOV3 cells, which was attenuated using knockdown of OB-Rb gene by siRNA. The effect of leptin on the cell growth was promoted in the presence of PPT, but not in the presence of DNP and E2, which was lost when OB-Rb siRNA was transfected. Furthermore, ERα gene silencing and/or pre-incubation with ER antagonist (ICI 182,780, 10 nM) significantly reduced cell invasion and MMP9 expression stimulated by leptin. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that ERα, but not ERβ, is involved in leptin-induced ovarian cancer in an E2-independent manner, providing new evidence for cancer progression in obesity-associated ovarian cancer.","Patient-centered communication, patient satisfaction, and retention in care in assisted reproductive technology visits.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31077010,Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,2019 05 11,"To explore the association between patient-centered communication, patients' satisfaction, and retention in care in assisted reproductive technology (ART) visits."

Nevertheless, while IGF-1 levels are associated with increased cancer risk, they have been paradoxically implicated with protection from other age-related conditions, particularly in the brain, suggesting that strategies aimed at selectively increasing central IGF-1 action may have favorable effects on aging. To test this hypothesis, we generated inducible, brain-specific (TRE-IGF-1 × Camk2a-tTA) IGF-1 (bIGF-1) overexpression mice and studied effects on healthspan. Doxycycline was removed from the diet at 12 weeks old to permit post-development brain IGF-1 overexpression, and animals were monitored up to 24 months. Brain IGF-1 levels were increased approximately twofold in bIGF-1 mice, along with greater brain weights, volume, and myelin density (P < 0.05). Age-related changes in rotarod performance, exercise capacity, depressive-like behavior, and hippocampal gliosis were all attenuated specifically in bIGF-1 male mice (P < 0.05). However, chronic brain IGF-1 failed to prevent declines in cognitive function or neurovascular coupling. Therefore, we performed a short-term intranasal (IN) treatment of either IGF-1 or saline in 24-month-old male C57BL/6 mice and found that IN IGF-1 treatment tended to reduce depressive (P = 0.09) and anxiety-like behavior (P = 0.08) and improve motor coordination (P = 0.07) and unlike transgenic mice improved motor learning (P < 0.05) and visuospatial and working memory (P < 0.05). These data highlight important sex differences in how brain IGF-1 action impacts healthspan and suggest that translational approaches that target IGF-1 centrally can restore cognitive function, a possibility that should be explored as a strategy to combat age-related cognitive decline.",Comparative evaluation of different therapeutic protocols for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia in Himalayan Pashmina goats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076996,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 11,"Therapeutic management of contagious caprine pleuroneumonia (CCPP) involves mostly the use of oxytetracycline followed by enrofloxacin and rarely tylosin. In many parts of the world including India, the former antibiotics are commonly available than the latter. Therefore, prolonged use of the same leads to the development of antibiotic resistance and decreased efficacy of drug. Besides, inflammatory and allergic pathogenesis of CCPP envisages combination therapy. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the combination therapy using different antibiotics (oxytetracycyline @ 10: group I, enrofloxacin @ 5 group II, and tylosin: group III, @ 10 mg/kg body weight), along with anti-inflammatory (meloxicam @ 0.5 mg/kg) and anti-allergic (pheneramine maleate @ 1.0 mg/kg) drugs. These drugs were given intramuscularly at the interval of 48 h for four times in three test groups (n = 10) of Pashmina goats, viz. groups I, II, and III, respectively, affected with CCPP. Group IV (n = 10) was kept as healthy control when group V (n = 10) treated with oxytetracycline @ 10 mg/kg alone was used as positive control. Clinical signs, clinical parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)), and oxidative stress indices (total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS)) were evaluated at hours 0, 48, 96, and 144 of experimental trial. Tylosin-based combination therapy resulted in a rapid and favorable recovery resulting in restoration of normal body temperature (102.46 ± 0.31 °F), respiration rate (16.30 ± 0.79 per minute), and heart rate (89.50 ± 2.63 per minute) compared to the oxytetracycline (102.95 ± 0.13, 21.30 ± 1.12, 86.00 ± 2.33, respectively) and enrofloxacin (102.97 ± 0.19, 21.00 ± 1.25, 90.00 ± 2.58, respectively) treated groups. By hour 144, all the groups showed restoration of clinical parameters of normal health and diminishing signs of CCPP, viz. fever, dyspnea, coughing, nasal discharge, weakness, and pleurodynia. Significant (P ≤ 0.05) decrease in levels of TNF-α and non-significant (P > 0.05) decrease in levels of TOS and an increase in levels of TAS were noted from hour 0 to 144 in all the test groups. Within the groups, no significant (P > 0.05) change was noted in TNF-α, TOS, and TAS levels; however, TNF-α levels were comparatively lower in group III. Hematological parameters did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). From these findings, it can be inferred that tylosin-based combination therapy is relatively better for early, rapid, and safe recovery besides minimizing inflammatory and oxidative cascade in CCPP affected Pashmina goats compared to oxytetracycline- and enrofloxacin-based therapies.",Improving the nutritive value of cassava bioethanol waste using fermented yeast as a partial replacement of protein source in dairy calf ration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076995,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 11,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-fermented cassava bioethanol waste (YECAW) on feed utilization, ruminal fermentation, and microbial population in dairy calves fed a concentrate diet at 1% body weight (BW). Four male Holstein Friesian crossbred calves with an initial BW of 109 ± 6.23 kg were used in this research. The experimental design was a 4 × 4 Latin squared design and the dietary treatments were four levels of YECAW supplementation at 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20% concentrate mixture. The YECAW product contained CP at 25.1% dry matter (DM) and NDF and ADF at 65.2 and 40.6% DM, respectively. Inclusion of YECAW did not alter feed intake of rice straw, total intake, nutrient intake, and digestion coefficients (P > 0.05). Ruminal pH and temperature, ruminal ammonia-nitrogen, and blood urea-nitrogen (BUN) were not significant by YECAW levels supplementation (P > 0.05). Increasing YECAW levels did not adversely affect the population of bacteria, protozoa, and fungi and values ranged from 6.5 to 7.0 × 1012, 3.2 to 4.0 × 105, and 6.9 to 7.4 × 103 cells/ml, respectively (P > 0.05). Feeding of YECAW to dairy calves did not affect the total VFA, acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), or butyric acid (C4) proportion (P > 0.05) which ranged from 102.6 to104.6 mmol/l, 70.7 to 72.0, 17.8 to 20.2, and 9.1 to 10.3 mol/ 100 mol, respectively. Therefore, feeding of YECAW is recommended because no adversely affect the utilization of feed and rumen characteristics and might be alternative protein source for ruminants.",Molecular detection and characterization of Clostridium perfringens toxin genes causing necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076994,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 11,"A total of 464 samples comprising of cloacal swabs from necrotic enteritis suspected live birds (191), intestinal scrapings from dead birds with symptoms of necrotic enteritis (91), and apparently healthy birds (182) were collected from selected districts of AP. The samples were subjected to multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of α, β, and β2 toxin genes and uniplex PCR for the detection of NetB gene. Multiplex PCR screening of samples reveled α toxin gene positives from (cpa) 248/282 (87.94%) necrotic enteritis suspected and 40/182 (21.97%) apparently healthy samples. Among cpa positives 142/248 (57.25%) and 3/40 (7.5%) were positive for β2 toxin gene in necrotic enteritis suspected and apparently healthy birds respectively, indicating the involvement of C. perfringens type A, with minor pore forming toxin gene cpb2 in causing necrotic enteritis in poultry. None of the sample was positive for β toxin gene. The present research indicates C. perfringens type A along with β2 toxin gene was responsible for causing necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens in some parts of Andhra Pradesh in India. Phylogenetic relationship of amplified cpa and cpb2 amino acids sequences from present C. perfringens isolates were studied. The analysis reveals the sequence identity of cpb2 gene of the present isolates and variations at both nucleotide and amino acid level with the published sequences of cpb2 gene of C. perfringens isolates from different animal species of the USA, Iran, Netherlands, and Japan.",Development of a new approach of pasture management to control Rhipicephalus microplus infestation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076993,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 29,"Despite several decades of chemical control, the cattle tick Rhipicephalus microplus remains an important constraint for cattle farmers. The regular use of chemicals has led to the development of tick strains that are multi-resistant to acaricides. New methods of tick control are being developed and combined in integrated tick management programs. Grazing management is one part of these control methods. However, until now, grazing management consisted essentially of resting pastures for 4 to 5 months. This amount of time is generally sufficient to allow for natural tick larvae mortality to occur, but this method often compromises the quality of forages, which is less than optimal at the time of arrival of the animals in the paddock. In this paper, we propose a new approach to pasture management-based tick control that optimizes forage production. It is based on tick development biological parameters, herd management and strategic treatments. This approach was tested for 2 years on two farms raising tick-susceptible European breeds of cattle under tropical conditions. The number of chemical treatments decreased respectively by 82.9% and 70.9%. This cost-effective approach may prove useful in decreasing the number of acaricidal treatments on farms facing high tick loads.",MiR-499 inhibited hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cardiomyocytes injury by targeting SOX6.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076992,Biotechnology letters,2019 06 06,"MiR-499 has been reported to be expressed only in cardiomyocytes, and its expression would increase after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). miR-499 plays a role in the process of cardiomyocytes injury induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), however, it still remains unclear.",Multiphosphorylation and cellular localization of poly(rC) binding protein 1 during mitosis in hela cell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076991,Biotechnology letters,2019 06 06,To monitor the phosphorylation modifications and cellular localization of poly(rC)-binding protein-1 (PCBP1) during the cell cycle progression of Hela cells.,Backbone resonance assignments and secondary structure of Ebola nucleoprotein 600-739 construct.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076990,Biomolecular NMR assignments,2019 05 11,"Ebola viral infections have resulted in several deadly epidemics in recent years in West and Central Africa. Because only one of the seven proteins encoded by the viral genome possesses enzymatic activity, disruption of protein-protein interactions is a promising route for antiviral drug development. We carried out a screening campaign to identify small, drug-like compounds that bind to the C-terminal region of the multifunctional Ebola nucleoprotein (eNP) with the objective of discovering ones that disrupt its binding to other Ebola proteins or to the single-stranded RNA genome. In the course of this effort we assigned the backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances of residues 600‒739, the region that contains the critical eVP30 binding region 600‒615 targeted by host factors, and used the assigned chemical shifts to predict secondary structural features and peptide dynamics. This work supports and extends the previous X-ray crystal structures and NMR studies of residues 641‒739.

Nevertheless, during the past decade, there have been a growing number of publications focused on human genetics, the gut microbiome, and proteomics, suggesting that loss of mucosal barrier function, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, may substantially affect antigen trafficking, ultimately causing chronic inflammation, including autoimmunity, in genetically predisposed individuals. The gut mucosa works as a semipermeable barrier in that it permits nutrient absorption and also regulates immune surveillance while retaining potentially harmful microbes and environmental antigens within the intestinal lumen. Celiac disease (CD), a systemic, immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, is associated with altered gut permeability. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown that gliadin, a prolamine component of gluten that is implicated in CD pathogenesis, is capable to disassembling intercellular junctional proteins by upregulating the zonulin pathway, which can be inhibited by the zonulin antagonist larazotide acetate. In this review, we will focus on CD as a paradigm of chronic inflammatory diseases in order to outline the contribution of gut paracellular permeability toward disease pathogenesis; moreover, we will summarize current evidence derived from available clinical trials of larazotide acetate in CD.",Outcomes and Management Strategies for Capsule Retention: A Korean Capsule Endoscopy Nationwide Database Registry Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076988,Digestive diseases and sciences,2019 05 11,"The most concerning complication of capsule endoscopy (CE) is capsule retention (CR) in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract; however, the clinical outcomes and management of patients with CR are still uncertain."

The aim of this work was to verify the action of plant-derived material obtained from Tagetes patula on the life cycle of R. microplus, as well as to analyze the action of these extracts on ovary cells of engorged females. In the Adult Immersion Test, the crude ethanolic extract (TpEtOH) showed an efficacy of 99.2% (LC50 = 18.60 mg mL-1). From the repellency test, it was found that both the TpEtOH and essential oil were 100% efficient on the larval stage. In addition, in the Larval Package Test, a mortality of 98.37% was obtained with TpEtOH (LC50 = 3.798 mg mL-1). From the microscopic analysis of ovary cells, morphological changes in the chorion and cytoplasm of oocytes were observed, with vacuolization around the germinal vesicle and disorganization of the pedicular cells, suggesting an interference in the normal embryogenic formation of the larvae. These results demonstrate that T. patula extracts interfere at all stages of development of the ixodid, from eggs to adults forms, and have a pronounced repellent effect. In addition, the results of the cytotoxicity assays performed on keratinocytes, as well as previous information on oral and dermal acute toxicity (LD50 > 4000 mg kg-1), attest that T. patula can be a safe alternative for ectoparasitic control, representing an alternative for development of a formulation used to help control populations of ticks in the field.",Population growth of the stored product pest Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Acari: Acaridae) on environmentally and medically important fungi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076973,Experimental & applied acarology,2019 06 10,"The stored food mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) (Acari: Acaridae) has been associated with the presence of several fungal species. The aims of this work were to evaluate T. putrescentiae population growth associated to environmental and medically important fungal species to determine on which fungal species populations of T. putrescentiae performs best, and to evaluate their ability to disperse each fungal species. First, 24 fungal species were inoculated separately in Petri dishes containing Sabouraud agar medium. One week after inoculation, 50 mites were added to each plate. On the 28th evaluation day, mites and eggs were counted in each plate, and 50 mites randomly collected from each replicate were transferred to new plates containing only Sabouraud agar medium. Then, mites, eggs, and fungal population were evaluated in each plate on day 28 again. The highest population increases were on Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Alternaria sp., Microsporum gypseum, and Aspergillus chevalieri. With Fusarium guttiforme and the medically important fungi Microsporum canis, M. gypseum, T. mentagrophytes, and Sporothrix sp., mites were observed to feed on whole mycelium. Only eight fungal species were dispersed by T. putrescentiae to the new Petri dishes: Aspergillus clavatus, Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Fusarium guttiforme, Hyphopichia burtonii, Penicillium citrinum, Rhizophus azygosporus, and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The best performance of T. putrescentiae was found feeding on F. guttiforme, P. citrinum, and T. mentagrophytes. In conclusion, T. putrescentiae successfully used fungi as a food source, and it proved to be an important tool for disseminating both environmental and medically important fungi.",Research Progress of [68Ga]Citrate PET's Utility in Infection and Inflammation Imaging: a Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076971,Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging,2019 05 11,"Imaging diagnosis of infection and inflammation has been challenging for many years. Infection imaging agents commonly used in nuclear medicine, such as [67Ga]citrate, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG), and radionuclide-labeled leukocytes, have their own shortcomings. Identification of a tracer with considerable economic benefit, high specificity, and low radiation dose has become clinically urgent. In the twenty-first century, with the increasing availability of positron emission tomography (PET) devices and the commercialization of Ge-68/Ga-68 generators, the study of [68Ga]citrate applications for infection and inflammation has increased and shown good potential.

NMRlib is magnetic-field independent, and thus particularly helpful for laboratories operating multiple NMR spectrometers. NMRlib is easily personalized by adding, deleting, or reorganizing experiments. Additional tools are provided for data processing, visualization, and analysis. In particular, NMRlib contains all the polarization-enhanced fast-pulsing NMR experiments (SOFAST, BEST, HADAMAC,…) developed in our laboratory over the last decade.

However, multiple peptide plane orientations can be consistent with a given set of angular restraints. This ambiguity is further exacerbated by experimental uncertainty in obtaining and interpreting such restraints. The previously developed algorithms for structure calculations using angular restraints typically involve a sequential walkthrough along the backbone to find the torsion angles between the consecutive peptide plane orientations that are consistent with the experimental data. This method is sensitive to experimental uncertainty in interpreting the peak positions of as low as ± 10 Hz, often yielding high structural RMSDs for the calculated structures. Here we present a significantly improved version of the algorithm which includes the fitting of several peptide planes at once in order to prevent propagation of error along the backbone. In addition, a protocol has been devised for filtering the structural solutions using Rosetta scoring functions in order to find the structures that both fit the spectrum and satisfy bioinformatics restraints. The robustness of the new algorithm has been tested using synthetic angular restraints generated from the known structures for two proteins: a soluble protein 2gb1 (56 residues), chosen for its diverse secondary structure elements, i.e. an alpha-helix and two beta-sheets, and a membrane protein 4a2n, from which the first two transmembrane helices (having a total of 64 residues) have been used. Extensive simulations have been performed by varying the number of fitted planes, experimental error, and the number of NMR dimensions. It has been found that simultaneously fitting two peptide planes always shifted the distribution of the calculated structures toward lower structural RMSD values as compared to fitting a single torsion-angle pair. For each protein, irrespective of the simulation parameters, Rosetta was able to distinguish the most plausible structures, often having structural RMSDs lower than 2 Å with respect to the original structure. This study establishes a framework for de-novo protein structure prediction using a combination of solid-state NMR angular restraints and bioinformatics.",The influence of thickeners of food on the particle size of boluses: a consideration for swallowing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076968,Odontology,2019 05 11,"The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of thickeners with different levels of thickness on the sizes of particles in food boluses. In medical and nursing care, thickeners are used to make food safe for patients with dysphagia. However, the effect of thickeners on the foods they are added to, especially during swallowing, is still unclear. The bolus particles of 20 healthy volunteers were photographed, and the digital images were used to estimate the sizes of particles in them. Eight test samples with thickeners with different levels of thickness were tested: six grades of thickened carrot juice with raw carrots in it, raw carrot with banana, and raw carrot alone. The particle homogeneity index (HI) and particle size index (SI) just before swallowing were calculated. The viscosities of the liquid part of the test samples were also measured. The number of mastication cycles across the test samples was not significantly different. However, significant differences were found in SI and HI across the test samples: the absolute values of SI and HI tended to rise as the thickness of the test sample increased. The viscosity of the liquid part of the test sample also increased as the thickness increased.

Low voltage shows many useful associations with clinical outcomes, comorbidities and has links to trigger sites for AF. Several contemporary trials have shown promise in targeting low voltage areas as the substrate for AF ablation; however, the results have been mixed. In order to understand these results, a thorough understanding of voltage mapping techniques, the relationship between low voltage and the pathophysiology of AF, as well as the inherent limitations in voltage measurement are needed. Two key questions must be answered in order to optimally apply voltage mapping as the road map for ablation. First, are the inherent limitations of voltage mapping small enough as to be ignored when targeting specific tissue based on voltage? Second, can conventional criteria, using a binary threshold for voltage amplitude, truly define the extent of the atrial fibrotic substrate? Here, we review the latest clinical evidence with regard to voltage-based ablation procedures before analysing the utility and limitations of voltage mapping. Finally, we discuss omnipole mapping and dynamic voltage attenuation as two possible approaches to resolving these issues.","Identification of a 3,3-difluorinated tetrahydropyridinol compound as a novel antitumor agent for hepatocellular carcinoma acting via cell cycle arrest through disturbing CDK7-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc2.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076964,Investigational new drugs,2019 05 11,"Tetrahydropyridinol derivatives were recently reported to exhibit good biological activities, and the incorporation of fluorine into organic molecules may have profound effects on their physical and biological properties. Therefore, we investigated the anticancer activities of six fluorinated tetrahydropyridinol derivatives that we synthesized previously. We found that only one compound, 3,3-difluoro-2,2-dimethyl-1,6-diphenyl-5-tosyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-ol, showed significant antiproliferative activity on human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and HMCCLM3 cells (the IC50 values were 21.25 and 29.07 μM, respectively). We also found that this compound mediated cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase at 30-40 μM. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the cell cycle arrest induced by this compound in HepG2 and HMCCLM3 cells was associated with a significant decrease in Cdc2 and cyclin B1, which led to the accumulation of the phosphorylated-Tyr15 (inactive) form of Cdc2 and low expression of M phase-promoting factor (cyclin B1/Cdc2). Moreover, cells treated with this compound exhibited decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CDK7/cyclin H). This compound also induced cell apoptosis via activation of caspase-3. A xenograft model in nude mice demonstrated anti-liver cancer activity and the mechanism of action of this compound. These findings indicated that the anticancer effect of this compound was partially due to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via inhibition of CDK7-mediated expression of Cdc2, and this compound may be a promising anticancer candidate for further investigation.","Pam3CSK4, a TLR2 ligand, induces differentiation of glioblastoma stem cells and confers susceptibility to temozolomide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076963,Investigational new drugs,2019 05 11,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive human brain tumor, and GBM stem cells (GSC) may be responsible for its recurrence and therapeutic resistance. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize multiple ligands (endogenous and pathogen-associated) and trigger the immune response of mature immune cells, are also expressed by hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, where their activation results in the differentiation of these cells into myeloid cells. Since TLR expression has been recently described in neural cells, including neural stem cells, we studied TLR expression by GSCs and the effect of stimulation by TLR ligands on promoting GSC differentiation into mature GBM cells. First, our results showed heterogeneous TLR expression by GBM cells from human tumors and, for the first time, by human GSCs defined by their CD133+ and CD44+ phenotypes. Next, the effect of TLR ligands was studied in in vitro cell cultures of neurospheres and CD44+ cells obtained from two GBM cell lines (U-87 and U-118). The expression of GSC markers diminished in the presence of Pam3CSK4 or LPS (TLR2 and TLR4 ligands, respectively), thus indicating TLR-dependent differentiation. Interestingly, simultaneous treatment with Pam3CSK4 plus temozolomide (TMZ), the reference drug in GBM treatment, significantly increased cell death compared to the effect of the ligand alone, which showed no toxicity, or TMZ alone. These results suggest a synergistic effect between Pam3CSK4 and TMZ based on the induction of TLR-dependent GSC differentiation towards mature GBM cells, which exhibited increased sensitivity to chemotherapy, and provide new perspectives in GBM therapy."

The advancements in ICB have been attributed to the development of various approaches to improve the success rate and reduce complications. This has also necessitated a unified nomenclature system to facilitate comparison among different approaches. This review aimed to propose an anatomical nomenclature system by classifying ICB approaches into proximal and distal ones to aid future research and provide practice advisories according to recent updates. We also comprehensively discuss various aspects of this nomenclature system. Our review suggests that ultrasound-guided ICB should be categorized as an advanced technique that should be performed under supervision and dual guidance. For one-shot block, the conventional distal approach is still preferred but should be modified to follow ergonomic practice, with the arm in the proper position. For continuous ICB, the proximal approach is promising for reducing local anesthetic volume and increasing efficacy. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted in this direction. We provide practice advisories to maximize safety and minimize adverse events, and recommend designing future studies on ICB according to these findings based on the unified nomenclature system.",Efficacy of rituximab in resistant palindromic rheumatism: first report in literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076945,Clinical rheumatology,2019 05 11,"Rituximab (RTX) provides significant clinical benefits in active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with inadequate response to DMARDs and anti-TNF.

Pulse transit time (PTT), which closely relates to the physical properties of the cardiovascular system, can be linked to variations of blood pressure and stroke volume to provide information for patient-specific clinical diagnostics. In this work, we present mathematical and numerical tools, capable of accurately predicting the PTT, local pulse wave velocity, vessel compliance, and pressure/flow waveforms, in a viscous hyperelastic cardiovascular network. A new one-dimensional framework, entitled cardiovascular flow analysis (CardioFAN), is presented to describe the pulsatile fluid-structure interaction in the hyperelastic arteries, where pertaining hyperbolic equations are solved using a high-resolution total variation diminishing Lax-Wendroff method. The computational algorithm is validated against well-known numerical, in vitro and in vivo data for networks of main human arteries with 55, 37 and 26 segments, respectively. PTT prediction is improved by accounting for hyperelastic nonlinear waves between two arbitrary sections of the arterial tree. Consequently, arterial compliance assignments at each segment are improved in a personalized model of the human aorta and supra-aortic branches with 26 segments, where prior in vivo data were available for comparison. This resulted in a 1.5% improvement in overall predictions of the waveforms, or average relative errors of 5.5% in predicting flow, luminal area and pressure waveforms compared to prior in vivo measurements.

Stock-outs, stock mismatches, urgent restocking, assignment of high-value medical products to patients, and time allocated by the supervisory staff to the stock management, were assessed on a monthly basis. 0% stock-outs and 0% stock mismatches using RFID were observed during the study. Monthly percentages of products requiring urgent restocking ranged from 0% to 13.3%. No incorrect assignments to patients of surgery products or prostheses were detected. The percentage of correct assignments increased from 36.1%-86.1% to 100% in the first 4-5 months. The total average time allocated by the supervisory staff to the whole logistic chain was reduced by 58% (995 min with the traditional manual system vs. 428 min with RFID). The RFID system showed the ability to monitor both the traceability and consumption per patient of high-value surgery products as well as contributed to significant time savings.",Quasi-automatic early detection of progressive idiopathic scoliosis from biplanar radiography: a preliminary validation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076919,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",2019 05 11,To validate the predictive power and reliability of a novel quasi-automatic method to calculate the severity index of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).,Lipids and soluble carbohydrates in the mycelium and ascomata of alkaliphilic fungus Sodiomyces alkalinus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076918,Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions,2019 06 13,"Alkaliphilic fungi are fundamentally different from alkalitolerant ones in terms of mechanisms of adaptation. They accumulate trehalose in cytosol and phosphatidic acids (PA) in the membrane lipids, whereas alkalitolerants contain these compounds in low amounts. But it is unclear how the composition of osmolytes and lipids changes during cytodifferentiation. In this article the composition of lipids and soluble cytosol carbohydrates in the mycelium and fruit bodies of the alkaliphilic fungus Sodiomyces alkalinus was studied. In the mycelium, mannitol and trehalose dominated, while in fruit bodies only trehalose was predominant. Phosphatidylcholines (PC), PA and sterols were major membrane lipids of the mycelium, while PC and sterols were predominant in fruit bodies. The degree of fatty acids unsaturation of the main mycelium phospholipids (PC and PA) increased with age, while that of PC did not change regardless of the developmental stage. In young mycelium, storage lipids were represented mainly by free fatty acids, and in mature mycelium and fruit bodies-by triacylglycerols. Fruit bodies contained three times less membrane lipids and twice as many storage lipids as mycelium. Trehalose was the main cytosol carbohydrate in the mycelium and fruit bodies, which confirms its key value for alkaliphily.","Immunodetection and counting of circulating tumor cells (HepG2) by combining gold nanoparticle labeling, rolling circle amplification and ICP-MS detection of gold.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076917,Mikrochimica acta,2019 05 16,"A method is described for counting circulating tumor cells (CTCs). It is making use of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) along with a dual amplification strategy by combining rolling circle amplification (RCA) and gold nanoparticle (Au NP) labeling. HepG2 cells, as a representative CTC line, were captured by anti-epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM) immobilized on a microplate, then specifically labeled with biotinylated anti-asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Taking streptavidin (SA) as the bridge, the biotinylated RCA primer was conjugated to HepG2 cells. When the RCA reaction was triggered, long ssDNA with tandem repeats generated on the cell surface. Then, Au NP functionalized detection DNA (signal probes) was added to hybridize with the ssDNA. After removing the redundant signal probes, Au NPs conjugated on target HepG2 cells were subjected to ICP-MS detection. By adopting such a dual amplification strategy, a 756-fold improvement in sensitivity is accomplished compared to the method involving only Au NP labeling without RCA. The limit of detection is as low as 3 HepG2 cells (15 cell mL-1) which is the lowest LOD in ICP-MS based methods for cell counting. Besides, the method provides good selectivity, a wide linear range of 10-1000 HepG2 cells (50-5000 cells mL-1), and relative standard deviations of 6.3% (n = 7; 50 HepG2 cells (250 cells mL-1)). The method was successfully applied to HepG2 cell counting in spiked human blood samples and gave good recoveries.

Theoretical considerations, however, suggest that the aforementioned factors exert joined effects on response inhibition processes that are further modulated by the subject's experience about the reliability of cue stimuli during response inhibition processes. To examine the underlying neurophysiological processes of these interactive effects we combined EEG signal decomposition with sLORETA source localization. We show that response inhibition performance is modulated by interactive effects between (1) cue information/validity, (2) demands on inhibitory control processes and (3) the subject's experience that cue information is valid/invalid during response inhibition processes. Only if demands on inhibitory control processes are high and when participants acquainted the experience that cue information is very likely to be valid, invalid cue information compromised response inhibition performance. The neurophysiological data show that processes in the N2 time window, likely reflecting braking processes, but not stimulus-related processes during response inhibition, are modulated. It seems that braking processes cannot be sufficiently deployed if cue information that has been experienced to be highly valid turns out to be invalid in situations placing high demands on inhibitory control. Source localization data reveals that the interactive effects of the examined factors specifically modulate processes in the right inferior frontal gyrus (BA47). This provides electrophysiological evidence that the rIFG is a hub region integrating different factors modulating inhibitory control.",Long-term effect of subthalamic and pallidal deep brain stimulation for status dystonicus in children with methylmalonic acidemia and GNAO1 mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076915,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2019 06 10,"Status dystonicus (SD) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition requiring intensive care management. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment for SD refractory to medical management, but its application in this field is still limited. Here, we report the long-term outcome of four pediatric patients treated with DBS at the University Hospital of Padua, Italy, for SD refractory to medications. In addition, we present the results of a systematic literature review aimed at identifying published cases of SD treated with DBS, with focus on motor outcome. In our cohort, two children were affected by methylmalonic acidemia and suffered acute basal ganglia lesions, while the other two carried a pathogenic mutation in GNAO1 gene. DBS target was subthalamic nucleus (STN) in one case and globus pallidus internus (GPi) in three. All patients experienced SD resolution within 8-19 days after surgery. Mean post-operative follow-up was 5 years. We identified in the literature 53 additional SD cases treated with DBS (median age at DBS implantation: 12 years) with reported positive outcome in 51 and resolution of SD in a mean of 17 days after surgery. Our findings indicate that DBS is an effective treatment for SD refractory to medications, even in patients with acute basal ganglia lesions; STN can be an appropriate target when GPi is damaged. Moreover, data from long-term follow-up show that SD recurrences can be significantly reduced in frequency or abolished after DBS implantation."

However, the therapeutic effect of constructed liver grafts in hepatic failure has not been evaluated. Therefore, we aimed to develop a novel evaluation system demonstrating the curative effect of a constructed liver graft in animals with hepatic failure. First, we developed a highly reproducible rat model of hepatic failure by combining 80% partial hepatectomy with warm ischemia. In this model, severity could be controlled by the warm ischemic period. We also constructed a liver graft by recellularization of decellularized liver, and confirmed the ammonia metabolic function in the graft in vitro as one of the most important functions for recovery from hepatic failure. The graft was then applied to our developed hepatic failure rat model using a blood extracorporeal circulation system. In this application, the graft metabolized the ammonia in the blood of animals with hepatic failure and was thus suggested to be effective for the treatment of hepatic failure. In summary, a novel evaluation system for whole-organ-engineered liver graft as a preliminary stage of transplantation was developed. This system was expected to provide much information about the curative effect of a constructed liver graft.",Prognostic significance of histological categorization of desmoplastic reaction in colorectal liver metastases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076902,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2019 05 11,"Desmoplastic reaction (DR) involves the growth of fibrous or connective tissues around a tumor and has recently attracted attention as an indicator of malignant potential. Previous studies have confirmed that histological categorization of DR in the primary tumor is an independent prognostic factor in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). However, it remains unclear whether the DR status of the metastatic liver lesion (DRliver) is a useful prognostic factor. This pathological review evaluated records from 204 patients who underwent hepatectomy for CRLM at the National Defense Medical College Hospital in Japan. Each case's DRliver was classified as mature, intermediate, or immature based on the presence of keloid-like collagen and myxoid stroma in the metastatic liver lesion. This resulted in 12 cases of mature DRliver, 101 cases of intermediate DRliver, and 91 cases of immature DRliver. There was a significant correlation between the DR statuses of the primary tumor and the metastatic liver lesion (Spearman's rho = 0.3, P = 0.0001). The 5-year relapse-free survival rates after hepatectomy were 33.8% for mature/intermediate DRliver and 16.7% for immature DRliver (P = 0.0021). The 5-year overall survival rate after hepatectomy was higher in the mature/intermediate DRliver group (64.8%) than in the immature DRliver group (35.0%; P = 0.0012). The multivariate analysis confirmed that DRliver categorization could independently predict relapse-free survival and overall survival. In conclusion, DRliver categorization may be valuable for predicting prognosis after hepatectomy among patients with CRLM.",Strategies of complementary and integrative therapies in cancer-related pain-attaining exhaustive cancer pain management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076901,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2019 05 11,"Complementary integrative therapies (CITs) correspond to growing demand in patients with cancer-related pain.

Recent research shows that aspirin (ASP) has great potential in promoting bone regeneration. The objective of the present study was to incorporate PLGA into β-TCP combined with a lower single-dose local administration of ASP to enhance its in vivo biodegradation and bone tissue growth. After the creation of a rodent critical-sized femoral metaphyseal bone defect, PLGA -modified β-TCP (TP) was prepared by mixing sieved granules of β-TCP and PLGA (50:50, v/v) for medical use, then TP with dripped 50 µg/0.1 ml and 100 µg/0.1 ml aspirin solution was implanted into the defect of OVX rats until death at 8 weeks.

The results of our study show that a single-dose local administration of ASP combined with the local usage of TP can increase the healing of defects in OVX rats. Single-dose local administration of aspirin can improve the transcription of genes involved in the regulation of bone formation and vascularization in the defect area, and inhibits osteoclast activity. Furthermore, treatments with a higher single-dose local administration of ASP and TP showed a stronger effect on accelerating the local bone formation than while using a lower dose of ASP. The results from our study demonstrate that the combination of a single-dose local administration of ASP and β-TCP/PLGA had an additive effect on local bone formation in osteoporosis rats, and bone regeneration by PLGA/β-TCP/ASP occured in a dose-dependent manner.",Role of intra-ventricular vortex in left ventricular ejection elucidated by echo-dynamography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076894,Journal of medical ultrasonics (2001),2019 05 11,"From the correlation between the blood flow dynamics and wall dynamics in the left ventriocle (LV) analyzed using echo-dynamography, the ejection mechanisms and role of the intra-ventricular vortex in the LV were elucidated in detail during the pre-ejection transitional period (pre-ETP), the very short period preceding LV ejection.",Conductometric acetone vapor sensor based on the use of gold-doped three-dimensional hierarchical porous zinc oxide microspheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076893,Mikrochimica acta,2019 05 16,"A versatile nanoprobe for acetone vapor was designed and fabricated.

Immunological imprinting by CMV is not restricted to immunity against CMV itself, but can affect immunity against other viral or non-viral infectious agents and also immunopathological responses. One category is heterologous immunity based on molecular mimicry, where antigen recognition receptors specific for a CMV antigen with broad avidity distribution also bind with some avidity to unrelated antigens and exert effector functions against target structures other than those linked to CMV. Another category is induction of cytokines by CMV infection that inhibit or drive immune responses to bystander antigens unrelated to CMV, and a third category is the activation of antigen-presenting cells by CMV from which unrelated antigens profit as ""stowaways"". A striking example of the ""stowaway"" category, actually one that is of medical importance, has been published recently and will be discussed here for the more general reader. Specifically, in a murine model, CMV airway infection and inhaled environmental antigen of poor intrinsic allergenic potential were found to sensitize for allergic airway disease (AAD) only when combined. As to the mechanism, viral activation of CD11b+ conventional dendritic cells (CD11b+ cDC) that localize to airway mucosa facilitates uptake and processing of inhaled antigen. Thus, CMV serves as a ""door opener"" for otherwise harmless environmental antigens that have no intrinsic property to activate DC. Antigen-laden CD11b+ cDC migrate selectively to the airway draining lymph nodes, where they prime type-2 CD4+ T helper (Th-2) cells. Upon airway re-exposure to the inhaled antigen, Th-2 cells secrete interleukins (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-25) known to induce goblet cell metaplasia, the lead histopathological manifestation of AAD that is characterized by thickening of airway epithelia and increased numbers of mucus-producing goblet cells, resulting in enhanced mucus secretion and airflow obstruction.","Amyotrophy, cerebellar impairment and psychiatric disease are the main symptoms in a cohort of 14 Czech patients with the late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076878,Journal of neurology,2019 05 11,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A deficiency due to mutations in the HEXA gene.

However, the biological functions of pro-domains are ill-defined. New roles were recently reported for the pro-domain of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a well-known growth factor in the brain. Interestingly, the pro-domain of BDNF (BDNF pro-peptide) is localized at presynaptic termini, where it facilitates long-term depression (LTD) in hippocampal slices, implicating it as a novel synaptic modulator. BDNF binds its pro-peptide with high affinity in a pH-dependent manner and when bound to BDNF, the BDNF pro-peptide cannot facilitate hippocampal LTD, representing a new mechanism of regulation. The BDNF pro-peptide is present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and levels were significantly lower in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) than in controls.

These findings demonstrate that the BDNF pro-peptide is a biologically important synaptic modulator and is associated with MDD, particularly in males."

However, little is known about the properties of old and young duplicate genes in Arachis. Here, we have identified old and young duplicate genes in Arachis duranensis, and analyzed the evolution, gene complexity, gene expression pattern, and functional divergence between old and young duplicate genes. Our results showed different evolutionary, gene complexity and gene expression patterns, as well as differing correlations between old and young duplicate genes. Gene ontology results showed that old duplicate genes play a crucial role in lipid and amino acid biosynthesis and the oxidation-reduction process and that young duplicate genes are preferentially involved in photosynthesis and response to biotic stimulus. Transcriptome data sets revealed that most old and young duplicate genes had asymmetric function, and only a few duplicate genes exhibited symmetric function under drought and nematode stress. We found that old duplicate genes are preferentially involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism and response to abiotic stress, while young duplicate genes are likely to participate in photosynthesis and response to biotic stress. This work provides a better understanding of the evolution and functional divergence of old and young duplicate genes in A. duranensis.",A LysM effector protein from the basidiomycete Rhizoctonia solani contributes to virulence through suppression of chitin-triggered immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076860,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,2019 05 11,"Rhizoctonia solani is a fungal species that belongs to the fungal division Basidiomycota. It is a soil-borne pathogen that attacks a broad range of plant species and crops. Disease symptoms are commonly seen as damping off of seedlings and root rot, although it can infect plants at any developmental stage. Despite the severity of this disease, many aspects in R. solani infection biology remain unclear. Here we investigated the role of a LysM effector, previously predicted from the genome of a R. solani AG2-2IIIB strain that has sugar beet as a host. Gene expression analysis showed that RsLysM was highly induced upon sugar beet infection. When RsLysM was heterologously expressed in Cercospora beticola, necrotic lesion size and fungal colonization ability were increased, indicating a role in virulence. RsLysM displayed chitin-binding affinity and suppression of chitin-triggered immunity but could not protect hyphae from hydrolysis. Overall, this study is the first characterization of a LysM effector from Basidiomycota, suggesting that this necrotrophic fungal species relies on perturbation of chitin-triggered immunity to establish a successful infection.",Predicting Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Patients with Insomnia: A Comparative Study with Four Screening Instruments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076859,Lung,2019 05 11,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and insomnia are very prevalent disorders, especially in sleep-lab setting, and insomnia may be the presenting complaint of OSA.

Data regarding the outcome of patients with CKD in ICD recipients is limited. A large retrospective registry was used including consecutive ICD recipients surviving episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF) from 2002 to 2016. CKD patients were compared to non-CKD patients. The primary endpoint was the first recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias at 5 years. Secondary endpoints were ICD-related therapies, rehospitalization and all-cause mortality at 5 years. Kaplan-Meier, multivariable Cox regression and propensity score matching were applied. A total of 585 consecutive patients were included (non-CKD: 57%, CKD: 43%). CKD had higher rates of the primary endpoint of recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias compared to non-CKD patients (50% vs. 40%; log rank p = 0.008; HR = 1.398; 95% CI 1.087-1.770; p = 0.009), which was irrespective of a primary or secondary preventive ICD and mainly attributed to recurrent VF (11% vs. 5%; p = 0.007) and electrical storm (ES) (10% vs. 5%; p = 0.010). Accordingly, CKD patients had higher rates of the secondary endpoint of appropriate ICD therapies (41% vs. 30%; log rank p = 0.002; HR = 1.532; 95% CI 1.163-2.018; p = 0.002), mainly attributed to appropriate ICD shocks (19% vs. 11%; p = 0.005).

This flexibility may occur over periods of days to weeks, but the underlying mechanisms for such flexibility are not well understood. Because lipids are the primary fuel for sustained thermogenesis, we examined whether lipid transport and catabolism can mediate within-winter metabolic flexibility in two small temperate-zone wintering passerine birds, dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We used simple and multiple regression analyses to test for correlations of several lipid transporters in pectoralis muscle (plasma membrane-bound and cytosolic fatty acid-binding proteins, FABP; fatty acyl translocase, FAT/CD36) and regulatory enzymes (carnitine acyl transferase, CPT; β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase, HOAD) in pectoralis and heart with short-term (ST, 0-7 days), medium-term (MT, 14-30 days) and long-term (LT, 30-year mean daily and extreme minimum temperatures, day of winter season) temperature variables. We hypothesized negative correlations between these regulators and temperature variables. Juncos showed negative correlations for FABPs with ST or MT temperature variables, but other lipid transporters and regulatory enzymes showed positive correlations with ST or MT temperatures for juncos, suggesting no consistent pathway-wide response to within-winter temperatures. LT temperature variables showed several significant associations with lipid transporters and enzymes for juncos, but also not in consistent directions. House sparrows showed the expected negative correlations with LT temperatures for FABPpm, but positive correlations with temperature variables for FABPc, CPT and HOAD. Different species-specific patterns of variation and the absence of consistent pathway-wide responses to temperature suggest that the lipid transport and catabolism pathway is not a uniform mediator of within-winter metabolic flexibility among small birds.",[Lung transplantation : Histomorphological diagnosis and clinical aspects].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076836,Der Pathologe,2019 06 10,"The function of pulmonary allografts is regularly impaired by alloimmune reactions with quite variable clinical outcomes, different involved effector cells and molecules, as well as affected anatomical compartments. Acute rejection of grafts after lung transplantation (LuTx) is not only associated with the subsequent development of acute graft dysfunction, but can also contribute - among other immunological and nonimmunological factors - to the development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which is the main reason for the limited long-term survival after LuTx. In addition to ACR and analogous to other solid organ transplants, the importance of antibody-mediated (humoral) rejection (AMR) in LuTx has also been recognized. There are currently no specific laboratory, radiological, or clinical tests available for either ACR or AMR. Only by the synoptic examination of histopathological changes and interpretation against the background of microbiological, virological, serological, and functional findings, can adequate sensitivity and specificity be achieved in the diagnostics of rejection.

However, for being a viable alternative to conventional techniques as well as being financially and industrially competitive, various challenges need to be overcome. In this review, the detailed metabolic pathways, including ammonification of amino acids, dissimilatory reduction of nitrate, and urea degradation (ureolysis), along with the potent bacteria and the favorable conditions for precipitation of calcium carbonate, are explained. Moreover, this review highlights the potential environmental and engineering applications of MICP, including restoration of stones and concrete, improvement of soil properties, sand consolidation, bioremediation of contaminants, and carbon dioxide sequestration.

Adults with rheumatic disease and CMV infection from 2000-2015 were identified. SLE cases were matched 3:1 with controls based on age, sex and year of admission, and compared. Fourteen patients were included (6 SLE, 4 rheumatoid arthritis, 2 sarcoidosis, 1 psoriatic arthritis, 1 microscopic polyangiitis). Seven had viremia alone, the remainder tissue-invasive disease. Thirteen received glucocorticoids prior to CMV reactivation. Fever was the most common symptom, and coinfections were seen in eight including four with bacteremia. Thirteen received antiviral therapy (median 33 days), four died during hospitalization. Six patients with underlying SLE and CMV reactivation were compared to 18 SLE controls. Cases received more glucocorticoids prior to admission (median 36.5 vs. 2.5 mg/day, p = 0.006), had longer hospitalizations (median 47 vs. 7 days, p = 0.006) and more coinfections (67% vs. 17%, p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in symptoms at presentation. CMV reactivation occurs in patients with rheumatologic disease, can result in severe clinical sequelae, and is difficult to distinguish from a flare of the underlying disease.

The objective of the study is to find out how college and university students think about nature. The study also seeks to identify which factors are most significant in influencing students' thoughts about nature. This paper analyzes racial, gender, class, and academic differences in the way college students think about nature. The study of 287 American students found that respondents thought about a wide range of concepts and ideas when they contemplate nature. This article focuses on the demographic differences in thoughts about fear, danger, and loathing. This set of ideas has been the subject of scholarly research, and the findings presented herein contribute to this body of scholarship. The paper discusses both descriptive and multivariate techniques that are used to explore the topic. The study found that white students are less likely than racial/ethnic minorities to think about disconnection, predators, getting lost, loathsome or hateful places, fear, and danger when they think of nature. However, the results also show that it would be inaccurate to describe racial/ethnic minorities as universally fearful of and disconnected from nature. Moreover, the paper demonstrates that race is not the only explanatory variable that has significant impacts in multivariate models-the student's academic interest has significant impacts on thoughts about natural hazards, disconnection, predators, human-made hazards, and loathsome or hateful places. Gender, age, parental education, and first-generation college attendance also has significant impacts on the dependent variables."

We report that RPSAP52 expression is highly upregulated in gonadotroph and prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas, where it correlates with that of HMGA2, compared with normal pituitary tissues. Conversely, its expression showed a variable behavior in somatotroph adenomas. We also demonstrate that RPSAP52 enhances HMGA2 protein expression in a ceRNA-dependent way acting as sponge for miR-15a, miR-15b, and miR-16, which have been already described to be able to target HMGA2. Interestingly, RPSAP52 also positively modulates HMGA1, the other member of the High-Mobility Group A family. Moreover, functional studies indicate that RPSAP52 promotes cell growth by enhancing the G1-S transition of the cell cycle. The results reported here reveal a novel mechanism, based on the overexpression of the lncRNA RPSAP52, which contributes to pituitary tumorigenesis, and propose this lncRNA as a novel player in the development of these tumors. KEY MESSAGES: RPSAP52 is overexpressed in pituitary adenomas. RPSAP52 increases HMGA protein levels. A ceRNA mechanism is proposed for the increased HMGA1/2 expression.",[Percutaneous stabilization of the anterior pelvic ring in osteoporotic fractures].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076807,Der Unfallchirurg,2019 05 11,"The number of low energy traumas in older people with subsequent pelvic ring fractures is increasing in contrast to high energy traumas with pelvic injury in younger people. Geriatric pelvic fractures can be treated conservatively with analgesics and physiotherapy-assisted mobilization, depending on the symptoms. If physical complaints do not allow adequate mobilization, surgical stabilization is indicated. It is often possible to stabilize the dorsal pelvic ring with transiliosacral screws. If additional instability associated with anterior pelvic ring complaints is prevalent, stabilization of the anterior ring can be achieved by invasive osteosynthesis using a plate or percutaneously by implanting an intramedullary plastic polymer.",[Diagnosis and treatment of jugular vein thrombosis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076806,HNO,2019 06 10,"Thromboses in the head and neck region are rare events, particularly in the internal jugular vein. However, they can result in potentially hazardous complications. Possible triggers are inflammatory, traumatic, and (para-)neoplastic diseases. Clinical symptoms often are non-specific, and it is thus important to even consider the possibility of an internal jugular vein thrombosis. Sonography is the diagnostic tool of choice, which can be complemented by CT/MRI if necessary. Depending on the individual etiology, antithrombotic treatment including modern direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is advisable. In cases of sepsis, surgery is mandatory to control the focus.

To date, only the host proteins ezrin, the binding partner of ezrin, CD44, as well as cyclophilin A (CypA) have been identified as crucial components for L. monocytogenes membrane protrusion stabilization and, thus, efficient cell-to-cell movement of the microbes. Here, we examine the classical binding partner of CypA, CD147, and find that this membrane protein is also hijacked by the bacteria for their cellular dissemination. CD147 is enriched at the plasma membrane surrounding the membrane protrusions as well as the resulting invaginations generated in neighboring cells. In cells depleted of CD147, these actin-rich structures appear similar to those generated in CypA depleted cells as they are significantly shorter and more contorted as compared to their straighter counterparts formed in wild-type control cells. The presence of malformed membrane protrusions hampers the ability of L. monocytogenes to efficiently disseminate from CD147-depleted cells. Our findings uncover another important host protein needed for L. monocytogenes membrane protrusion formation and efficient microbial dissemination."

Introducing a new pathway from an exogenous source via biotechnology enables the creation of a new trait, where the biosynthetic pathway for such a new trait is not available in the host crop.

Strigolactones and their precursors are synthesized in root tips as well as along shoot and root vasculature; they either move shoot-wards and regulate plant architecture or are exuded from roots into the soil to establish mycorrhizal symbiosis. Owing to the difficulty in quantification of SL in shoot tissues because of low abundance, it is not yet clear how SL distribution in plants is regulated at short- and long-distances from SL biosynthetic and target tissues. To address this question, we grafted wildtype scions and rootstocks from different petunia mutants for SL biosynthesis/transport and investigated SL activity by quantifying lateral bud outgrowth in the main shoot. Based on these results, we show that i) the previously reported petunia SL transporter PLEIOTROPIC DRUG RESISTANCE 1 (PDR1) directly accounts for short-distance SL transport and ii) long distance transport of SLs seems to be partially and not-directly dependent on PDR1. These data suggest that the root-to-shoot transport of SLs occurs either via the vasculature bundle through transporters other than PDR1 or involves SL precursors that are not substrates of PDR1.",Beyond CLIP: advances and opportunities to measure RBP-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076772,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 11,"RNA is an essential player in almost all biological processes, and has an ever-growing number of roles in regulating cellular growth and organization.

Investigating these biological questions has fueled the development of new quantitative technologies to measure how RNA and RBPs interact both locally and on a global scale.

In the past decade, coumarins have emerged as iron-mobilizing compounds that are secreted by plant roots and aid in iron uptake from iron-deprived soils. Members of the coumarin family are found in many plant species. Besides their role in iron uptake, coumarins have been extensively studied for their potential to fight infections in both plants and animals. Coumarin activities range from antimicrobial and antiviral to anticoagulant and anticancer. In the past decade, studies in the model plant species tobacco and Arabidopsis have significantly increased our understanding of coumarin biosynthesis, accumulation, secretion, chemical modification, and their modes of action against plant pathogens. Here we review current knowledge on coumarins in different plant species. We focus on simple coumarins and provide an overview on their biosynthesis and role in environmental stress responses, with special attention for the recently discovered semiochemical role of coumarins in aboveground and belowground plant-microbe interactions and the assembly of the root microbiome.",Replacing Part of Glucose with Galactose in the Postweaning Diet Protects Female But Not Male Mice from High-Fat Diet-Induced Adiposity in Later Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076770,The Journal of nutrition,2019 05 11,"Duration of breastfeeding is positively associated with decreased adiposity and increased metabolic health in later life, which might be related to galactose.",Self-powered RNA nanomachine driven by metastable structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076769,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 11,"Many non-coding and regulatory RNA elements have evolved to exploit transient or metastable structures that emerge during transcription to control complex folding pathways or to encode dynamic functions. However, efforts to engineer synthetic RNA devices have mostly focused on the thermodynamically stable structures. Consequently, significant challenges and opportunities exist in engineering functional RNAs that explicitly take advantage of cotranscriptionally generated transient or metastable structures. In this work, we designed a short RNA sequence that adopts a robust metastable structure when transcribed by an RNA polymerase. Although the metastable structure persists for hours at low temperature, it refolds almost completely into the thermodynamically stable structure upon heat denaturation followed by cooling. The synthetic RNA was also equipped with the Broccoli aptamer so that it can bind its ligand and become fluorescent only in the thermodynamically stable structure. We further demonstrated that the relaxation to the thermodynamically stable and fluorescent structure can be catalyzed by a short trigger RNA in a sequence-specific manner. Finally, the RNA architecture was redesigned to sense and respond to microRNA sequences. In summary, we designed RNA nanomachines that can detect an RNA sequence, amplify signal and produce an optical output, all encoded in a single RNA transcript, self-powered by a metastable structure.",Light-induced artemisinin biosynthesis is regulated by the bZIP transcription factor AaHY5 in Artemisia annua.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076768,Plant & cell physiology,2019 05 11,"Artemisinin, the frontline drug against malaria, is a sesquiterpenoid extracted from Artemisia annua. Light has been proposed to play an important role in the activation of artemisinin biosynthesis. Here, we report the basic leucine zipper transcription factor AaHY5 as a key regulator of light-induced biosynthesis of artemisinin. We show that AaHY5 transcription overlaps with that of artemisinin biosynthesis genes in response to light and in A. annua tissues. Analysis of AaHY5 over-expression and RNAi-suppression lines suggests that AaHY5 is a positive regulator of the expression of artemisinin biosynthesis genes and accumulation of artemisinin. We show that AaHY5 complements the hy5 mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data further suggests that AaHY5 interacts with AaCOP1, the ubiquitin E3 ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 in A. annua. In yeast one hybrid and transient expression assays, we demonstrate that AaHY5 acts via the transcription factor GLANDULAR TRICHOME-SPECIFIC WRKY 1 (AaGSW1) in artemisinin regulation. In summary, we present a novel regulator of artemisinin gene expression and propose a model in which AaHY5 indirectly controls artemisinin production in response to changing light conditions.",Sperm entry into the egg cell induces the progression of karyogamy in rice zygotes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076767,Plant & cell physiology,2019 05 11,"Karyogamy is a prerequisite event for plant embryogenesis, in which dynamic changes in nuclear architecture and the establishment of appropriate gene expression patterns must occur. However, the precise role of the male and female gametes in the progression of karyogamy still remains elusive. Here, we show that the sperm cell possesses the unique property to drive steady and swift nuclear fusion. When we fertilized egg cells with sperm cells in vitro, the immediate fusion of the male and female nuclei in the zygote progressed. This rapid nuclear fusion did not occur when two egg cells were artificially fused. However, the nuclear fusion of two egg nuclei could be accelerated by additional sperm entry or the exogenous application of calcium, suggesting that possible increase of cytosolic Ca2+ level via sperm entry into the egg cell efficiently can facilitate karyogamy. In contrast to zygotes, the egg-egg fusion cells failed to proliferate beyond an early developmental stage. Our transcriptional analyses also revealed the rapid activation of zygotic genes in zygotes, whereas there was no expression in fused cells without the male contribution. Thus, the male sperm cell has the ability to cause immediate karyogamy and to establish appropriate gene expression patterns in the zygote."

However, the relationship between the mutagenic influence of replication timing and its developmental plasticity remains unexplored. Here, we studied the distribution of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the zebrafish genome in relation to changes in DNA replication timing during embryonic development in this model vertebrate species. We show that CNV sites exhibit strong replication timing plasticity during development, replicating significantly early during early development but significantly late during more advanced developmental stages. Reciprocally, genomic regions that changed their replication timing during development contained a higher proportion of CNVs than developmentally-constant regions. Developmentally-plastic CNV sites, in particular those that become delayed in their replication timing, were enriched for the clustered protocadherins, a set of genes important for neuronal development that have undergone extensive genetic and epigenetic diversification during zebrafish evolution. In contrast, SNP sites replicated consistently early throughout embryonic development, highlighting a unique aspect of the zebrafish genome.

In this study, the morphology of developing microspore and mature pollen was compared between a KCMS line and its near-isogenic restorer line (KCMS-NIL). The most striking difference is that the microspore was unable to develop into tricellular pollen in the KCMS line. MicroRNA play vital roles in flowering and gametophyte development. Small RNA sequencing identified a total of 274 known and 401 novel miRNAs differentially expressed between two lines or two developmental stages. Most of miRNAs with high abundance were differentially expressed at the uninucleate stage, and their expression level recovered or remained at the binucleate stage. Further degradome sequencing identified target genes which were mainly enriched in transcription regulation, phytohormone signaling and RNA degradation pathways. Combining with the transcriptome data, a correlation was found between the abnormal anther development, such as post-meiotic mitosis cessation, deformative pollen wall and the chromosome condensation of the vegetative cell, and the alterations in the related miRNA and their targets expression profiles. According to the correlation and pathway analysis, we propose a hypothetic miRNA-mediated network for the control of KCMS restoration.",Pathogenic budding yeasts isolated outside of clinical settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076749,FEMS yeast research,2019 05 11,"Budding yeasts are distributed across a wide range of habitats, including as human commensals. However, under some conditions, these commensals can cause superficial, invasive, and even lethal infections. Despite their importance to human health, little is known about the ecology of these opportunistic pathogens, aside from their associations with mammals and clinical environments. During a survey of approximately 1000 non-clinical samples across the United States of America, we isolated 54 strains of budding yeast species considered opportunistic pathogens, including Candida albicans and Candida (Nakaseomyces) glabrata. We found that, as a group, pathogenic yeasts were positively associated with fruits and soil environments, whereas the species Pichia kudriavzevii (syn. Candida krusei syn. Issatchenkia orientalis) had a significant association with plants. Of the four species that cause 95% of candidiasis, we found a positive association with soil. These results suggest that pathogenic yeast ecology is more complex and diverse than is currently appreciated and raises the possibility that these additional environments could be a point of contact for human infections.",Synergistic effects of temperature and salinity on the gene expression and physiology of Crassostrea virginica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076748,Integrative and comparative biology,2019 05 11,"The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, forms reefs that provide critical services to the surrounding ecosystem. These reefs are at risk from climate change, in part because altered rainfall patterns may amplify local fluctuations in salinity, impacting oyster recruitment, survival, and growth. As in other marine organisms, warming water temperatures might interact with these changes in salinity to synergistically influence oyster physiology. In this study, we used comparative transcriptomics, measurements of physiology, and a field assessment to investigate what phenotypic changes C. virginica uses to cope with combined temperature and salinity stress in the Gulf of Mexico. Oysters from a historically low salinity site (Sister Lake, Louisiana) were exposed to fully crossed temperature (20 °C and 30 °C) and salinity (25, 15, and 7 PSU) treatments. Using comparative transcriptomics on oyster gill tissue, we identified a greater number of genes that were differentially expressed in response to low salinity at warmer temperatures. Functional enrichment analysis showed low overlap between genes differentially expressed in response to thermal stress compared to hypoosmotic stress and identified enrichment for gene ontologies associated with cell adhesion, transmembrane transport, and microtubule-based process. Experiments also showed that oysters changed their physiology at elevated temperatures and lowered salinity, with significantly increased respiration rates between 20 °C and 30 °C. However, despite the higher energetic demands oysters did not increase their feeding rate. To investigate transcriptional differences between populations in situ, we collected gill tissue from three locations and two time points across the Louisiana Gulf coast and used qPCR to measure the expression levels of seven target genes. We found an upregulation of genes that function in osmolyte transport, oxidative stress mediation, apoptosis, and protein synthesis at our low salinity site and sampling time point. In summary, oysters altered their phenotype more in response to low salinity at higher temperatures as evidenced by a higher number of differentially expressed genes during laboratory exposure, increased respiration (higher energetic demands), and in situ differential expression by season and location. These synergistic effects of hypoosmotic stress and increased temperature suggest that climate change will exacerbate the negative effects of low salinity exposure on eastern oysters.",Genome Plasticity in Papillomaviruses and De Novo Emergence of E5 Oncogenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076746,Genome biology and evolution,2019 06 16,"The clinical presentations of papillomavirus (PV) infections come in many different flavors. While most PVs are part of a healthy skin microbiota and are not associated to physical lesions, other PVs cause benign lesions, and only a handful of PVs are associated to malignant transformations linked to the specific activities of the E5, E6, and E7 oncogenes. The functions and origin of E5 remain to be elucidated. These E5 open reading frames (ORFs) are present in the genomes of a few polyphyletic PV lineages, located between the early and the late viral gene cassettes. We have computationally assessed whether these E5 ORFs have a common origin and whether they display the properties of a genuine gene. Our results suggest that during the evolution of Papillomaviridae, at least four events lead to the presence of a long noncoding DNA stretch between the E2 and the L2 genes. In three of these events, the novel regions evolved coding capacity, becoming the extant E5 ORFs. We then focused on the evolution of the E5 genes in AlphaPVs infecting primates. The sharp match between the type of E5 protein encoded in AlphaPVs and the infection phenotype (cutaneous warts, genital warts, or anogenital cancers) supports the role of E5 in the differential oncogenic potential of these PVs. In our analyses, the best-supported scenario is that the five types of extant E5 proteins within the AlphaPV genomes may not have a common ancestor. However, the chemical similarities between E5s regarding amino acid composition prevent us from confidently rejecting the model of a common origin. Our evolutionary interpretation is that an originally noncoding region entered the genome of the ancestral AlphaPVs. This genetic novelty allowed to explore novel transcription potential, triggering an adaptive radiation that yielded three main viral lineages encoding for different E5 proteins, displaying distinct infection phenotypes. Overall, our results provide an evolutionary scenario for the de novo emergence of viral genes and illustrate the impact of such genotypic novelty in the phenotypic diversity of the viral infections.","Revisiting the evolution and taxonomy of Clostridia, a phylogenomic update.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076745,Genome biology and evolution,2019 05 11,"Clostridium is a large genus of obligate anaerobes belonging to the Firmicutes phylum of bacteria, most of which have a Gram-positive cell wall structure. The genus includes significant human and animal pathogens, causative of potentially deadly diseases such as tetanus and botulism.

Currently, species belonging to the genus are placed in the unnatural order defined as Clostridiales, which includes the class Clostridia. Here we used genomic data from 779 strains to study the taxonomy and evolution of the group. This analysis allowed us to; (i) confirm that the group is composed of more than one genus (ii), detect major differences between pathogens classified as a single species within the group of authentic Clostridium spp. (sensu stricto), (iii) identify inconsistencies between taxonomy and toxin evolution that reflect on the pervasive misclassification of strains and, (iv) identify differential traits within central metabolism of members of what has been defined earlier and confirmed by us as cluster I. Our analysis shows that the current taxonomic classification of Clostridium species hinders the prediction of functions and traits, suggests a new classification for this fascinating class of bacteria and highlights the importance of phylogenomics for taxonomic studies.",Esophageal contractility increases and gastroesophageal reflux does not worsen after lung transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076744,Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus,2019 05 11,"Gastroesophageal reflux and esophageal dysmotility are common in patients with advanced lung disease and are associated with allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation.

The teaching is mainly delivered in lecture-based or phantom head room settings. The majority of schools provided direct clinical experience in procedures relating to peri-implant maintenance, although in some schools it was stated that not every student was guaranteed to receive such experience. In 86% of schools, students gained experience in oral hygiene and scaling, while 71% and 64% provided experience of non-surgical management of patients with peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis, respectively. The main barrier to developing the implant programme was an insufficient number of suitable cases.Conclusions Although all responding schools provide implant training, the overall findings show that further development and improvement of implant teaching in dental hygiene and therapy schools within the UK and Ireland is required, particularly with respect to direct clinical experience. This will ensure that newly qualified dental hygienists and therapists are sufficiently prepared for managing implant patients in their clinical practice.",Management of carious primary molars within the community dental setting in Wales: a retrospective observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076701,British dental journal,2019 05 15,"Background Tertiary prevention is still an integral part of a child's healthcare. In community dental service (CDS), we aim to try to restore carious primary teeth in young children as a means of caries control.Aim To assess the survival rates of individual carious primary molars within CDS, based on the type of dental interventions.Design Retrospective observational study.Methods Fifty patients' notes were reviewed, and patients were selected using a defined protocol. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves.Results Out of 251 teeth, the estimated survival rates of teeth restored with stainless steel crowns (SSC) was the highest at 46.7 months, GIC-restored teeth at 45.8 months and unrestored teeth at 18.2 months. There was no correlation seen between the survival rates and the number of further interventions required. The difference between the survival rates of teeth restored with GIC, SSC and unrestored was statistically significant (p <0.05). There was minimal use of SSCs within this sample.Conclusion Our present findings indicate that restored teeth have higher survival rates than unrestored teeth. However, it must be emphasised that restorative treatment may not always be feasible and other factors should be considered in the treatment planning.","Frequency, variation and cost of dental extractions for adults in secondary care in Great Britain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076700,British dental journal,2019 05 11,"Aims We have conducted a survey of administrative data, aiming to investigate the reported provision of dental extraction under general anaesthesia in the NHS for adults in secondary care in the following aspects: 1) anaesthetic data accessibility by NHS organisations; 2) the number and proportion of dental extraction episodes by anaesthetic modality and procedure type; 3) the economic cost of dental general anaesthesia (DGA) for adults; 4) variations in the anaesthetic provision between commissioning regions and organisation types. Methods We collected data from individual secondary care NHS organisations that provide dental extraction services in England, Wales and Scotland. A data collection form was devised to capture the number of episodes of dental extraction under each relevant oral surgery procedure code per anaesthetic modality per institution from October 2015 to September 2016. Results The majority (64.0%, n = 96,659) of the episodes were categorised into an anaesthetic modality; 39.2% (n = 37,902) under general anaesthesia, 18.7% (n = 18,050) under sedation, and 42.1% (n = 40,707) under local anaesthesia. The majority of sedation provision (84.9%) derived from dental hospitals. A substantial proportion (37.0%) of the episodes could not be assigned an anaesthetic modality. Variations in dental general anaesthesia activity were observed with respect to the commissioning regions and organisation types. The annual cost of adult DGA from 81 out of 150 organisations that provided DGA data was estimated to be over £19 million, based on the NHS payment by results tariff 2015-2016. Conclusion Our data suggest that the number of adult DGA episodes and the associated cost are considerable, and highlights the scope for improving the quality of data for commissioners and providers to support discussions over patient pathways.",Analysis of highly tweeted dental journals and articles: a science mapping approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076699,British dental journal,2019 05 11,"Aim We aimed to rank dental journals according to the number of Twitter mentions related to their articles. We set out to analyse and visualise the bibliometric characteristics of highly tweeted articles.Methods Twitter mentions were extracted from the Altmetric database. Bibliometric data were obtained from the Web of Science and analysed by VOSviewer software. Hotspots among highly tweeted articles visualised by keyword co-occurrence network analysis. Bibliographic coupling network analysis was used to find the most influential journals, institutions and countries.Results A total of 20,520 Twitter accounts which shared 93,776 tweets related to 23,686 articles from 91 journals were analysed. The British Dental Journal had the highest number of Twitter mentions related to dental articles. Children, dental caries, and periodontal disease were the hottest topics among the 134 highly tweeted dental articles. @The_BDJ had the highest number of tweets related to dental articles, followed by @Dddent2 and @gary_takacs. @TheBDA had the highest number of followers, followed by @Dddent2 and @The_BDJ.Discussion Ground breaking issues such as genomic medicine, stem cells, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence were not seen among the highly tweeted dental articles. In the 'Twittersphere', some independent scientists are more active than well-known dental organisations and journals. The journals are strongly recommended to be proactive in Twittersphere, to set up their own Twitter profile, and to promote their visibility and social impact by immediately tweeting the articles. Researchers should be alert to the overuse of Twitter in scholarly communications. The Kardashian index will be a useful tool to measure the over/under activity of a researcher on Twitter.",A systematic review of botulinum toxin in the management of patients with temporomandibular disorders and bruxism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076698,British dental journal,2019 05 11,"Introduction The medical and cosmetic use of botulinum toxin (BTX) is now widespread. With an increased number of clinicians adopting the use of BTX in the management of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and/or bruxism, as either a standalone treatment or as an adjunct, affirmation is required in regards to whether it has a clinically justifiable position among the current spectrum of available treatment modalities.Objectives To establish the usefulness of BTX when treating patients with TMD and/or bruxism, and thereby determine whether there may be an appropriate purpose for the prescription of BTX in the management of these patients.Data sources and data selection A systematic review of the relevant literature was conducted. The literature search was carried out by applying key terms to appropriate data sources (Medline, Embase, Pubmed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and OpenSIGLE). The resultant papers were subjected to inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were then assessed for bias using a framework outlined in the Cochrane Handbook.Results A total of 11 trials met the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome measure was changes in pain experience in groups that had been treated with BTX, relative to an appropriate control group. Secondary outcomes included changes in the frequency of bruxism events, changes in maximum mouth opening, changes in occlusal force and changes in electromyography (EMG) readings of muscles of mastication.Conclusion The evidence to support the use of BTX in the management of TMD and/or bruxism is not entirely unequivocal. A number of studies that have met the inclusion criteria have shown promising results and thereby justify further investigation. Given the current evidence, BTX should certainly be considered but due to financial implications and possible side effects, it seems appropriate that conservative options, such as self-management with explanation and physical therapies, should be exhausted first.",Potential neurovascular damage as a result of dental implant placement in the anterior maxilla.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076691,British dental journal,2019 05 11,"Introduction A patient requested dental implant therapy to replace his missing upper left central incisor. Pre-operative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging revealed a complex neurovascular supply to the anterior maxilla.Discussion Imaging demonstrated accessory neurovascular canals around the nasopalatine foramen which directly communicate with canalis sinuosus. They are, therefore, most likely to carry branches of the anterior superior alveolar nerve and vessels. One of these canals was directly in the path of proposed dental implant placement. A review of the dental literature suggests that such anatomical variation is relatively common. Some authors have proposed that injury to these structures is a cause of intractable pain following dental implant placement. Following discussion with the patient, it was agreed that the provision of an adhesive bridge was a realistic alternative in this case.Conclusion The availability of CBCT imaging in recent years has shown that complex neurovascular anatomy in the anterior maxilla is not uncommon. Evidence is lacking regarding the relevance of this to dental implant placement but it is possible that injury to these structures explains some cases of postoperative intractable pain.",Unintended changes to the occlusion following the provision of night guards.

However, hypertension effects on the right ventricle (RV) have not been sufficiently investigated; only in recent years, with the development of new imaging modalities, has its importance become widely recognized. Indeed, evidence from clinical trials suggestive of RV functional and structural impairment early in the course of arterial hypertension continues to accumulate. Newer imaging techniques, especially speckle-tracking-derived myocardial deformation imaging, have provided new insights into the effect of systemic hypertension on this previously neglected cardiac chamber. Two- and three-dimensional echocardiography, along with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, forms the cornerstone of RV structural and functional assessment. This article provides an overview of the effect of longstanding hypertension on RV structure and function, the respective underlying mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic implications. It summarizes the available options for RV structural and functional assessment, and evaluates the existing evidence with respect to RV alterations in hypertensive disease, aiming to assess the current limits of scientific knowledge about a heart chamber that has only recently become the focus of greater interest.","Short distance pollen dispersal and low genetic diversity in a subcanopy tropical rainforest tree, Fontainea picrosperma (Euphorbiaceae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076650,Heredity,2019 05 11,"Gene flow via pollen movement affects genetic variation in plant populations and is an important consideration in plant domestication. Fontainea picrosperma is a subcanopy rainforest tree that is of commercial interest because it is the source of tigilanol tiglate, a natural product used for the treatment of solid tumors. We identify patterns of pollen-mediated gene flow within natural populations of F. picrosperma and estimate genetic parameters and genetic structure between adult and juvenile groups using microsatellite markers. Our results show pollination events occur over much shorter distances than reported for tropical canopy species. At least 63% of seeds are sired by male trees located within 30 m of the mother. On average, 27% of the local male population contributed to successful reproduction of F. picrosperma with most fathers siring a single seed, however, the contributions to reproduction were uneven. Larger male trees with more flowers had greater reproductive success than those with less flowers (P < 0.05). There were comparatively low levels of genetic variation across the species (HE = 0.405 for adult trees and 0.379 for juveniles) and we found no loss of genetic diversity between adult and juvenile trees. Short distance pollen flow and low genetic diversity is theoretically a prelude to genetic impoverishment, however F. picrosperma has persisted through multiple significant climatic oscillations. Nevertheless, the remaining low genetic diversity is of concern for domestication programs which require maximal genetic diversity to facilitate efficient selective breeding and genetic improvement of this commercially significant species.",Identification of a gene encoding polygalacturonase expressed specifically in short styles in distylous common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076649,Heredity,2019 05 16,"Common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a heteromorphic self-incompatible (SI) species with two types of floral architecture: thrum (short style) and pin (long style). The floral morphology and intra-morph incompatibility are controlled by a single genetic locus, S. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the heteromorphic self-incompatibility of common buckwheat remain unclear. To identify these mechanisms, we performed proteomic, quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and linkage analyses. Comparison of protein profiles between the long and short styles revealed a protein unique to the short style. Amino-acid sequencing revealed that it was a truncated form of polygalacturonase (PG); we designated the gene encoding this protein FePG1. Phylogenetic analysis classified FePG1 into the same clade as PGs that function in pollen development and floral morphology. FePG1 expression was significantly higher in short styles than in long styles. It was expressed in flowers of a short-homostyle line but not in flowers of a long-homostyle line. Linkage analysis indicated that FePG1 was not linked to the S locus; it could be a factor downstream of this locus. Our finding of a gene putatively working under the regulation of the S locus provides useful information for elucidation of the mechanism of heteromorphic self-incompatibility.",Inhibition of tumour necrosis factor alpha in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease by etanercept treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076648,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the CAG repeat in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in a mutant protein with an extended polyglutamine tract. Inflammation occurs in both the brain and the periphery of HD patients and mouse models, with increases in brain and/or plasma levels of neurotoxic TNFα and several other proinflammatory cytokines. TNFα promotes the generation of many of these cytokines, such as IL6, which raises the possibility that TNFα is central to the inflammatory milieu associated with HD. A number of mouse studies have reported that the suppression of chronic immune activation during HD has beneficial consequences. Here, we investigated whether TNFα contributes to the peripheral inflammation that occurs in the R6/2 mouse model, and whether the in vivo blockade of TNFα, via etanercept treatment, can modify disease progression. We found that etanercept treatment normalised the elevated plasma levels of some cytokines. This did not modify the progression of certain behavioural measures, but slightly ameliorated brain weight loss, possibly related to a reduction in the elevated striatal level of soluble TNFα.",Newborn screening for Pompe disease in Japan: report and literature review of mutations in the GAA gene in Japanese and Asian patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076647,Journal of human genetics,2019 05 11,"A newborn screening program for Pompe disease using dried blood spots (DBSs) was initiated in Japan. Here, we summarized this screening program and described the results of the GAA gene analysis. From April 2013 to November 2016, 103,204 newborns were screened; 71 had low acid alpha-glucosidase (AαGlu) activity. GAA sequencing showed that 32 (45.1%) and 37 (52.1%) of these newborns were homozygous and heterozygous for pseudodeficiency alleles c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A], respectively. Moreover, 24 of 32 newborns with homozygous c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles had no mutations, and the other eight had one mutation each. Thirty-five of 37 newborns with heterozygous c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles had one mutation, and the other two had two mutations each. Only one newborn who had two mutations did not harbor c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles. Thus, it was difficult to distinguish newborns with c.[1726G>A; 2965G>A] alleles from newborns with pre-symptomatic Pompe disease using AαGlu assays in DBSs or fibroblasts; GAA gene sequencing was necessary. Seventy-one newborns had 50 variants, including 21 mutations or predictably pathogenic variants, and 29 polymorphisms or predictably non-pathogenic variants. Four of 21 mutations or predictably pathogenic variants and four of 29 polymorphisms or predictably non-pathogenic variants were novel. No infantile-onset Pompe disease was detected, and three newborns were diagnosed with potential late-onset Pompe disease. In the literature, 156 variants have been reported for 296 patients from 277 families in 41 articles from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and China.

As it comprises a mechanistic model embedded in neurophysiology, the findings of this approach may shed light onto inference and neurobiological causes of transition to psychosis.",Analysis of the risk factors for tracheostomy and decannulation after traumatic cervical spinal cord injury in an aging population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076645,Spinal cord,2019 05 11,Retrospective study.,TREML4 mRNA Expression and Polymorphisms in Blood Leukocytes are Associated with Atherosclerotic Lesion Extension in Coronary Artery Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076644,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Members of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) family are associated with atherosclerosis risk and progression. TREML4 is upregulated in the early phase of acute coronary syndrome. We investigated the relationship between the mRNA expression of 13 genes in blood leukocytes, TREML4 polymorphisms, and coronary artery lesion extension (Friesinger index) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 137). TREML4 rs2803495 (A > G) and rs2803496 (T > C) variants and leukocyte mRNA expression were analysed by qRT-PCR. TREML4 expression was higher in patients with major coronary artery lesions than in subjects without or with low and intermediate lesions (p < 0.05). However, TREML4 polymorphisms were not associated with coronary lesion extent. Presence of the rs2803495 G allele was not associated with increased TREML4 mRNA expression. Patients carrying the rs2803496 C allele (TC/CC genotypes) were more likely to express TREML4 mRNA than non-C allele carriers (allele C: OR 7.3, and 95% CI 1.9-27.5, p = 0.03). In conclusion, increased TREML4 mRNA expression in blood leukocytes is influenced by gene polymorphisms and is associated with more severe coronary artery lesions, suggesting its potential as a biomarker of the extent of coronary lesions in patients with CAD.",Efficacy of the novel CDK7 inhibitor QS1189 in mantle cell lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076643,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is typically an aggressive and rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with a poor prognosis despite recent advances in immunochemotherapy and targeted therapeutics against NHL. New therapeutic agents are needed for MCL. In this study, we generated a potent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), designated QS1189, and confirmed its anti-cancer effects towards MCL and other lymphomas. QS1189 was highly selective for CDK7 and showed potent anticancer effects in MCL compared to other targeted therapeutic agents, such as ibrutinib and venetoclax. Consistent with a conventional CDK7 inhibitor, QS1189 treatment significantly decreased phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and transcription-associated genes. QS1189 induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and apoptosis. Interestingly, QS1189 overcame the acquired resistance to venetoclax, which is mediated by Bcl-xL. Similarly, QS1189 showed potent tumour cell growth inhibition of various lymphomas. Thus, CDK7 might be a suitable therapeutic target for inhibiting lymphoma, and QS1189 is a promising therapeutic option for various lymphomas and cells with acquired resistance to targeted therapy.",Complement C3 activation regulates the production of tRNA-derived fragments Gly-tRFs and promotes alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076642,Cell research,2019 05 11,"Complement is known to play a role in alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, thereby constraining the development of a rational approach for therapeutic intervention in the complement system. C3 deficiency has been shown to impart protective effects against ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Here we demonstrate a protection effect in wild-type mice by treatment with CR2-Crry, a specific inhibitor of C3 activation. The expression of glycine transfer (t) RNA-derived fragments (Gly-tRFs) is upregulated in ethanol-fed mice and inhibition of Gly-tRFs in vivo decreases chronic ethanol feeding-induced hepatosteatosis without affecting inflammation. The expression of Gly-tRF was downregulated in C3-deficient or CR2-Crry-treated mice, but not in C5-deficient mice; Gly-tRF expression was restored by the C3 activation products C3a or Asp (C3a-des-Arg) via the regulation of CYP2E1. Transcriptome profiling of hepatic tissues showed that Gly-tRF inhibitors upregulate the expression of sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and subsequently affect downstream lipogenesis and β-oxidation pathways. Mechanistically, Gly-tRF interacts with AGO3 to downregulate Sirt1 expression via sequence complementarity in the 3' UTR. Notably, the expression levels of C3d, CYP2E1 and Gly-tRF are upregulated, whereas Sirt1 is decreased in AFLD patients compared to healthy controls. Collectively, our findings suggest that C3 activation products contribute to hepatosteatosis by regulating the expression of Gly-tRF. Complement inhibition at the C3 activation step and treatment with Gly-tRF inhibitors may be potential and precise therapeutic approaches for AFLD."

This work will elucidate the effect of miR-494 on EndMT and development of HCC. Therefore, the differential miRNA expression among non-tumorous, para-tumorous and tumorous tissues was analyzed. Moreover, luciferase activities of SIRT3 3'UTR treated with miR-494 were determined. Then human hepatoma cell lines were dealt with mimics or inhibitors of miR-494, migration and proliferation ability were assessed. The expression of SIRT3 and markers of mesenchymal cell were analyzed. The influences of miR-494 on development of HCC through inducing EndMT by targeting SIRT3 and TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathways in hepatoma cell lines were investigated. Xenograft mice were used to explore the potential roles of miR-494 on EndMT and development of HCC in vivo. Our results showed that, compared with non-tumorous tissues, 17 miRNAs were upregulated and 3 miRNAs were down-regulated in tumor tissues. In tumor tissues, the miR-494 expression level was much more than the expression of para-tumorous and non-tumorous tissues. MiR-494 suppressed SIRT3 expression, additionally enhanced expression of mesenchymal cell markers, while exerted effects on cell proliferation and migration of hepatoma cell lines. Moreover, the antagomir of miR-494 could protect against development process in xenogarft murine model. In conclusions, our work demonstrated that miR-494 targeted to SIRT3, and was a crucial mediator of EndMT and development of HCC through regulating SIRT3/TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway. It suggested that aim at SIRT3/TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway through suppressing the miR-494 expression level, was a feasible therapy strategy for HCC.",A survey for ketamine abuse and its relation to the lower urinary tract symptoms in Taiwan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076629,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"We aimed to explore the correlation between ketamine abuse and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and epidemiology of ketamine cystitis. Questionnaire records of ketamine abusers, such as sex, age, and details of using ketamine, including consumption method, amount, duration of ketamine use, and LUTS, were obtained from two private rehabilitation centers. We analyzed these factors and established a severity forecasting module. One hundred and six ketamine abusers completed the questionnaires. LUTS showed an onset time of 24.67 ± 26.36 months among ketamine abusers. Overactive bladder symptom score, international prostate symptom score-storage, interstitial cystitis symptom index, interstitial cystitis problem index, and visual analogue scale score were 5.25 ± 4.43, 5.95 ± 5.72, 10.96 ± 6.66, 9.73 ± 5.82, and 2.55 ± 3.18, respectively. All symptom scores were positively correlated with the duration of ketamine abuse. Ketamine snorting was significantly correlated with all symptom scores compared to smoking. Hydrodistention, intravesical hyaluronic acid instillation, intravesical injection with botulinum toxin, and hyperbaric-oxygen therapy showed better effect than oral treatment. Ketamine can induce severe storage symptoms, such as frequency or nocturia depending on the duration of abuse. Ketamine snorting may cause worse LUTS than smoking. Combining ketamine and other substances may exacerbate LUTS. Intravesical therapy may lead to better outcomes than oral treatment.",σ54 (σL) plays a central role in carbon metabolism in the industrially relevant Clostridium beijerinckii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076628,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The solventogenic C. beijerinckii DSM 6423, a microorganism that naturally produces isopropanol and butanol, was previously modified by random mutagenesis. In this work, one of the resulting mutants was characterized. This strain, selected with allyl alcohol and designated as the AA mutant, shows a dominant production of acids, a severely diminished butanol synthesis capacity, and produces acetone instead of isopropanol. Interestingly, this solvent-deficient strain was also found to have a limited consumption of two carbohydrates and to be still able to form spores, highlighting its particular phenotype. Sequencing of the AA mutant revealed point mutations in several genes including CIBE_0767 (sigL), which encodes the σ54 sigma factor. Complementation with wild-type sigL fully restored solvent production and sugar assimilation and RT-qPCR analyses revealed its transcriptional control of several genes related to solventogensis, demonstrating the central role of σ54 in C. beijerinckii DSM 6423.

However, fundamental properties of the system, such as the spacing of the kinesin motors bound to the microtubule and the dynamics of binding, remain poorly understood. We show that Fluorescence Interference Contrast (FLIC) microscopy can illuminate the exact height of the microtubule, which for a sufficiently low surface density of kinesin, reveals the locations of the bound motors. We examine the spacing of the kinesin motors on the microtubules at various kinesin surface densities and compare the results with theory.

Thirty- five (66%) isolates representing 4 genera (Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Brevisbacillus and Lysinibacillus) including 10 species were identified. The most important species were Bacillus cereus (30%) and Bacillus licheniformis (21%). Eighteen (34%) isolates were non-reactive Bacillus. The overall contamination rate on LJ with VCNT at 10 µg of vancomycin was statistically lower than which without VCNT (18.7% versus 43.8%) (p = 0.01). The most important SFB identified were B. cereus and B. licheniformis. Almost all identified strains were similar to those currently isolated in fermented traditional food suggesting in part food related contaminants. VCNT containing 10 µg of vancomycin is a good alternative method to reduce mycobacterial culture contamination.",Graphene Quantum Dots Decorated Gold-Polyaniline Nanowire for Impedimetric Detection of Carcinoembryonic Antigen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076624,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"A label-free impedimetric immunosensor based on N, S-graphene quantum dots@Au-polyaniline (N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI) nanowires was fabricated for the quantitative detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The N, S-GQDs and Au-PANI were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal pyrolysis and interfacial polymerization, respectively. Subsequently, 2-9 nm N, S-GQDs are successfully decorated onto 30-50 nm Au-PANI nanowires by Au-thiol linkage to serve as the bifunctional probe for amplifying the electrochemical activity as well as anchoring anti-CEA. The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires are excellent conducting materials to accelerate the electron transfer, while the formation of CEA antibody-antigen bioconjugates after the addition of CEA significantly increase the charge transfer resistance, and subsequently provides a highly stable and label-free immunoassay platform for the impedimetric detection of CEA. The label-free immunosensor exhibits a wide linear range from 0.5 to 1000 ng mL-1 with a low detection limit of 0.01 ng mL-1. The N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI based immunosensor also shows high selectivity and stability over other cancer makers and amino acids. Moreover, this promising platform is successfully applied to the detection of CEA in human serum samples with excellent recovery of (96.0 ± 2.6)-(103 ± 3.8)%. These results clearly demonstrate a newly developed highly efficient and label-free impedimetric immunosensor for the detection of CEA using N, S-GQDs@Au-PANI nanowires as the biosensing probe, which can pave the gateway for the fabrication of high performance and robust impedimetric immunosensor to detect cancer makers in early stage of cancer diagnosis and therapy.","A comprehensive analysis of the Lactuca sativa, L. transcriptome during different stages of the compatible interaction with Rhizoctonia solani.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076623,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The leafy green vegetable Lactuca sativa, L. is susceptible to the soil-born fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IB. In a previous study, we reported on the transcriptional response of R. solani AG1-IB (isolate 7/3/14) during the interspecies interaction with L. sativa cv. Tizian by means of RNA sequencing. Here we present the L. sativa transcriptome and metabolome from the same experimental approach. Three distinct interaction zones were sampled and compared to a blank (non-inoculated) sample: symptomless zone 1, zone 2 showing light brown discoloration, and a dark brown zone 3 characterized by necrotic lesions. Throughout the interaction, we observed a massive reprogramming of the L. sativa transcriptome, with 9231 unique genes matching the threshold criteria for differential expression. The lettuce transcriptome of the light brown zone 2 presents the most dissimilar profile compared to the uninoculated zone 4, marking the main stage of interaction. Transcripts putatively encoding several essential proteins that are involved in maintaining jasmonic acid and auxin homeostasis were found to be negatively regulated. These and other indicator transcripts mark a potentially inadequate defence response, leading to a compatible interaction. KEGG pathway mapping and GC-MS metabolome data revealed large changes in amino acid, lignin and hemicellulose related pathways and related metabolites.",The impact of differences in plasma glucose between glucose oxidase and hexokinase methods on estimated gestational diabetes mellitus prevalence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076622,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,We evaluated the extent of measurement discordance between glucose oxidase and hexokinase laboratory methods and the effect of this on estimated gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence in a routine clinical setting. 592 consecutive urban African women were screened for GDM. Paired venous specimens were submitted to two independent calibrated laboratories that used either method to measure plasma glucose concentrations. World Health Organisation diagnostic criteria were applied. GDM prevalence determined by the glucose oxidase and hexokinase methods was 6.9% and 5.1% respectively. The overall GDM prevalence was 9%. Only 34% of GDM positive diagnoses were common to both laboratory methods. Bland Altman plots identified a bias of 0.2 mmol/l between laboratory methods. Plasma glucose concentrations measured by the glucose oxidase method were more platykurtic in distribution. Low diagnostic agreement between laboratory methods was further indicated by a Cohen's kappa of 0.48 (p < 0.001). Reports of GDM prevalence using either the glucose oxidase or hexokinase laboratory methods may not be truly interchangeable or directly comparable.,Genetic inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation at serine 522 promotes axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076621,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Axonal degeneration occurs in various neurological diseases and traumatic nerve injury, and axonal regeneration is restricted by inhibitory factors in the central nervous system. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) are activated by one of those inhibitors, and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) is phosphorylated by both kinases. We previously developed a CRMP2 knock-in (CRMP2 KI) mouse line, in which CRMP2 phosphorylation at Ser 522 is inhibited. Because CRMP2 KI mice showed promotion of axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury, we hypothesized that CRMP2 KI mice would show higher axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury. In this study, we first show that depolymerization of microtubules after optic nerve crush (ONC) injury was suppressed in CRMP2 KI mice. Loss of retinal ganglia cells was also reduced after ONC. We found that protein level of GAP43, a marker of regenerative axons, was higher in the optic nerve from CRMP2KI than that from wild type 4 weeks after of ONC. We further observed increased numbers of axons labeled by tracer in the optic nerve after ONC in CRMP2 KI mice. These results suggest that inhibition of phosphorylation of CRMP2 suppresses axonal degeneration and promotes axonal regeneration after optic nerve injury."

However, optical properties of structured emitters reported so far degrade at temperatures approaching 1200 °C due to various degradation mechanisms. We have realized a 1D structured emitter based on a sputtered W-HfO2 layered metamaterial and demonstrated desired band edge spectral properties at 1400 °C. To the best of our knowledge the temperature of 1400 °C is the highest reported for a structured emitter, so far. The spatial confinement and absence of edges stabilizes the W-HfO2 multilayer system to temperatures unprecedented for other nanoscaled W-structures. Only when this confinement is broken W starts to show the well-known self-diffusion behavior transforming to spherical shaped W-islands. We further show that the oxidation of W by atmospheric oxygen could be prevented by reducing the vacuum pressure below 10-5 mbar. When oxidation is mitigated we observe that the 20 nm spatially confined W films survive temperatures up to 1400 °C. The demonstrated thermal stability is limited by grain growth in HfO2, which leads to a rupture of the W-layers, thus, to a degradation of the multilayer system at 1450 °C.",Statistical Properties and Predictability of Extreme Epileptic Events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076609,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The use of extreme events theory for the analysis of spontaneous epileptic brain activity is a relevant multidisciplinary problem. It allows deeper understanding of pathological brain functioning and unraveling mechanisms underlying the epileptic seizure emergence along with its predictability. The latter is a desired goal in epileptology which might open the way for new therapies to control and prevent epileptic attacks. With this goal in mind, we applied the extreme event theory for studying statistical properties of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of WAG/Rij rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy. Our approach allowed us to reveal extreme events inherent in this pathological spiking activity, highly pronounced in a particular frequency range. The return interval analysis showed that the epileptic seizures exhibit a highly-structural behavior during the active phase of the spiking activity. Obtained results evidenced a possibility for early (up to 7 s) prediction of epileptic seizures based on consideration of EEG statistical properties.",Human cytomegaloviral multifunctional protein kinase pUL97 impairs zebrafish embryonic development and increases mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076608,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Cytomegalovirus is a worldwide-distributed human pathogen, which is the leading cause of congenital virus infection, affecting 0.5 to 2% of live births. To date, it is largely unclear which molecular mechanisms underlie the symptomatic outcomes. This is mainly due to species specificity and limited homology among cytomegalovirus genomes. As it is not possible to infect model organisms with human cytomegalovirus, the aim of this study was to develop a heterologous system allowing in the future the elucidation of the pathological role of individual viral proteins. As a model organism the zebrafish has been chosen due to its ease of manipulation and characterization as well as its large offspring. As cytomegalovirus model protein, pUL97 was characterized because it is multiply involved in virus-host interaction. Here, we show in zebrafish embryos, that (i) pUL97 can be expressed in zebrafish, (ii) increasing pUL97 expression levels quantitatively correlate with both minor and major pathological defects, (iii) pUL97 expression impairs cell cycle progression and induces cell death, (iv) active pUL97, but not an inactive mutant, induces excess mortality, and (v) co-administration of a pUL97 inhibitor reduces embryonic pathology. Collectively, these data indicate the suitability of zebrafish to elucidate the pathological role of human cytomegaloviral proteins.",Metabolites and Lipids Associated with Fetal Swine Anatomy via Desorption Electrospray Ionization - Mass Spectrometry Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076607,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Chemical imaging by mass spectrometry (MS) has been largely used to study diseases in animals and humans, especially cancer; however, this technology has been minimally explored to study the complex chemical changes associated with fetal development. In this work, we report the histologically-compatible chemical imaging of small molecules by desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) - MS of a complete swine fetus at 50 days of gestation. Tissue morphology was unperturbed by morphologically-friendly DESI-MS analysis while allowing detection of a wide range of small molecules. We observed organ-dependent localization of lipids, e.g. a large diversity of phosphatidylserine lipids in brain compared to other organs, as well as metabolites such as N-acetyl-aspartic acid in the developing nervous system and N-acetyl-L-glutamine in the heart. Some lipids abundant in the lungs, such as PC(32:0) and PS(40:6), were  similar to surfactant composition reported previously. Sulfatides were highly concentrated in the fetus liver, while hexoses were barely detected at this organ but were abundant in lung and heart. The chemical information on small molecules recorded via DESI-MS imaging coupled with traditional anatomical evaluation is a powerful source of bioanalytical information which reveals the chemical changes associated with embryonic and fetal development that, when disturbed, causes congenital diseases such as spina bifida and cleft palate.",PA-X antagonises MAVS-dependent accumulation of early type I interferon messenger RNAs during influenza A virus infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076606,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The sensing of viral nucleic acids by the innate immune system activates a potent antiviral response in the infected cell, a key component of which is the expression of genes encoding type I interferons (IFNs). Many viruses counteract this response by blocking the activation of host nucleic acid sensors. The evolutionarily conserved influenza A virus (IAV) protein PA-X has been implicated in suppressing the host response to infection, including the expression of type I IFNs. Here, we characterise this further using a PA-X-deficient virus of the mouse-adapted PR8 strain to study activation of the innate immune response in a mouse model of the early response to viral infection. We show that levels of Ifna4 and Ifnb1 mRNAs in the lungs of infected mice were elevated in the absence of PA-X and that this was completely dependent on MAVS. This therefore suggests a role for PA-X in preventing the accumulation of early type I IFN mRNAs in the lung during IAV infection.",Inheritance of fruit yield and quality in melon (Cucumis melo L.) grown under field salinity stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076605,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Cultivation of salinity-tolerant crops can help mitigate salinization threats to soil and fresh water resources. This study was conducted to investigate the quantitative genetic basis of yield, yield components, and quality-related traits of salinity-stressed melon (Cucumis melo L.) using 55 melon hybrids and their 11 parents (half diallel). The results of combined ANOVA revealed highly significant effects of salinity and genotype on all the traits studied. Salinity stress influenced the inheritance of all the traits. The lower values of variance components (mainly additive), GCA/SCA ratio, as well as broad- and narrow-sense heritabilities were estimated for saline conditions (ECW = 14 dSm-1) when compared with those obtained under non-saline conditions. Fruit weight was governed by additive effects in non-saline conditions, but largely governed by the dominant nature in saline conditions. Based on the results obtained, especially as reflected by fruit yield, it is possible to develop melon hybrids with higher salinity tolerance than is currently observed in tolerant cultivars. On the other hand, most of the traits contributing to fruit quality are found to be governed by additive effects, allowing for their further improvement through recurrent selection to develop new cultivars of high yield and good quality for cultivation under saline conditions.",Polymorphisms of ADME-related genes and their implications for drug safety and efficacy in Amazonian Amerindians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076604,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The variation in the allelic frequencies of polymorphic pharmacogenes among different ethnic groups may be responsible for severe adverse reactions to or altered efficacy of a wide variety of drugs.

The genetic characteristics of these populations are poorly known, which can negatively impact the systematic application of treatments guided by pharmacogenomic guidelines. We investigated the diversity of 32 polymorphisms in genes responsible for drug Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) in Amazonian Amerindians, and compared the findings with populations from other continents available in the 1000 Genomes database. We found significantly different (P ≤ 1.56E-03) allelic frequencies and genotype distributions in many study markers in comparison with African, European, American and Asian populations. Based on FST values, the Amerindian population was also the most distinct (mean FST = 0.09917). These data highlight the unique genetic profile of the indigenous population from the Brazilian Amazon region, which is potentially important from a pharmacogenetic viewpoint. Understanding the diversity of ADME- related genetic markers is crucial to the implementation of individualized pharmacogenomic treatment protocols in Amerindian populations, as well as populations with a high degree of admixture with this ethnic group, such as the general Brazilian population.",Transducin activates cGMP phosphodiesterase by trapping inhibitory γ subunit freed reversibly from the catalytic subunit in solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076603,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) by activated transducin α subunit (Tα*) is a necessary step to generate a light response in vertebrate photoreceptors. PDE in rods is a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic subunits, PDEα and PDEβ, and two inhibitory PDEγ subunits, each binding to PDEα or PDEβ. Activation of PDE is achieved by relief of the inhibitory constraint of PDEγ on the catalytic subunit. In this activation mechanism, it is widely believed that Tα* binds to PDEγ still bound to the catalytic subunit, and removes or displaces PDEγ from the catalytic subunit. However, recent structural analysis showed that the binding of Tα* to PDEγ still bound to PDEα or PDEβ seems to be difficult because the binding site of PDEγ to PDEα or PDEβ overlaps with the binding site to Tα*. In the present study, we propose a novel activation mechanism of PDE, the trapping mechanism, in which Tα* activates PDE by trapping PDEγ released reversibly and spontaneously from the catalytic subunit. This mechanism well explains PDE activation by Tα* in solution. Our further analysis with this mechanism suggests that more effective PDE activation in disk membranes is highly dependent on the membrane environment.",Magnonic Floquet Quantum Spin Hall Insulator in Bilayer Collinear Antiferromagnets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076602,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"We study irradiated two-dimensional insulating bilayer honeycomb ferromagnets and antiferromagnets coupled antiferromagnetically with a zero net magnetization. The former is realized in the recently synthesized bilayer honeycomb chromium triiodide CrI3. In both systems, we show that circularly-polarized electric field breaks time-reversal symmetry and induces a dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in each honeycomb layer. However, the resulting bilayer antiferromagnetic system still preserves a combination of time-reversal and space-inversion ([Formula: see text]) symmetry. We show that the magnon topology of the bilayer antiferromagnetic system is characterized by a [Formula: see text] Floquet topological invariant. Therefore, the system realizes a magnonic Floquet quantum spin Hall insulator with spin filtered magnon edge states. This leads to a non-vanishing Floquet magnon spin Nernst effect, whereas the Floquet magnon thermal Hall effect vanishes due to [Formula: see text] symmetry. We study the rich [Formula: see text] Floquet topological magnon phase diagram of the system as a function of the light amplitudes and polarizations. We further discuss the great impact of the results on future experimental realizations.",Human adipose stromal-vascular fraction self-organizes to form vascularized adipose tissue in 3D cultures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076601,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Native human subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) is well organized into unilocular adipocytes interspersed within dense vascularization. This structure is completely lost under standard culture conditions and may impair the comparison with native tissue. Here, we developed a 3-D model of human white AT reminiscent of the cellular architecture found in vivo. Starting with adipose progenitors derived from the stromal-vascular fraction of human subcutaneous white AT, we generated spheroids in which endogenous endothelial cells self-assembled to form highly organized endothelial networks among stromal cells. Using an optimized adipogenic differentiation medium to preserve endothelial cells, we obtained densely vascularized spheroids containing mature adipocytes with unilocular lipid vacuoles. In vivo study showed that when differentiated spheroids were transplanted in immune-deficient mice, endothelial cells within the spheroids connected to the recipient circulatory system, forming chimeric vessels. In addition, adipocytes of human origin were still observed in transplanted mice. We therefore have developed an in vitro model of vascularized human AT-like organoids that constitute an excellent tool and model for any study of human AT."

Additionally, we preliminary tested the cytotoxicity of some H. indicus's phytochemicals on leukemia cells and their intestinal absorption on a human intestinal epithelium model consisting of a monolayer of differentiated Caco2 cells. We observed a potent antileukemic effect for H. indicus, imputable to the modulation of different critical targets at protein and mRNA levels and the reduction of the 26S proteasome expression. We found that some phytomarkers of H. indicus decoction passed through the enterocyte monolayer.

In vivo, apoptotic endothelial cells release two types of extracellular vesicles upon caspase-3 activation: apoptotic bodies and exosome-like nanovesicles (ApoExos). Only ApoExos are immunogenic: their injection causes inflammation and autoimmunity in mice. Based on deep sequencing of total RNA, we report that apoptotic bodies and ApoExos are loaded with divergent RNA cargos that are not released by healthy endothelial cells. Apoptotic bodies, like endothelial cells, contain mainly ribosomal RNA whereas ApoExos essentially contain non-ribosomal non-coding RNAs. Endogenous retroelements, bearing viral-like features, represented half of total ApoExos RNA content. ApoExos also contained several copies of unedited Alu repeats and large amounts of non-coding RNAs with a demonstrated role in autoimmunity such as U1 RNA and Y RNA. Moreover, ApoExos RNAs had a unique nucleotide composition and secondary structure characterized by strong enrichment in U-rich motifs and unstably folded RNAs. Globally, ApoExos were therefore loaded with RNAs that can stimulate a variety of RIG-I-like receptors and endosomal TLRs. Hence, apoptotic endothelial cells selectively sort in ApoExos a diversified repertoire of immunostimulatory ""self RNAs"" that are tailor-made for initiation of innate immune responses and autoimmunity.",Cryo-Electron Tomography and Proteomics studies of centrosomes from differentiated quiescent thymocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076588,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"We have used cryo Electron Tomography, proteomics and immunolabeling to study centrosomes isolated from the young lamb thymus, an efficient source of quiescent differentiated cells.

The data obtained enhances our understanding of the protein system joining the centrioles, a system comprised of a branched network of fibers linked to an apparently amorphous density that was partially characterized here. A number of proteins were localized to the amorphous density by immunolabeling (C-NAP1, cohesin SMC1, condensin SMC4 and NCAPD2), yet not DNA.

The clinical heterogeneity of CVID has hindered identification of an underlying immune defect; diagnosis relies on clinical judgement, alongside evidence-based criteria. The lack of pathognomonic clinical or laboratory features leads to average diagnostic delays of 5 years or more from the onset. Vibrational spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy have recently gained increasing clinical importance, being rapid-, non-invasive and inexpensive methods to obtain information on the content of biological samples. This has led us to apply FTIR spectroscopy to the investigation of blood samples from a cohort of CVID patients; revealing spectral features capable of stratifying CVID patients from healthy controls with sensitivities and specificities of 97% and 93%, respectively for serum, and 94% and 95%, respectively for plasma. Furthermore we identified several discriminating spectral biomarkers; wavenumbers in regions indicative of nucleic acids (984 cm-1, 1053 cm-1, 1084 cm-1, 1115 cm-1, 1528 cm-1, 1639 cm-1), and a collagen-associated biomarker (1528 cm-1), which may represent future candidate biomarkers and provide new knowledge on the aetiology of CVID. This proof-of-concept study provides a basis for developing a novel diagnostic tool for CVID.","Mating structure of the blue and red shrimp, Aristeus antennatus (Risso, 1816) characterized by relatedness analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076585,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Understanding life history variation and strategies is crucial for stock assessment and fisheries management due to the direct effects on population dynamics, effective population size, sex-ratios, levels of inbreeding, and relatedness among individuals. Aristeus antennatus (En ─ Blue and red shrimp; Fr ─ Crevette rouge; Sp ─ Gamba rosada) is one of the most exploited demersal resources in the Western Mediterranean Sea. However, information regarding the mating system and mate choice preferences remains largely unknown. Advances in molecular genetic markers and methods of inferring biological relationships among individuals have facilitated new insights into the reproductive dynamics of the species in the wild. Here, we used microsatellite markers to examine the A. antennatus mating system and putative mate choice preferences. Our results provided clear evidence of polyandry and polygyny. Relatedness analyses, together with FST and DAPC values showed females exhibited a mating bias towards unrelated males. Mating males were inferred from spermatophores and suggested males were sympatric with females and were also from other spawning grounds. Our findings provided the first description of the reproductive behavior of blue and red shrimp.",Combining patch-clamping and fluorescence microscopy for quantitative reconstitution of cellular membrane processes with Giant Suspended Bilayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076583,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"In vitro reconstitution and microscopic visualization of membrane processes is an indispensable source of information about a cellular function.

The Giant Suspended Bilayers (GSBs) spontaneously swell from lipid lamella reservoir deposited on microspheres. GSBs attached to the reservoir can be prepared from virtually any lipid composition following a fast procedure. Giant unilamellar vesicles can be further obtained by GSB detachment from the microspheres. The reservoir stabilizes GSB during deformations, mechanical micromanipulations, and fluorescence microscopy observations, while GSB-reservoir boundary enables the exchange of small solutes with GSB interior. These unique properties allow studying macro- and nano-scale membrane deformations, adding membrane-active compounds to both sides of GSB membrane and applying patch-clamp based approaches, thus making GSB a versatile tool for reconstitution and quantification of cellular membrane trafficking events.",Functional duplication of Rap1 in methylotrophic yeasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076582,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"The telomere regulator and transcription factor Rap1 is the only telomere protein conserved in yeasts and mammals.

In the methylotrophic thermotolerant species Hansenula polymorpha DL-1 the RAP1 gene is duplicated (HpRAP1A and HpRAP1B). Here, we report the functional characterization of the two paralogues from H. polymorpha DL-1. We uncover distinct (but overlapping) DNA binding preferences of HpRap1A and HpRap1B proteins. We show that only HpRap1B is able to recognize telomeric DNA directly and to protect it from excessive recombination, whereas HpRap1A is associated with subtelomere regions. Furthermore, we identify specific binding sites for both HpRap1A and HpRap1B within promoters of a large number of ribosomal protein genes (RPGs), implicating Rap1 in the control of the RP regulon in H. polymorpha. Our bioinformatic analysis suggests that RAP1 was duplicated early in the evolution of the ""methylotrophs"" clade, and the two genes evolved independently. Therefore, our characterization of Rap1 paralogues in H. polymorpha may be relevant to other ""methylotrophs"", yielding valuable insights into the evolution of budding yeasts.",Self-organisation in striped seagrass meadows affects the distributional pattern of the sessile bivalve Pinna nobilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076581,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Striped seagrass meadows are formed by narrow ribbons which are elevated over the seabed and separated by channels. Limited information on the genesis and development of this morphological pattern, including the adaptive responses of associated biota, is preventing holistic insight into the functioning of such protected ecosystems. This paper assessed the structural dynamics of a Posidonia oceanica striped meadow and the distribution and 3D orientation of the associated bivalve Pinna nobilis. Our analysis of the interaction between bedforms, bottom currents, and the distribution of P. nobilis revealed that the striped seascape is the result of a self-organisation process driven by feedback interactions among seagrass growth, sediment deposition, and hydrodynamics. The results suggest that the ribbon wall is the most suitable sub-habitat for this species, because it supports the highest density of P. nobilis, compared to the meadow top and bottom. Here, specimens can take advantage of the resuspension induced by hydrodynamics and open their shells towards the current, thus enhancing food intake. Therefore, our results show that self-organisation in striped seagrass meadow affects the distributional pattern of P. nobilis, providing new insights into the autoecology of this species beyond the conservation implications for its habitat.",Melanoma proteomics suggests functional differences related to mutational status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076580,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Melanoma is the most lethal cutaneous cancer. New drugs have recently appeared; however, not all patients obtain a benefit of these new drugs. For this reason, it is still necessary to characterize melanoma at molecular level. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular differences between melanoma tumor subtypes, based on BRAF and NRAS mutational status. Fourteen formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded melanoma samples were analyzed using a high-throughput proteomics approach, combined with probabilistic graphical models and Flux Balance Analysis, to characterize these differences. Proteomics analyses showed differences in expression of proteins related with fatty acid metabolism, melanogenesis and extracellular space between BRAF mutated and BRAF non-mutated melanoma tumors. Additionally, probabilistic graphical models showed differences between melanoma subgroups at biological processes such as melanogenesis or metabolism. On the other hand, Flux Balance Analysis predicts a higher tumor growth rate in BRAF mutated melanoma samples. In conclusion, differential biological processes between melanomas showing a specific mutational status can be detected using combined proteomics and computational approaches.","Magnitude and reasons for pre-diagnosis attrition among presumptive multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients in Bago Region, Myanmar: A mixed methods study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076579,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"In Myanmar, Rifampicin resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB, a proxy for Multi-drug resistant TB) case detection is very low. Our study objectives were to assess the proportion of eligible TB patients who had not undergone RR-TB testing (Xpert-MTB/Rif tests) in Bago Region, Myanmar and to understand the reasons and solutions for non-testing. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving analysis of routinely collected programme data followed by key informant interviews (KIIs) with 32 health care providers. From October 2016 to March 2017, of the 2,331 eligible patients, 1,066 (46%) had not undergone Xpert-MTB/Rif testing. Patients from townships without Xpert-MTB/Rif testing facilities, new TB patients, patients whose HIV status was negative or unknown and extra pulmonary TB patients were less likely to undergo Xpert-MTB/Rif testing. From the health care providers' perspective, the most common reasons for non-testing were: (a) lack of awareness of the eligibility criteria; (b) difficulties in collecting sputum and transportation from eligible patients to the testing sites. We conclude that nearly half of eligible patients were not tested for RR-TB. Training of health care providers about the latest eligibility criteria and improvement in sputum collection and transportation systems particularly for townships without Xpert-MTB/Rif testing facilities are required to improve RR-TB testing."

Here, we report that hypoxia disassembles 14-3-3ζ from YAP and thereby promotes YAP nuclear localization mediated by ERK2, which directly binds to the D-site of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) docking domain in 14-3-3ζ Leu98/100 and phosphorylates 14-3-3ζ at Ser37. When localizing in nucleus, YAP recruits at pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) gene promoter with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), for which PKM2 transcription is required. 14-3-3ζ Ser37 phosphorylation is instrumental for the hypoxia-induced glucose uptake, lactate production, and clonogenicity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, as well as tumorigenesis in mice. The 14-3-3ζ Ser37 phosphorylation positively correlates with p-ERK1/2 activity and HIF-1α expression in clinical samples from patients with PDAC and predicts unfavorable prognosis. Our findings underscore an appreciable linkage between YAP transcriptional activation and hypoxic glycolysis governed by ERK2-dependent 14-3-3ζ Ser37 phosphorylation for malignant progression of PDAC.",A functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies kinases that modulate FGFR inhibitor response in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076567,Oncogenesis,2019 05 11,"Some gastric cancers have FGFR2 amplifications, making them sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. However, cancer cells inevitably develop resistance despite initial response. The underlying resistance mechanism to FGFR inhibition is unclear. In this study, we applied a kinome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to systematically identify kinases that are determinants of sensitivity to a potent FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 in KatoIII cells, a gastric cancer cell line with FGFR2 amplification. In total, we identified 20 kinases, involved in ILK, SRC, and EGFR signaling pathways, as determinants that alter cell sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. We functionally validated the top negatively selected and positively selected kinases, ILK and CSK, from the CRISPR/Cas9 screen using RNA interference. We observed synergistic effects on KatoIII cells as well as three additional gastric cancer cell lines with FGFR2 amplification when AZD4547 was combined with small molecular inhibitors Cpd22 and lapatinib targeting ILK and EGFR/HER2, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSK3b is one of the downstream effectors of ILK upon FGFR inhibition. In summary, our study systematically evaluated the kinases and associated signaling pathways modulating cell response to FGFR inhibition, and for the first time, demonstrated that targeting ILK would enhance the effectiveness of AZD4547 treatment of gastric tumors with amplifications of FGFR2.","Alginate oligosaccharide attenuates α2,6-sialylation modification to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth via the Hippo/YAP pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076566,Cell death & disease,2019 05 14,"Chitosan oligosaccharides have been reported to inhibit various tumors. However, the water-soluble marine plant oligosaccharide alginate oligosaccharide (AOS) has only rarely been reported to have anti-cancer effects. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of AOS on prostate cancer and the underlying molecular mechanism remain unknown. This study shows that AOS inhibited cell growth, which was consistent with the attenuation of α2,6-sialylation modification. Furthermore, AOS inhibited ST6Gal-1 promoter activity and thus affected transcriptional processes. In addition, AOS could activate the Hippo/YAP pathway and block the recruitment of both the coactivator YAP and c-Jun. Furthermore, YAP interacted with the transcription factor c-Jun and regulated the transcriptional activity of the downstream target ST6Gal-1 gene. Consistent with in vitro data, AOS suppressed the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells via the Hippo/YAP pathway in vivo. In summary, these data indicate that AOS slows the proliferation of prostate cancer and provides a basis for the healthy function of kelp in traditional cognition.",Evaluation of Reliability and Validity of Chinese-Version Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076565,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 10,"BACKGROUND Borderline Personality Features Scale for Children (BPFS-C) has been widely applied to evaluate the children's borderline personality features worldwide, whereas it is rarely utilized in China. This study was designed to assess the feasibility, reliability, and validity of the Chinese-version BPFS-C in a multi-school-based sample of Chinese children and adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 964 students were recruited from 3 senior high schools, 1 junior middle school, and 1 elementary school in Shenyang, Capital city of Liaoning Province, China. We used the Chinese-version BPFS-C, Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder (MSI-BPD), University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, 12-item Aggression Questionnaire (AQ-12), the subscales of obsessive-compulsive symptom and interpersonal sensitivity of Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90), and Basic Empathy Scale (BES). RESULTS Sixty-eight students were re-tested 3 weeks after the initial test. Internal consistency and reliability of the Chinese-version BPFS-C was calculated as 0.853, and the reliability of re-test was 0.824. The BPFS-C score was moderately correlated with the scores of CDI, MSI-BPD, UCLA, AQ-12, and SCL-90, with a correlation coefficient of 0.590-0.676. The mean BPFS-C score in boys (55.857±12.620) was significantly lower than that (59.460±13.866) in girls (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS BPFS-C is a reliable and effective scale, which can be used for evaluating borderline personality features in children and adolescents in China.",Spontaneous Hemothorax in a Patient with von Recklinghausen's Disease: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076564,The American journal of case reports,2019 06 16,"BACKGROUND Von Recklinghausen's disease, also known as Type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF1), is a genetic disorder characterized by skin tumors, neurofibromas of multiple organs and vascular abnormalities. Spontaneous thoracic hemorrhage is a rare but potentially fatal consequence of this disorder. After a review of the literature over the last 10 years and on the basis of a case study, the aim of this study was to report the challenges of management of this pathology. CASE REPORT We report a rare case of a 45-years-old male with a medical history of neurofibromatosis who complained of a 3-day history of progressive dyspnea. At his admission to the Emergency Department, the patient was hemodynamically stable. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large left hemothorax with mediastinal shift to the right without active bleeding. A chest tube was introduced, and conservative treatment was followed. Another CT scan performed 2 days later revealed a middle lobar pulmonary embolism on the opposite side. A full treatment of anticoagulation was administered, and the patient was released after 8 days of hospitalization. Three weeks later, a new chest CT scan indicated the absence of vascular aneurysm or source for hemothorax. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic literature review found 15 articles which were described as early as 2005. To our knowledge, endovascular treatment produces the best immediate successful result (100%) and may be used in adjunction with video-assisted thorax surgery (VATS) or thoracic drainage to optimize outcomes. In the present case, conservative treatment showed a good result despite anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism. The endovascular approach seems to be the most promising, but treatment needs to be tailored to each individual patient.",Modulation of Coenzyme Q10 content and oxidative status in human dermal fibroblasts using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor over a broad range of concentrations. From mitohormesis to mitochondrial dysfunction and accelerated aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076563,Aging,2019 06 10,"Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenous lipophilic quinone, ubiquitous in biological membranes and endowed with antioxidant and bioenergetic properties, both crucial to the aging process. In fact, coenzyme Q10 synthesis is known to decrease with age in different tissues including skin. Moreover, synthesis can be inhibited by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors such as statins, that are widely used hypocholesterolemic drugs. They target a key enzymatic step along the mevalonate pathway, involved in the synthesis of both cholesterol and isoprenylated compounds including CoQ10.In the present study, we show that pharmacological CoQ10 deprivation at concentrations of statins > 10000 nM triggers intracellular oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and generates cell death in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). On the contrary, at lower statin concentrations, cells and mainly mitochondria, are able to partially adapt and prevent oxidative imbalance and overt mitochondrial toxicity. Importantly, our data demonstrate that CoQ10 decrease promotes mitochondrial permeability transition and bioenergetic dysfunction leading to premature aging of human dermal fibroblasts in vitro.",Phloretin protects against cardiac damage and remodeling via restoring SIRT1 and anti-inflammatory effects in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076562,Aging,2019 06 10,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy increases the risk of heart failure independent of coronary artery disease and hypertension. Phloretin (PHL) shows anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages. In this study, we explored the protective effects of PHL on high glucose (HG)-induced injury in diabetic cardiomyopathy in vivo and in vitro. Using streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model and incubating cardiac cells line under a HG environment, PHL were evaluated of the activities of anti-inflammation and anti-fibrosis. In the study, PHL treatment ameliorated cardiomyocyte inflammation injury, and reduced fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. PHL also improved cardiac biochemical criterions after 8 weeks of induction of diabetes in C57BL/6 mice. Molecular docking results indicated that silent information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) bound to PHL directly and that SIRT1 expression was upregulated in the PHL-treated group in HG-induced H9C2 cells. Protective effect of PHL was been eliminated in silence SIRT1 H9C2 cells. Taken together, these results suggested that PHL suppressed HG-induced cardiomyocyte injury via restoring SIRT1 expression.",Metformin induces a fasting- and antifolate-mimicking modification of systemic host metabolism in breast cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076561,Aging,2019 06 10,"Certain dietary interventions might improve the therapeutic index of cancer treatments. An alternative to the ""drug plus diet"" approach is the pharmacological reproduction of the metabolic traits of such diets. Here we explored the impact of adding metformin to an established therapeutic regimen on the systemic host metabolism of cancer patients. A panel of 11 serum metabolites including markers of mitochondrial function and intermediates/products of folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism were measured in paired baseline and post-treatment sera obtained from HER2-positive breast cancer patients randomized to receive either metformin combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab or an equivalent regimen without metformin. Metabolite profiles revealed a significant increase of the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate and of the TCA intermediate α-ketoglutarate in the metformin-containing arm. A significant relationship was found between the follow-up levels of homocysteine and the ability of treatment arms to achieve a pathological complete response (pCR). In the metformin-containing arm, patients with significant elevations of homocysteine tended to have a higher probability of pCR. The addition of metformin to an established anti-cancer therapeutic regimen causes a fasting-mimicking modification of systemic host metabolism. Circulating homocysteine could be explored as a clinical pharmacodynamic biomarker linking the antifolate-like activity of metformin and biological tumor response.",Laminin α4 overexpression in the anterior lens capsule may contribute to the senescence of human lens epithelial cells in age-related cataract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076560,Aging,2019 06 10,"Senescence is a leading cause of age-related cataract (ARC). The current study indicated that the senescence-associated protein, p53, total laminin (LM), LMα4, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) in the cataractous anterior lens capsules (ALCs) increase with the grades of ARC. In cataractous ALCs, patient age, total LM, LMα4, TGF-β1, were all positively correlated with p53. In lens epithelial cell (HLE B-3) senescence models, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) alleviated senescence by decreasing the expression of total LM and LMα4; TGF-β1 induced senescence by increasing the expression of total LM and LMα4. Furthermore, MMP-9 silencing increased p-p38 and LMα4 expression; anti-LMα4 globular domain antibody alleviated senescence by decreasing the expression of p-p38 and LMα4; pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK signaling alleviated senescence by decreasing the expression of LMα4. Finally, in cataractous ALCs, positive correlations were found between LMα4 and total LM, as well as between LMα4 and TGF-β1. Taken together, our results implied that the elevated LMα4, which was possibly caused by the decreased MMP-9, increased TGF-β1 and activated p38 MAPK signaling during senescence, leading to the development of ARC. LMα4 and its regulatory factors show potential as targets for drug development for prevention and treatment of ARC.",Magnesium transporter protein solute carrier family 41 member 1 suppresses human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through magnesium-dependent Akt/mTOR inhibition and bax-associated mitochondrial apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076559,Aging,2019 06 10,"The aim of this study was to identify the function of the Mg2+ transporter protein solute carrier family 41 member 1 SLC41A1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and the underlying mechanisms. A total of 27 solute carrier proteins were differentially expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Three of these proteins were correlated with clinical outcomes in patients, among which SLC41A1 was downregulated in tumour. Overexpression of SLC41A1 suppressed orthotopic tumour growth in a mouse model and reduced the cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasiveness of KP3 and Panc-1 cells, which may have been associated with the increased population of apoptotic-prone cells. Overexpression of SLC41A1 reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, induced Bax while suppressed Bcl-2 expression. Suppression of Bax abrogated the tumour-suppressive effects of SLC41A1. Furthermore, overexpression of SLC41A1 promoted Mg2+ efflux and suppressed Akt/mTOR activity, which is the upstream regulator of Bax and Bcl-2. An increase in Akt activity and supplementation with Mg2+ abolished SLC41A1-induced tumour suppression. The results of this study suggest that SLC41A1 may be a potential target for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."

Trastuzumab emtansine as additional adjuvant therapy improves recurrence-free survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer without pCR, but it is uncertain whether all patients without pCR need additional therapy. We evaluated the prognostic value of residual disease after trastuzumab-based NST in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer using Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), Neoadjuvant Response Index (NRI), and Neo-Bioscore.Experimental Design: We included patients with stage II or III HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab-based NST and surgery at The Netherlands Cancer Institute between 2004 and 2016. RCB, NRI, and Neo-Bioscore were determined. Primary endpoint was 5-year recurrence-free interval (RFI). A 3% difference compared with the pCR group was considered acceptable as noninferiority margin on the 5-year RFI estimate, based on a proportional hazards model, and its lower 95% confidence boundary.Results: A total of 283 women were included. Median follow-up was 67 months (interquartile range 44-100). A total of 157 patients (56%) with pCR (breast and axilla) had a 5-year RFI of 92% (95% CI, 88-97); patients without pCR had a 5-year RFI of 80% (95% CI, 72-88). Patients with an RCB = 1 (N = 40, 15%), an NRI score between 0.75 and 0.99 (N = 30, 11%), or a Neo-Bioscore of 0 to 1 (without pCR; N = 28, 11%) have a 5-year RFI that falls within a predefined noninferiority margin of 3% compared with patients with pCR.Conclusions: The RCB, NRI, and Neo-Bioscore can identify patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with minimal residual disease (i.e., RCB = 1, NRI ≥ 0.75, or Neo-Bioscore = 0-1) after NST who have similar 5-year RFI compared with patients with pCR.",FEZF1-AS1 functions as an oncogenic lncRNA in retinoblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076545,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) FEZF1 antisense RNA 1 (FEZF1-AS1) has been shown to be up-regulated in tumor tissues and cells, and exerts oncogenic effects on various types of malignancies. However, the expression and function of FEZF1-AS1 was still fully unclear in retinoblastoma. The purpose of our study was to investigate the expression and clinical value of FEZF1-AS1 in retinoblastoma patients, and explore the effect of FEZF1-AS1 on retinoblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In our results, levels of FEZF1-AS1 expression were elevated in retinoblastoma tissue specimens and cell lines compared with adjacent normal retina tissue specimens and human retinal pigment epithelial cell line, respectively. The correlation analysis indicated that high FEZF1-AS1 expression was significantly correlated with present choroidal invasion and optic nerve invasion. Survival analysis suggested that retinoblastoma patients in high FEZF1-AS1 expression group had obviously short disease-free survival (DFS) compared with retinoblastoma patients in low FEZF1-AS1 expression group, and high FEZF1-AS1 expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for DFS in retinoblastoma patients. Loss-of-function study indicated silencing FEZF1-AS1 expression inhibited retinoblastoma cell proliferation, invasion and migration. In conclusion, FEZF1-AS1 functions as an oncogenic lncRNA in retinoblastoma.",Up-regulated circular RNA VANGL1 contributes to progression of non-small cell lung cancer through inhibition of miR-195 and activation of Bcl-2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076544,Bioscience reports,2019 06 05,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a group of non-coding RNAs, play an important role in cancer biology, and in the present study, we aimed to clarify the expression profiles and biological functions of circRNA circVANGL1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results showed that circVANGL1 was overexpressed in human NSCLC tissues and cell lines. circVANGL1 expression was closely associated with tumor size, TNM stage and overall survival of NSCLC patients. Further loss-of-function analysis revealed that knockdown of circVANGL1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in NSCLC cell lines. The migration and invasion of NSCLC cells were also suppressed by circVANGL1 knockdown. In addition, we predicted that circVANGL1 might serve as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), becoming a sink for miR-195, thereby modulating the expression of Bcl-2 in NSCLC cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-195 inhibitor abrogated the beneficial role of circVANGL1 knockdown in NSCLC cells. Taken together, we conclude that circVANGL1 functions as an oncogene to promote NSCLC progression partly through miR-195/Bcl-2 axis, which might be a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.",Evaluation of myocardial injury induced by different ablation approaches (radiofrequency ablation versus cryoablation) in atrial flutter patients: a meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076543,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"Background: To evaluate myocardial injury in Atrial flutter (AFL) patients undergoing Radiofrequency ablation (RF) and cryoablation (CRYO) treatments.Methods: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases. All relevant clinical trials (up to October 2018) on myocardial injury in AFL patients were retrieved and subsequent results analyzed with a random-effects model or a fixed-effects model.Results: A total of eight clinical trials with a sample size of 644 patients, were identified and incorporated in the present study. The results indicated no significant differences in creatine kinase (CK) levels (mean difference (MD) = 62.74, P=0.46; 4-6 h and MD = 30.73, P=0.49; 12-24 h after ablation), creatine kinase MB(CK-MB) levels (MD = 17.32, P=0.25; 12-24 h post-ablation), troponinI (TnI) levels (MD = 0.12, P=0.08; 6 h after ablation), and troponin T (TnT) levels (MD = 0.30, P=0.08; 4-6 h post-ablation) between the two treatment approaches. However, patients receiving CRYO xhibited higher levels of CK (MD = 179.54, P=0.04; tested immediately after the procedure), CK-MB (MD = 10.08, P=0.004) 4-6 h after ablation, and TnT (MD = 0.19, P=0.002) tested the next morning. Moreover, those patients had a significantly reduced pain perception (odds ratio (OR) = 0.05, P=0.04) compared with those in the RF group.Conclusion: These results indicate that CRYO in comparison with RF significantly increases myocardial injury in AFL patients. Additionally, it decreases pain perception during the procedure. Further large-sampled studies are needed to support these findings.","Injury Incidence in Youth, High School, and NCAA Men's Lacrosse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076542,Pediatrics,2019 06 04,"We compared injury incidence and mechanisms among youth, high school (HS), and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) boys' and men's lacrosse athletes for the 2014-2015 to 2016-2017 lacrosse seasons.",Physicians' Attitudes on Resuscitation of Extremely Premature Infants: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076541,Pediatrics,2019 06 04,"Whether to resuscitate extremely premature infants (EPIs) is a clinically and ethically difficult decision to make.

Perception of the generalist insect, Spodoptera litura, by Arabidopsis thaliana activates cytosolic Ca2+ elevation, which triggers downstream defense. However, not all the Ca2+ channels generating the signal have been identified, nor are their modes of action known. We report on a rapidly activated, leaf vasculature- and plasma membrane-localized, CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE GATED CHANNEL19 (CNGC19), which activates herbivory-induced Ca2+ flux and plant defense. Loss of CNGC19 function results in decreased herbivory defense. The cngc19 mutant shows aberrant and attenuated intra-vascular Ca2+ fluxes. CNGC19 is a Ca2+ permeable channel, as hyperpolarization of CNGC19-expressing Xenopus oocytes in the presence of both cAMP and Ca2+ results in Ca2+ influx. Breakdown of Ca2+-based defence in cngc19 mutants leads to a decrease in herbivory-induced JA-Ile biosynthesis and expression of JA responsive genes. cngc19 mutants are deficient in aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation and hyperaccumulate its precursor, methionine. CNGC19 modulates aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in tandem with BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID TRANSAMINASE4 (BCAT4), which is involved in the chain elongation pathway of Met-derived glucosinolates. Furthermore, CNGC19 interacts with herbivory-induced CALMODULIN2 (CaM2) in planta. Together, our work reveals a key mechanistic role for the Ca2+ channel CNGC19 in the recognition of herbivory and the activation of defense signaling.",Multiple gibberellin receptors contribute to phenotypic stability under changing environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076539,The Plant cell,2019 05 11,"The pleiotropic and complex gibberellin (GA) response relies on targeted proteolysis of DELLA proteins mediated by a GA-activated GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome encodes for a single DELLA protein, PROCERA (PRO), and three receptors, SlGID1a (GID1a), GID1b1 and GID1b2, that may guide specific GA responses. In this work, CRISPR-Cas9-derived gid1 mutants were generated and their effect on GA responses was studied. The gid1 triple mutant was extremely dwarf and fully insensitive to GA. Under optimal growth conditions, the three receptors function redundantly and the single gid1 mutants exhibited very mild phenotypic changes. Among the three receptors, GID1a had the strongest effects on germination and growth. Yeast two-hybrid assays suggested that GID1a has the highest affinity to PRO. Analysis of lines with a single active receptor demonstrated a unique role for GID1a in protracted response to GA that was saturated only at high doses. When the gid1 mutants were grown in the field under ambient changing environments, they showed phenotypic instability, the high redundancy was lost and gid1a exhibited dwarfism that was strongly exacerbated by the loss of another GID1b receptor gene. These results suggest that multiple GA receptors contribute to phenotypic stability under environmental extremes.",Abnormal thalamocortical network dynamics in migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076535,Neurology,2019 06 04,To investigate the dynamic functional connectivity of thalamocortical networks in interictal migraine patients and whether clinical features are associated with abnormal connectivity.,Imaging necrosis during treatment is associated with worse survival in EORTC 26101 study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076534,Neurology,2019 06 11,Imaging necrosis on MRI scans was assessed and compared to outcome measures of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 26101 phase III trial that compared single-agent lomustine with lomustine plus bevacizumab in patients with progressive glioblastoma.

The study aimed to quantify the usage of systemic glucocorticoids (SGC) in dogs in the UK using primary care treatment records recorded during 2013 in the VetCompass Programme. From a study population of 455 557 dogs, 28 472 dogs (6.2 per cent, 95 per cent CI 6.2 to 6.3) received a total of 50 971 SGC therapy events in 2013. Prednisolone represented the most frequently used oral preparation (27 362 events, 90.0 per cent of oral events). Dexamethasone sodium phosphate was the most commonly used injectable agent (12 796 events, 62.7 per cent of injectable events). The most common breed treated was Staffordshire Bull Terriers (2236/28 472 dogs, 7.9 per cent, 95 per cent CI 7.5 to 8.2) and within-breed prevalence of SGC usage was 2236/32 635, 6.9 per cent, 95 per cent CI 6.6 to 7.1. The most commonly treated age group was dogs older than eight years (8931/28472, 31.4 per cent) and the most commonly treated bodyweight group was 10.01-20.0 kg (7918/28 472, 27.8 per cent). Dexamethasone and prednisolone were the most commonly prescribed SGC. Short-acting and intermediate-acting injectable SGC were more commonly used compared with long-acting injectable SGC. Older and medium size dogs were most likely to receive SGC and certain breeds appeared predisposed. These data can provide a useful benchmark for glucocorticoid usage and highlight the benefits from 'Big Data' analyses.",Evaluation of urinary γ-glutamyl transferase and serum creatinine in non-azotaemic hospitalised dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076519,The Veterinary record,2019 05 11,"Urinary and blood biomarkers for diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalised dogs were evalueted.

Furthermore, we find that MACET4 forms oligomers that induce aster formation in vitro in a manner that is similar to aster formation mediated by centrosomes and TPX2. MACET4 is expressed during cell division and accumulates at the microtubule nucleation regions of the plant-specific cytokinetic microtubule array, the phragmoplast. We found that MACET4 localizes to the preprophase band and the cortical division zone, but not the spindle. MACET4 appears as cytoplasmic foci in vivo and forms octamers in vitro Transient expression in tobacco leaf pavement cells results in labeling of shrinking plus- and minus-ends. MACET4 facilitates microtubule depolymerization by increasing the frequency of catastrophes in vivo and by suppressing rescues in vitro Microtubules formed in the presence of MACET4 in vitro are shorter, most likely due to the depletion of the free tubulin pool. Accordingly, MACET4 knockdown results in longer phragmoplasts. We conclude that the direct activity of MACET4 is in promoting microtubule nucleation.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",Shear stress-induced nuclear shrinkage through activation of Piezo1 channels in epithelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076516,Journal of cell science,2019 06 13,"The cell nucleus responds to mechanical cues with changes in size, morphology and motility. Previous work has shown that external forces couple to nuclei through the cytoskeleton network, but we show here that changes in nuclear shape can be driven solely by calcium levels. Fluid shear stress applied to MDCK cells caused the nuclei to shrink through a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway. Inhibiting mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels through treatment with GsMTx4 prevented nuclear shrinkage. Piezo1 knockdown also significantly reduced the nuclear shrinkage. Activation of Piezo1 with the agonist Yoda1 caused similar nucleus shrinkage in cells not exposed to shear stress. These results demonstrate that the Piezo1 channel is a key element for transmitting shear force input to nuclei. To ascertain the relative contribution of Ca2+ to cytoskeleton perturbation, we examined F-actin reorganization under shear stress and static conditions, and showed that reorganization of the cytoskeleton is not necessary for nuclear shrinkage. These results emphasize the role of the mechanosensitive channels as primary transducers in force transmission to the nucleus.",GGA2 and RAB13 promote activity-dependent β1-integrin recycling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076515,Journal of cell science,2019 06 08,"β1-integrins mediate cell-matrix interactions and their trafficking is important in the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion, migration and malignant processes, including cancer cell invasion. Here, we employ an RNAi screen to characterize regulators of integrin traffic and identify the association of Golgi-localized gamma ear-containing Arf-binding protein 2 (GGA2) with β1-integrin, and its role in recycling of active but not inactive β1-integrin receptors. Silencing of GGA2 limits active β1-integrin levels in focal adhesions and decreases cancer cell migration and invasion, which is in agreement with its ability to regulate the dynamics of active integrins. By using the proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) method, we identified two RAB family small GTPases, i.e. RAB13 and RAB10, as novel interactors of GGA2. Functionally, RAB13 silencing triggers the intracellular accumulation of active β1-integrin, and reduces integrin activity in focal adhesions and cell migration similarly to GGA2 depletion, indicating that both facilitate active β1-integrin recycling to the plasma membrane. Thus, GGA2 and RAB13 are important specificity determinants for integrin activity-dependent traffic.",The cancer-associated meprin β variant G32R provides an additional activation site and promotes cancer cell invasion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076514,Journal of cell science,2019 06 01,"The extracellular metalloprotease meprin β is expressed as a homodimer and is primarily membrane bound. Meprin β can be released from the cell surface by its known sheddases ADAM10 and ADAM17. Activation of pro-meprin β at the cell surface prevents its shedding, thereby stabilizing its proteolytic activity at the plasma membrane. We show that a single amino acid exchange variant (G32R) of meprin β, identified in endometrium cancer, is more active against a peptide substrate and the IL-6 receptor than wild-type meprin β. We demonstrate that the change to an arginine residue at position 32 represents an additional activation site used by furin-like proteases in the Golgi, which consequently leads to reduced shedding by ADAM17. We investigated this meprin β G32R variant to assess cell proliferation, invasion through a collagen IV matrix and outgrowth from tumor spheroids. We found that increased meprin β G32R activity at the cell surface reduces cell proliferation, but increases cell invasion.",DLC3 suppresses MT1-MMP-dependent matrix degradation by controlling RhoB and actin remodeling at endosomal membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076513,Journal of cell science,2019 06 06,"Cancer cells degrade the extracellular matrix through actin-rich protrusions termed invadopodia. The formation of functional invadopodia requires polarized membrane trafficking driven by Rho GTPase-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. We identify the Rho GTPase-activating protein deleted in liver cancer 3 (DLC3; also known as STARD8) as an integral component of the endosomal transport and sorting machinery. We provide evidence for the direct regulation of RhoB by DLC3 at endosomal membranes to which DLC3 is recruited by interacting with the sorting nexin SNX27. In TGF-β-treated MCF10A breast epithelial cells, DLC3 knockdown enhanced metalloproteinase-dependent matrix degradation, which was partially rescued by RhoB co-depletion. This was recapitulated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in which early endosomes demonstrated aberrantly enriched F-actin and accumulated the metalloproteinase MT1-MMP (also known as MMP14) upon DLC3 knockdown. Remarkably, Rab4 (herein referring to Rab4A) downregulation fully rescued the enhanced matrix degradation of TGF-β-treated MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 cells. In summary, our findings establish a novel role for DLC3 in the suppression of MT1-MMP-dependent matrix degradation by inactivating RhoB signaling at endosomal membranes. We propose that DLC3 function is required to limit endosomal actin polymerization, Rab4-dependent recycling of MT1-MMP and, consequently, matrix degradation mediated by invadopodial activity.",Peroxisomes control mitochondrial dynamics and the mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076512,Journal of cell science,2019 06 01,"Peroxisomes cooperate with mitochondria in the performance of cellular metabolic functions, such as fatty acid oxidation and the maintenance of redox homeostasis. However, whether peroxisomes also regulate mitochondrial fission-fusion dynamics or mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis remained unclear. We now show that genetic ablation of the peroxins Pex3 or Pex5, which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis, results in mitochondrial fragmentation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in a manner dependent on Drp1 (also known as DNM1L). Conversely, treatment with 4-PBA, which results in peroxisome proliferation, resulted in mitochondrial elongation in wild-type MEFs, but not in Pex3-knockout MEFs. We further found that peroxisome deficiency increased the levels of cytosolic cytochrome c and caspase activity under basal conditions without inducing apoptosis. It also greatly enhanced etoposide-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, which is indicative of an enhanced cellular sensitivity to death signals. Taken together, our data unveil a previously unrecognized role for peroxisomes in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. Effects of peroxin gene mutations on mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis may contribute to pathogenesis of peroxisome biogenesis disorders.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper."

Although silencing mutations and transcriptional repression of the E-cadherin gene have been widely studied, not much is known about post-translational regulation of E-cadherin in tumors. We show that E-cadherin is tightly co-expressed with the secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase isoform 2, SPCA2 (ATP2C2), in breast tumors. Loss of SPCA2 impairs surface expression of E-cadherin and elicits mesenchymal gene expression through disruption of cell adhesion in tumorspheres and downstream Hippo-YAP signaling. Conversely, ectopic expression of SPCA2 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) elevates baseline Ca2+ and YAP phosphorylation, enhances post-translational expression of E-cadherin, and suppresses mesenchymal gene expression. Thus, loss of SPCA2 phenocopies loss of E-cadherin in the Hippo signaling pathway and EMT-MET transitions, consistent with a functional role for SPCA2 in E-cadherin biogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SPCA2 suppresses invasive phenotypes, including cell migration in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo. Based on these findings, we propose that SPCA2 functions as a key regulator of EMT and may be a potential therapeutic target for treatment of metastatic cancer. Implications: Post-translational control of E-cadherin and the Hippo pathway by calcium signaling regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells.",Corynebacterium diphtheriae-infective endocarditis in a patient with an atrial septal defect closure device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076496,BMJ case reports,2019 05 11,"An 18-year-old woman presented to our institution with fever, bilateral flank pain, headache and photophobia.

Plant cells are at high turgor pressure and are surrounded by a rigid yet flexible cell wall, which is the primary determinant of plant growth and morphogenesis. Cellulose microfibrils, synthesized by plasma membrane-localized cellulose synthase complexes, are major tension-bearing components of the cell wall that mediate directional growth. Despite advances in understanding the genetic and biophysical regulation of morphogenesis, direct studies of cellulose biosynthesis and its impact on morphogenesis of different cell and tissue types are largely lacking. In this study, we took advantage of mutants of three primary cellulose synthase (CESA) genes that are involved in primary wall cellulose synthesis. Using field emission scanning electron microscopy, live cell imaging and biophysical measurements, we aimed to understand how the primary wall CESA complex acts during shoot apical meristem development.

We demonstrate that microRNA (miRNA) control of APETALA2 (AP2) is required for rapid, complete elongation of stem internodes in barley, especially of the final 'peduncle' internode directly underneath the inflorescence. Disrupted miR172 targeting of AP2 in the Zeo1.b barley mutant caused lower mitotic activity, delayed growth dynamics and premature lignification in the peduncle leading to fewer and shorter cells. Stage- and tissue-specific comparative transcriptomics between Zeo1.b and its parent cultivar showed reduced expression of proliferation-associated genes, ectopic expression of maturation-related genes and persistent, elevated expression of genes associated with jasmonate and stress responses. We further show that applying methyl jasmonate (MeJA) phenocopied the stem elongation of Zeo1.b, and that Zeo1.b itself was hypersensitive to inhibition by MeJA but less responsive to promotion by gibberellin. Taken together, we propose that miR172-mediated restriction of AP2 may modulate the jasmonate pathway to facilitate gibberellin-promoted stem growth during flowering.",Molecular signatures identify immature mesenchymal progenitors in early mouse limb buds that respond differentially to morphogen signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076486,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 12,"The key molecular interactions governing vertebrate limb bud development are a paradigm for studying the mechanisms controlling progenitor cell proliferation and specification during vertebrate organogenesis. However, little is known about the cellular heterogeneity of the mesenchymal progenitors in early limb buds that ultimately contribute to the chondrogenic condensations prefiguring the skeleton. We combined flow cytometric and transcriptome analyses to identify the molecular signatures of several distinct mesenchymal progenitor cell populations present in early mouse forelimb buds. In particular, jagged 1 (JAG1)-positive cells located in the posterior-distal mesenchyme were identified as the most immature limb bud mesenchymal progenitors (LMPs), which crucially depend on SHH and FGF signaling in culture. The analysis of gremlin 1 (Grem1)-deficient forelimb buds showed that JAG1-expressing LMPs are protected from apoptosis by GREM1-mediated BMP antagonism. At the same stage, the osteo-chondrogenic progenitors (OCPs) located in the core mesenchyme are already actively responding to BMP signaling. This analysis sheds light on the cellular heterogeneity of the early mouse limb bud mesenchyme and on the distinct response of LMPs and OCPs to morphogen signaling.",Rapid clearance of cellular debris by microglia limits secondary neuronal cell death after brain injury in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076485,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 13,"Moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes widespread neuronal cell death. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, react to injury by migrating to the lesion site, where they phagocytose cellular debris. Microglial phagocytosis can have both beneficial (e.g. debris clearance) and detrimental (e.g. respiratory burst, phagoptosis) consequences. Hence, whether the overall effect of microglial phagocytosis after brain injury in vivo is neuroprotective or neurotoxic is not known. Here, we establish a system with which to carry out dynamic real-time analyses of the mechanisms regulating cell death after brain injury in vivo We show that mechanical injury to the larval zebrafish brain induces distinct phases of primary and secondary cell death. Excitotoxicity contributes to secondary cell death in zebrafish, reflecting findings from mammals. Microglia arrive at the lesion site within minutes of injury, where they rapidly engulf dead cells. Importantly, the rate of secondary cell death is increased when the rapid removal of cellular debris by microglia is reduced pharmacologically or genetically. In summary, our results provide evidence that microglial debris clearance is neuroprotective after brain injury in vivo."

Sepsis is the leading cause of AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU) and accounts for nearly half of all AKI events. Patients with AKI who require dialysis have an unacceptably high mortality rate of 60%-80%. During sepsis, endothelial activation, increased microvascular permeability, changes in regional blood flow distribution with resulting areas of hypoperfusion, and hypoxemia can lead to AKI. No effective drugs to prevent or treat human sepsis-induced AKI are currently available. Recent research has identified dysfunction in energy metabolism as a critical contributor to the pathogenesis of AKI. Mitochondria, the center of energy metabolism, are increasingly recognized to be involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced AKI and mitochondria could serve as a potential therapeutic target. In this review, we summarize the potential role of mitochondria in sepsis-induced AKI and identify future therapeutic approaches that target mitochondrial function in an effort to treat sepsis-induced AKI.",Imminent death: clinician certainty and accuracy of prognostic predictions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076463,BMJ supportive & palliative care,2019 05 11,To determine the accuracy of predictions of dying at different cut-off thresholds and to acknowledge the extent of clinical uncertainty.

We have previously shown that CD8+ T cells in CLL exhibit impaired activation and reduced glucose uptake after stimulation. CD8+ T cells in CLL patients are chronically exposed to leukemic B cells, which potentially impacts metabolic homeostasis resulting in aberrant metabolic reprogramming upon stimulation. Here we report that resting CD8+ T cells in CLL have reduced intracellular GLUT1 reserves, and have an altered mitochondrial metabolic profile as displayed by increased mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and levels of reactive oxygen species. This coincided with decreased levels of PGC-1α, and in line with that, CLL-derived CD8+ T cells showed impaired mitochondrial biogenesis upon stimulation. In search of a therapeutic correlate of these findings, we analyzed mitochondrial biogenesis in CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) CD8+ T cells prior to infusion in CLL patients (enrolled in NCT01747486 and NCT01029366, https://clinicaltrials.gov). Interestingly, in cases with a subsequent complete response, the infused CD8+ CAR T cells had increased mitochondrial mass compared to non-responders, which positively correlated with the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells. Our findings demonstrate that GLUT1 reserves and mitochondrial fitness of CD8+ T cells are impaired in CLL. Therefore, boosting mitochondrial biogenesis in CAR T cells might improve the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy and other emerging cellular immunotherapies.

Specific therapies are unavailable. Pre-existing inflammation is a risk factor for TRALI and neutrophils (PMNs) are considered to be the major pathogenic cells. Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein expressed at sites of inflammation and, for example, is involved in pulmonary disorders, can regulate cellular migration and can function as a PMN-chemoattractant. We investigated whether OPN is involved in TRALI-induction by promoting PMN-recruitment to the lungs. Using a previously established murine TRALI model, we found that in contrast to wildtype (WT) mice, OPN knock-out (KO) mice were resistant to antibody-mediated PMN-dependent TRALI induction. Administration of purified OPN to the OPN KO mice, however, restored the TRALI response and pulmonary PMNaccumulation. Alternatively, blockade of OPN in WT mice using an anti-OPN antibody prevented the onset of TRALI induction. Using pulmonary immunohistochemistry, OPN could be specifically detected in the lungs of mice that suffered from TRALI. The OPNmediated TRALI response seemed dependent on macrophages, likely the cellular source of OPN, and OPN-polymerization and independent from the OPN-receptor CD44, IL-6 and other PMN-chemoattractants including macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2. These data indicate that OPN is critically required for induction of antibody-mediated murine TRALI through localization to the lungs and stimulation of pulmonary PMN-recruitment. This suggests that anti-OPN antibody-therapy may be a potential therapeutic strategy to explore in TRALI patients.",Patrolling monocytes scavenge endothelial adherent sickle RBC: a novel mechanism of inhibition of vaso-occlusion in SCD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076443,Blood,2019 05 15,"Painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most common complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). Increasing evidence suggests that vaso-occlusion is initiated by increased adherence of sickle red blood cells (RBC) to the vascular endothelium. Thus, the mechanisms that remove endothelial- attached sickle RBCs from the microvasculature are expected to be critical for optimal blood flow and prevention of VOC in SCD. We hypothesized that patrolling monocytes (PMo) which protect against vascular damage by scavenging cellular debris, could remove endothelial adherent sickle RBCs and ameliorate VOC in SCD. We detected RBC (GPA+ )-engulfed material in circulating PMos of patients with SCD and their frequency was further increased during acute crisis. RBC uptake by PMo was specific to endothelialattached sickle, but not control RBCs and occurred mostly through ICAM-1, CD11a and CD18. HO-1 induction, by counteracting the cytotoxic effects of engulfed RBC breakdown products, increased PMo viability. In addition, transfusions, by lowering sickle RBC uptake, improved PMo survival. Selective depletion of PMo in Townes sickle mice exacerbated vascular stasis and tissue damage, whereas treatment with muramyl dipeptide (NOD2 ligand), which increases PMo mass, reduced stasis and SCD associated organ damage. Altogether, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism for removal of endothelial attached sickle RBCs mediated by PMo that can protect against VOC pathogenesis, further supporting PMo as a promising therapeutic target in SCD VOC.",The enhancer RNA ARIEL activates the oncogenic transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076442,Blood,2019 05 11,"The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 regulates the transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). ARID5B is one of critical downstream targets of TAL1 which further activates the oncogenic regulatory circuit in T-ALL cells. Here, we elucidated the molecular functions of the non-coding RNA, ARID5B Inducing Enhancer Associated Long non-coding RNA (ARIEL), in T-ALL pathogenesis. We demonstrated that ARIEL is specifically activated in TAL1-positive T-ALL cases, and its expression is associated with ARID5B enhancer activity. ARIEL recruits mediator proteins to the ARID5B enhancer, promotes enhancer-promoter interactions, and activates the expression of ARID5B, thereby positively regulating the TAL1-induced transcriptional program and the MYC oncogene. The TAL1 complex coordinately regulates the expression of ARIEL. Knockdown of ARIEL inhibits cell growth and survival of T-ALL cells in culture and blocks disease progression in a murine xenograft model. Our results indicate that ARIEL plays an oncogenic role as an enhancer RNA in T-ALL.",Signaling mechanisms inducing hypo-responsiveness of phagocytes during systemic inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076441,Blood,2019 05 11,"The inflammatory responsiveness of phagocytes to exogenous and endogenous stimuli is tightly regulated. This regulation plays an important role in systemic inflammatory response syndromes (SIRS). In SIRS phagocytes initially develop a hyper-inflammatory response followed by a secondary state of hypo-responsiveness, a so called tolerance. This hypo-responsiveness can be induced by endotoxin stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) resulting in an ameliorated response after subsequent re-stimulation. This modification of inflammatory response patterns has been described as innate immune memory. Interestingly, tolerance can also be triggered by endogenous TLR4 ligands, such as alarmins MRP8 (myeloid-related protein) and MRP14, under sterile conditions. However, signaling pathways that trigger hypo-responsiveness of phagocytes in clinically relevant diseases are only barely understood. Through our work, we have now identified two main signaling cascades that are activated during MRP-induced tolerance of phagocytes. We demonstrate that the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β pathway interferes with NF-kB-driven gene expression and that inhibition of GSK-3β mimics tolerance in vivo Moreover, we identified interleukin-10 triggered activation of transcription factors STAT3 and BCL-3 as master regulators of MRP-induced tolerance. Accordingly, patients with dominant negative STAT3 mutations show no tolerance development. In a clinically relevant condition of systemic sterile stress, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, we confirmed the initial induction of MRP-expression and the tolerance induction of monocytes associated with nuclear translocation of STAT3 and BCL-3 as relevant mechanisms. Our data indicate that the use of pharmacological JAK-STAT inhibitors may be promising targets for future therapeutic approaches to prevent complications associated with secondary hypo-responsiveness during SIRS.",Motility-independent formation of antibiotic-tolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa aggregates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076438,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 05 11,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe chronic infections in immunocompromised individuals. This bacterium is highly adaptable to its environments which frequently select for traits that promote bacterial persistence. A clinically significant temporal adaptation is the formation of surface- or cell- adhered bacterial biofilms which are associated with increased resistance to immune and antibiotic clearance. Extensive research supports that bacterial flagellar motility promotes formation of such biofilms whereupon the bacteria subsequently become non-motile. However, recent evidence supports that antibiotic-tolerant non-attached bacterial aggregates, distinct from surface-adhered biofilms, can form and these have been reported in the context of lung infections, otitis media, non-healing wounds and soft tissue fillers. It is unclear whether the same bacterial traits are required for aggregate formation as for biofilm formation. In this report, using isogenic mutants, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa aggregates in liquid cultures are spontaneously formed independent of bacterial flagellar motility and independent of an exogenous scaffold. This contrasts with the role of the flagellum to initiate surface-adhered biofilms. Similar to surface attached biofilms, these aggregates exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance compared to planktonic cultures. These findings provide key insights into the requirements for aggregate formation that contrast with those for biofilm formation and that may have relevance for the persistence and dissemination of non-motile bacteria found within chronic clinical infections.IMPORTANCE: In this work, we have investigated the role of bacterial motility with regard to antibiotic-tolerant bacterial aggregate formation. Previous work has convincingly demonstrated that P. aeruginosa flagellar motility promotes the formation of surface-adhered biofilms in many systems, while, in contrast, aggregate formation was observed only by non-motile but not by motile P. aeruginosa in the presence of an exogenous scaffold. Here we identify that both wildtype P.aeruginosa and mutants that genetically lack motility spontaneously form antibiotic-tolerant aggregates in the absence of an exogenously-added scaffold. Additionally, we also demonstrate that wildtype and non-motile P. aeruginosa bacteria can co-aggregate, shedding light on potential physiological interactions and heterogeneity of aggregates.",Differences in viral disinfection mechanisms as revealed by quantitative transfection of Echovirus 11 genomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076437,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 05 11,"Virus inactivation mechanisms can be elucidated by methods which measure the loss of specific virus functionality (e.g., host attachment, genome internalization, genome replication). Genome functionality is frequently assessed by PCR-based methods, which are indirect and potentially inaccurate; genome damage that affects detection by high-fidelity PCR enzymes may not adversely affect the ability of actual cellular enzymes to produce functional virus. Therefore, we here develop a transfection-based assay to quantitatively determine viral genome functionality by inserting viral RNA into host cells directly to measure their ability to produce new functional viruses from damaged viral genomes. Echovirus 11 was treated with ozone, free chlorine (FC), UV254 or heat and reductions in genome functionality and infectivity were compared. Ozone reduced genome functionality proportionally to infectivity, indicating that genome damage is the main mechanism of virus inactivation. In contrast, FC caused little or no loss of genome functionality compared to infectivity, indicating a larger role for protein damage. For UV254, genome functionality loss accounted for approximately 60% of virus inactivation, with the remainder presumably due to protein damage. Heat treatment resulted in no reduction in genome functionality, in agreement with the understanding that heat inactivation results from capsid damage. Our results indicate that there is a fundamental difference between genome integrity reductions measured by PCR enzymes in previous studies and actual genome functionality (whether the genome can produce virus) post disinfection. Compared to PCR, quantitative transfection assays provide a more realistic picture of actual viral genome functionality and overall inactivation mechanisms during disinfection.ImportanceThis study provides a new tool for assessing virus inactivation mechanisms by directly measuring a viral genome's ability to produce new viruses after disinfection. In addition, we identify a potential pitfall of PCR for determining virus genome damage, which does not reflect whether a genome is truly functional. The results presented here using quantitative transfection corroborate previously suggested virus inactivation mechanisms for some virus inactivation methods (heat) while bringing additional insights for others (ozone, FC and UV254). The developed transfection method provides a more mechanistic approach for the assessment of actual virus inactivation by common water disinfectants.",Bacillus cereus cshA is expressed during the lag-phase and serves as a potential marker of early adaptation to low temperature and pH.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076436,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 05 11,"Bacterial adaptation is characterized by a lag-phase during which cells do not multiply and modify their physiology to cope with the constraints of their environment. Our aim was to determine a sequence of events during the lag-phase of growth at low temperature and pH for three Bacillus cereus strains. The onsets of expression of two genes, essential for stress adaptation (cshA coding for a RNA helicase) or involved in the transition between lag and exponential phase (abrB coding for a transition regulator), were determined using fluorescent transcriptional reporter systems. Regardless of the stressing conditions and the tested strains, cshA promoter was active very early, while the biomass increased and always before the first cell division. At 12°C and pH 7.0, onset of cshA promoter activity occurred between 3 h and 7 h, while bacterial counts started between 12 h and 13 h. At pH 5.0 and at 20°C or 30°C, onset of cshA promoter activity occurred before 1 h and earlier than at pH 7.0. In contrast, the onset of abrB promoter activity depended on the strain and stressing conditions. In the ATCC 14579 strain, onset of abrB promoter activity always started between 30 min and 3 h, before biomass increased and cell division occurred. For the other strains, it took place along with the first cell division at 12°C, but much later during growth in the other tested conditions.IMPORTANCEThe spore-forming bacterium B. cereus is a major cause of foodborne outbreaks in Europe. Some B. cereus strains can grow at low temperatures and low-pH in many processed foods. Modeling bacterial lag time is hampered by a lack of knowledge of the temporality of events occurring during this phase. In this context, the identification of lag-phase markers, not currently available, could be a real advance for a better prediction of lag time duration. Currently, no molecular markers of this phase are available. By determining that cshA was always expressed early during the lag-phase, we provided a molecular marker of the early adaptation process of B. cereus cells when exposed to low temperature and pH.",Complex microbial communities drive iron and sulfur cycling in Arctic fjord sediments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076435,Applied and environmental microbiology,2019 05 11,"Glacial retreat is changing biogeochemical cycling in the Arctic, where glacial runoff contributes iron for oceanic shelf primary production. In Svalbard fjords, we hypothesize that microbes catalyze intense iron and sulfur cycling in low organic matter sediments. This is because low organic matter limits sulfide generation, allowing iron mobility to the water column instead of precipitation as iron monosulfides. Here, we tested this with high-depth-resolution 16S rRNA gene libraries in the upper 20 cm at two sites in Van Keulenfjorden, Svalbard. At the site closer to the glaciers, iron-reducing Desulfuromonadales, iron-oxidizing Gallionella and Mariprofundus, and sulfur-oxidizing Thiotrichales and Epsilonproteobacteria were abundant above 12 cm depth. Below this depth, the relative abundances of sequences for sulfate-reducing Desulfobacteraceae and Desulfobulbaceae increased. At the outer station, the switch from iron-cycling clades to sulfate reducers occurred at shallower depths (∼5 cm), corresponding to higher sulfate reduction rates. Relatively labile organic matter (shown by δ13C and C/N ratios) was more abundant at this outer site and ordination analysis suggested that this affected microbial community structure in surface sediments. Network analysis revealed more correlations between predicted iron- and sulfur-cycling taxa, and with uncultured clades proximal to the glacier. Together, these results suggest that complex microbial communities catalyze redox cycling of iron and sulfur, especially closer to the glacier, where sulfate reduction is limited due to low organic matter availability. Diminished sulfate reduction in upper sediments enables iron to flux into the overlying water, where it may be transported to the shelf.ImportanceGlacial runoff is a key source of iron for primary production in the Arctic. In the fjords of the Svalbard archipelago, glacial retreat is predicted to stimulate phytoplankton blooms that were previously restricted to outer margins. Decreased sediment delivery and enhanced primary production has been hypothesized to alter sediment biogeochemistry, wherein any free reduced iron that could potentially be delivered to the shelf will instead become buried with sulfide generated through microbial sulfate reduction. We support this hypothesis with sequencing data that showed increases in the relative abundance of sulfate reducing taxa and sulfate reduction rates with increasing distance from the glaciers in Van Keulenfjorden, Svalbard. Community structure was driven by organic geochemistry, suggesting that enhanced input of organic material will stimulate sulfate reduction in interior fjord sediments as glaciers continue to recede."

The entire gene expression pattern of a decay fungus is followed in untreated and modified wood from initial to advanced stages of decay. Results support the current model of a two-step decay mechanism, with expression of genes related to initial oxidative depolymerization followed by accumulation of transcripts of genes related to hydrolysis of cell-wall polysaccharides. The wood decay process is finished, and the fungus goes into starvation mode after five weeks when grown on unmodified radiata pine wood. The pattern of repression of oxidative processes and oxalic acid synthesis found in radiata pine at later stages of decay is not mirrored for the high furfurylation treatment. The high treatment level provided a more unpredictable expression pattern throughout the entire incubation period. Furfurylation does not seem to directly influence the expression of core plant cell wall hydrolyzing enzymes, as a delayed and prolonged, but similar pattern was observed in the radiata pine and the modified experiments. This indicates that the fungus starts a common decay process in the modified wood, but proceeds at a slower pace as access to the plant cell wall polysaccharides is restricted. This is further supported by the downregulation of hydrolytic enzymes for the high treatment level at the last harvest point (mass loss 14%). Moreover, the mass loss does not increase during the last weeks. Collectively, this indicates a potential threshold for lower mass loss for the high furfurylation treatment.IMPORTANCEFungi are important decomposers of woody biomass in natural habitats. Investigation of the mechanisms employed by decay fungi in their attempt to degrade wood is important for both the basic scientific understanding of ecology and carbon cycling in nature, and for applied uses of woody materials. For wooden building materials long service life and carbon storage is essential, but decay fungi are responsible for massive losses of wood in service. Thus, optimizing durable wood products for the future are of major importance. In this study we have investigated the fungal genetic response to furfurylated wood, a commercial environmentally benign wood modification approach, that improves service life of wood in outdoor applications. Our results show that there is a delayed wood decay by the fungus as a response to furfurylated wood and new knowledge about the mechanisms behind the delay is provided.","The Effect of Wolffia globosa Mankai, a Green Aquatic Plant, on Postprandial Glycemic Response: A Randomized Crossover Controlled Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076421,Diabetes care,2019 05 11,"To compare the postprandial and overnight glycemic response using a novel green aquatic plant thought to provide a dietary source for high-quality protein, with an iso-carbohydrate/protein/caloric dairy shake.",Characterization of Glycolytic Enzymes and Pyruvate Kinase M2 in Type 1 and 2 Diabetic Nephropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076418,Diabetes care,2019 05 11,"Elevated glycolytic enzymes in renal glomeruli correlated with preservation of renal function in the Medalist Study, individuals with ≥50 years of type 1 diabetes.

A meta-analysis was performed whereby literary sources reporting region-specific transporter expression obtained via absolute and relative quantification approaches were considered in healthy adult Caucasian individuals. Furthermore, intestinal total membrane protein yield was calculated to enable mechanistic IVIVE via absolute transporter abundances. Where required, authors were contacted for additional information. A refined database was constructed where samples were excluded based on quantification in; non-Caucasian subjects; disease tissue; subjects <18 years old; duplicated samples; non-total membrane matrix; pooled matrices or cDNA. Demographic data was collected where available. The weighted and geometric mean, coefficient of variation and between-study homogeneity was calculated in each of 8 gut segments (duodenum, 2 jejunum, 4 ileum and colon) for 16 transporters. Expression data was normalized to that in the proximal jejunum. From a total of 47 articles, the final database consisted of 2238 measurements for 16 transporters. The solute carrier PepT1 showed the highest jejunal abundance, while MRP2 was the highest abundance ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter. Transporters displaying significant region-specific expression included, IBAT, which showed 18-fold greater terminal ileum expression compared to the proximal jejunum, while MRP3, OCTN1 and OCT1 showed >2-fold higher expression in other regions compared to the proximal jejunum. This is the first systematic analysis incorporating absolute quantification methodology to determine region-specific intestinal transporter expression. It is expected to be beneficial for mechanistic transporter IVIVE in healthy adult Caucasians. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Given the burgeoning reports of absolute transporter abundances in the human intestine, the incorporation of such information into mechanistic IVIVE-PBPK models could offer a distinct advantage to facilitate the robust assessment of the impact of gut transporters on drug disposition. The systematic and formal assessment via a literature meta-analysis described here, enables assignment of the regional-specific expression, absolute transporter abundances, inter-individual variability and other associated scaling factors to healthy Caucasian populations within PBPK models. The resulting values are available to incorporate into PBPK models, and offer a verifiable account describing intestinal transporter expression within PBPK models for persons wishing to utilize them. Furthermore, these data facilitate the development of appropriate IVIVE scaling strategies using absolute transporter abundances.","Carboxylesterase 2 and Intestine Transporters Contribute to the Low Bioavailability of Allisartan, a prodrug of Exp3174 for Hypertension Treatment in Humans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076412,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 05 11,"Exp3174 is an active metabolite of losartan for the treatment of hypertension. Allisartan (ALS3) is a marketed ester prodrug of Exp3174 to reduce bioavailability variation of losartan in China. However, ALS3 exhibited a lower oral absorption than losartan in humans. In this study, the enzymes and transporters involved in ALS3 and Exp3174 disposition were investigated to clarify the mechanisms. ALS3 underwent extensive hydrolysis to Exp3174 in S9 of Caco-2 cells, HIM, recombinant carboxylesterase (rCES) 1, and rCES2. ALS3 exhibited similar affinity in HIM and rCES2 with Km values of 6.92 and 6.77 µM, respectively, indicating that ALS3 is mainly hydrolyzed to Exp3174 in human intestine by CES2. Transport assays of ALS3 and Exp3174 suggested that ALS3 and Exp3174 are substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) with poor permeability. Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 2B1 showed higher affinity and clearance towards ALS3 (Km 0.75 µM and CLint 215 µL/min/mg) than those of Exp3174 (Km 7.85 µM and CLint 16.1 µL/min/mg), indicating that ALS3 is preferred to be uptaken into intestinal epithelia. Hydrolysis of ALS3 was increased from approximately 30% to 55% in CES2-transfected HEK293-OATP2B1 cells, indicating the possible interplay between OATP2B1 and CES2.The influx and efflux of ALS3 across Caco-2 cells increased the potential of ALS3 hydrolysis to Exp3174, and the produced Exp3174 was rapidly pumped out, which led to undetectable ALS3 and Exp3174 in basolateral (receiver) side in Caco-2 cells. Overall, our study provided supportive evidences that the interplay between CES2 and transporters in intestine contributes to the low bioavailability of ALS3 in humans.

The comprehensive TSS maps allowed us to identify core promoters for ~96% verified protein-coding genes. We corrected misannotation of translation start codon for 122 genes and suggested alternative start codon for 57 genes. We found that 56% of yeast genes are controlled by multiple core promoters and alternative core promoter usage by a gene is widespread in response to changing environments. Most core promoter shifts are coupled with altered gene expression, indicating that alternative core promoter usage might play an important role in controlling genes' transcriptional activities. Based on their activities in responding to environmental cues, we divided core promoters into constitutive class (55%) and inducible class (45%). The two classes of core promoters display distinctive patterns in transcriptional abundance, chromatin structure, promoter shape, and sequence context. In summary, our study improved the annotation of the yeast genome and demonstrated a much more pervasive and dynamic nature of transcription initiation in yeast than previously recognized."

Various studies have explored the effects of forcing individual proteins to interact with the yeast SPB, however no systematic study has been performed. We used synthetic physical interactions to detect proteins that inhibit growth when forced to associate with the SPB. We found the SPB to be especially sensitive to relocalization, necessitating a novel data analysis approach. This novel analysis of SPI screening data shows that regions of the cell are locally more sensitive to forced relocalization than previously thought. Furthermore, we found a set of associations that result in elevated SPB number and, in some cases, multi-polar spindles. Since hyper-proliferation of centrosomes is a hallmark of cancer cells, these associations point the way for the use of yeast models in the study of spindle formation and chromosome segregation in cancer.",What does sleep hygiene have to offer children's sleep problems?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076381,Paediatric respiratory reviews,2019 05 11,"Sleep hygiene practices have been described extensively in the literature. There is considerably less clarity about relationships between particular elements of sleep hygiene and particular sleep outcomes, and which intervention approaches using sleep hygiene principles are effective. In this review, we describe themes extracted from a systematic review of the sleep hygiene literature. We systematically searched Psycinfo, CINAHL, Cochrane, Ovid Medline, Embase, and Web of Science Search Engines up to August, 2017. We included all studies that associated sleep hygiene (behaviors adjacent to bedtime and during the night) with sleep duration and/or sleep onset latency and/or night waking or that used sleep-hygiene based interventions to improve sleep duration and/or sleep onset latency and/or night waking (n = 44). We organized our findings into themes by age group, sleep hygiene factors, and interventions.

The purpose of this review is to present a review of the current knowledge of the uses of respiratory support in the management of infants with bronchiolitis presenting to hospital. We electronically searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE (inception to 25th March 2018), to manually search for clinical trials that address the management strategies for respiratory support of infants with bronchiolitis. We identified 120 papers who met the inclusion criteria, of which 33 papers were relevant for this review with only nine randomized controlled trials. This review demonstrated that non-invasive respiratory support reduced the need for escalation of therapy, particularly the proportion of intubations required for infants with bronchiolitis. Additionally, clear economic benefits have been demonstrated when non-invasive ventilation has been used. The potential early use of non-invasive respiratory supports such as nasal high flow therapy and non-invasive ventilation may have an impact on health care costs and reduction in ICU admissions and intubation rates. High-grade evidence demonstrates safety and quality of high flow therapy in general ward settings.","Clinical phenotypes and management concepts for severe, established bronchopulmonary dysplasia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076379,Paediatric respiratory reviews,2019 05 11,"With advances in care, the bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotypes have evolved, so that infants who would have died in previous eras are now surviving with significant pulmonary and neurologic morbidities. The spectrum of bronchopulmonary dysplasia phenotypes is broad, however, ranging from very mild to very severe disease, and management strategies used in previous eras of care may not be appropriate for the most severe phenotypes. The pathophysiology depends largely on the gestational age at birth, but disease progression and long-term outcome depends on the net sum of antenatal, perinatal and postnatal exposures. There is no single management strategy for the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of BPD; care must be individualized. Regardless of the phenotype, the support apparatus should match the disease physiology. Here we describe an interdisciplinary approach to management in terms of achieving clinical stability and progress along a continuum, from diagnosis at 36 weeks of corrected gestational age to convalescence. The clinical trajectory depends on the balance of factors related to support of respiration, healing of the lungs, and return of organ growth and development. The overall treatment strategy should optimize positive influences that lead to a pro-growth state, while minimizing exposures that interfere with lung growth and development. This is best achieved by use of a multi-disciplinary team, with feedback loops that inform clinical decision-making regarding respiratory stability, tolerance for cares and activities, the clinical response to changes in the care plan, and progress in growth and development.",Upper airway visualization in pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076378,Paediatric respiratory reviews,2019 05 11,"Pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition that may lead to a variety of comorbidities in adolescence and adulthood. The gold standard of diagnosing OSA is polysomnography (PSG). Over the past fifteen years numerous publications have explored how to better visualize the upper airway to further assess OSA in the pediatric population, and eventually institute personalized treatment. Lateral neck radiograph, cephalometry, computed axial tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are all unique imaging techniques that are used in the diagnosis of OSA. Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy is a direct visualization technique that is gathering momentum in pediatrics. Each approach has respective benefits and weaknesses. However, none of them at this time can replace PSG. They are a helpful supplement in those patients with complicated upper airway anatomy and in those with residual OSA.","The MOPEAD project: Advancing patient engagement for the detection of ""hidden"" undiagnosed cases of Alzheimer's disease in the community.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076376,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,2019 06 09,"In most, if not all health systems, dementia is underdiagnosed, and when diagnosis occurs, it is typically at a relatively late stage in the disease process despite mounting evidence showing that a timely diagnosis would result in numerous benefits for patients, families, and society.

The authors present and discuss the development of a course that offers a semi-on-site auriculotherapy course for Brazilian primary health care (PHC) professionals. The course was funded by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and developed at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in 2015 by a team of experts in auriculotherapy. It consisted of 75 h of distance learning (five sequential modules) and 5 h of on-site learning. The modules included the following items: (1) introduction to integrative practices; (2) ear reflexology; (3) introduction to TCM; (4) biomedical view of auriculotherapy; and (5) auriculotherapy in PHC. The teaching material included a workbook for each module, 14 video lectures and an interactive ear (online resource) to study location and application to the main auricular points. The on-site lectures follow a structured script of ear palpation techniques, auricular seed insertion practice and clinical case discussions, under the supervision of trained instructors. The course was offered in 2016 and 2017 and on-site lectures took place in 25 cities, covering all Brazilian regions, in coordination with municipal or state boards of health. A total of 4273 health professionals concluded the training and their evaluation of the course was highly positive. The Brazilian experience of large-scale training shows the potential to disseminate auriculotherapy in the context of PHC, given that its practice is fast, easy to learn, safe, effective for different health problems and well accepted by the patients.",Study on the Prognostic Value of Aberrant Antigen in Patients With Acute B Lymphocytic Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076372,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",2019 05 11,"Approximately 30% to 60% of patients with acute B-lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) show as refractory or relapsed, which is one of the major causes of death in patients with B-ALL, but the methods of the treatment for relapsed/refractory B-ALL (R/R B-ALL) are limited.

Limited periods of exposure suggest that chemoprophylaxis could be a promising strategy to protect forest workers against malaria. Here we discuss three major questions in optimizing malaria chemoprophylaxis for forest workers: which antimalarial drug regimens are most appropriate, how frequently the chemoprophylaxis should be delivered, and how to motivate forest workers to use, and adhere to, malaria prophylaxis.",Biological Concepts for the Control of Aquatic Zoosporic Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076352,Trends in parasitology,2019 05 11,"Aquatic zoosporic diseases are threatening global biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as economic activities.

Results of clinical trials have been disappointing. Major problems include lack of biomarkers and understanding of the mechanisms of disease and protection. A more fundamental problem is that the scientific community seldom recognizes that primary and post-primary TB are distinct disease entities. Nearly all vaccine candidates have been designed and tested in models of primary TB, while transmission of infection is mediated by post-primary TB. Post-primary TB is seldom studied because no animal develop complete symptoms of the disease as it exists in humans. Nevertheless, mice, guinea pigs and rabbits all develop infections that at certain points appear to be models of human post-primary TB. Slowly progressive pulmonary TB in immunocompetent mice is an example. It is characterized by an alveolitis with infected foamy macrophages that have multiple characteristics of the human disease. We demonstrated that inclusion of an immune modulating agent, lactoferrin, with a BCG vaccine in this model induced a sustained reduction in lung pathology, but not numbers of organisms in tissue.

Moreover, rhamnolipid exhibited an improvement in abundance of Simplicispira and Gemmatimonas which were responsible for enhanced biofilm formation and denitrification. The results suggested that rhamnolipid addition can be a novel strategy to improve the start-up and denitrification performance of DNBFs.",Biosynthesis of nerol from glucose in the metabolic engineered Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076292,Bioresource technology,2019 06 03,"In this study, nerol was biosynthesized in the metabolic engineered Escherichia coli from glucose for the first time. Firstly, the truncated neryl diphosphate synthase gene tNDPS1 was expressed that catalyzes isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to form neryl diphosphate (NPP), and then the nerol synthase gene GmNES was co-expressed to synthesize the final product nerol from NPP. The engineered strain LZ001 accumulated 0.053 ± 0.015 mg/L of nerol. Secondly, the IDI1, MVD1, ERG8, ERG12, tHMG1 and ERG13 were co-expressed to increase the supply of IPP and DMAPP. Finally, the heterologous ERG10 gene was overexpressed, and the recombinant strain LZ005 produced 1.564 ± 0.102 mg/L of nerol in shaking-flask culture, which represents a 29.51-fold increase over LZ001 strain. This study shows the novel method for the biosynthesis of nerol and provides new metabolic engineering strategy for the production of terpenoids.",Pneumocystosis pneumonia: A comparison study between HIV and non-HIV immunocompromised patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076291,Pulmonology,2019 05 11,"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii, and its incidence has been on the rise in immunosuppressed patients without HIV.

We further assess the adequacy of current workplace practices and exposure controls via comparative urinary biomonitoring of the corresponding methylene diphenyl diamine (MDA) pre- and post-shift. MDI and pMDI are potent dermal and respiratory sensitizers and asthmagens, strong irritants of the skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract, and may cause skin burns. This study is the first comprehensive report to-date on the work practices, inhalation and dermal exposures to isocyanates and effectiveness of existing controls during SPF applications. Breathing zone exposures to 4,4' MDI (n = 31; 24 sprayers, 7 helpers) ranged from 0.9 to 123.0 μg/m3 and had a geometric mean (GM) of 13.8 μg/m3 and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 4.8. Stationary near field area samples (n = 15) were higher than personal exposures: GM, 40.9 (GSD, 3.9) μg/m3, range 1.4-240.8 μg/m3. Sixteen percent of personal air samples and 35% of area samples exceeded the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety's (NIOSH) full shift recommended exposure limit (REL) of 50 μg/m3, assuming zero exposure for the unsampled time. 4,4' MDI load on the glove dosimeters had a GM of 11.4 (GSD 2.9) μg/glove pair/min, suggesting high potential for dermal exposures. Urinary MDA had a GM of 0.7 (GSD, 3.0) μmol MDA/mol creatinine (range, nd-14.5 μmol MDA/mol creatinine). Twenty-five % of urine samples exceeded the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) biological monitoring guidance value (BMGV) of 1 μmol MDA/mol creatinine. We further report on field observations regarding current exposure controls, discuss implications of these findings and opportunities for improving work practices to prevent isocyanate exposures during SPF insulation.","The RNA-Binding ATPase, Armitage, Couples piRNA Amplification in Nuage to Phased piRNA Production on Mitochondria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076285,Molecular cell,2019 06 07,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons in Drosophila ovaries, ensuring female fertility. Two coupled pathways generate germline piRNAs: the ping-pong cycle, in which the PIWI proteins Aubergine and Ago3 increase the abundance of pre-existing piRNAs, and the phased piRNA pathway, which generates strings of tail-to-head piRNAs, one after another. Proteins acting in the ping-pong cycle localize to nuage, whereas phased piRNA production requires Zucchini, an endonuclease on the mitochondrial surface. Here, we report that Armitage (Armi), an RNA-binding ATPase localized to both nuage and mitochondria, links the ping-pong cycle to the phased piRNA pathway. Mutations that block phased piRNA production deplete Armi from nuage. Armi ATPase mutants cannot support phased piRNA production and inappropriately bind mRNA instead of piRNA precursors. We propose that Armi shuttles between nuage and mitochondria, feeding precursor piRNAs generated by Ago3 cleavage into the Zucchini-dependent production of Aubergine- and Piwi-bound piRNAs on the mitochondrial surface.",R-DeeP: Proteome-wide and Quantitative Identification of RNA-Dependent Proteins by Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076284,Molecular cell,2019 05 11,"The comprehensive but specific identification of RNA-binding proteins as well as the discovery of RNA-associated protein functions remain major challenges in RNA biology. Here we adapt the concept of RNA dependence, defining a protein as RNA dependent when its interactome depends on RNA. We converted this concept into a proteome-wide, unbiased, and enrichment-free screen called R-DeeP (RNA-dependent proteins), based on density gradient ultracentrifugation. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified 1,784 RNA-dependent proteins, including 537 lacking known links to RNA. Exploiting the quantitative nature of R-DeeP, proteins were classified as not, partially, or completely RNA dependent. R-DeeP identified the transcription factor CTCF as completely RNA dependent, and we uncovered that RNA is required for the CTCF-chromatin association. Additionally, R-DeeP allows reconstruction of protein complexes based on co-segregation.

It is associated with psychosis proneness, and several risk genes for psychosis are associated with schizotypy in non-clinical populations. Schizotypy might also modulate cognitive abilities as it is associated with attentional deficits in healthy subjects. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that established genetic risk variants ZNF804A rs1344706 and CACNA1C rs1006737 are associated with psychometric schizotypy and that schizotypy mediates their effect on attention or vice versa. In 615 healthy subjects from the FOR2107 cohort study, we analysed the genetic risk variants ZNF804A rs1344706 and CACNA1C rs1006737, psychometric schizotypy (schizotypal personality questionnaire-brief SPQB), and a neuropsychological measure of sustained and selective attention (d2 test). ZNF804A rs1344706 C (non-risk) alleles were significantly associated with higher SPQ-B Cognitive-Perceptual subscores in women and with attention deficits in both sexes. This schizotypy dimension also mediated the effect of ZNF804A on attention in women, but not in men. CACNA1C rs1006737-A showed a significant sex-modulated negative association with Interpersonal schizotypy only in men, and no effect on attention. Our multivariate model demonstrates differential genetic contributions of two psychosis risk genes to dimensions of schizotypy and, partly, to attention.

In contrast, some studies using radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have suggested that function of load transmission might not be appropriately maintained after saucerization with repair. Therefore, in pursuit to uphold load transmission after surgery for DLM, this study tried to preserve the DLM shape to keep the original DLM function. Discoid lateral meniscus repair without saucerization was indicated, with strict criteria, for those who had a painful peripheral longitudinal tear with purely intact body caused after a single traumatic incidence. The repair was performed without saucerization for four adolescents (two males, two females; mean age 16.2 years; three complete types of DLM, and one incomplete type of DLM). Postoperatively, the following were evaluated with radiography and MRI at six, 12, and 24 months after surgery: clinical outcomes, degenerative changes, and morphology of repaired DLM. They all showed good clinical outcomes. Furthermore, no degeneration, deformation, nor extrusion was observed at the two-year follow-up after surgery.

Archaeal histones were crucial in that regard by providing the basic functional unit with which eukaryotes organize DNA into nucleosomes, exert epigenetic control of gene expression, transcribe genes with CCAAT-box promoters, and a manifest cell cycle with condensed chromosomes.

Nerve conduction studies are considered essential for a definite diagnosis, but poor performance and misinterpretation of the results frequently leads to misdiagnosis. Nerve ultrasound and MRI could be helpful in diagnosis. Whereas typical CIDP is relatively easy to diagnose, atypical variants with distinct phenotypes can be a diagnostic challenge. Intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and plasma exchange are effective treatments, but maintenance treatments are often required for years, and treatment regimens require careful and regular adjustments to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Patients who do not improve, or insufficiently improve after treatment, might have specific characteristics related to a distinct disease mechanism caused by immunoglobulin G4 antibodies to nodal or paranodal proteins, and could require alternative treatments. Future studies should focus on curative and individualised treatment regimens to improve the patient's condition and to prevent further nerve damage.",Enhanced microbiological surveillance reveals that temporal case clusters contribute to the high rates of campylobacteriosis in a model agroecosystem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076242,International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM,2019 06 01,"Infections by pathogenic Campylobacter species were determined in diarrheic (n = 2,217) and non-diarrheic control (n = 104) people in Southwestern Alberta (SWA), Canada over a 1-year period using specialized and conventional isolation, and direct PCR. Overall, 9.9% of diarrheic individuals were positive for C. jejuni (9.1%), C. upsaliensis (0.6%), and C. coli (0.5%). No C. lari was detected. Four diarrheic individuals were co-infected with C. jejuni and C. coli, and four different individuals were co-infected with C. jejuni and C. upsaliensis. Two control individuals were positive for C. jejuni. Approximately 50% of stools containing C. jejuni and/or C. coli were deemed negative by conventional isolation. Direct PCR for C. jejuni was less effective than culture-based detection. Most C. jejuni infections occurred in people living in the urban centers, but the prevalence of the bacterium was lower in females than males living in urban locations, and both males and females living in rural locations. Although C. jejuni was detected throughout the year, a trend for higher infection rates was observed in the late spring to early fall with a peak in August. Forty-six C. jejuni subtype clusters were identified, including 44 temporal case clusters attributed to 28 subtype groupings. The majority of infections (70.3%) were linked to subtypes associated with beef cattle. We conclude that many occurrences of pathogenic Campylobacter species were not detected by the conventional laboratory methodology, and temporal case clusters of C. jejuni subtypes associated with cattle contribute to the high rates of campylobacteriosis in SWA.","The relationships between mobile phone use and depressive symptoms, bodily pain, and daytime sleepiness in Hong Kong secondary school students.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076240,Addictive behaviors,2019 05 31,"Studies have found that increased mobile phone use (MPU) is associated with multiple health issues such as depression, disordered sleep and pain.

Symptoms of this rare interstitial pulmonary disease can be either acute or sub-acute and it can rapidly progress to death. Diagnosis should be considered in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) if patients' symptomatology and radiology correlates with non-responding or progressive pneumonia and when morphology, on biopsies, encompasses criteria of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and organizing pneumonia (OP) balancing in between. Three clinical cases of patients presenting severe lung disease requiring mechanical ventilation and prolonged intensive care fitted on the variable spectra of AFOP histopathology and had poor outcome: a 23 year-old women had AFOP in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome pulmonary compromise; a 35 year-old man developed a letal intensive care pneumonia with AFOP pattern registered in post-mortem biopsy; and a 79 year-old man died 21 days after intensive care unit treatment of a sub-pleural organizing pneumonia with intra-alveolar fibrin, seen in post-mortem biopsy.

This idea is intuitively appealing, especially for complex organelles such as centrosomes, where a liquid-like structure would allow the many constituent molecules to diffuse and interact with one another efficiently. I discuss here recent studies that either support the concept of a liquid-like centrosome or suggest that centrosomes are assembled upon a more solid, stable scaffold. I suggest that it may be difficult to distinguish between these possibilities. I argue that the concept of biomolecular condensates is an important advance in cell biology, with potentially wide-ranging implications, but it seems premature to conclude that centrosomes, and perhaps other membraneless organelles, are necessarily best described as liquid-like phase-separated condensates."

The antiinflammatory properties of lidocaine and the role of inflammation from intestinal handling in the genesis of postoperative reflux are questionable. Because of cost and questionable efficacy of lidocaine, a well-designed clinical trial is required to support its continued use. However, lidocaine could be given to provide or enhance analgesia in selected cases with postoperative colic.",Host-Microbe Interplay in the Cardiometabolic Benefits of Dietary Polyphenols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076221,Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM,2019 06 02,"Polyphenols are nonessential phytonutrients abundantly found in fruits and vegetables. A wealth of data from preclinical models and clinical trials consistently supports cardiometabolic benefits associated with dietary polyphenols in murine models and humans. Furthermore, a growing number of studies have shown that specific classes of polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins (PACs) and ellagitannins, as well as the stilbenoid resveratrol, can alleviate several features of the metabolic syndrome. Moreover, mounting evidence points to the gut microbiota as a key mediator of the health benefits of polyphenols.

We searched the MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Science Direct databases in October and November, 2017. A total of 3492 studies were identified, and all the studies reporting the outcomes of dental implants placed during the growth phase were included in the study. After duplicates had been removed, 2133 studies were screened based on their titles and abstracts, and 162 were selected for reading. Finally, 28 studies were included in the review. Overall, 493 dental implants were placed in 147 patients aged from 3-18 years old with follow-up being from 1-20 years. The most common disorders seen that were associated with missing teeth were ectodermal dysplasia and dental trauma. The main complications reported were the infraocclusion positioning of dental implants in the maxillary arch and the rotation of dental implants in the mandibular arch. Dental implants were indicated for the anterior regions of the maxilla and mandible in patients over 10 years old, and placement of maxillary implants in a more coronal position was recommended. Consultations and adjustments to prostheses were required until growth had ceased. In growing jaws, dental implants require positional modifications, and they should be considered only under special circumstances.","Current thinking on the management of abnormal retropharyngeal nodes in patients with oral, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a structured review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076218,The British journal of oral & maxillofacial surgery,2019 05 11,"The management of enlarged retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RLN) in patients with confirmed oral, oropharyngeal, or nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has prognostic relevance and is a challenge for the clinical teams. There is, however, no consensus regarding their clinical management or radiographic evaluation. The aim of this review therefore was to present the current thinking on management to help improve outcomes. We searched several online databases using the key terms ""retropharyngeal node"", ""oral cancer"", ""head and neck cancer"", ""oropharyngeal cancer"", ""nasopharyngeal cancer"", ""nasopharynx"", ""oral cavity"", ""oropharynx"", ""TORS"", and ""radiotherapy"". A total of 1024 papers were screened, of which 32 were eligible. There was no consensus about the management of RLN. There is a lack of randomised studies and a lack of consistency in the presentation of results. Management should be tailored in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and prophylactic irradiation is warranted as these nodes are at high risk of metastasis. In patients with non-NPC tumours, we prefer to resect them during primary operations when there is radiological uncertainty or evidence that they are affected, as the combination of radiological and histological outcomes will further our understanding. In both NPC and non-NPC tumours, sampling may also help to standardise the radiological criteria for the diagnosis of RLN by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) CT.",Effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the development of pig oocytes in vitro following parthenogenetic activation and on the lipid content of oocytes and embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076217,Animal reproduction science,2019 05 15,"As oocytes and embryos of pigs have greater lipid content in the cytoplasm than those of other species, supplementation of the medium for in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may help to improve embryo development. This study was conducted to evaluate effects of the inclusion of the docosaexaenoic (DHA) and of the eicosapentaenoic acids (EPA) in the IVM medium on the development of pig oocytes and on the lipid content of oocytes and embryos. In all experiments, control media consisted of porcine follicular fluid and oocytes were activated through parthenogenesis. In Experiment 1, there were four treatments for each PUFA: one control; and three treatments including EPA or DHA in the IVM medium at 12.5 μM, 25.0 μM and 50.0 μM). In Experiment 2, inclusion of 50 μM DHA was compared against the control. Cleavage rates in the IVM medium including 12.5 μM EPA and blastocyst development rates in media at any EPA concentration were less than for the control in Experiment 1 (P <  0.05). Compared to the control, inclusion of 50 μM DHA in the IVM medium was related to greater cleavage rates and greater number of embryo cells, in Experiment 1, and lesser lipid content in oocytes after 22 and 44 h and in embryos after 7 days, in Experiment 2 (both P <  0.05).

Concerns arose regarding the high incidence of capsular contracture and complication rates. With the introduction of acellular dermal matrix (ADM), plastic surgeons are again considering the advantages of prepectoral implant placement. A systematic review was conducted to examine complication profiles in prepectoral breast reconstruction alone versus prepectoral with ADM or mesh. A systematic review of the PubMed database was performed from inception to March 2017 to identify literature on postmastectomy patients undergoing prepectoral breast reconstruction with and without ADM or mesh. Study characteristics, complication rates, and outcomes were extracted for analysis. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and complication profiles were analyzed using the random-effects model. Twenty-seven studies met criteria for inclusion out of 550 identified for review. For 1881 total breasts, the complication rate with ADM was 23.4%, while the rate without an additional implant material was 27.5%. The difference in the capsular contracture rate with and without ADM was 2.3% and 12.4%, respectively. The use of ADM in prepectoral breast reconstruction correlated with lower capsular contracture and overall complications rates; however, rates of implant loss, infection, and mastectomy flap necrosis were higher with the use of ADM. Results were variable across studies, and in general, the quality of evidence reported was low. Because the methodology for outcome assessment was inconsistent, there is a need for further investigation with comparative studies and standardized outcome reporting.",Current Trends in Clinical Practice for the Direct Anterior Approach Total Hip Arthroplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076194,The Journal of arthroplasty,2019 05 11,"Despite increased popularity of the direct anterior approach (DAA) for total hip arthroplasty (THA), current practice trends and specific driving factors leading to adoption are not well established.",Tramadol in Knee Osteoarthritis: Does Preoperative Use Affect Patient-Reported Outcomes After Total Knee Arthroplasty?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076193,The Journal of arthroplasty,2019 05 11,"The 2013 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons evidence-based guidelines recommend against the use of preoperative narcotics in the management of symptomatic osteoarthritic knees; however, the guidelines strongly recommend tramadol in this patient population.

The objective of the study was to assess the occurrence of trypanocidal drug resistance in naturally infected cattle in identified hot spots villages of Gidami district. An initial cross-sectional prevalence study was conducted in seven villages from November 2015 to June 2016. Based on the outcome of the cross-sectional study, Kellem and Gry Sonka villages with highest trypanosome prevalence (28% and 30.85%) respectively were selected. An abbreviated 28-day field prototocol study was used to estimate resistance to 1 mg/kg bw isometamidium chloride (ISM) and 7.0 mg/kg bw diminanzene aceturate (DA). In this study, 100 purposively selected trypanosome positive cattle were ear-tagged and allocated into two treatment groups: a group I were treated with 2% solution of 1 mg/kg bw ISM and a group II were treated with 7% solution of 7 mg/kg bw DA. The treatment day was considered as day 0 and the treated cattle were monitored for trypanosomes and packed cell volume (PCV) levels on days 14 (for DA and ISM) and 28 (for ISM) post treatment. A treatment failure rate of 25% of the cattle in the ISM treated group on days 14 and 28 were indicative of resistance, whereas in the DA treated group the response was assessed only on day 14 post-treatment. The results of the study confirmed the presence of drug resistance to the maximum recommended doses of ISM and DA in Giray Sonka and Kellem villages of Gidami district. Out of 50 trypanosome positive cattle treated with ISM, 68% had persistent infections on day 28 post-treatment. Similarly, of the 50 trypanosome positive cattle treated with 7 mg/kg bw DA, 36% had persistent trypanosomes on day 14 post treatment. Of all ISM and DA treatment failures T. congolense accounted for (70.59%; 66.67%), T. vivax (23.53%; 27.78%) and T. brucei (5.88%; 5.55%) respectively. Drug resistance has indeed been a considerable threat in all villages of Gidami district, but the situation is magnified in Giray Sonka and Kellem villages. Thus, an integrated control approach of trypanosomosis should be conducted to ensure sustainable animal health and production in the area. In addition beside tsetse control, rational use of trypanocidal drugs and control of co-infections to exploit self-cure against resistant trypanosome populations are recommended. Furthermore, extensive data on trypanocidal drug sensitivity tests using advanced molecular techniques considered as elucidative.",Gene-environment interaction between an endocannabinoid system genetic polymorphism and cannabis use in first episode of psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076188,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 06 16,"Alterations of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) may play an important role in the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Cannabis use is one of the environmental factors more repeatedly related to an increase the risk of developing a psychotic episode, while its use modifies the ECS normal function. In the present study we purposed to examine the gene by environment (GxE) interaction between 15 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the ECS and cannabis use in a cohort of 321 patients with a first episode of psychosis (FEP) and 241 matched healthy controls. We found the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) rs2295633 SNP genetic polymorphism was associated with a greater risk of presenting a FEP in subjects with relevant cannabis use, but not in subjects without a history of cannabis use. The probability of presenting a FEP was tenfold higher (OR: 10.69) in cannabis users who were homozygote carriers of the T allele of the FAAH rs2295633 SNP, compared to users of cannabis without this genotype. We also found that a higher a proportion of TT carriers of the FAAH rs2295633 SNP with a positive history of cannabis use was treated with high potency antipsychotic. This study has identified a GxE-environment interaction between a genetic polymorphism from the ECS and cannabis use involved in the risk of presenting a FEP. Although this preliminary data should be replicated with independent samples, our results highlight the importance of the pro-psychotic effects of exogenous cannabis use over the ECS in certain subjects.",Modeling the acute pharmacological response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in human brain using simultaneous PET/MR imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076187,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 06 16,"Pharmacological imaging of the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) may aid the clarification of their mechanism of action and influence treatment of highly prevalent neuropsychiatric conditions if the detected effects could be related to patient outcomes. In a randomized double-blind design, 38 healthy participants received a constant infusion of 8 mg citalopram or saline during either their first or second of two PET/MR scans. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) was acquired simultaneously with PET data on the binding of serotonin transporters (5-HTT) using [11C]DASB. Three different approaches for modeling of pharmacological fMRI response were tested separately. These relied on the use of regressors corresponding to (1) the drug infusion paradigm, (2) time courses of citalopram plasma concentrations and (3) changes in 5-HTT binding measured in each individual, respectively. Furthermore, the replication of results of a widely used model-free analysis method was attempted which assesses the deviation of signal in discrete time bins of fMRI data acquired after start of drug infusion. Following drug challenge, average 5-HTT occupancy was 69±7% and peak citalopram plasma levels were 111.8 ± 21.1 ng/ml. None of the applied methods could detect significant differences in the pharmacological response between SSRI and placebo scans. The failed replication of SSRI effects reported in the literature despite a threefold larger sample size highlights the importance of appropriate correction for family-wise error in order to avoid spurious results in pharmacological imaging. This calls for the development of analysis methods which take regional specialization and the dynamics of brain activity into account.",Functional remediation improves bipolar disorder functioning with no effects on brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076186,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 06 16,"The main aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of functional remediation (FR) in serum brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in euthymic adult patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD).

Therefore inducing effective mucosal immune responses play key role in preventing the virus infection. Vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (VV) was a remarkably attenuated poxvirus, which has been broadly exploited as a multifunctional vector during the development of genetically recombinant vaccine and cancer therapeutic agent. In this study, we generated a recombinant VV harboring EBOV gp (VV-Egp) that was used to immunize mice, followed by assessing immune responses, particularly the mucosal immune responses to EBOV GP. A stable and further attenuated VV-Egp, in which the VV ha gene was replaced with the EBOV gp, was generated. In BALB/c mouse model, intranasal immunization with VV-Egp elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses, including high level of neutralizing serum IgG and IgA against EBOV, and a large amount of GP-specific IFN-γ secreting lymphocytes. More importantly, EBOV GP-specific neutralizing secreted IgA (sIgA) in nasal wash and both sIgA and IgG in vaginal wash were induced. In summary, immunization with a safe and stable recombinant VV carrying a single EBOV gp conferred robust systemic immune response and mucosal neutralizing antibodies, indicating that the recombinant virus could be utilized as a viral vector for plug-and-play universal platform in mucosal vaccine development.","Can pneumococcal meningitis surveillance be used to assess the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on total invasive pneumococcal disease?

Focus groups (n = 5) were conducted through convenience sampling in a medical university in October 2016 in Anhui, China. Two years later, 6 participants among them were follow-up interviewed. All the interviews were audio-recorded, then transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using constant comparative method. Opinions of 22 participants (13 females, 9 males) were collected. Results revealed that hepatitis B vaccination was discussed the most frequently, and most of participants were vaccinated against (or had documented immunity to) hepatitis B before or during their clinical internship. None of the participants reported other vaccines uptake. Three dimensions of themes were identified: (i) at individual level, the factor ""feeling less infection risk"" might strengthen their perceived barriers. The factors ""laziness"" and ""fluke mind"" would be used to rationalize their inactive practices about vaccination; (ii) at social level, themes involved ""inactive organizational behaviors"", ""suggestions from people around"", and ""social norms"". Decision-making of medical students' vaccination was more relying on themselves and influenced more by their classmates before or during their internship, rather than being influenced more by their families/universities as before. (iii) at professional level, there are two contradictions about the participants' behaviors and attitudes. One is that they may have inappropriate behaviors because of their lack of knowledge, but sometimes they seem too satisfied about their medical knowledge to vaccination. The other is that there are both vigilance response and desensitization to occupational infection risk.

The therapeutic results were compared between two groups after 3-month therapy. Porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from venous blood by using density gradient centrifugation on percoll. The levels of FoxP3, EGF-β, IL-17 and IL-23 from PBMCs and serum IgE were measured. The relative percentage of Treg/Th17 cells was determined using flow cytometry. The main components of A. membranaceus were calycosin-7-O-glucoside, isoquercitrin, ononin, calycosin, quercetin, genistein, kaempferol, isorhamnetin and formononetin, all of which may contribute to asthma therapy. Lung function was significantly improved in the treatment group when compared with a control group (P < 0.05). The efficacy in preventing the occurrence of childhood asthma was higher in the treatment group than the control group (P < 0.05). The levels of IgE, IL-17 and IL-23 were reduced significantly in the treatment group when compared with the control group, while the levels of FoxP3 and TGF-β were increased in the treatment group when compared with the control group (P < 0.05).

ACSS2 fulfills distinct functions depending on its cellular location in tumor cells. The role and cellular localization of ACSS2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be studied. Herein, we identified that the alternative transcription start site selection of ACSS2 was significantly different between HCC and corresponding adjacent tissues. Alternative transcription start site selection produced two different ACSS2 transcripts, ACSS2-S1 and ACSS2-S2. The two isoforms of ACSS2 had different subcellular localization and different functions. Overexpression of ACSS2-S2 promoted cell proliferation and invasion, but ACSS2-S1 did not. The ACSS2-S1 was mainly present in cytoplasm, and ACSS2-S2 was distributed in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Finally, we demonstrated that alternative transcription start site selection of ACSS2 correlates ribosome biogenesis in HCC. Our findings reveal an oncogenic role of ACSS2-S2 in HCC progression via increase of ribosome biogenesis, and suggest ACSS2-S2 might be a potential therapeutic target against the HCC.",Downregulation of DPF3 promotes the proliferation and motility of breast cancer cells through activating JAK2/STAT3 signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076105,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 01,"It is reported that the genetic variation of DPF3 is a risk factor of breast cancer through large-scale association research.

However, by which mechanisms Cdk5 controls cell adhesion in migrating neurons are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the functional interaction between Cdk5 and N-cadherin (Ncad) in newborn neurons when they undergo the multipolar to bipolar transition in the intermediate zone (IZ). Detailed expression analysis revealed that both Cdk5 and Ncad were present in GFP-electroporated migrating neurons in the IZ. Misexpression of dominant negative Cdk5 into the embryonic brains stalled neuronal locomotion in the lower IZ in which arrested cells were round or multipolar. When Ncad was co-introduced with Cdk5DN, however, cells continue to migrate into the cortical plate (CP) and migrating neurons acquired typical bipolar morphology with a pia-directed leading process. Similarly, downregulation of CDK5 resulted in lesser aggregation ability, reversed by the expression of Ncad in vitro. Down-regulation of activity or protein level of CDK5 did not alter the total amount of NCAD proteins but lowered its surface expression in cells. Lastly, expression of CDK5 and NCAD overlapped in the IZ of the human fetal cortex, indicating that the role of Cdk5 and Ncad in neuronal migration is evolutionarily conserved."

This bicentric study included all patients who underwent aortic ViV procedure for surgical bioprosthetic aortic failure between 2013 and 2017. All patients who underwent TAVI were included in the analysis during the same period. ViV and non-ViV patients were matched with 1:2 ratio according to size, type of TAVI device, age (±5 years), sex, and STS score. Primary end point was hemodynamic performance including mean aortic gradient and aortic regurgitation at 1-year follow-up. A total of 132 patients were included, 49 in the ViV group and 83 in the non-ViV group. Mean age was 82.8 ± 5.9 years, 55.3% were female. Mean STS score was 5.2% ± 3.1%. Self-expandable valves were implanted in 78.8% of patients. At 1-year follow-up, aortic mean gradient was significantly higher in ViV group (18.1 ± 9.4 mm Hg vs 11.4 ± 5.4 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) and 17 (38.6%) patients had a mean aortic gradient ≥20 mm Hg vs 6 (7.8%) in the non-ViV group (p = 0.0001). Aortic regurgitation > grade 2 were similar in both groups (p = 0.71).

In conclusion, compared with TAVI in native aortic stenosis, ViV appears as a safe and feasible strategy in patients with impaired bioprosthesis. As 1-year hemodynamic performances seem better in native TAVI procedure, long-term follow-up should be assessed to determinate the impact of residual stenosis on outcomes and durability.",A-Kinase Anchoring Protein 150 and Protein Kinase A Complex in the Basolateral Amygdala Contributes to Depressive-like Behaviors Induced by Chronic Restraint Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076080,Biological psychiatry,2019 05 11,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been widely implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.

Severe contact hypersensitivity to metallic gold, typically considered non-sensitizing, has been reported. However, whether gold induces IgE-independent allergy remains unclear. Therefore, this study assessed the effects of gold chloride (CA) on MC activation and its relation to MRGPRX2.

In practice,2019 05 11,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In contrast to other chronic diseases, COPD is increasing in prevalence and is projected to be the third leading cause of death and disability worldwide by 2030. Recent advances in understanding the underlying pathophysiology of COPD has led to the development of novel targeted therapies (biologics and small molecules) that address the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. In severe asthma, biologics targeting type 2 (T2)- mediated immunity have been successful and have changed the treatment paradigm. In contrast, no biologics are currently licensed for the treatment of COPD. Those targeting non-T2 pathways have not demonstrated efficacy and in some cases raised concerns related to safety. With the increasing recognition of the eosinophil and perhaps T2-immunity possibly playing a role in a subgroup of patients with COPD, T2 biologics, specifically anti-IL-5(R), have been tested and demonstrated modest reductions in exacerbation frequency. Potential benefit was related to the baseline blood eosinophil count. These benefits were small compared with asthma. Thus, whether a subgroup of COPD sufferers might respond to anti-IL-5 or other T2-directed biologics remains to be fully addressed and requires further investigation.",New Targeted Therapies for Uncontrolled Asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076057,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology. In practice,2019 05 11,"Mechanistic studies have improved our understanding of molecular and cellular components involved in asthma and our ability to treat severe patients. An mAb directed against IgE (omalizumab) has become an established add-on therapy for patients with uncontrolled allergic asthma and mAbs specific for IL-5 (reslizumab, mepolizumab), IL-5R (benralizumab), and IL-4R (dupilumab) have been approved as add-on treatments for uncontrolled eosinophilic (type 2) asthma. While these medications have proven highly effective, some patients with severe allergic and/or eosinophilic asthma, as well as most patients with severe non-type-2 disease, have poorly controlled disease. Agents that have recently been evaluated in clinical trials include an antibody directed against thymic stromal lymphopoietin, small molecule antagonists to the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2) and the receptor for stem cell factor on mast cells (KIT), and a DNA enzyme directed at GATA3. Antibodies to IL-33 and its receptor, ST2, are being evaluated in ongoing clinical studies. In addition, a number of antagonists directed against other potential targets are under consideration for future trials, including IL-25, IL-6, TNF-like ligand 1A, CD6, and activated cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM).

Fortunately, since the introduction of biological therapeutics, patients with severe eosinophilic asthma now have beneficial treatment options that they did not have just a few years ago. In addition to anti-IgE therapy for allergic asthma, 3 new biological therapeutics targeting IL-5 and 1 targeting IL-4 and IL-13 signaling have recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma, and approval of more biological therapeutics is on the horizon. These medications decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations, improve lung function, reduce corticosteroid usage, and improve health-related quality of life. This article reviews the mechanisms of action, specific indications, benefits, and side effects of each of the approved biological therapies for asthma. Furthermore, this article reviews how a clinician could use specific patient characteristics to decide which biologic treatment may be optimal for a given patient.","Expansion of Telemedicine Services: Telepharmacy, Telestroke, Teledialysis, Tele-Emergency Medicine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076051,Critical care clinics,2019 05 11,"As more specialized care gets centralized in centers of excellence, patients admitted to rural hospitals may be at a disadvantage at the time of accessing expertise or receiving advanced care.

LPS stimulates cytokines releasing, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), that is important to ROS production. Platelets, considered inflammatory cells, generate ROS when exposed to LPS in vivo, but not when they are incubated in vitro with this compound. Therefore, we investigated the role of TNF-α on the increased intraplatelet ROS levels after LPS treatment. Mice were injected with LPS (1 mg/kg) or TNF-α (10 ng/kg), and blood was collected to prepare the washed platelets. Animals were treated with infliximab (anti-TNF-α antibody), R-7050 (non-selective TNF-α receptor antagonist) or apocynin (NADPH oxidase inhibitor). At 48 h after LPS or TNF-α injection, the ROS levels in ADP (25 µM)-activated platelets were evaluated by flow cytometry. Our data showed that injection of mice with LPS increased by 4-fold the ROS production (p < 0.05), which was significantly reduced by the treatments with infliximab, R-7050 or apocynin. Injection of mice with TNF-α markedly elevated the ROS formation in platelets (p < 0.05) that was reduced by infliximab, R-7050 or apocynin treatments. In separate experiments, platelets from saline-injected mice were incubated with TNF-α (30 to 3000 pg/mL) in absence or presence of infliximab, R-7050, apocynin or GKT137831 (NOX1/NOX4 inhibitor) before ROS measurements.

Next, neural stem cells (NSCs) were planted on the PLGA/GO conductive composite membrane and ES was applied. NSC proliferation and differentiation and neurite elongation were observed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, immunofluorescence, and PCR, respectively. The results showed that the PLGA/GO membrane had good hydrophilicity, mechanical strength, and protein adsorption.

We found that in human dermal fibroblasts, α-ionone inhibited UVB-induced loss of collagen. α-Ionone upregulated the molecules participating in the TGF-β-SMAD pathway (TGF-β1, phospho-SMAD2/3, Col1A1, and Col1A2), but downregulated the molecules involved in the MAPK-AP-1 signaling pathway (phospho-p38, phospho-JNK, phospho-ERK, phospho-c-Fos, phospho-c-Jun, MMP1, MMP3, and MMP9), in human dermal fibroblasts. α-Ionone treatment also increased hyaluronic acid contents, and this effect was accompanied by an upregulation of mRNA expression of genes (HAS1 and HAS2) involved in hyaluronic acid synthesis. Thus, α-ionone is effective in the prevention of UVB-induced decrease of collagen and hyaluronic acid in human dermal fibroblasts. We propose that α-ionone may prove beneficial for the prevention of UV-induced wrinkle formation and skin damage.",Post-FSW Cold-Rolling Simulation of ECAP Shear Deformation and Its Microstructure Role Combined to Annealing in a FSWed AA5754 Plate Joint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075986,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Friction stir welds are considered reliable joints for their lack of voids, cracks and distortions. When compared to the base material, friction stir welding (FSW) joints typically exhibit finer grain structured (especially at the nugget zone, NZ). Similarly, refined grain structure can also be obtained by severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques, such as equal channel angular pressing (ECAP). In fact, the fine grain structures produced within the NZ of FSW or friction stir processed (FSP) materials are usually coarser than the ones achieved by ECAP. The former is characterized by lower dislocation density, higher high-angle boundary fraction and different mechanical strength, compared to what can be obtained by ECAP. In this study, a dedicated cold-rolling (CR) set-up, specifically designed to simulate an ECAP-equivalent shear deformation, was used to further refine the grain structure of FSW AA5754 sheets. The effect of ECAP-equivalent deformation induced by CR in a 2 mm-thick AA5754-H111 FSW joint was investigated. FSW was carried out at two different rotational (ω) and translational (v) welding speeds, 600 rpm, 200 mm/min and 1800 rpm, 75 mm/min, respectively. FSW sheets were then CR to obtain an equivalent shear strain of ε ~ 1.08, that is equivalent to 1-ECAP pass carried out with an internal die channels intersecting at an angle φ = 90° with a curvature extending over an angle Ψ = 20°. By CR, the sheet thickness reduced only by ~20%. The role of annealing on the FSW and CR plastically deformed AA5754 was also investigated. This was applied either prior or after FSW, and it resulted that whenever it follows the FSW, the mean volume fraction of dispersoids and Mg-rich particles is higher than the case of annealing preceding the FSW process. On the contrary, it was found that the annealing treatment had a minimal role on the dispersoids and particles mean size. The here reported post-FSW ECAP-simulated deformation, obtained by a customized CR process, showed sheet integrity and a significant concurrent grain size refinement.",Smartphone Sensors for Health Monitoring and Diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075985,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Over the past few decades, we have witnessed a dramatic rise in life expectancy owing to significant advances in medical science and technology, medicine as well as increased awareness about nutrition, education, and environmental and personal hygiene. Consequently, the elderly population in many countries are expected to rise rapidly in the coming years. A rapidly rising elderly demographics is expected to adversely affect the socioeconomic systems of many nations in terms of costs associated with their healthcare and wellbeing. In addition, diseases related to the cardiovascular system, eye, respiratory system, skin and mental health are widespread globally. However, most of these diseases can be avoided and/or properly managed through continuous monitoring. In order to enable continuous health monitoring as well as to serve growing healthcare needs; affordable, non-invasive and easy-to-use healthcare solutions are critical. The ever-increasing penetration of smartphones, coupled with embedded sensors and modern communication technologies, make it an attractive technology for enabling continuous and remote monitoring of an individual's health and wellbeing with negligible additional costs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research and developments in smartphone-sensor based healthcare technologies. A discussion on regulatory policies for medical devices and their implications in smartphone-based healthcare systems is presented.

They fall into the categories of molecular tweezers, clefts and clips, depending on the geometry allowing the recognition of various guests. The advances in synthesis and mechanistic studies have pushed them forward to pharmaceutical applications, such as neurodegenerative disorders, infectious diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc. In this review, we provide a summary of the synthetic molecular tweezers, clefts and clips that have been reported for pharmaceutical applications. Their structures, mechanism of action as well as in vitro and in vivo results are described. Such receptors were found to selectively bind biological guests, namely, nucleic acids, sugars, amino acids and proteins enabling their use as biosensors or therapeutics. Particularly interesting are dynamic molecular tweezers which are capable of controlled motion in response to an external stimulus. They proved their utility as imaging agents or in the design of controlled release systems. Despite some issues, such as stability, cytotoxicity or biocompatibility that still need to be addressed, it is obvious that molecular tweezers, clefts and clips are promising candidates for several incurable diseases as therapeutic agents, diagnostic or delivery tools.","Biomarker Effects in Carassius auratus Exposure to Ofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole and Ibuprofen.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075982,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen are three commonly used drugs which can be detected in aquatic environments. To assess their ecotoxicity, the effects of these three pharmaceuticals and their mixture on AChE (acetylcholinesterase) activity in the brain, and EROD (7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) and SOD (superoxide dismutase) activities in the liver of the freshwater crucian carp Carassius auratus were tested after exposure for 1, 2, 4 and 7 days. The results showed that treatments with 0.002⁻0.01 mg/L ofloxacin and 0.0008⁻0.004 mg/L sulfamethoxazole did not significantly change AChE, EROD and SOD activities. AChE activity was significantly inhibited in response to treatment with 0.05mg/L ofloxacin and 0.02mg/L sulfamethoxazole. All three biomarkers were induced significantly in treatments with ibuprofen and the mixture of the three pharmaceuticals at all the tested concentrations. The combined effects of ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen were compared with their isolated effects on the three biomarkers, and the results indicated that exposure to ibuprofen and the mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations could trigger adverse impacts on Carassius auratus. The hazard quotient (HQ) index also demonstrated a high risk for ibuprofen. Moreover, the present study showed that the effects of ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen might be additive on the physiological indices of Carassius auratus.",Hyperbilirubinemia in Gunn Rats is Associated with Decreased Inflammatory Response in LPS-Mediated Systemic Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075981,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Decreased inflammatory status has been reported in subjects with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. However, mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory actions of bilirubin (BR) are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to assess the role of BR in systemic inflammation using hyperbilirubinemic Gunn rats as well as their normobilirubinemic littermates and further in primary hepatocytes. The rats were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 6 mg/kg intraperitoneally) for 12 h, their blood and liver were collected for analyses of inflammatory and hepatic injury markers. Primary hepatocytes were treated with BR and TNF-α. LPS-treated Gunn rats had a significantly decreased inflammatory response, as evidenced by the anti-inflammatory profile of white blood cell subsets, and lower hepatic and systemic expressions of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10. Hepatic mRNA expression of LPS-binding protein was upregulated in Gunn rats before and after LPS treatment. In addition, liver injury markers were lower in Gunn rats as compared to in LPS-treated controls. The exposure of primary hepatocytes to TNF-α with BR led to a milder decrease in phosphorylation of the NF-κB p65 subunit compared to in cells without BR. In conclusion, hyperbilirubinemia in Gunn rats is associated with an attenuated systemic inflammatory response and decreased liver damage upon exposure to LPS.",Ascorbic Acid and Ozone: Novel Perspectives to Explain an Elusive Relationship.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075980,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 11,"A huge amount of studies highlighted the importance of high ascorbic acid (AA) content in ozone tolerance, yet the relationship between them appears more complex than a simple direct correlation. Sometimes the connection is clear, for example, two Arabidopsis mutants defective in the main AA biosynthetic pathway (vtc mutants) were identified by means of their ozone sensitivity. However, some low-AA containing mutants are relatively tolerant, suggesting that AA location/availability could be more relevant than total content. A clear distinction should also be made between ozone tolerance obtained when AA content is increased by experimental supplementation (exogenous AA), and the physiological role of plant-synthesized AA (endogenous AA), whose amount is apparently subjected to tight regulation. Recent findings about the role of AA in signal transduction and epigenetic regulation of gene expression open new routes to further research.",Toxin⁻Antitoxin Systems in Bacillus subtilis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075979,Toxins,2019 05 11,"Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems were originally discovered as plasmid maintenance systems in a multitude of free-living bacteria, but were afterwards found to also be widespread in bacterial chromosomes. TA loci comprise two genes, one coding for a stable toxin whose overexpression kills the cell or causes growth stasis, and the other coding for an unstable antitoxin that counteracts toxin action. Of the currently known six types of TA systems, in Bacillus subtilis, so far only type I and type II TA systems were found, all encoded on the chromosome. Here, we review our present knowledge of these systems, the mechanisms of antitoxin and toxin action, and the regulation of their expression, and we discuss their evolution and possible physiological role."

However, the low carrier frequency restricts its imaging resolution. The sliding spotlight mode provides an operational solution to meet the requirement of high imaging resolution in P-band SAR design. Unfortunately, the space-borne P-band SAR will be inevitably deteriorated by the ionospheric scintillation. Compared with the stripmap mode, the sliding spotlight SAR will suffer more degradation when operating in the scintillation active regions due to its long integration time and complex imaging geometry. In this paper, both the imaging performance and scintillation effect for P-band sliding spotlight mode are studied. The theoretical analysis of scintillation effect is performed based on a refined model of the two-frequency and two-position coherence function (TFTPCF). A novel scintillation simulator based on the reverse back-projection (ReBP) algorithm is proposed to generate the SAR raw data for sliding spotlight mode. The proposed scintillation simulator can also be applied to predict the scintillation effect for other multi-mode SAR systems such as terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) and ScanSAR. Finally, a group of simulations are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis.",Carotenoids: How Effective Are They to Prevent Age-Related Diseases?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075966,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Despite an increase in life expectancy that indicates positive human development, a new challenge is arising. Aging is positively associated with biological and cognitive degeneration, for instance cognitive decline, psychological impairment, and physical frailty. The elderly population is prone to oxidative stress due to the inefficiency of their endogenous antioxidant systems. As many studies showed an inverse relationship between carotenoids and age-related diseases (ARD) by reducing oxidative stress through interrupting the propagation of free radicals, carotenoid has been foreseen as a potential intervention for age-associated pathologies. Therefore, the role of carotenoids that counteract oxidative stress and promote healthy aging is worthy of further discussion. In this review, we discussed the underlying mechanisms of carotenoids involved in the prevention of ARD. Collectively, understanding the role of carotenoids in ARD would provide insights into a potential intervention that may affect the aging process, and subsequently promote healthy longevity.",LightSit: An Unobtrusive Health-Promoting System for Relaxation and Fitness Microbreaks at Work.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075965,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Physical inactivity and chronic stress at work increase the risks of developing metabolic disorders, mental illnesses, and musculoskeletal injuries, threatening office workers' physical and psychological well-being. Although several guidelines and interventions have been developed to prevent theses subhealth issues, their effectiveness and health benefits are largely limited when they cannot match workday contexts. This paper presents LightSit, a health-promoting system that helps people reduce physically inactive behaviors and manage chronic stress at work. LightSit comprises a sensor mat that can be embedded into an office chair for measuring a user's sitting posture and heart rate variability and a lighting display that is integrated into a monitor stand to present information unobtrusively, facilitating fitness and relaxation exercises during microbreaks. Following the showroom approach, we evaluated LightSit during a public exhibition at Dutch Design Week 2018. During the eight days of the exhibition, we observed more than 500 sessions of experiences with healthy microbreaks using our prototype. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 50 participants who had office-based jobs and had experienced LightSit. Our qualitative findings indicated the potential benefits of LightSit in facilitating health-promoting behaviors during office work. Based on the insights learned from this study, we discuss the implications for future designs of interactive health-promoting systems.",Mechanical Durotactic Environment Enhances Specific Glioblastoma Cell Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075964,Cancers,2019 05 11,"Background: A hallmark of glioblastoma is represented by their ability to widely disperse throughout the brain parenchyma. The importance of developing new anti-migratory targets is critical to reduce recurrence and improve therapeutic efficacy. Methods: Polydimethylsiloxane substrates, either mechanically uniform or presenting durotactic cues, were fabricated to assess GBM cell morphological and dynamical response with and without pharmacological inhibition of NNMII contractility, of its upstream regulator ROCK and actin polymerization. Results: Glioma cells mechanotactic efficiency varied depending on the rigidity compliance of substrates. Morphologically, glioma cells on highly rigid and soft bulk substrates displayed bigger and elongated aggregates whereas on durotactic substrates the same cells were homogeneously dispersed with a less elongated morphology. The durotactic cues also induced a motility change, cell phenotype dependent, and with cells being more invasive on stiffer substrates. Pharmacological inhibition of myosin or ROCK revealed a rigidity-insensitivity, unlike inhibition of microfilament contraction and polymerization of F-actin, suggesting that alternative signalling is used to respond to durotactic cues. Conclusions: The presence of a distinct mechanical cue is an important factor in cell migration. Together, our results provide support for a durotactic role of glioma cells that acts through actomyosin contractility to regulate the aggressive properties of GBM cells.",Identification of Ground Intrusion inUnderground StructuresBased on Distributed Structural Vibration Detected by Ultra-Weak FBG Sensing Technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075963,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"It is challenging for engineers to timely identify illegal ground intrusions in underground systems such as subways. In order toprevent the catastrophic collapse of subway tunnels from intrusion events, this paper investigated the capability of detecting the ground intrusion of underground structures based on dynamic measurement of distributed fiber optic sensing. For an actual subway tunnel monitored by the ultra-weak fiber optic Bragg grating (FBG)sensing fiber with a spatial resolution of five meters, a simulated experiment of the ground intrusion along the selected path was designed and implemented, in which a hydraulic excavator was chosen to exert intrusion perturbations with different strengths and modes at five selected intrusion sites. For each intrusion place, the distributed vibration responses of sensing fibers mounted on the tunnel wall and the track bed were detected to identify the occurrence and characteristics of the intrusion event simulated by the discrete and continuous pulses of the excavator under two loading postures. By checking the on-site records of critical moments in the intrusion process, the proposed detection approach based on distributed structural vibration responses for the ground intrusion can detect the occurrence of intrusion events, locate the intrusion ground area, and distinguish intrusion strength and typical perturbation modes.","Honokiol Improves Insulin Resistance, Hepatic Steatosis, and Inflammation in Type 2 Diabetic db/db Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075962,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"This study focuses on the effect of honokiol (HON) on glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and inflammation in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were fed a normal diet with or without HON (0.02%, w/w) or pioglitazone (PIO, anti-diabetic agent, 0.01%, w/w) for 5 weeks. Blood biomarker, tissue morphology and enzymatic and genetic parameters were determined. PIO significantly decreased food intake, fasting blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, but markedly increased body weight, adipose tissue weight, and plasma leptin levels. HON did not significantly affect food intake, body weight, or levels of plasma leptin and blood glucose. However, HON led to significant decreases in adipose tissue weight, plasma insulin, blood HbA1c and HOMA-IR levels and improved glucose tolerance. The anti-diabetic and anti-adiposity effects of HON were partially related to the inhibition of gluconeogenic enzymes and their mRNA expression in the liver; and the inhibition of lipogenic enzymes in adipose tissue, respectively. Unlike PIO, HON did not affect dyslipidemia, but ameliorated hepatic steatosis by inhibiting hepatic lipogenic enzymes activity. Moreover, HON exhibited anti-inflammatory effects similar to PIO. These results suggest that HON can protect against type 2 diabetes by improving insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammation.",Temporal Dynamics of DNA Methylation Patterns in Response to Rearing Juvenile Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in a Hatchery versus Simulated Stream Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075961,Genes,2019 05 11,"Genetic selection is often implicated as the underlying cause of heritable phenotypic differences between hatchery and wild populations of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) that also differ in lifetime fitness. Developmental plasticity, which can also affect fitness, may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. Our previous study identified significant differences in DNA methylation between adult hatchery- and natural-origin steelhead from the same population that could not be distinguished by DNA sequence variation. In the current study, we tested whether hatchery-rearing conditions can influence patterns of DNA methylation in steelhead with known genetic backgrounds, and assessed the stability of these changes over time. Eyed-embryos from 22 families of Methow River steelhead were split across traditional hatchery tanks or a simulated stream-rearing environment for 8 months, followed by a second year in a common hatchery tank environment. Family assignments were made using a genetic parentage analysis to account for relatedness among individuals. DNA methylation patterns were examined in the liver, a relatively homogeneous organ that regulates metabolic processes and somatic growth, of juveniles at two time points: after eight months of rearing in either a tank or stream environment and after a subsequent year of rearing in a common tank environment. Further, we analyzed DNA methylation in the sperm of mature 2-year-old males from the earlier described treatments to assess the potential of environmentally-induced changes to be passed to offspring. Hepatic DNA methylation changes in response to hatchery versus stream-rearing in yearling fish were substantial, but few persisted after a second year in the tank environment. However, the early rearing environment appeared to affect how fish responded to developmental and environmental signals during the second year since novel DNA methylation differences were identified in the livers of hatchery versus stream-reared fish after a year of common tank rearing. Furthermore, we found profound differences in DNA methylation due to age, irrespective of rearing treatment. This could be due to smoltification associated changes in liver physiology after the second year of rearing. Although few rearing-treatment effects were observed in the sperm methylome, strong family effects were observed. These data suggest limited potential for intergenerational changes, but highlight the importance of understanding the effects of kinship among studied individuals in order to properly analyze and interpret DNA methylation data in natural populations. Our work is the first to study family effects and temporal dynamics of DNA methylation patterns in response to hatchery-rearing.",Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study on Oxygen Vacancies and Site Occupations in Mg-Doped BaTiO3 Ceramics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075960,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Nominal (Ba1-xMgx)TiO3 (x = 0.015) (BM1T) and (Ba1-xMgx)TiO3 (x = 0.03-0.20) (BMT) ceramics were prepared by the mixed-oxide route at sintering temperatures (Ts) of 1200-1400 °C and 1200 °C, respectively. The solubility limit of Mg2+ in BMT was determined by XRD to be x = 0.05, and evidence was found for occupation of the A site by Mg2+. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was employed as a key technique to investigate the effect of Ts on oxygen vacancies in BM1T. The structure of BM1T changed from pseudocubic at Ts = 1200 °C to tetragonal at 1300 °C to mixed phases of hexagonal and tetragonal at 1400 °C. When Ts ≥ 1300 °C, a g = 1.956 EPR signal was observed at T = -188 °C and assigned as ionized oxygen vacancies. Mg2+ exhibited amphoteric behavior of substituting for the double cation sites. When Ts = 1400 °C, B-site Mg2+ and oxygen vacancies mainly existed in the hexagonal phase and A-site Mg2+ was dominant in the tetragonal phase. The higher tan δ was attributed to the higher concentrations of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ in the hexagonal phase.",In Situ Production and Application of Cellulose Nanofibers to Improve Recycled Paper Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075959,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The recycled paper and board industry needs to improve the quality of their products to meet customer demands.

A circular economy approach in the industrial implementation of CNF can be addressed through the in situ production of CNF using side cellulose streams of the process as raw material, avoiding transportation costs and reducing industrial wastes. Furthermore, CNF fit for use can be produced for specific industrial applications.This study evaluates the feasibility of using two types of recycled fibers, simulating the broke streams of two paper machines producing newsprint and liner for cartonboard, to produce in situ CNF for direct application on the original pulps, old newsprint (ONP), and old corrugated container (OCC), and to reinforce the final products. The CNF were obtained by 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation and homogenization at 600 bar. Handsheets were prepared with disintegrated recycled pulp and different amounts of CNF using a conventional three-component retention system. Results show that 3 wt.% of CNF produced with 10 mmol of NaClO per gram of dry pulp improve tensile index of ONP ~30%. For OCC, the same treatment and CNF dose increase tensile index above 60%. In both cases, CNF cause a deterioration of drainage, but this effect is effectively counteracted by optimising the retention system.",Prognostic Value of the Conversion to a Shockable Rhythm in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients with Initial Non-Shockable Rhythm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075958,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 11,"In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with an initial non-shockable rhythm, the prognostic significance of conversion to a shockable rhythm (or hereafter ""conversion"") during resuscitation remains unclear. We investigated whether conversion is associated with good neurologic outcome. We included patients with OHCA with medical causes and an initial non-shockable rhythm by using the national OHCA surveillance cohort database of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 2012~2016. The primary outcome was good neurologic outcome at hospital discharge. Of 85,602 patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm, 17.9% experienced conversion. Patients with and those without conversion had good neurologic outcome rates of 3.2% and 1.0%, respectively (p < 0.001). In multiple regression analysis, conversion was associated with good neurologic outcome (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.604; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.248-3.015) in the patients with an initial non-shockable rhythm, and had the association with good neurologic outcome (adjusted OR 3.972, 95% CI 3.167-4.983) in unwitnessed patients by emergency medical services (EMS) without pre-hospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) among the population. In patients with OHCA with an initial non-shockable rhythm, even if with unwitnessed arrest by EMS and no pre-hospital ROSC, continuing resuscitation needs to be considered if conversion to a shockable rhythm occurred."

However, most biochemical or molecular studies about fleshy fruit development concern the entire fruit, the fruit without seeds, or pericarp only. We studied tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit at four stages of development (12, 20, 35, and 45 days post-anthesis). We separated the seeds and the other tissues, exocarp, mesocarp, columella with placenta and locular tissue, and analyzed them individually using proton NMR metabolomic profiling for the quantification of major polar metabolites, enzymatic analysis of starch, and LC-DAD analysis of isoprenoids. Pericarp tissue represented about half of the entire fruit mass only. The composition of each fruit tissue changed during fruit development. An ANOVA-PCA highlighted common, and specific metabolite trends between tissues e.g., higher contents of chlorogenate in locular tissue and of starch in columella. Euclidian distances based on compositional data showed proximities within and between tissues. Several metabolic regulations differed between tissues as revealed by the comparison of metabolite networks based on correlations between compounds.

These features can strongly depend on feeding and management. In this perspective, the screening of milk samples intended for Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano located in Northern Italy was performed, focusing on a panel of volatile molecules. The work was carried out on a total number of 25 bovine milk samples for the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano. Milk samples were collected from May to September and analyzed for volatile molecules using headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry. A range of several volatile molecule classes was considered (aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons, solforates). Results showed a significant influence of the month and destination of milk due to the time period and subsequent use in cheesemaking (Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano). Significant differences between months were observed for all volatiles. These preliminary results indicate differences between the two types of milk due to the period and destination. The study of volatile molecules in milk will give important information about the physiology of milk and the evolution of dairy products. These features must be extended and confirmed by the sensory analysis of milk and derived products, leading to a more complete characterization of milk biology and derived products.",Association between Statin Use and Sepsis Risk in Patients with Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075943,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"This study investigated the association of statin use with sepsis risk in patients with dementia. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in Taiwan by using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified and enrolled 308 patients with newly diagnosed dementia who used statin after dementia diagnosis. These patients were individually propensity score matched (1:1) according to age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, asthma, malignancy, parkinsonism, and dementia drugs used (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and memantine) with 251 controls (statin non-users). A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio for sepsis in statin users and non-users. After adjustment for other confounding factors, the incidence of sepsis in statin users was 1.42-fold higher than that in non-users (95% confidence interval = 0.81-2.5). In conclusion, our analysis showed no positive association of sepsis with statin use in patients with dementia.",Methods for the Refinement of Protein Structure 3D Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075942,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The refinement of predicted 3D protein models is crucial in bringing them closer towards experimental accuracy for further computational studies. Refinement approaches can be divided into two main stages: The sampling and scoring stages. Sampling strategies, such as the popular Molecular Dynamics (MD)-based protocols, aim to generate improved 3D models. However, generating 3D models that are closer to the native structure than the initial model remains challenging, as structural deviations from the native basin can be encountered due to force-field inaccuracies. Therefore, different restraint strategies have been applied in order to avoid deviations away from the native structure. For example, the accurate prediction of local errors and/or contacts in the initial models can be used to guide restraints. MD-based protocols, using physics-based force fields and smart restraints, have made significant progress towards a more consistent refinement of 3D models. The scoring stage, including energy functions and Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are also used to discriminate near-native conformations from non-native conformations. Nevertheless, there are often very small differences among generated 3D models in refinement pipelines, which makes model discrimination and selection problematic. For this reason, the identification of the most native-like conformations remains a major challenge.",A Pilot Study of the Synergy between Two Antimicrobial Peptides and Two Common Antibiotics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075940,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 11,"Frequent and unrestricted use of antibiotics has been associated with the development of antibiotic resistance by microorganisms.

In addition to its well-known roles in embryonic development, wound healing, and regeneration, EMT plays an important role in tumor progression and metastatic invasion. In breast cancer, EMT both increases the migratory capacity and invasive potential of tumor cells, and initiates protumorigenic alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In particular, recent evidence has linked increased expression of EMT markers such as TWIST1 and MMPs in breast tumors with increased immune infiltration in the TME. These immune cells then provide cues that promote immune evasion by tumor cells, which is associated with enhanced tumor progression and metastasis. In the current review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the role of EMT in the biology of different subtypes of breast cancer. We will further explore the correlation between genetic switches leading to EMT and EMT-induced alterations within the TME that drive tumor growth and metastasis, as well as their possible effect on therapeutic response in breast cancer.",Microstructural Evolution and Mechanical Properties of an Advanced γ-TiAl Based Alloy Processed by Spark Plasma Sintering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075938,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Intermetallic γ-TiAl based alloys are innovative lightweight structural high-temperature materials used in aerospace and automotive applications due to already established industrial-scale processing routes, like casting and hot-working, i.e., forging. A promising alternative method of production, regarding manufacturing of near net-shape components, goes over the powder metallurgy route, more precisely by densification of TiAl powder via spark plasma sintering. In this study, gas atomized powder from the 4th generation TNM alloy, Ti-43.5Al-4Nb-1Mo-0.1B (in at.%), was densified and the microstructure was investigated by means of electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The sintered microstructure exhibits lamellar α2-Ti3Al /γ-TiAl colonies surrounded by globular γ- and ordered βo-TiAl phase. The coarse lamellar spacing stems from the low cooling rate after densification at sintering temperature. Against this background, subsequent heat treatments were designed to decrease the lamellar widths by a factor of ten. Accompanying, tensile tests and creep experiments at different temperatures revealed that the modified almost fully lamellar microstructure is enhanced in strength and creep resistance, where a small volume fraction of globular γ-phase provides ductility at ambient temperatures.","Effects of Different Biochars on Wheat Growth Parameters, Yield and Soil Fertility Status in a Silty Clay Loam Soil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075937,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The conversion of organic wastes into biochar via the pyrolysis technique could be used to produce soil amendments useful as a source of plant nutrients. In this study, we investigated the effects of fruit peels and milk tea waste-derived biochars on wheat growth, yield, root traits, soil enzyme activities and nutrient status. Eight amendment treatments were tested: no amendment (CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), banana peel biochar 1% (BB1 + CF), banana peel biochar 2% (BB2 + CF), orange peel biochar 1% (OB1 + CF), orange peel biochar 2% (OB2 + CF), milk tea waste biochar 1% (TB1 + CF) and milk tea waste biochar 2% (TB2 + CF). The results indicated that chlorophyll values, plant height, grain yield, dry weight of shoot and root were significantly (p < 0.05) increased for the TB2 + CF treatment as compared to other treatments. Similarly, higher contents of nutrients in grains, shoots and roots were observed for TB2 + CF: N (61.3, 23.3 and 7.6 g kg-1), P (9.2, 10.4 and 8.3 g kg-1) and K (9.1, 34.8 and 4.4 g kg-1). Compared to CK, the total root length (41.1%), surface area (56.5%), root volume (54.2%) and diameter (78.4%) were the greatest for TB2 + CF, followed by BB2 + CF, OB2 + CF, TB1 + CF, BB1 + CF, OB1 + CF and CF, respectively. However, BB + CF and OB + CF treatments increased β-glucosidase and dehydrogenase, but not urease activity, as compared to the TB + CF amendment, while all enzyme activity decreased with the increased biochar levels. We concluded that the conversion of fruit peels and milk tea waste into biochar products contribute the benefits of environmental and economic issues, and should be tested as soil amendments combined with chemical fertilizers for the improvement of wheat growth and grain yield as well as soil fertility status under field conditions.",Enhanced Photocatalytic Degradation of Organic Dyes via Defect-Rich TiO2 Prepared by Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075936,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 11,"The dye wastewater produced in the printing and dyeing industry causes serious harm to the natural environment. TiO2 usually shows photocatalytic degradation of dye under the irradiation ultravilet light rather than visible light. In this work, a large number of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ defects were generated on the surface of the TiO2 nanoparticles via Ar plasma. Compared with pristine TiO2 nanoparticles, the as-obtained Ar plasma-treated TiO2 (Ar-TiO2) nanoparticles make the energy band gap reduce from 3.21 eV to 3.17 eV and exhibit enhanced photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. The Ar-TiO2 obtained exhibited excellent degradation properties of methyl orange (MO); the degradation rate under sunlight irradiation was 99.6% in 30 min, and the photocatalytic performance was about twice that of the original TiO2 nanoparticles (49%). The degradation rate under visible light (λ > 400 nm) irradiation was 89% in 150 min, and the photocatalytic performance of the Ar-TiO2 was approaching ~4 times higher than that of the original TiO2 nanoparticles (23%). Ar-TiO2 also showed good degradation performance in degrading rhodamine B (Rho B) and methylene blue (MB). We believe that this plasma strategy provides a new method for improving the photocatalytic activity of other metal oxides.",Cranio-Facial Characteristics in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075935,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 11,"Background: Cranio-facial anomalies frequently occur in neurodevelopmental disorders because both face and brain are derived from neuroectoderm. The identification of differences in the facial phenotype of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may reflect alterations in embryologic brain development in children with ASD. Methods: we evaluated 33 caucasian children with ASD using a 2D computerized photogrammetry. Anthropometric euclidean measurements and landmarks located on the soft tissue of the face and head, were based on five cranio-facial indexes. Relationships between anthropometric z-scores and participant characteristics (i.e., age, Global IQ, severity of autistic symptoms measured using the CARS checklist) were assessed. Results: Cephalic index z-score differed significantly from 0 in our ASD group (p = 0.019). Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between Facial Index z-score and CARS score (p = 0.003); conversely, a positive correlation was found between Interchantal Index z-score and CARS score (p = 0.028). Conclusion: our measurements shows a dolichocephalic head shape which is not correlated with autism severity. Importantly, two craniofacial markers were significantly correlated with autism severity: increased orbital hyperthelorism and decrease of height of the facial midline. These data support previous findings of craniofacial anomalies in autism spectrum disorder suggesting an ""ASD facial phenotype"" that could be used to improve ASD diagnoses."

We investigated whether physical activity (PA) modulates the effect of FTO rs3751812 on body mass index (BMI) among Taiwanese adults. Analytic samples included 10,853 Taiwan biobank participants. Association of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with BMI was assessed using linear regression models. Physical activity was defined as any kind of exercise lasting 30 min each session, at least three times a week. Participants with heterozygous (TG) and homozygous (TT) genotypes had higher BMI compared to those with wild-type (GG) genotypes. The β value was 0.381(p < 0.0001) for TG individuals and 0.684 (p = 0.0204) for TT individuals. There was a significant dose-response effect among carriers of different risk alleles (p trend <0.0001). Active individuals had lower BMI than their inactive counterparts (β = -0.389, p < 0.0001). Among the active individuals, significant associations were found only with the TG genotype (β = 0.360, p = 0.0032). Inactive individuals with TG and TT genotypes had increased levels of BMI compared to those with GG genotypes: Their β values were 0.381 (p = 0.0021) and 0.950 (p = 0.0188), respectively. There was an interaction between the three genotypes, physical inactivity, and BMI (p trend  = 0.0002). Our data indicated that increased BMI owing to genetic susceptibility by FTO rs3751812 may be reduced by physical activity.","Cryostructuring of Polymeric Systems. 52.

Such sequence of operations resulted in the calcium alginate or alginic acid sponges, respectively. The swelling degree of the walls of macropores in such matrices decreased with increasing polymer concentration in the initial solution. The dependence of the degree of swelling on the cryogenic processing temperature had a bell-like character with a maximum for the samples formed at -20 °C. According to 1H NMR spectroscopy, the content of mobile (non-frozen) water in the frozen water-sodium alginate systems also depended on the initial polymer concentration and freezing temperature. The cryostructurates obtained did not lose their integrity in water, saline, in an acidic medium at pH 2 for at least three weeks. Under alkaline conditions at pH 12 the first signs of dissolution of the Ca-alginate sponge arose only after a week of incubation. Microbiological testing of the model depot form of the antibiotics entrapped in the Ca-alginate cryostructurate demonstrated the efficiency of this system as the antibacterial material.",Enhanced High-Temperature Mechanical Properties of Al⁻Cu⁻Li Alloy through T1 Coarsening Inhibition and Ce-Containing Intermetallic Refinement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075922,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The effects of the addition of 0.29 wt% Ce on the high-temperature mechanical properties of an Al-Cu-Li alloy were investigated. Ce addition contributes to T1 (Al2CuLi) phase coarsening inhibition and Ce-containing intermetallic refinement which greatly improved the thermal stability and high-temperature deformation uniformity of this alloy. On the one hand, small Ce in solid solution and segregation at phase interface can effectively prevent the diffusion and convergence of the main element Cu on T1 phase during thermal exposure. Therefore, the thermal stability of Ce-containing alloy substantiality improves during thermal exposure at the medium-high-temperature stage (170 °C to 270 °C). On the other hand, the increment of the tensile elongation in Ce-containing alloy is much greater than that in Ce-free alloy at high temperatures tensile test, because the refined Al8Cu4Ce intermetallic phase with high-temperature stability are mainly located in the fracture area with plastic fracture characteristics. This work provides a new method for enhancing high-temperature mechanical properties of Al-Cu-Li alloy which could be used as a construction material for high-temperature structural components.",Improvements in Performance Analysis of Photovoltaic Systems: Array Power Monitoring in Pulse Width Modulation Charge Controllers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075921,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Various challenges should be considered when measuring photovoltaic array power and energy in pulse width modulation (PWM) charge controllers. These controllers are frequently used not only in stand-alone photovoltaic (SAPV) systems, but may also be found in photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption systems with battery storage connected to the electricity grid. An acceptable solution may be reached using expensive data acquisition systems (DASs), although this could be generally disproportionate to the relatively low cost of SAPV systems. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop new and effective monitoring techniques which will provide the PV array direct current (DC), output power (PA,dc), and PV array DC output energy (EA), thus avoiding the use of sophisticated DASs and providing high accuracy for the calculated parameters. Only transducers and electronic circuits that provide the average and true rms values of the PWM signals are needed. The estimation of these parameters through the aforementioned techniques showed high accuracy for both series and shunt PWM battery charge controllers. Normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) was lower than 2.4%, normalized mean bias error (NMBE) was between -1.5% and 1.1%, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was within 1.6%.",Identifying Traffic Context Using Driving Stress: A Longitudinal Preliminary Case Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075920,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Many previous studies have identified that physiological responses of a driver are significantly associated with driving stress. However, research is limited to identifying the effects of traffic conditions (low vs. high traffic) and road types (highway vs. city) on driving stress. The objective of this study is to quantify the relationship between driving stress and traffic conditions, and driving stress and road types, respectively. In this study, electrodermal activity (EDA) signals for a male driver were collected in real road driving conditions for 60 min a day for 21 days. To classify the levels of driving stress (low vs. high), two separate models were developed by incorporating the statistical features of the EDA signals, one for traffic conditions and the other for road types. Both models were based on the application of EDA features with the logistic regression analysis. City driving turned out to be more stressful than highway driving. Traffic conditions, defined as traffic jam also significantly affected the stress level of the driver, when using the criteria of the vehicle speed of 40 km/h and standard deviation of the speed of 20 km/h. Relevance to industry: The classification results of the two models indicate that the traffic conditions and the road types are important features for driving stress and its related applications.",In-Cell Synthesis of Bioorthogonal Alkene Tag S-Allyl-Homocysteine and Its Coupling with Reprogrammed Translation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075919,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"In this study, we report our initial results on in situ biosynthesis of S-allyl-l-homocysteine (Sahc) by simple metabolic conversion of allyl mercaptan in Escherichiacoli, which served as the host organism endowed with a direct sulfhydration pathway. The intracellular synthesis we describe in this study is coupled with the direct incorporation of Sahc into proteins in response to methionine codons. Together with O-acetyl-homoserine, allyl mercaptan was added to the growth medium, followed by uptake and intracellular reaction to give Sahc. Our protocol efficiently combined the in vivo synthesis of Sahc via metabolic engineering with reprogrammed translation, without the need for a major change in the protein biosynthesis machinery. Although the system needs further optimisation to achieve greater intracellular Sahc production for complete protein labelling, we demonstrated its functional versatility for photo-induced thiol-ene coupling and the recently developed phosphonamidate conjugation reaction. Importantly, deprotection of Sahc leads to homocysteine-containing proteins-a potentially useful approach for the selective labelling of thiols with high relevance in various medical settings.",Effect of Al⁻Zn Alloy Coating on Corrosion Fatigue Behavior of X80 Riser Steel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075918,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This paper presents a corrosion fatigue cyclic failure test for X80 steel, which has arc sprayed with an Al-Zn coating in natural seawater under different stress levels. We found that the Al-Zn coating can significantly improve the corrosion fatigue resistance and slow the crack initiation of X80 steel. The effect of the Al-Zn coating on the corrosion fatigue crack initiation is mainly attributed to its physical isolation, cathodic protection and residual prestress while the effect on crack propagation is due to its inhibition of the formation and evolution of secondary cracks. Moreover, according to the test results, a new life prediction model for corrosion fatigue based on the damage evolution law is proposed and the effect of corrosion-fatigue coupling damage in the proposed model is also considered.","Mitochondrial DNA, a Powerful Tool to Decipher Ancient Human Civilization from Domestication to Music, and to Uncover Historical Murder Cases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075917,Cells,2019 05 11,"Mitochondria are unique organelles carrying their own genetic material, independent from that in the nucleus. This review will discuss the nature of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and its levels in the cell, which are the key elements to consider when trying to achieve molecular identification in ancient and degraded samples. mtDNA sequence analysis has been appropriately validated and is a consistent molecular target for the examination of biological evidence encountered in forensic cases-and profiling, in certain conditions-especially for burnt bodies and degraded samples of all types. Exceptional cases and samples will be discussed in this review, such as mtDNA from leather in Beethoven's grand piano, mtDNA in mummies, and solving famous historical criminal cases. In addition, this review will be discussing the use of ancient mtDNA to understand past human diet, to trace historical civilizations and ancient trade routes, and to uncover geographical domestication origins and lineage relationships. In each topic, we will present the power of mtDNA and how, in many cases, no nuclear DNA was left, leaving mitochondrial DNA analysis as a powerful alternative.

However, the degradation features always present different trends of different run-to-failure data. To find a consistent indicator of different data will be helpful to establish a general model and explore the nature of bearings' degradation. In this study, we have found there is a trend of similarity between the energy and complexity features. By using the cointegration test, we found the two kinds of features exhibit a certain degree of cointegration relationship. Fused by the cointegration method, we have obtained a novel health indicator which can depict different run-to-failure data in a unified way. The difference between the energy features and complexity features can be explained by the novel health indicator. The indicator has ""two-stage"" characters. The first stage is the zero-line stage and the second stage is the quickly raise stage, which presents like an exponential function. It is easy to think about using an exponential degradation model to model this indicator. Next, we have compared the indicator to root mean square (RMS) by using the exponential degradation model. It shows that the indicator is more suitable for the exponential degradation model. In this paper, we used eleven run-to-failure data to verify the generality and ""two-stage"" characters of the proposed indicator. The result shows that the novel indicator is general and effective and that it will promote the development of bearings' prognostics.",Association of Infant Feeding Patterns with Taste Preferences in European Children and Adolescents: A Retrospective Latent Profile Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075915,Nutrients,2019 05 11,"The aim was to investigate associations between the duration of infant feeding practices (FP) and taste preferences (TP) in European children and adolescents. A total of 5526 children (6-16 years old) of the I.Family study completed a Food and Beverage Preference Questionnaire to measure their preferences for sweet, fatty and bitter tastes. Mothers retrospectively reported the FPs duration in months: exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), exclusive formula milk feeding (EFMF), combined breastfeeding (BF&FMF) and the age at the introduction of complementary foods (CF). Using logistic regression analyses and latent class analysis (latent profiles of FP and CF were identified), we explored associations between profiles and TP, adjusting for various covariates, including the Healthy Diet Adherence Score (HDAS). A total of 48% of children had short durations of EBF (≤4 months) and BF&FMF (≤6 months) and were introduced to CF early (<6 months). No significant relationship was observed between the single FPs and TP, even when considering common profiles of FP. HDAS was inversely associated with sweet and fatty TP, but positively with bitter TP. Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not observe associations between FP and children's TP later in life. Further studies with higher FP variation and longitudinal design are needed to investigate the causal associations between infant FP and taste preferences later in life."

In conclusion, a single oral of fat-based energy supplement dose at birth did not improve growth, survival, rectal temperature or vitality of low birth weight piglets.",Boron Deficiency Increases Cytosolic Ca2+ Levels Mainly via Ca2+ Influx from the Apoplast in Arabidopsis thaliana Roots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075903,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Boron (B) is a micronutrient for plant development, and its deficiency alters many physiological processes. However, the current knowledge on how plants are able to sense the B-starvation signal is still very limited. Recently, it has been reported that B deprivation induces an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. The aim of this work was to research in Arabidopsis whether [Ca2+]cyt is restored to initial levels when B is resupplied and elucidate whether apoplastic Ca2+ is the major source for B-deficiency-induced rise in [Ca2+]cyt. The use of chemical compounds affecting Ca2+ homeostasis showed that the rise in root [Ca2+]cyt induced by B deficiency was predominantly owed to Ca2+ influx from the apoplast through plasma membrane Ca2+ channels in an IP3-independent manner. Furthermore, B resupply restored the root [Ca2+]cyt. Interestingly, expression levels of genes encoding Ca2+ transporters (ACA10, plasma membrane PIIB-type Ca2+-ATPase; and CAX3, vacuolar cation/proton exchanger) were upregulated by ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and abscisic acid (ABA). The results pointed out that ACA10, and especially CAX3, would play a major role in the restoration of Ca2+ homeostasis after 24 h of B deficiency.",Study of the Effects of Aging Treatment on Astroloy Processed via Hot Isostatic Pressing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075902,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The effect of aging treatment on Astroloy fabricated via hot isostatic pressing and subjected to super-, and sub- solvus solutioning has been investigated. The evolution of hardness and microstructural features were followed after each step of the treatment. Since this alloy is commonly subjected to a double aging treatment at two different temperatures, particular attention was given to the effectiveness of the first aging treatment compared to the second one. Coarsening and modification of the γ' reinforcing system together with carbides formation were made the object of research. The cooling rate used after solutioning treatment was also kept into account. Finally, a model to describe secondary and ternary gamma prime coarsening upon aging treatments is presented.",P2X7 Receptor Indirectly Regulates the JAM-A Protein Content via Modulation of GSK-3β.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075901,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The alveolar epithelial cells represent an important part of the alveolar barrier, which is maintained by tight junction proteins, particularly JAM-A, occludin, and claudin-18, which regulate paracellular permeability. In this study, we report on a strong increase in epithelial JAM-A expression in P2X7 receptor knockout mice when compared to the wildtype. Precision-cut lung slices of wildtype and knockout lungs and immortal epithelial lung E10 cells were treated with bleomycin, the P2X7 receptor inhibitor oxATP, and the agonist BzATP, respectively, to evaluate early changes in JAM-A expression. Biochemical and immunohistochemical data showed evidence for P2X7 receptor-dependent JAM-A expression in vitro. Inhibition of the P2X7 receptor using oxATP increased JAM-A, whereas activation of the receptor decreased the JAM-A protein level. In order to examine the role of GSK-3β in the expression of JAM-A in alveolar epithelial cells, we used lithium chloride for GSK-3β inhibiting experiments, which showed a modulating effect on bleomycin-induced alterations in JAM-A levels. Our data suggest that an increased constitutive JAM-A protein level in P2X7 receptor knockout mice may have a protective effect against bleomycin-induced lung injury. Bleomycin-treated precision-cut lung slices from P2X7 receptor knockout mice responded with a lower increase in mRNA expression of JAM-A than bleomycin-treated precision-cut lung slices from wildtype mice.",FEP Encapsulated Crack-Based Sensor for Measurement in Moisture-Laden Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075900,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Among many flexible mechanosensors, a crack-based sensor inspired by a spider's slit organ has received considerable attention due to its great sensitivity compared to previous strain sensors. The sensor's limitation, however, lies on its vulnerability to stress concentration and the metal layers' delamination. To address this issue of vulnerability, we used fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) as an encapsulation layer on both sides of the sensor. The excellent waterproof and chemical resistance capability of FEP may effectively protect the sensor from damage in water and chemicals while improving the durability against friction.",Comparison of Bi- and Tri-Linear PLS Models for Variable Selection in Metabolomic Time-Series Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075899,Metabolites,2019 05 11,"Metabolomic studies with a time-series design are widely used for discovery and validation of biomarkers. In such studies, changes of metabolic profiles over time under different conditions (e.g., control and intervention) are compared, and metabolites responding differently between the conditions are identified as putative biomarkers. To incorporate time-series information into the variable (biomarker) selection in partial least squares regression (PLS) models, we created PLS models with different combinations of bilinear/trilinear X and group/time response dummy Y. In total, five PLS models were evaluated on two real datasets, and also on simulated datasets with varying characteristics (number of subjects, number of variables, inter-individual variability, intra-individual variability and number of time points). Variables showing specific temporal patterns observed visually and determined statistically were labelled as discriminating variables. Bootstrapped-VIP scores were calculated for variable selection and the variable selection performance of five PLS models were assessed based on their capacity to correctly select the discriminating variables. The results showed that the bilinear PLS model with group × time response as dummy Y provided the highest recall (true positive rate) of 83-95% with high precision, independent of most characteristics of the datasets. Trilinear PLS models tend to select a small number of variables with high precision but relatively high false negative rate (lower power). They are also less affected by the noise compared to bilinear PLS models. In datasets with high inter-individual variability, bilinear PLS models tend to provide higher recall while trilinear models tend to provide higher precision. Overall, we recommend bilinear PLS with group x time response Y for variable selection applications in metabolomics intervention time series studies.",Steroid Metabolites Support Evidence of Autism as a Spectrum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075898,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 11,"Objectives: It is common nowadays to refer to autism as a spectrum. Increased evidence of the involvement of steroid metabolites has been shown by the presence of stronger alterations in Kanner's syndrome compared with Asperger syndrome. Methods: 24 h urine samples were collected from 20 boys with Asperger syndrome, 21 boys with Kanner's syndrome, and identically sized control groups, each matched for age, weight, and height for comprehensive steroid hormone metabolite analysis via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: Higher levels of most steroid metabolites were detected in boys with Kanner's syndrome and Asperger syndrome compared to their matched controls. These differences were more pronounced in affected individuals with Kanner's syndrome versus Asperger syndrome. Furthermore, a specific and unique pattern of alteration of androsterone, etiocholanolone, progesterone, tetrahydrocortisone, and tetrahydrocortisol was identified in boys with Kanner's syndrome and Asperger syndrome. Interestingly, in both matched samples, only androsterone, etiocholanolone, progesterone, tetrahydrocortisone, tetrahydrocortisol, and 5a-tetrahydrocortisol groups were positively correlated. In the Asperger syndrome group, all metabolites showed a positive correlation. In the Kanner's syndrome group, 5-a tetrahydrocortisol with androsterone showed a positive correlation. Conclusions: Due to differences in the level of alteration, the premise that Asperger syndrome is on the mild side of the autism spectrum and that Kanner's syndrome is on the severe side is supported, but alteration patterns yield different phenotypic expressions.",Silicon Amendment Reduces Soil Cd Availability and Cd Uptake of Two Pennisetum Species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075897,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Silicon (Si) plays important roles in alleviating heavy metal stress, but the migrating effects and mechanisms, especially for Pennisetum, are not well studied. In this study, Pennisetum glaucum and Pennisetum glaucum × P. purpureum were used to explore the impacts of Si application on alleviating cadmium (Cd) toxicity and its possible mechanism. Treatments consist of four levels of Cd (0, 10, 50, and 100 mg·kg-1) with or without 2.0 mM Si amendments. Under Cd stress, Si application significantly increased plant biomass and Si content, reduced Cd content, and decreased the enrichment factor in shoots and roots. Si treatment also increased soil pH and soil residual Cd, while reducing available/oxidizable/reducible Cd content in soil at 50 and 100 mg·kg-1 Cd levels, thereby leading to a reduction of the soil's available Cd. These findings indicate that Si application is effective in alleviating Cd phytotoxicity of Pennisetum, mainly through reducing plant Cd uptake and increasing soil pH and Cd immobilization, thereby reducing Cd bioavailability.",Characterisation of Osteopontin in an In Vitro Model of Embryo Implantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075896,Cells,2019 05 11,"At the onset of pregnancy, embryo implantation is initiated by interactions between the endometrial epithelium and the outer trophectoderm cells of the blastocyst. Osteopontin (OPN) is expressed in the endometrium and is implicated in attachment and signalling roles at the embryo-epithelium interface. We have characterised OPN in the human endometrial epithelial Ishikawa cell line using three different monoclonal antibodies, revealing at least nine distinct molecular weight forms and a novel secretory pathway localisation in the apical domain induced by cell organisation into a confluent epithelial layer. Mouse blastocysts co-cultured with Ishikawa cell layers served to model embryo apposition, attachment and initial invasion at implantation. Exogenous OPN attenuated initial, weak embryo attachment to Ishikawa cells but did not affect the attainment of stable attachment. Notably, exogenous OPN inhibited embryonic invasion of the underlying cell layer, and this corresponded with altered expression of transcription factors associated with differentiation from trophectoderm (Gata2) to invasive trophoblast giant cells (Hand1). These data demonstrate the complexity of endometrial OPN forms and suggest that OPN regulates embryonic invasion at implantation by signalling to the trophectoderm.",Photophysical and Electroluminescence Characteristics of Polyfluorene Derivatives with Triphenylamine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075895,Polymers,2019 05 11,"In this work, polymers of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-triphenylamine] with side chains containing: pyrene (C1), diphenyl (C2), naphthalene (C3), and isopropyl (C6) structures were synthesized via a Suzuki coupling reaction. The structures were verified using NMR and cyclic voltammetry measurements provide the HOMO and LUMO of the polymers. The polymer with pyrene (C1) and naphthalene (C3) produced photoluminescence in the green while the polymer with the side chain containing diphenyl (C2) and isopropyl (C6) produce dual emission peaks of blue-green photoluminescence (PL). In order to examine the electroluminescence properties of the polymers, the solutions were spin-coated onto patterned ITO anode, dried, and subsequently coated with an Al cathode layer to form pristine single layer polymer LEDs. The results are compared to a standard PFO sample. The electroluminescence spectra resemble the PL spectra for C1 and C3. The devices of C2, C3, and C6 exhibit voltage-dependent EL. An additional red emission peak was detected for C2 and C6, resulting in spectra with peaks at 435 nm, 490 nm, and 625 nm. The effects of the side chains on the spectral characteristics of the polymer are discussed."

Companies like Samsung, LG, and Apple are launching home appliances that use IoT as a part of their smart home business. Currently, Intelligent Things which combine artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT are being developed. Most of these devices are configured to collect and respond to human behavior (motion, voice, etc.) through built-in sensors. If IoT devices do not ensure high security, personal information could be leaked. This paper describes the IoT security threats that can cause information leakage from a hierarchical viewpoint of cyberspace. In addition, because these smart home-based IoT devices are closely related to human life, considering social damage is a problem. To overcome this, we propose a framework to measure the risk of IoT devices based on security scenarios that can occur in a smart home.",Radiation-Induced Heart Diseases: Protective Effects of Natural Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075882,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 11,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for the majority of deaths worldwide. Radiation-induced heart diseases (RIHD) is one of the side effects following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Exposure could be from various forms such as diagnostic imaging, radiotherapy for cancer treatment, as well as nuclear disasters and nuclear accidents. RIHD is mostly observed after radiotherapy for thoracic malignancies, especially left breast cancer. RIHD may affect the supply of blood to heart muscles, leading to an increase in the risk of heart attacks to irradiated persons. Due to its dose-limiting consequence, RIHD has a negative effect on the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy. Several methods have been proposed for protection against RIHD. In this paper, we review the use of natural products, which have shown promising results for protection against RIHD.","The Mechanism of Action of Ursolic Acid as a Potential Anti-Toxoplasmosis Agent, and Its Immunomodulatory Effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075881,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 11,"This study was performed to investigate the mechanism of action of ursolic acid in terms of anti-Toxoplasma gondii effects, including immunomodulatory effects. We evaluated the anti-T. gondii effects of ursolic acid, and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokines through co-cultured immune cells, as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of T. gondii. The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, particularly rhoptry protein 18, microneme protein 8, and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3, were markedly decreased when T. gondii was treated with ursolic acid, and their expressions were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of NO, ROS, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-β, while reducing the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in T. gondii-infected immune cells. These results demonstrate that ursolic acid not only causes anti-T. gondii activity/action by effectively inhibiting the survival of T. gondii and the subcellular organelles of T. gondii, but also induces specific immunomodulatory effects in T. gondii-infected immune cells. Therefore, this study indicates that ursolic acid can be effectively utilized as a potential candidate agent for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs, and has immunomodulatory activity.",Targeting Protein Kinases to Enhance the Response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075880,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The interaction between programmed cell death protein (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) is one of the main pathways used by some tumors to escape the immune response. In recent years, immunotherapies based on the use of antibodies against PD-1/PD-L1 have been postulated as a great promise for cancer treatment, increasing total survival compared to standard therapy in different tumors. Despite the hopefulness of these results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to such therapy or will end up evolving toward a progressive disease. Besides their role in PD-L1 expression, altered protein kinases in tumor cells can limit the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking therapies at different levels. In this review, we describe the role of kinases that appear most frequently altered in tumor cells and that can be an impediment for the success of immunotherapies as well as the potential utility of protein kinase inhibitors to enhance the response to such treatments.",Predictors of Seniors' Interest in Assistive Applications on Smartphones: Evidence from a Population-Based Survey in Slovenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075879,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Assistive applications (apps) on smartphones could contribute to a better quality of life for seniors living independently at home. At present, there is a lack of empirical evidence of seniors' acceptance of such apps. The Cycle of Technology Acquirement by Independent-Living Seniors (C-TAILS) model was recently proposed for studying the interplay between acceptance factors by integrating the personal, social and technological domains of seniors' daily lives. This study aimed to explore how four groups of factors, clustered in accordance with the C-TAILS model, predict seniors' interest in assistive apps, on a representative sample of the Slovenian population aged 55 years or older. The 617 respondents, who were contacted though a telephone survey, answered a questionnaire about their interest in three groups of assistive apps and four groups of potentially associated acceptance factors. Three linear regression models were used to analyse the association between the factors and the seniors' interest in the three types of assistive apps. Smartphone-related dispositional traits were the strongest predictors across all three models. Among mobile phone usage patterns, smartphone use and the breadth of mobile phone features used were significant factors, while the significance of seniors' personal characteristics and socio-economic conditions varied across the models. Hence, awareness that these factors play different roles in the acceptance of different assistive apps is needed in order to design viable interventions for their acceptance among seniors.",Analysis of Volatile Compounds in Pears by HS-SPME-GC×GC-TOFMS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075878,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Aroma plays an important role in fruit quality and varies among different fruit cultivars. In this study, a sensitive and accurate method based on headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS) was developed to comprehensively compare aroma components of five pear cultivars. In total, 241 volatile compounds were identified and the predominant volatile compounds were esters (101 compounds), followed by alcohols (20 compounds) and aldehydes (28 compounds). The longyuanyangli has the highest relative concentration (838.12 ng/g), while the Packham has the lowest (208.45 ng/g). This study provides a practical method for pear aroma analysis using SPME and GC×GC-TOFMS.",Bioinformatic Analysis of Gene Variants from Gastroschisis Recurrence Identifies Multiple Novel Pathogenetic Pathways: Implication for the Closure of the Ventral Body Wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075877,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"We investigated whether likely pathogenic variants co-segregating with gastroschisis through a family-based approach using bioinformatic analyses were implicated in body wall closure. Gene Ontology (GO)/Panther functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis by String identified several biological networks of highly connected genes in UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A5, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT1A10, AOX1, NOTCH1, HIST1H2BB, RPS3, THBS1, ADCY9, and FGFR4. SVS-PhoRank identified a dominant model in OR10G4 (also as heterozygous de novo), ITIH3, PLEKHG4B, SLC9A3, ITGA2, AOX1, and ALPP, including a recessive model in UGT1A7, UGT1A6, PER2, PTPRD, and UGT1A3. A heterozygous compound model was observed in CDYL, KDM5A, RASGRP1, MYBPC2, PDE4DIP, F5, OBSCN, and UGT1A. These genes were implicated in pathogenetic pathways involving the following GO related categories: xenobiotic, regulation of metabolic process, regulation of cell adhesion, regulation of gene expression, inflammatory response, regulation of vascular development, keratinization, left-right symmetry, epigenetic, ubiquitination, and regulation of protein synthesis. Multiple background modifiers interacting with disease-relevant pathways may regulate gastroschisis susceptibility. Based in our findings and considering the plausibility of the biological pattern of mechanisms and gene network modeling, we suggest that the gastroschisis developmental process may be the consequence of several well-orchestrated biological and molecular mechanisms which could be interacting with gastroschisis predispositions within the first ten weeks of development.","Cell Integration with Electrospun PMMA Nanofibers, Microfibers, Ribbons, and Films: A Microscopy Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075876,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 11,"Tissue engineering requires properly selected geometry and surface properties of the scaffold, to promote in vitro tissue growth. In this study, we obtained three types of electrospun poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) scaffolds-nanofibers, microfibers, and ribbons, as well as spin-coated films. Their morphology was imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and characterized by average surface roughness and water contact angle. PMMA films had a smooth surface with roughness, Ra below 0.3 µm and hydrophilic properties, whereas for the fibers and the ribbons, we observed increased hydrophobicity, with higher surface roughness and fiber diameter. For microfibers, we obtained the highest roughness of 7 µm, therefore, the contact angle was 140°. All PMMA samples were used for the in vitro cell culture study, to verify the cells integration with various designs of scaffolds. The detailed microscopy study revealed that higher surface roughness enhanced cells' attachment and their filopodia length. The 3D structure of PMMA microfibers with an average fiber diameter above 3.5 µm, exhibited the most favorable geometry for cells' ingrowth, whereas, for other structures we observed cells growth only on the surface. The study showed that electrospinning of various scaffolds geometry is able to control cells development that can be adjusted according to the tissue needs in the regeneration processes.",(Epi)genetic Modifications in Myogenic Stem Cells: From Novel Insights to Therapeutic Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075875,Cells,2019 05 11,"The skeletal muscle is considered to be an ideal target for stem cell therapy as it has an inherent regenerative capacity. Upon injury, the satellite cells, muscle stem cells that reside under the basal lamina of the myofibres, start to differentiate in order to reconstitute the myofibres while maintaining the initial stem cell pool. In recent years, it has become more and more evident that epigenetic mechanisms such as histon modifications, DNA methylations and microRNA modulations play a pivatol role in this differentiation process. By understanding the mechanisms behind myogenesis, researchers are able to use this knowledge to enhance the differentiation and engraftment potential of different muscle stem cells. Besides manipulation on an epigenetic level, recent advances in the field of genome-engineering allow site-specific modifications in the genome of these stem cells. Combining epigenetic control of the stem cell fate with the ability to site-specifically correct mutations or add genes for further cell control, can increase the use of stem cells as treatment of muscular dystrophies drastically. In this review, we will discuss the advances that have been made in genome-engineering and the epigenetic regulation of muscle stem cells and how this knowledge can help to get stem cell therapy to its full potential.",Plasticity and Constraints of tRNA Aminoacylation Define Directed Evolution of Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075874,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Genetic incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) has become a powerful tool to enhance existing functions or introduce new ones into proteins through expanded chemistry. This technology relies on the process of nonsense suppression, which is made possible by directing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) to attach an ncAA onto a cognate suppressor tRNA. However, different mechanisms govern aaRS specificity toward its natural amino acid (AA) substrate and hinder the engineering of aaRSs for applications beyond the incorporation of a single l-α-AA. Directed evolution of aaRSs therefore faces two interlinked challenges: the removal of the affinity for cognate AA and improvement of ncAA acylation. Here we review aspects of AA recognition that directly influence the feasibility and success of aaRS engineering toward d- and β-AAs incorporation into proteins in vivo. Emerging directed evolution methods are described and evaluated on the basis of aaRS active site plasticity and its inherent constraints."

Therefore, different stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), are used to model neuroinflammation associated with neurodegeneration. By acting at its receptors, LPS activates various intracellular molecules, which alter the expression of a plethora of inflammatory mediators. These factors, in turn, initiate or contribute to the development of neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, LPS is an important tool for the study of neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, the serotype, route of administration, and number of injections of this toxin induce varied pathological responses. Thus, here, we review the use of LPS in various models of neurodegeneration as well as discuss the neuroinflammatory mechanisms induced by this toxin that could underpin the pathological events linked to the neurodegenerative process.",Parsimonious Scenario for the Emergence of Viroid-Like Replicons De Novo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075860,Viruses,2019 05 11,"Viroids are small, non-coding, circular RNA molecules that infect plants. Different hypotheses for their evolutionary origin have been put forward, such as an early emergence in a precellular RNA World or several de novo independent evolutionary origins in plants. Here, we discuss the plausibility of de novo emergence of viroid-like replicons by giving theoretical support to the likelihood of different steps along a parsimonious evolutionary pathway. While Avsunviroidae-like structures are relatively easy to obtain through evolution of a population of random RNA sequences of fixed length, rod-like structures typical of Pospiviroidae are difficult to fix. Using different quantitative approaches, we evaluated the likelihood that RNA sequences fold into a rod-like structure and bear specific sequence motifs facilitating interactions with other molecules, e.g., RNA polymerases, RNases, and ligases. By means of numerical simulations, we show that circular RNA replicons analogous to Pospiviroidae emerge if evolution is seeded with minimal circular RNAs that grow through the gradual addition of nucleotides. Further, these rod-like replicons often maintain their structure if independent functional modules are acquired that impose selective constraints. The evolutionary scenario we propose here is consistent with the structural and biochemical properties of viroids described to date.",Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 is Associated with a Frequent Exacerbator Phenotype in COPD: A Cross-Sectional Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075857,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory airway disease punctuated by exacerbations (AECOPD).

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)23, a hormone associated with systemic inflammation and altered metabolism is elevated in COPD. However, associations between FGF23 and AECOPD are unknown. In this cross-sectional study, individuals with COPD were enrolled between June 2016 and December 2016. Plasma samples were analyzed for intact FGF23 levels. Logistic regression analyses were used to measure associations between clinical variables, FGF23, and the frequent exacerbator phenotype. Our results showed that FGF23 levels were higher in frequent exacerbators as compared to patients without frequent exacerbations. FGF23 was also independently associated with frequent exacerbations (OR 1.02; 95%CI 1.004-1.04; p = 0.017), after adjusting for age, lung function, smoking, and oxygen use. In summary, FGF23 was associated with the frequent exacerbator phenotype and correlated with number of exacerbations recorded retrospectively and prospectively. Further studies are needed to explore the role of FGF 23 as a possible biomarker for AECOPD to better understand the pathobiology of COPD and to help develop therapeutic targets.",Mechanosynthesis of the Whole Y1-xBixMn1-xFexO3 Perovskite System: Structural Characterization and Study of Phase Transitions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075856,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Perovskite BiFeO3 and YMnO3 are both multiferroic materials with distinctive magnetoelectric coupling phenomena. Owing to this, the Y1-xBix Mn1-xFexO3 solid solution seems to be a promising system, though poorly studied. This is due to the metastable nature of the orthorhombic perovskite phase of YMnO3 at ambient pressure, and to the complexity of obtaining pure rhombohedral phases for BiFeO3-rich compositions. In this work, nanocrystalline powders across the whole perovskite system were prepared for the first time by mechanosynthesis in a high-energy planetary mill, avoiding high pressure and temperature routes. Thermal decomposition temperatures were determined, and structural characterization was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy on thermally treated samples of enhanced crystallinity. Two polymorphic phases with orthorhombic Pnma and rhombohedral R3c h symmetries, and their coexistence over a wide compositional range were found. A gradual evolution of the lattice parameters with the composition was revealed for both phases, which suggests the existence of two continuous solid solutions. Following bibliographic data for BiFeO3, first order ferroic phase transitions were located by differential thermal analysis in compositions with x ≥ 0.9. Furthermore, an orthorhombic-rhombohedral structural evolution across the ferroelectric transition was characterized with temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction.","Effects of Low-Protein Diets and Exogenous Protease on Growth Performance, Carcass Traits, Intestinal Morphology, Cecal Volatile Fatty Acids and Serum Parameters in Broilers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075855,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 11,"Dietary exogenous proteases (ENZ) can be used in poultry production to improve the growth of chickens fed low-protein (LP) diets. We hypothesized that ENZ supplemented in an LP diet would improve growth performance and physiological response in broilers for 8-35 days. To investigate this, we used a 2 × 2 factorial design with crude protein (CP, normal diet (NP) and LP) and ENZ. The LP diet contained low in 1% CP and ca. 8-12% amino acids compared to the NP diet and both NP and LP diets were added without or with (1 g/kg of diet) ENZ. We randomly allocated 720 1-week-old Ross 308 male chicks to 48 pens and experimental diets. At 21 days, dietary ENZ, but not CP, increased (p = 0.007) live body weight. Body weight gain from 8-21 days was affected (p = 0.006) by dietary ENZ, but was not affected (p = 0.210) by CP. The feed conversion ratio was affected by both CP and ENZ during the starter period (p < 0.05), by ENZ (p = 0.034) during the finisher period, and by CP (p < 0.001) during the whole period. However, the interaction between CP and ENZ did not significantly affect growth performance (p > 0.05). Dietary ENZ increased (p = 0.013) the relative weight of liver at 21 days. CP and ENZ affected (p = 0.043) total short-chain fatty acids at 21 days. However, this effect was not seen (p = 0.888) at 35 days. Dietary CP increased (p < 0.05) the serum concentrations of both uric acid and creatinine in broilers. We concluded that dietary ENZ is more beneficial to younger broilers, independent of CP levels, and that its effect was restricted to body weight and the feed conversion ratio.",Reactivity of Different Crystalline Surfaces of C3S During Early Hydration by the Atomistic Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075854,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Early hydration of tricalcium silicate (C3S) has received great attention over the years due to the increased use of composite cement with a reduced number of clinker phases, especially the addition of what should be very reactive C3S to guarantee early strength. Although many mechanisms have been proposed, the dissolution of polygonal C3S at the material interface is not yet fully understood. Over the last decade, computational methods have been developed to describe the reaction in the cementitious system. This paper proposes an atomistic insight into the early hydration and the dissolution mechanism of calcium from different crystalline planes of C3S using reactive force field (ReaxFF) combined with metadynamics (metaD). The reactivity and thermodynamic stability of different crystal planes were calculated from the dissolution profile of calcium during hydration at 298 K. The simulation results, clearly describe the higher reactivity of ( 0 1 ¯ 1 ¯ ), (011), (100), and ( 1 ¯ 00 ) surfaces of C3S due to the strong interaction with the water, whereas, the dissolution profile explains the lower reactivity of ( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 0 ), (110), ( 0 1 ¯ 0 ) and the effect of water tessellation on the (001), (010) planes.",A Premature Stop Codon in RAF1 Is the Priority Candidate Causative Mutation of the Inherited Chicken Wingless-2 Developmental Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075853,Genes,2019 05 11,"The chicken wingless-2 (wg-2) mutation is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, and the resulting phenotype in mutant (wg-2/wg-2) individuals is a developmental syndrome characterized by absent wings, truncated legs, craniofacial as well as skin and feather defects, and kidney malformations. Mapping and genotyping established that the mutation resides within 227 kilobases (kb) of chromosome 12 in a wg-2 congenic inbred line. A capture array was designed to target and sequence the candidate region along with flanking DNA in 24 birds from the line. Many point mutations and insertions or deletions were identified, and analysis of the linked variants indicated a point mutation predicted to cause a premature stop codon in the RAF1 gene. Expression studies were conducted inclusive of all genes in the candidate region. Interestingly, RAF1 transcription was elevated, yet the protein was absent in the mutants relative to normal individuals. RAF1 encodes a protein integral to the Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway controlling cellular proliferation, and notably, human RASopathies are developmental syndromes caused by germline mutations in genes of this pathway. Our work indicates RAF1 as the priority candidate causative gene for wg-2 and provides a new animal model to study an important signaling pathway implicated in limb development, as well as RASopathies.","Molecular Characterization, Bioinformatic Analysis, and Expression Profile of Lin-28 Gene and Its Protein from Arabian Camel (Camelus dromedarius).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075852,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Lin-28 is an RNA-binding protein that is known for its role in promoting the pluripotency of stem cells. In the present study, Arabian camel Lin-28 (cLin-28) cDNA was identified and analyzed. Full length cLin-28 mRNA was obtained using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It was shown to be 715 bp in length, and the open reading frame (ORF) encoded 205 amino acids. The molecular weight and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of the cLin-28 protein were predicted to be 22.389 kDa and 8.50, respectively. Results from the bioinformatics analysis revealed that cLin-28 has two main domains: an N-terminal cold-shock domain (CSD) and a C-terminal pair of retroviral-type Cysteine3Histidine (CCHC) zinc fingers. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis showed that the cLin-28 protein is grouped together Camelus bactrianus and Bos taurus. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that cLin-28 mRNA is highly expressed in the lung, heart, liver, and esophageal tissues. Peptide mass fingerprint-mass spectrometry (PMF-MS) analysis of the purified cLin-28 protein confirmed the identity of this protein. Comparing the modeled 3D structure of cLin-28 protein with the available protein 3D structure of the human Lin-28 protein confirmed the presence of CSD and retroviral-type CCHC zinc fingers, and high similarities were noted between the two structures by using super secondary structure prediction.",Tensile Behaviors of Lap-Spliced Carbon Fiber-Textile Reinforced Mortar Composites Exposed to High Temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075851,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The tensile behaviors of textile-reinforced mortar (TRM) composites made with carbon fiber textile and alumina cement-based mortar were investigated through direct tensile tests. Three different surface treatment details in the lap splice area were used to improve the tensile behaviors of the TRM composites: carbon fiber textile impregnated by epoxy, carbon fiber textile coated with aluminum oxide powder following epoxy impregnation, and carbon fiber textile coated with aluminum oxide powder following both carbon fiber fabric attachment and epoxy impregnation. Three different lap splice lengths were used 180, 200, and 220 mm. In addition, the tensile properties of TRM composites following exposure to high temperature were investigated as well. In this test, TRM test specimens were exposed to two different temperature histories with maximum values of 250 and 350 °C. The results of the test specimens according to the test parameters were analyzed in terms of initial stiffness, cracking strength, corresponding strain at cracking, modulus of elasticity in the cracked stage, peak strength, and ultimate strain. The influence of lap splice length on the tensile behaviors of the TRM composites was analyzed and discussed. The surface treatment in the overlapping region showed ductile behavior and resulted in a significant improvement of the peak strength and ultimate strain over the untreated lap splice textile. Following exposure to high temperature, the TRM composites showed a reduction of tensile responses compared to those cured at room temperature. In addition, a prediction model developed in the previous study was used to predict the tensile behaviors of the lap-spliced carbon fiber-textile reinforced mortar composites exposed to high temperature, and the prediction by the model showed a good agreement with the experimental results.",3-(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)propionic Acid Produced from 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic Acid by Gut Microbiota Improves Host Metabolic Condition in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075850,Nutrients,2019 05 11,"4-Hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (HMCA), a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative, is abundant in fruits and vegetables, including oranges, carrots, rice bran, and coffee beans. Several beneficial effects of HMCA have been reported, including improvement of metabolic abnormalities in animal models and human studies. However, its mitigating effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, and the mechanism underlying these effects, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that dietary HMCA was efficacious against HFD-induced weight gain and hepatic steatosis, and that it improved insulin sensitivity. These metabolic benefits of HMCA were ascribable to 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)propionic acid (HMPA) produced by gut microbiota. Moreover, conversion of HMCA into HMPA was attributable to a wide variety of microbes belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. We further showed that HMPA modulated gut microbes associated with host metabolic homeostasis by increasing the abundance of organisms belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes and reducing the abundance of the phylum Firmicutes. Collectively, these results suggest that HMPA derived from HMCA is metabolically beneficial, and regulates hepatic lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and the gut microbial community. Our results provide insights for the development of functional foods and preventive medicines, based on the microbiota of the intestinal environment, for the prevention of metabolic disorders."

This study aimed to investigate the role of computed tomography (CT) imaging traits in predicting the CIN status of gastric cancer. We screened 443 patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas gastric cancer cohort to filter 40 patients with complete CT imaging and genomic data as the training cohort. CT imaging traits were subjected to logistic regression to select independent predictors for the CIN status. For the validation cohort, we prospectively enrolled 18 gastric cancer patients for CT and tumor genomic analysis. The imaging predictors were tested in the validation cohort using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Thirty patients (75%) in the training cohort and 9 patients (50%) in the validation cohort had CIN subtype gastric cancers. Smaller tumor diameter (p = 0.017) and acute tumor transition angle (p = 0.045) independently predict CIN status in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, acute tumor transition angle demonstrated the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 88.9%, 88.9%, and 88.9%, respectively, and areas under ROC curve of 0.89. In conclusion, this pilot study showed acute tumor transition angle on CT images may predict the CIN status of gastric cancer.",Volcanic Mud Incorporating Paper Sludge as Raw Materials for Lightweight Aggregates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075838,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This study assessed the use of volcanic mud collected from southern Taiwan and the incorporation of paper sludge for manufacturing lightweight aggregate (LWA).

Using volcanic mud and mixed sludge (volcanic mud with added paper sludge) resulted in the successful manufacture of various qualified LWAs with particle density ranging from 973 to 1950 g/cm3, water absorption from 6.2 to 20.0%, and crushing strength from 2.2 to 15.8 MPa.",Routing Protocols for Low Power and Lossy Networks in Internet of Things Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075837,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications has taken the attention of several researchers. In an effort to provide interoperability and IPv6 support for the IoT devices, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed the 6LoWPAN stack. However, the particularities and hardware limitations of networks associated with IoT devices lead to several challenges, mainly for routing protocols. On its stack proposal, IETF standardizes the RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) as the routing protocol for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). RPL is a tree-based proactive routing protocol that creates acyclic graphs among the nodes to allow data exchange. Although widely considered and used by current applications, different recent studies have shown its limitations and drawbacks. Among these, it is possible to highlight the weak support of mobility and P2P traffic, restrictions for multicast transmissions, and lousy adaption for dynamic throughput. Motivated by the presented issues, several new solutions have emerged during recent years. The approaches range from the consideration of different routing metrics to an entirely new solution inspired by other routing protocols. In this context, this work aims to present an extensive survey study about routing solutions for IoT/LLN, not limited to RPL enhancements. In the course of the paper, the routing requirements of LLNs, the initial protocols, and the most recent approaches are presented. The IoT routing enhancements are divided according to its main objectives and then studied individually to point out its most important strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, as the main contribution, this study presents a comprehensive discussion about the considered approaches, identifying the still remaining open issues and suggesting future directions to be recognized by new proposals.",Candida/Staphylococcal Polymicrobial Intra-Abdominal Infection: Pathogenesis and Perspectives for a Novel Form of Trained Innate Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075836,"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 11,"Polymicrobial sepsis is difficult to diagnose and treat and causes significant morbidity and mortality, especially when fungi are involved. In vitro, synergism between Candida albicans and various bacterial species has been described for many years. Our laboratory has developed a murine model of polymicrobial intra-abdominal infection with Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus, demonstrating that polymicrobial infections cause high levels of mortality, while monoinfections do not. By contrast, closely related Candida dubliniensis does not cause synergistic lethality and rather provides protection against lethal polymicrobial infection. This protection is thought to be driven by a novel form of trained innate immunity mediated by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which we are proposing to call ""trained tolerogenic immunity"". MDSC accumulation has been described in patients with sepsis, as well as in in vivo sepsis models. However, clinically, MDSCs are considered detrimental in sepsis, while their role in in vivo models differs depending on the sepsis model and timing. In this review, we will discuss the role of MDSCs in sepsis and infection and summarize our perspectives on their development and function in the spectrum of trained innate immune protection against fungal-bacterial sepsis.",Research on the Preparation and Properties of High Belite Sulphoaluminate Cement (HBSAC) Based on Various Industrial Solid Wastes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075834,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this study, a variety of industrial solid wastes, including petroleum coke desulfurization slag, fly ash and carbide slag with natural resource bauxite, were used as raw materials to prepare high belite suphoaluminate cement, which contains a certain CaSO4 content without adding natural gypsum to the clinker. The sintering temperature, mineral composition, and the physical and mechanical properties of the cement clinkers were investigated. The techniques adopted included a comprehensive thermal analysis (DSC-TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results revealed that it is completely feasible to prepare high belite sulphoaluminate cement with the various industrial solid wastes mentioned above and the utilization rate of the solid wastes is up to 80%. The sintering temperature ranges from 1225 °C to 1350 °C, and the optimal sintering temperature is approximately 1300 °C. The clinkers prepared at 1300 °C set and harden quickly and have a slightly higher water requirement of normal consistency.

Dairy food consumption was measured by the semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Periodontal disease was defined as Community Periodontal Index score ≥3 in more than one of six sextants. Frequent intake of dairy foods (≥7 servings/week) was associated with a 24% lower prevalence of periodontal disease compared with never consumers after adjustment for age, gender, income, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, diabetes mellitus status, calcium intake, tooth brushing frequency, and use of dental floss (Odds ratio (OR)= 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63-0.91, p for trend = 0.052).

The alloys' durability is crucial for their commercial handling and use, and therefore it is required to characterize their surface oxidation behavior and stability at the working temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was utilized to study the surface composition and oxidation of the ZrNiSn alloy at room and elevated temperatures. It was found that during heating in a vacuum, Sn segregates to the surface in order to reduce the surface energy. Exposing the alloy to oxygen resulted mainly in the oxidation of the zirconium to ZrO2, as well as some minor oxidation of Sn. At room temperature, the oxidation to ZrO2 was accompanied by the formation of a thin ZrO layer at the metal-oxide interface. In contrast to TiNiSn, where most of the oxide was formed on the surface due to oxygen-enhanced segregation of Ti, and in the case of ZrNiSn, the formed oxide layer was thinner. Part of the oxide is formed due to Zr segregation to the surface, and in part due to oxygen dissolved into the alloy.",The Serotonin Syndrome: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075831,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"The serotonin syndrome is a medication-induced condition resulting from serotonergic hyperactivity, usually involving antidepressant medications.

The emergence and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted growing attention to the low-cost location scheme, which can respond to a dramatic increasing amount of public infrastructure in smart cities. Various Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based locating systems and noise mitigation methods have been developed. However, most of them are impractical for built environments in large areas due to their high cost, computational complexity, and low noise detection capability. In this paper, we proposed a novel noise mitigation solution integrating the low-cost localization scheme with one mobile RFID reader. We designed a filter algorithm to remove the influence of abnormal data. Inspired the sampling concept, a more carefully parameters calibration was carried out for noise data sampling to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To achieve robust noise detection results, we employed the powerful noise detection capability of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for the localization and noise mitigation in a large area.

On the other hand, in highly polarized cells like neurons, the cytoskeleton carries out its role not only in axons but also has a fundamental role in dendrite plasticity and in the organization of soma. In the literature, there are many studies focused on the antineoplastic-induced alteration of microtubule organization (and consequently, fast axonal transport defects) while very few studies have investigated the effect of the different classes of drugs on microfilaments, intermediate filaments and associated proteins. Therefore, in this review, we will focus on: (1) Highlighting the fundamental role of the crosstalk among the three filamentous subsystems and (2) investigating pivotal cytoskeleton-associated proteins."

Being employed: Informal (aOR = 0.479, p < 0.0001), and Formal (aOR = 0.475, p = 0.0008) was associated with lower age- and sex-adjusted odds of developing T2DM-related complications while having T2DM for 5-10 years (aOR = 1.550, p = 0.0009) and more than 10 years (aOR = 2.755, p < 0.0001) was associated with increased odds of developing complications. Conclusions: Microvascular complication is the most predominant among T2DM in Kumasi, Ghana. The most prevalent T2DM-related microvascular complication in Kumasi, Ghana is neuropathy. Sexual dysfunction is associated with male compared to female T2DM patients. Being employed reduces the chance of developing T2DM-related complications while increasing DM duration increases the risk of complications.",Introducing the New COPD Pocket Consultant Guide App: Can A Digital Approach Improve Care?

However, due to interdependence among material surface and bulk properties, the best material to fabricate such adhesives is still unknown. In this work, we analyzed eleven commercially available silicone elastomers to evaluate their use as flat and microstructured adhesives to address multiple material related questions that may impact the choice of the 'best' material for microstructured dry adhesives. To illustrate the applicability of the measured properties to modeling microstructured surfaces, we use stalk-shaped microstructures, whose contact mechanics are well understood. We demonstrate that there is no correlation between the adhesion strength of flat and microstructured adhesives; while bulk dissipation is the most important factor influencing the adhesion strength of flat elastomers, after microstructurization, interface toughness becomes more important. Therefore, microstructured elastomers loaded with high surface energy additives may demonstrate higher adhesion than their flat counterparts. We also compare the adhesion of flat and microstructured silicone elastomers on rough substrates. In this case, we show that while flat elastomer adhesion decreases with increasing substrate roughness, microstructured silicone adhesion actually increases with increasing roughness up to 0.19 [Formula: see text]m. This is the first time an increase in adhesion strength on rough surfaces is reported for materials stiffer than 1.0 MPa.",Neurosurgical ablative procedures for intractable cancer pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075782,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVECancer patients suffering from severe refractory pain may benefit from targeted ablative neurosurgical procedures aimed to disconnect pain pathways in the spinal cord or the brain. These patients often present with a plethora of medical problems requiring careful consideration before surgical interventions. The authors present their experience at an interdisciplinary clinic aimed to facilitate appropriate patient selection for neurosurgical procedures, and the outcome of these interventions.METHODSThis study was a retrospective review of all patients who underwent neurosurgical interventions for cancer pain in the authors' hospital between March 2015 and April 2018. All patients had advanced metastatic cancer with limited life expectancy and suffered from intractable oncological pain.RESULTSSixty patients underwent surgery during the study period. Forty-three patients with localized pain underwent disconnection of the spinal pain pathways: 34 percutaneous-cervical and 5 open-thoracic cordotomies, 2 stereotactic mesencephalotomies, and 2 midline myelotomies. Thirty-nine of 42 patients (93%) who completed these procedures had excellent immediate postoperative pain relief. At 1 month the improvement was maintained in 30/36 patients (83%) available for follow-up. There was 1 case of hemiparesis.Twenty patients with diffuse pain underwent stereotactic cingulotomy. Nineteen of these patients reported substantial pain relief immediately after the operation. At 1 month good pain relief was maintained in 13/17 patients (76%) available for follow-up, and good pain relief was also found at 3 months in 7/11 patients (64%). There was no major morbidity or mortality.CONCLUSIONSWith careful patient selection and tailoring of the appropriate procedure to the patient's pain syndrome, the authors' experience indicates that neurosurgical procedures are safe and effective in alleviating suffering in patients with intractable cancer pain.",Accumulated thermal dose in MRI-guided focused ultrasound for essential tremor: repeated sonications with low focal temperatures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075781,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVEThe object of this study was to correlate lesion size with accumulated thermal dose (ATD) in transcranial MRI-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatments of essential tremor with focal temperatures limited to 50°C-54°C.METHODSSeventy-five patients with medically refractory essential tremor underwent MRgFUS thalamotomy at the authors' institution. Intraoperative MR thermometry was performed to measure the induced temperature and thermal dose distributions (proton resonance frequency shift coefficient = -0.00909 ppm/°C). In 19 patients, it was not possible to raise the focal temperature above 54°C because of unfavorable skull characteristics and/or the pain associated with cranial heating. In this patient subset, sonications with focal temperatures between 50°C and 54°C were repeated (5.1 ± 1.5, mean ± standard deviation) to accumulate a sufficient thermal dose for lesion formation. The ATD profile sizes (17, 40, 100, 200, and 240 cumulative equivalent minutes at 43°C [CEM43]) calculated by combining axial MR thermometry data from individual sonications were correlated with the corresponding lesion sizes measured on axial T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MR images acquired 1 day posttreatment. Manual corrections were applied to the MR thermometry data prior to thermal dose accumulation to compensate for off-resonance-induced spatial-shifting artifacts.RESULTSMean lesion sizes measured on T2w MRI (5.0 ± 1.4 mm) were, on average, 28% larger than those measured on T1w MRI (3.9 ± 1.4 mm). The ATD thresholds found to provide the best correlation with lesion sizes measured on T2w and T1w MRI were 100 CEM43 (regression slope = 0.97, R2 = 0.66) and 200 CEM43 (regression slope = 0.98, R2 = 0.89), respectively, consistent with data from a previous study of MRgFUS thalamotomy via repeated sonications at higher focal temperatures (≥ 55°C). Two-way linear mixed-effects analysis revealed that dominant tremor subscores on the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) were statistically different from baseline at 3 months and 1 year posttreatment in both low-temperature (50°C-54°C) and high-temperature (≥ 55°C) patient cohorts. No significant fixed effect on the dominant tremor scores was found for the temperature cohort factor.CONCLUSIONSIn transcranial MRgFUS thalamotomy for essential tremor, repeated sonications with focal temperatures between 50°C and 54°C can accumulate a sufficient thermal dose to generate lesions for clinically relevant tremor suppression up to 1 year posttreatment, and the ATD can be used to predict the size of the resulting ablation zones measured on MRI. These data will serve to guide future clinical MRgFUS brain procedures, particularly those in which focal temperatures are limited to below 55°C."

Long-term CDA outcomes continue to be evaluated. Here, the authors present outcomes at 10 years postoperatively for the single-level CDA arm of an IDE study (postapproval study).METHODSThe primary endpoint was overall success, a composite variable composed of five criteria: 1) Neck Disability Index score improvement ≥ 15 points; 2) maintenance or improvement in neurological status; 3) no decline in anterior or posterior functional spinal unit (FSU) height of more than 2 mm compared to 6 weeks postoperatively; 4) no serious adverse event (AE) caused by the implant or the implant and the surgical procedure; and 5) no additional surgery classified as a failure. Additional safety and effectiveness measures included numeric rating scales for neck pain and arm pain, SF-36 quality-of-life physical and mental components, patient satisfaction, range of motion, and AEs.RESULTSFrom the reported assessments at 7 years postoperatively to the 10-year postoperative follow-up, the scores for all patient-reported outcomes, rate of overall success (without FSU), and proportion of patients at least maintaining their neurological function remained stable for the CDA group. Nine patients had secondary surgery at the index level, increasing the secondary surgery cumulative rate from 6.6% to 10.3%.

Spine,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVEThis proof-of-concept study was conducted to determine whether negative-pressure wound therapy, through the use of incisional vacuum-assisted closure (VAC), is associated with a reduction in surgical site infections (SSIs) when compared to standard wound dressings in patients undergoing open posterior spinal fusion who have a high risk of infection.METHODSA total of 64 patients were examined; 21 patients received incisional VAC application (VAC group) versus 43 diagnosis-matched patients who received standard wound dressings (control group). Patients in the VAC group were prospectively enrolled in a consecutive series between March 2013 and March 2014 if they met the following diagnostic criteria for high risk of infection: posterior open surgery across the cervicothoracic junction; thoracic kyphosis due to metastatic disease; high-energy trauma; or multilevel revision reconstructive surgery. Patients in the VAC group also met one or more comorbidity criteria, including body mass index ≥ 35 or < 18.5, diabetes, previous radiation at surgical site, chemotherapy, steroid use, bedridden state, large traumatic soft-tissue disruption, or immunocompromised state. Consecutive patients in the control group were retrospectively selected from the previous year by the same high-risk infection diagnostic criteria as the VAC group. All surgeries were conducted by the same surgeon at a single site. The primary outcome was SSI. All patients had 1 year of follow-up after their surgery. Baseline demographics, intraoperative parameters, and postoperative wound infection rates were compared between groups.RESULTSPatient demographics including underlying comorbidities were similar, with the exception that VAC-treated patients were malnourished (p = 0.020). VAC-treated patients underwent longer surgeries (p < 0.001) and required more postoperative ICU admissions (p = 0.039). The median length of hospital stay was not different between groups. In total, 9 control patients (21%) developed an SSI, versus 2 VAC-treated patients (10%).CONCLUSIONSPatients in this cohort were selected to have an increased risk of infection; accordingly, the rate of SSI was high. However, negative-pressure wound therapy through VAC application to the postoperative incision resulted in a 50% reduction in SSI. No adverse effects were noted secondary to VAC application. The preliminary data confirm the authors' proof of concept and strongly support the need for a prospective randomized trial.","Biomechanical implications of unilateral facetectomy, unilateral facetectomy plus partial contralateral facetectomy, and complete bilateral facetectomy in minimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075766,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVEMinimally invasive transforaminal interbody fusion techniques vary among surgeons. One decision point is whether to perform a unilateral facetectomy (UF), a unilateral facetectomy plus partial contralateral facetectomy (UF/PF), or a complete bilateral facetectomy (CBF). The authors therefore compared the biomechanical benefits of all 3 types of facetectomies to determine which approach produces improved biomechanical outcomes.METHODSSeven human cadaveric specimens (L3-S1) were potted and prepped for UF, with full facet removal, hemilaminectomy, discectomy, and pedicle screw placement. After distraction, a fixed interbody spacer was placed, and compression was performed. A final fixation configuration was performed by locking the rods across the screws posteriorly with bilateral compression. Final lordosis angle and change and foraminal height were measured, and standard nondestructive flexibility tests were performed to assess intervertebral range of motion (ROM) and compressive stiffness. The same procedure was followed for UF/PF and CBF in all 7 specimens.RESULTSAll 3 conditions demonstrated similar ROM and compressive stiffness. No statistically significant differences occurred with distraction, but CBF demonstrated significantly greater change than UF in mean foraminal height after bilateral posterior compression (1.90 ± 0.62 vs 1.00 ± 0.45 mm, respectively, p = 0.04). With compression, the CBF demonstrated significantly greater mean ROM than the UF (2.82° ± 0.83° vs 2.170° ± 1.10°, p = 0.007). The final lordosis angle was greatest with CBF (3.74° ± 0.70°) and lowest with UF (2.68° ± 1.28°). This finding was statistically significant across all 3 conditions (p ≤ 0.04).CONCLUSIONSAlthough UF/PF and CBF may require slightly more time and effort and incur more risk than UF, the potential improvement in sagittal balance may be worthwhile for select patients.",Cervical disc arthroplasty for less-mobile discs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075765,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVEThe published clinical trials of cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) have unanimously demonstrated the success of preservation of motion (average 7°-9°) at the index level for up to 10 years postoperatively. The inclusion criteria in these trials usually required patients to have evident mobility at the level to be treated (≥ 2° on lateral flexion-extension radiographs) prior to the surgery. Although the mean range of motion (ROM) remained similar after CDA, it was unclear in these trials if patients with less preoperative ROM would have different outcomes than patients with more ROM.METHODSA series of consecutive patients who underwent CDA at the level of C5-6 were followed up and retrospectively reviewed. The indications for surgery were medically refractory cervical radiculopathy, myelopathy, or both, caused by cervical disc herniation or spondylosis. All patients were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a less-mobile group, which consisted of those patients who had an ROM of ≤ 5° at C5-6 preoperatively, or a more-mobile group, which consisted of patients whose ROM at C5-6 was > 5° preoperatively. Clinical outcomes, including visual analog scale, Neck Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association Scale scores, were evaluated at each time point. Radiological outcomes were also assessed.RESULTSA total of 60 patients who had follow-up for more than 2 years were analyzed. There were 27 patients in the less-mobile group (mean preoperative ROM 3.0°) and 33 in the more-mobile group (mean ROM 11.7°). The 2 groups were similar in demographics, including age, sex, diabetes, and cigarette smoking. Both groups had significant improvements in clinical outcomes, with no significant differences between the 2 groups. However, the radiological evaluations demonstrated remarkable differences. The less-mobile group had a greater increase in ΔROM than the more-mobile group (ΔROM 5.5° vs 0.1°, p = 0.001), though the less-mobile group still had less segmental mobility (ROM 8.5° vs 11.7°, p = 0.04). The rates of complications were similar in both groups.CONCLUSIONSPreoperative segmental mobility did not alter the clinical outcomes of CDA. The preoperatively less-mobile (ROM ≤ 5°) discs had similar clinical improvements and greater increase of segmental mobility (ΔROM), but remained less mobile, than the preoperatively more-mobile (ROM > 5°) discs at 2 years postoperatively.",Intracranial aneurysms in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075764,Journal of neurosurgery.

This systematic review was performed to identify and assess the distinct characteristics of IAs in patients with TSC.METHODSThe authors searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for publications describing cases of TSC and IA reported before August 7, 2018. They also report 2 cases of IAs in TSC patients treated at their own institution.RESULTSThirty-three TSC patients with a total of 42 IAs were included in this review. Three individuals presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The IAs were large or giant in 57.1% and fusiform in 45.2% of the cases. Most of the IAs (61.9%, 26 of 42) originated from the internal carotid artery. There was a higher prevalence of pediatric cases (66.7%) and male patients (63.6%, 21 of 32 individuals with known sex) among the collected series.CONCLUSIONSTSC patients with IAs are characterized with a higher proportion of large/giant and fusiform IAs and young age, suggesting rapid aneurysmal growth. Furthermore, there is a distinct location pattern of IAs and an inverse sex ratio than in the healthy population. Large population-based patient registers are required to improve the understanding of epidemiology and pathophysiology of IA formation in TSC.",Complications and 3-month outcomes of children with hydrocephalus treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in Malawi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075763,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVEHydrocephalus is the most common pediatric neurosurgical condition, with a high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries. Untreated, hydrocephalus leads to neurological disability or death. The epidemiology and outcomes of hydrocephalus treated by ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts in Sub-Saharan Africa are not well defined and vary by region. The aim of the present study was to examine the mortality and morbidity rates and predictors of mortality in children treated by VP shunt placement for hydrocephalus at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi.METHODSThis is a prospective study of 100 consecutive children presenting with hydrocephalus who were treated with VP shunt placement from January 2015 to August 2017. Demographics, nutritional status, maternal characteristics, developmental delay, shunt complications, readmissions, and in-hospital and 3-month mortality data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of death within 3 months of surgery.RESULTSOverall, 46% of participants were female, with an average age of 5.4 ± 3.7 months at the time of surgery. The majority of patients were term deliveries (87.8%) and were not malnourished (72.9%). Only 10.8% of children were diagnosed with meningitis before admission. In-hospital and 3-month mortality rates were 5.5% and 32.1%, respectively. The only significant association with mortality was maternal age, with older maternal age demonstrating decreased odds of 3-month mortality (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8-1.0, p = 0.045).CONCLUSIONSSurgical management of hydrocephalus with VP shunts portends a high mortality rate in Malawi. The association of younger maternal age with mortality is likely a proxy for social determinants, which appear to contribute as much to mortality as patient factors. VP shunting is inadequate as a sole surgical management of hydrocephalus in resource-limited settings.",Evaluation of head impact exposure measured from youth football game plays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075762,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVEThere is a growing body of literature informing efforts to improve the safety of football; however, research relating on-field activity to head impacts in youth football is limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare head impact exposure (HIE) measured in game plays among 3 youth football teams.METHODSHead impact and video data were collected from athletes (ages 10-13 years) participating on 3 youth football teams. Video analysis was performed to verify head impacts and assign each to a specific play type. Each play was categorized as a down, punt, kickoff, field goal, or false start. Kickoffs and punts were classified as special teams. Downs were classified as running, passing, or other. HIE was quantified by play type in terms of mean, median, and 95th percentile linear and rotational acceleration. Mixed-effects models were used to assess differences in acceleration among play types. Contact occurring on special teams plays was evaluated using a standardized video abstraction form.RESULTSA total of 3003 head impacts over 27.5 games were analyzed and paired with detailed video coding of plays. Most head impacts were attributed to running (79.6%), followed by passing (14.0%), and special teams (6.4%) plays. The 95th percentile linear acceleration measured during each play type was 52.6g, 50.7g, and 65.5g, respectively. Special teams had significantly greater mean linear acceleration than running and passing plays (both p = 0.03). The most common kick result on special teams was a deep kick, of which 85% were attempted to be returned. No special teams plays resulted in a touchback, and one resulted in a fair catch. One-third of all special teams plays and 92% of all nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball.CONCLUSIONSThe results demonstrate a trend toward higher head impact magnitudes on special teams than for running and passing plays, but a greater number of impacts were measured during running plays. Deep kicks were most common on special teams, and many returned and nonreturned kicks resulted in athletes diving toward the ball. These results support policy changes to youth special teams plays, including modifying the yard line the ball is kicked from and coaching proper return technique. Further investigation into biomechanical exposure measured during game impact scenarios is needed to inform policy relevant to the youth level.",Factors influencing patient satisfaction after adult scoliosis and spinal deformity surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075761,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,2019 05 10,"OBJECTIVEAchieving high patient satisfaction with management is often one of the goals after adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. However, literature on associated factors and their correlations with patient satisfaction is limited. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and radiographic factors independently correlated with patient satisfaction in terms of management at 2 years after surgery.METHODSA multicenter prospective database of ASD surgery was retrospectively reviewed. The demographics, complications, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) subdomains, and radiographic parameters were examined to determine their correlation coefficients with the Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire (SRS-22R) satisfaction scores at 2 years (Sat-2y score). Subsequently, factors determined to be independently associated with low satisfaction (Sat-2y score ≤ 4.0) were used to construct 2 types of multivariate models: one with 2-year data and the other with improvement (score at 2 years - score at baseline) data.RESULTSA total of 422 patients who underwent ASD surgery (mean age 53.1 years) were enrolled. All HRQOL subdomains and several coronal and sagittal radiographic parameters had significantly improved 2 years after surgery. The Sat-2y score was strongly correlated with the SRS-22R self-image (SI)/appearance subdomain (r = 0.64), followed by moderate correlation with subdomains related to standing (r = 0.53), body pain (r = 0.49-0.55), and function (r = 0.41-0.55) at 2 years. Conversely, the correlation between radiographic or demographic parameters with Sat-2y score was weak (r < 0.4). Multivariate analysis to eliminate confounding factors revealed that a worse Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score for standing (≥ 2 points; OR 4.48) and pain intensity (≥ 2 points; OR 2.07), SRS-22R SI/appearance subdomain (< 3 points; OR 2.70) at 2 years, and a greater sagittal vertical axis (SVA) (> 5 cm; OR 2.68) at 2 years were independent related factors for low satisfaction. According to the other model, a lower improvement in ODI for standing (< 30%; OR 2.68), SRS-22R pain (< 50%; OR 3.25) and SI/appearance (< 50%; OR 2.18) subdomains, and an inadequate restoration of the SVA from baseline (< 2 cm; OR 3.16) were associated with low satisfaction.CONCLUSIONSSelf-image, pain, standing difficulty, and sagittal alignment restoration may be useful goals in improving patient satisfaction with management at 2 years after ASD surgery. Surgeons and other medical providers have to take care of these factors to prevent low satisfaction.",Diabetes care in pediatric refugees from Africa or Middle East - experiences from Germany and Austria based on real-world data from the DPV registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075760,European journal of endocrinology,2019 05 10,"With increasing migration to Europe, diabetes diagnosis and treatment of refugees became challenging.

In particular, geometry plays an important role in increasing the strength, toughness and damage tolerance among different species. Here, we investigate the role of the shape of the opening crack behind the crack tip as the crack propagates along the interface. In particular, we studied the shape of the interface behind the crack tip for different amplitude-to-wavelength aspect ratios with two analytical models and compared with finite element simulations through the J-integral. Additionally, we explore the role of material length scale by investigating the relationship between the geometrical characteristic lengths and the emerging material length scale using a finite element-based cohesive zone model. The results suggest that geometrical toughening is influenced by a size effect, but it is bounded between two extreme conditions.",Synthesis and evaluation of Quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives as potential antibacterial agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075745,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 06 11,"New quinoline-3-carbonitrile derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their potential antibacterial behavior. Compounds were obtained by a one-pot multicomponent reaction of appropriate aldehyde, ethyl cyanoacetate, 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalin-1-one and ammonium acetate. Structures were established by different physical and spectroscopic techniques. The molecular geometry, vibration frequencies, HOMO-LUMO energy gap, molecular hardness (g), ionization energy (IE), electron affinity (EA), and total energy of these compounds was assessed by DFT studies, employing DFT/RB3LYP method. Preliminary antibacterial studies using both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains and cytotoxicity studies on mammalian cells revealed their promising antibacterial activity, without causing any severe host toxicity. All the compounds (QD1-QD5) in this study obeyed the 'Lipinski's Rule of Five' with logP values <5 and HBA <10, hydrogen bond donor's <5. The most active compound QD4 showed good interaction with the target DNA gyrase; target enzyme for quinoline class of antibiotics, which reveals its probable mechanism of action. Results of all these studies establish these compounds as important scaffolds with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with no off-target toxicity. Having lower band gap energy of 3.40 eV and a low lying LUMO for compound QD4, this compound may be a valuable starting point for the development of quinoline-3-carbonitrile based broad-spectrum antibacterial agents.",Nimesulide analogues: From anti-inflammatory to antitumor agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075744,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 06 11,"Nimesulide is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug possessing analgesic and antipyretic properties.

The MTX was conjugated to albumin via covalent bond. Next, this synthesized prodrug loaded with CUR. Afterward, the formulations were evaluated for physical and chemical properties by DLS, TEM, FTIR, UV/Vis, DSC analysis, in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo biocompatibility studies. Furthermore, the drug loading and release study were evaluated. Proteinase K enzyme was used to break amid bond between MTX and BSA and also amidic bonds in BSA structure. Administration of up to 2000 mg/kg of BSA to healthy animals was non-toxic and all treated mice were still alive after 24 h.

Furthermore, this derivative 9g recorded higher anti-inflammatory activity than celecoxib which showed 43%, 43% and 54% inhibition after 1, 3 and 5h, sequentially. Moreover, the target derivatives 9a-l demonstrated moderate to high potent inhibitory action towards COX-2 (IC50 = 0.87-3.78 µM), in particular, the derivatives 9e (IC50 = 0.92 µM), 9g (IC50 = 0.87 µM) and 9k (IC50 = 1.02 µM) recorded higher COX-2 inhibitory effect than the selective COX-2 inhibitor drug celecoxib (IC50 = 1.11 µM). The in vivo potent compounds (9e, 9g and 9k) caused variable ulceration effect (ulcer index = 5-12.25) in comparison to that of celecoxib (ulcer index = 3).

AD-1 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation without significant host toxicity in vivo, and has excellent development potential as a new anti-cancer agent. This study was designed systematically to explore the metabolic pathway of ginseng sapogenins. The metabolism of drugs in the body is a complex biotransformation process where drugs are structurally modified to different molecules (metabolites) through various metabolizing enzymes. The compounds responsible for the effects of orally administered ginseng are believed to be metabolites produced in the gastrointestinal tract, so understanding the metabolism of the drug candidate can help to optimize its pharmacokinetics. In this study, faeces samples were collected and extracted after oral administration of AD-1. The 16 metabolites of AD-1 were isolated and identified for the first time with various chromatographic techniques, including semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry; of these 16 metabolites, 10 were novel compounds. We first discovered the biotransformation of dammarane-type sapogenins into oleanane-type sapogenins in rats and found a series of metabolites that changed, mainly at C-25 and C-29. This study provides new ideas for the metabolic pathway of ginseng sapogenins. The isolated compounds were screened for their effect on the viability and proliferation against cancer cell lines (Human A549, MCF-7, HELA, HO-8901 and U87). The discovery of novel active metabolites 3β,12β,21α,22β-Hydroxy-24-norolean-12-ene (M6) may lead to a new or improved drug candidate. For one, M6 could inhibit the growth of all the tested cancer cells. Among the tested cell lines, M6 exhibited the most remarkable inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer HO-8901 cells, with IC50 value of 2.086 μM. On this basis, we studied the anticancer mechanisms of M6. The results indicated that the pro-apoptotic feature of M6 acts via a mitochondrial pathway. Our results indicated that M6 exhibited a higher inhibitory effect on cancer-cell proliferation than AD-1 by inducing cell apoptosis. Our work provides data for future investigations on the metabolic mechanism of AD-1 in vivo and the potential for future research on developing a new drug.","Synthesis, computational molecular docking analysis and effectiveness on tyrosinase inhibition of kojic acid derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075740,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 06 11,"Tyrosinase inhibitors have become increasingly important as whitening agents and for the treatment of pigmentary disorders. In this study, the synthesis of kojic acid derivatives having 2-substituted-3-hydroxy-6-hyroxymethyl/chloromethyl/methyl/morpholinomethylpiperidinyl- methyl/pyrrolidinylmethyl-4H-pyran-4-one structure (compounds 1-30) with inhibitory effects on tyrosinase enzyme were described. One-pot Mannich reaction was carried out by using kojic acid/chlorokojic acid/allomaltol and substituted benzylpiperazine derivatives in presence of formaline. Subsequently, cyclic amine (morpholine, piperidine and pyrrolidine) derivatives of the 6th-position of chlorokojic acid were obtained with nucleophilic substitutions in basic medium. The structures of new compounds were identified by FT-IR, 1H- and 13C NMR, ESI-MS and elemental analysis data. The potential mushroom tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the compounds were evaluated by the spectrophotometric method using l-DOPA as a substrate and kojic acid as the control agent. The potential inhibitory activity was also investigated in silico using molecular docking simulation method. Tyrosinase inhibitory action was significantly more efficacious for several compounds (IC50: 86.2-362.1 µM) than kojic acid (IC50: 418.2). Compound 3 bearing 3,4-dichlorobenzyl piperazine moiety was proven to have the highest inhibitory activity. The results of docking studies showed that according to the predicted conformation of compound 3 in the enzyme binding site, hydroxymethyl group provides a metal complex with copper ions and enzyme. Thus, this interaction explain the high inhibitory activities of the compounds 1, 3 and 4 possessing hydroxymethyl substituent supporting the mushroom assay results with docking studies. In accordance with the results, it is suggested that Mannich bases of kojic acid bearing substituted benzyl piperazine groups (compounds 1, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14, 23, 24, 28, and 29) could be promising antityrosinase agents. Additionally, considering the relationship between tyrosinase inhibitory activity results and molecular docking, a new tyrosinase inhibition mechanism can be proposed.",Association of calpain and calpastatin activity to postmortem myofibrillar protein degradation and sarcoplasmic proteome changes in bovine Longissiumus lumborum and Triceps brachii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075739,Meat science,2019 05 28,"The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which calpastatin (CASN) variants (based on two chromatographic peaks; CASN-P1 and CASN-P2) explain variation in μ-calpain autolysis, protein degradation, and changes in the sarcoplasmic proteome observed during postmortem aging of beef. The Longissimus lumborum (LL) and Triceps brachii (TB) muscles were obtained from six crossbred steers and samples prepared from day 0, 1 and 7 postmortem (pm). The decline of CASN activity during aging was due to decrease of CASN-P2 in both muscles. The CASN-P2:μ-calpain ratio at day 0 was greater for TB, which presented lesser calpain autolysis, myofibrillar protein degradation, and fewer sarcoplasmic proteome changes during aging.

It remains a major challenge how to enhance anti-drug efficacy and reduce side effects of anti-cancer drugs. Herein, we report a self-assembled nanoplatform (FDEP NPs) by integration of doxorubicin (DOX) and epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) with the help of coordination between Fe3+ ions and polyphenols. The EGCG from FDEP NPs could inhibit the expression of carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) protein and thereby inhibit the doxorubicinol (DOXOL) generation from DOX both in vitro and in vivo, thus the efficacy of DOX to cancerous cells is improved significantly. More importantly, the FDEP NPs could reduce cardiac toxicity and the DOX mediated toxicity to blood cells due to the repression of DOXOL production. Moreover, the blood half-life of FDEP NPs is longer than 23 h as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of biodistribution of radiolabelled NPs and HPLC measurement of plasma level of DOX, ensuring high tumor accumulation of FDEP NPs by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The FDEP NPs also exhibited much improved antitumor effect over free drugs.

We previously demonstrated a unique host-guest macromer (HGM) approach to prepare mechanically resilient, self-healing and injectable supramolecular gelatin hydrogels free of chemical crosslinking. In this work, we show that compared with conventional hydrogels our supramolecular gelatin hydrogels mediate more sustained release of small molecular (kartogenin) and proteinaceous (TGF-β1) chondrogenic agents, leading to enhanced chondrogenesis of the encapsulated human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, the supramolecular nature of our hydrogels allows injection of the pre-fabricated hydrogels containing the encapsulated hBMSCs and chondrogenic agents, and our data show that the injection process has little negative impact on the viability and chondrogenesis of the encapsulated cells and subsequent neocartilage development. Furthermore, the stem cell-laden supramolecular hydrogels administered via injection through a needle effectively promote the regeneration of both hyaline cartilage and subchondral bone in the rat osteochondral defect model. These results demonstrate that our supramolecular HGM hydrogels are promising delivery biomaterials of therapeutic agents and cells for cartilage repair via minimally invasive procedures. This unique capability of injecting cell-laden hydrogels to target sites will greatly facilitate stem cell therapies.",A controlled study of the efficacy and safety of tandospirone citrate combined with escitalopram in the treatment of vascular depression: A pilot randomized controlled trial at a single-center in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075722,Journal of psychiatric research,2019 06 03,"Vascular depression can respond poorly to antidepressants.

The tandospirone + escitalopram group had higher MMSE scores than that in the escitalopram group at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.01). All AEs were mild, and the rates were comparable between groups. Augmentation of escitalopram with tandospirone accelerates the onset of anti-depressive and anxiolytic effects and improves cognitive function in patients with vascular depression and anxiety.",Rapid sequential detection of Hg2+ and biothiols by a probe DNA-MOF hybrid sensory system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075721,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2019 06 11,"A one-dimensional (1D) metal-organic framework (MOF) of [Cu(Cdcbp)(H2O)2·2H2O]n (1, H3CdcbpBr = 3-carboxyl-(3,5-dicarboxybenzyl)-pyridinium bromide) has been synthesized and characterized. MOF 1 features a cationic Cu2+ center, conjugated tricarboxylate ligand bearing positively charged pyridinium and uncoordinated carboxylate groups within its skeleton. These features enable MOF 1 to tightly adsorb thymine rich (T-rich) single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) probe labeled with carboxyfluorescein (FAM) (denote as P-DNA) through π-stacking, electrostatic interactions and/or hydrogen bonding to give a hybrid complex (denote as P-DNA@1), and quenches its fluorescence via a photo-induced electron transfer (PET) process. The formed P-DNA@1 hybrid can thus function as a sensing platform for the detection of Hg2+, driven by the formation of hairpin-like double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA@Hg2+) with a T-Hg-T coordination motif, and subsequently dissociated into the solution due to its more rigid nature than ss-DNA, leading to the recovery of FAM fluorescence. In the presence of biothiols, including cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH), the strong coordination interaction between Hg2+ and the mercapto function serves to sequestrate the Hg2+ from the ds-DNA@Hg2+ duplex. The released ss-DNA, in turn, are re-adsorbed by MOF 1, leading to the formation of the initial P-DNA@1 state with fluorescence quenching. As such, P-DNA@1 detects Hg2+ and biothiols Cys/Hcy/GSH in sequence with detection limits of (2.3 ± 0.8) nM and (29.6 ± 0.1) nM/(19.8 ± 0.5) nM/(10.2 ± 0.1) nM. The sensing process is efficient and selective with instantaneous response time. The detection mechanism was further validated by circular dichroism (CD), and simulation studies using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) package.",Inhibition of Na+/K+- and Ca2+-ATPase activities by phosphotetradecavanadate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075720,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2019 06 11,"Polyoxometalates (POMs) are promising inorganic inhibitors for P-type ATPases. The experimental models used to study the effects of POMs on these ATPases are usually in vitro models using vesicles from several membrane sources. Very recently, some polyoxotungstates, such as the Dawson anion [P2W18O62]6-, were shown to be potent P-type ATPase inhibitors; being active in vitro as well as in ex-vivo. In the present study we broaden the spectrum of highly active inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase from basal membrane of epithelial skin to the bi-capped Keggin-type anion phosphotetradecavanadate Cs5.6H3.4PV14O42 (PV14) and we confront the data with activity of other commonly encountered polyoxovanadates, decavanadate (V10) and monovanadate (V1). The X-ray crystal structure of PV14 was solved and contains two trans-bicapped α-Keggin anions HxPV14O42(9-x)-. The anion is built up from the classical Keggin structure [(PO4)@(V12O36)] capped by two [VO] units. PV14 (10 μM) exhibited higher ex-vivo inhibitory effect on Na+/K+-ATPase (78%) than was observed at the same concentrations of V10 (66%) or V1 (33%). Moreover, PV14 is also a potent in vitro inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase activity (IC50 5 μM) exhibiting stronger inhibition than the previously reported activities for V10 (15 μM) and V1 (80 μM). Putting it all together, when compared both P-typye ATPases it is suggested that PV14 exibited a high potential to act as an in vivo inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase associated with chloride secretion.",Effect of the point mutation H54N on the ferroxidase process of Rana catesbeiana H' ferritin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075719,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2019 06 11,"Human H and Rana catesbeiana H' subunits in vertebrate ferritin protein cages catalyze the Fe(II) oxidation by molecular oxygen and promote the ferric oxide biomineral synthesis. By depositing iron biomineral, ferritins also prevent potentially toxic reactions products from Fe(II)-based Fenton chemistry. Recent work from our laboratory was aimed to describe the iron pathways within ferritin, from entrance into the cage to the ferroxidase site, and to understand the role played by amino-acid residues in iron trafficking and catalysis. Our approach exploits anomalous X-ray diffraction from ferritin crystals, exposed to a ferrous salt, to track transient iron binding sites along the path towards a well-defined di-iron site where they get oxidized by oxygen. Coupling structure determination with solution kinetic measurements on selected variants, allows validating the role played by key residues on the catalytic iron oxidation. Our previous studies on H' ferritin indicated the regulatory role played by His54, and by its human counterpart Gln58, on guiding Fe(II) ions to the catalytic site. Here, we have investigated the effects induced by substituting the wild type His54 with Asn54, having different iron coordination properties. We have obtained a series of atomic-resolution crystal structures that provide time-dependent snapshots of iron bound at different locations in the H' ferritin H54N variant. The comparison with H' ferritin and H' ferritin H54Q variant leads to identify a new iron binding site. Our kinetic and structural data support the role of H' ferritin residue 54 in regulating the access of Fe(II) ions to the catalytic site.","Identification of a potential tissue-specific biomarker cathepsin L-like gene from the planarian Dugesia japonica: Molecular cloning, characterization, and expression in response to heavy metal exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075718,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"Heavy metal pollution is a global health issue affecting people worldwide, and the exploration of sensitive biomarkers to assess the toxicity of heavy metals is an important work for researchers. Cathepsin L, role as a tissue-specific biomarker to assess the biological effects of environmental pollutants, has not received much attention. In this work, the full-length cDNA of cathepsin L gene from the planarian Dugesia japonica (designated DjCatL) was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. The cDNA sequence of DjCatL is 1161 bp, which encodes a protein of 346 amino acids with a molecular weight of 39.03 kDa. Sequence analysis revealed that DjCatL contains highly conserved ERF/WNIN, GNFD, and GCXGG motifs, which are the features of the cathepsin L protein family. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) results revealed that the transcripts of DjCatL are specifically distributed in the intestinal system, suggesting that this gene is related to food digestion in planarians. Both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and WISH results revealed that the transcriptional levels of DjCatL are inhibited significantly by heavy metal (Cd2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+) exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we proposed that cathepsin L can be used as a tissue-specific biomarker to assess the heavy metal pollution in the aquatic environment.","Simultaneous mitigation of aluminum, salinity and drought stress in Lactuca sativa growth via formulated plant growth promoting Rhodotorula mucilaginosa CAM4.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075717,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"In the present study, a potent Aluminum (Al) resistant yeast strain CAM4 was isolated from rhizosphere soil of Rubus geoides, grown in acidic Andisols and identified as Rhodotorula mucilaginosa by 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The strain CAM4 was selected in terms of abiotic stress tolerance to Al, salinity and drought with multiple plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. Besides, strain CAM4 also exhibited Al removal efficiency (80-88%) from the culture medium even under combined stresses of salinity and drought. The sawdust-based formulation of strain CAM4 (sawdust-molasses 5%-PEG 1%-strain CAM4) showed higher cell viability of up to 24 weeks (8.54 log CFU g-1). Inoculation of formulated strain CAM4 significantly enhanced the various morphological and biochemical characters of Lactuca sativa grown under abiotic stress conditions. The formulated strain CAM4 also reduced the accumulation of Al in L. sativa as well that conferring Al tolerance to the plants. The study concludes that strain CAM4 could be used as a biofertilizer for healthy and safe crop production in soils, with Al toxicity as well as combined salt and drought stresses."

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is efficacious for both OCD and two of its most common comorbid conditions, anxiety and depression. Therefore, treating OCD may yield secondary benefits for anxiety and depressive symptomatology. This study examined whether anxiety and/or depression symptoms declined over the course of OCD treatment and, if so, whether improvements were secondary to reductions in OCD severity, impairment, and/or global treatment response. The sample consisted of 137 youths who received 12 sessions of manualized CBT and were assessed by independent evaluators. Mixed models analysis indicated that youth-reported anxiety and depression symptoms decreased in a linear fashion over the course of CBT, however these changes were not linked to specific improvements in OCD severity or impairment but to global ratings of treatment response. Results indicate that for youth with OCD, CBT may offer benefit for secondary anxiety and depression symptoms distinct from changes in primary symptoms. Understanding the mechanisms underlying carryover in CBT techniques is important for furthering transdiagnostic and/or treatment-sequencing strategies to address co-occurring anxiety and depression symptoms in pediatric OCD.","Photodegradation of the novel brominated flame retardant 2,4,6-Tris-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine in solvent system: Kinetics, photolysis products and pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075705,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"In this study the direct and indirect photolysis of the novel brominated flame retardant 2,4,6-Tris-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine (TTBP-TAZ) in an organic solvent mixture (60:30:10, ACN:MeOH:THF) under UV-(C) and simulated sunlight irradiation was investigated, and the formed photo-transformation products were identified for the first time. TTBP-TAZ was almost completely degraded within 10 min under UV-(C) irradiation. Due to the fast degradation no specific kinetic order could be observed. In comparison, the reaction under simulated sunlight irradiation was much slower and thus, the kinetic first-order could be determined. The observed photolysis rate constant k as well as the half-life time t1/2 were estimated to be k = (0.0163 ± 0.0002) h-1 and t1/2 = 42.3 h, respectively. The addition of 2-propanol and hydrogen peroxide to investigate the influence of indirect photolysis under UV-(C) irradiation causes no influence on the degradation of TTBP-TAZ. Nevertheless, the removal of TTBP-TAZ under UV-(C) and simulated sunlight without additional chemicals (except solvent) indicates that the direct photolysis plays a significant role in the degradation mechanism of TTBP-TAZ. In both irradiation experiments, TTBP-TAZ was quantitatively degraded that involve the formation of previously unknown PTPs. Overall, two main PTPs were determined when irradiated with UV-(C) and eight sequential debromination products were observed when irradiated by simulated sunlight. These were determined by HPLC-DAD and - MS/(MS), respectively. Based on the chosen experimental conditions the consecutive debromination as well as photo-Fries rearrangement was confirmed as the main degradation pathway by high resolution mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction.",Kinetics of chlorate formation during ozonation of aqueous chloride solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075704,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"Chlorate ion ClO3- is formed as a result of the complex chemical interaction of ozone with chloride ion in aqueous solution. In neutral and basic solutions, chlorate is the main product. In acid solutions, the main product is molecular chlorine Cl2, and the yield of chlorate is 50-100 times lower. Dependencies have been studied of chlorate formation rate on significant experimental factors: concentrations of initial substances, ozone and chloride ion, acidity (pH), ionic strength and temperature of the reaction solution. The kinetic laws of chlorate generation have been established, and the expressions are given for rate constants of chlorate formation as functions of temperature and ionic strength. When tert-butanol is added to the reaction system, the formation of chlorate ceases, which is an evidence of the crucial role of free radical reactions in this process.",BPA activates EGFR and ERK1/2 through PPARγ to increase expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein in human cumulus granulosa cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075703,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"Bisphenol A (BPA) negatively affects steroid production in human luteinized granulosa cells (GC). This study was designed to address two important questions: (1) whether BPA exerts the same disruptive effect in human cumulus granulosa cells (hCGC) and (2) to reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the BPA's action on steroidogenesis. We used cultured hCGC since these cells exert the properties of GC from early antral follicles. Results showed that BPA at 100 μM decreased estradiol level and CYP19A1 mRNA, but increased progesterone production, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) mRNA expression after 48 h. Shorter (6 h) exposure to BPA elevated PPARγ mRNA level in hCGC. Addition of ERK1/2 (U0126), EGFR (AG1478) and PPARγ (GW9662) inhibitors prevented the BPA-induced STAR and PPARγ mRNA expression. Western blot analysis showed that BPA induced a rapid EGFR and ERK1/2 activation. The BPA-induced EGFR phosphorylation was prevented by addition of the PPARγ inhibitor, whereas the BPA-induced ERK1/2 activation was prevented by addition of the EGFR or PPARγ inhibitor. These data show that BPA increases the progesterone and decreases the estradiol biosynthetic pathway in hCGC. Augmentation of the progesterone biosynthetic pathway is mediated through the PPARγ-dependent activation of EGFR and ERK1/2, leading to increased expression of STAR mRNA.","Comparison of emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants from the combustion of biomass and coal in modern and old-type boilers used for residential heating in the Czech Republic, Central Europe.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075702,Chemosphere,2019 05 27,"The chemical composition of emissions from old-type (an overfire boiler, a boiler with down-draft combustion) and modern-type (an automatic and a gasification boiler) boilers was compared. The boilers were operated with different fuels (brown and hard coal, wet and dry wood, wood pellets and brown coal briquettes) with reduced output (40-60%). The emissions were characterized by the contents of gaseous components (NOx, SO2, CO, CO2, OGC); and particulate organic compounds (alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, saccharides), including organic markers (monosaccharide anhydrides, diterpenoids, methoxyphenols, hopanes), which are used for source apportionment of particulate matter in ambient air. In general, emissions of the products of incomplete combustion (CO, particles, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) were higher from the combustion of solid fuels in old-type boilers than from that in modern-type boilers. The modern-type (especially automatic) boilers were the most environmentally friendly. The highest concentrations of particulate matter (81.6-89.4 g kg-1) and particulate organic compounds (sum of PAHs: 225-275 mg kg-1) including organic markers were found in emissions from old-type (overfire) boilers, especially with the combustion of brown and hard coal. Characteristic ratios of selected organic compounds/markers applied for source identification were calculated. Computed characteristic ratios for monosaccharide anhydrides (biomass combustion) agreed with values in the literature. Homohopane indexes, frequently used for identification of coal combustion, and other characteristic ratios for PAHs, were different from the literature data. In our opinion, characteristic ratios for PAHs are not suitable for use in source apportionment.",Corrective osteotomy of distal radius malunion after IIIB open fracture: Palmar approach - Case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075701,International journal of surgery case reports,2019 05 29,"Despite the fact that distal radius fractures are the most common, open fractures are relatively uncommon.

Understanding how this flexibility is implemented is necessary for a complete accounting of analogical processes. The structure mapping theory of analogy addresses this issue by invoking re-representation-an online transformation of conceptually similar relational content that reveals potential partial identity matches between predicates. Despite the critical importance of re-representation to structure mapping, very little empirical work has validated the psychological reality of this mechanism, with the existing evidence being no more than suggestive. The present work investigates the likelihood of re-representation across two experiments using a novel change detection task. The resultant findings demonstrate precise evidence of representational change in relational content of analogs. Experiment 2 further explores the relationship between lower-order relational similarity and the likelihood of re-representation.",Inorganic arsenic exposure and neuropsychological development of children of 4-5 years of age living in Spain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075694,Environmental research,2019 06 10,"Early-life exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) may adversely impact health later in life. To date, evidence of iAs adverse effects on children's neurodevelopment comes mainly from populations highly exposed to contaminated water with conflicting results. Little is known about those effects among populations with low iAs exposure from food intake. We investigated the cross-sectional association between exposure to iAs and neurodevelopment scores among children living in Spain whose main route of exposure was diet. Arsenic species concentrations in urine from 400 children was determined, and the sum of urinary iAs, dimethylarsinic acid, and monomethylarsonic acid was used to estimate iAs exposure. The McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities was used to assess children's neuropsychological development at about 4-5 years of age. The median (interquartile range) of children's sum of urinary iAs, MMA, and DMA was 4.85 (2.74-7.54) μg/L, and in adjusted linear regression analyses the natural logarithm transformed concentrations showed an inverse association with children's motor functions (β, [95% confidence interval]; global scores (-2.29, [-3.95, -0.63])), gross scores (-1.92, [-3.52, -0.31]) and fine scores (-1.54, [-3.06, -0.03]). In stratified analyses by sex, negative associations were observed with the scores in the quantitative index (-2.59, [-5.36, 0.17]) and working memory function (-2.56, [-5.36, 0.24]) only in boys. Our study suggests that relatively low iAs exposure may impair children's neuropsychological development and that sex-related differences may be present in susceptibility to iAs related effects; however, our findings should be interpreted with caution given the possibility of residual confounding.",A systematic assessment of carcinogenicity of chemicals in hydraulic-fracturing fluids and flowback water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075693,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,Thousands of chemicals exist in hydraulic-fracturing (HF) fluids and wastewater from unconventional oil gas development.

It is characterized by recurrent nocturnal episodes of headache that periodically awaken the sleeping patient and usually occur in the elderly. This review aimed to describe the clinical features of the HH cases published in the literature from 1988 to 2018. Based on literature search in the major medical databases (LiLacs, SciELO, Bireme, Medline, Embase, Current Contents, Scopus, EBSCO and PubMed), we have analyzed the case reports on HH that have been published from 1988 to 2018. We described 343 adults (69.0% women and 31.0% men) and 5 children (3 girls and 2 boys) diagnosed with HH. Average age for adults and children was, respectively, 58.0 ± 13.1 years (ranging from 15 to 85 years) and 9 years (ranging from 7 to 11 years). The diagnosis was made 7.6 ± 14.2 years (range 0.1 to 39 years) after onset of headache. Pain occurred during nocturnal sleep (94.8%), with an average duration of 90 min, bilaterally located (55.5%), having a dull character (74.4%), and moderate intensity (61.5%).

Amphiphilic chitosan was self-assembled to load QCT as nanomicelles by a low-cost and inorganic solvent procedure. Both the encapsulation efficiencies (EE) and drug-loading rates (DL) increased when increasing the grafting rate of DA. There was a bursting release of QCT for the QCT-loaded nanomicelles (CS-DA-NAC-QNMs) from 0 to 8 h, and then the release rate decreased gradually. After releasing for 72 h, the final cumulative release percentages were more than 40%.

The mixtures of soil components were prepared to reflect the composition of the real anthroposol sample, determined by X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), total organic carbon (TOC) measurement and extraction methods. The effect of different initial Cr(VI) concentrations (2×10-2, 5×10-4, 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6M), background electrolyte (10-3, 10-2, and 10-1M KNO3), pH values (3-9), and sorbate/sorbent ratios (2g/L - 20g/L) were investigated. Maghemite and ferrihydrite were confirmed to be the main phases controlling Cr(VI) adsorption with increasing Cr(VI) concentration. Humic acids were primarily responsible for Cr(VI) reduction, especially at low pH values. The reduction of Cr(VI) was also proved in case of illite and kaolinite by XAS and isotopic analyses. Illite revealed higher reduction capacity in comparison with kaolinite based on XAS measurements. Chromium isotopic fractionation, resulting from Cr(VI) reduction, was the highest in the case of humic acids, followed by kaolinite and illite. However, a dissolution of intrinsic Cr originally present within kaolinite and illite might affect the final Cr isotopic composition of the supernatants due to its different Cr isotopic signature. In general, the combination of three different approaches was confirmed to offer more comprehensive information about Cr(VI) adsorption and/or reduction in soils. Detailed studies using soil mixtures can help to predict how the soil components affect Cr(VI) behavior in natural soils and possibly could improve the environmental remediation processes.",Automated virtual reality exposure therapy for spider phobia vs. in-vivo one-session treatment: A randomized non-inferiority trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075675,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 05 27,"This study compared the efficacy of a technician-assisted single-session virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for the treatment of spider phobia featuring low-cost consumer-available hardware and novel automated software to gold-standard in-vivo one-session treatment (OST), using a parallel group randomized non-inferiority design. Method Participants (N = 100) were randomized to VRET and OST arms. Assessors blinded to treatment allocation evaluated participants at pre- and post-treatment as well follow-up (3 and 12 months) using a behavioral approach test (BAT) and self-rated fear of spider, anxiety, depression and quality-of-life scales. A maximum post-treatment difference of 2-points on the BAT qualified as non-inferiority margin. Results Linear mixed models noted large, significant reductions in behavioral avoidance and self-reported fear in both groups at post-treatment, with VRET approaching the strong treatment benefits of OST over time. Non-inferiority was identified at 3- and 12- months follow-up but was significantly worse until 12-months. There was no significant difference on a questionnaire measuring negative effects. Conclusions Automated VRET efficaciously reduced spider phobia symptoms in the short-term and was non-inferior to in-vivo exposure therapy in the long-term. VRET effectiveness trials are warranted to evaluate real-world benefits and non-specific therapeutic factors accruing from the presence of a technician during treatment.

The structural characterization revealed that the NiFe2O4 particles synthesized with a modified co-precipitation method have a very narrow size distribution with a 4.4 nm magnetic core and 15 nm hydrodynamic diameters, with relatively small fraction of agglomerates. The as-prepared particles presented superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature. The in vitro hyperthermia experiments, performed in ac-field conditions under human tolerable limits, showed that the suspensions of the synthesized nanoparticles exhibit a maximum specific absorption rate (SAR) value of 11 W/g. The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry measurements indicated the suspensions of NiFe2O4 have a transverse-to-longitudinal relaxivity ratio r2/r1 greater than two, as required for superparamagnetic MRI contrast agents. On the basis of the parameters obtained from the magnetic measurements, by comparing the relevant theoretical models with the experimental results, we found that the presence of agglomerates, and particularly the interactions within the agglomerated nanoparticles, caused a significant increase in the hyperthermia and MRI efficiencies. On the other hand, from an applicative point of view, both the MRI contrast enhancement and the heating capabilities allow the simultaneous use of nickelferrites in diagnostic and therapeutic applications as theranostic agents.",Electrospun CuO-ZnO nanohybrid: Tuning the nanostructure for improved amperometric detection of hydrogen peroxide as a non-enzymatic sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075673,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 21,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a by-product of some biochemical processes which is catalyzed by enzymes such as glucose oxidase (GOx), cholesterol oxidase (ChoOx), etc and its overproduction in living cells can trigger cancer growth and various diseases. Therefore, H2O2 sensing is of great importance in the determination of diseases as well as industries and environmental health plans. We produced ZnO-CuO nanofibers by electrospinning method for non-enzymatic electrochemical H2O2 sensing. The sensing properties of the carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified with ZnO (0.3 wt%)/CuO (0.7 wt%) nanofibers (named as ZnO3-CuO7) for detection of H2O2 were explored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH ∼ 7.4 solution. The ZnO3-CuO7 nanofiber exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance and the highest electrocatalytic performance among other modified electrodes for detection of H2O2 and considered as an optimized sample. The effect of scan rate and H2O2 concentration in the reduction process were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the mechanism for the electrochemical reaction of H2O2 at the surface of the optimized electrode was studied. The diffusion coefficient of H2O2 and the catalytic rate constant were evaluated by chronoamperometry as 1.65 × 10-5 cm2 s-1 and 6 × 103 cm3 mol-1 s-1, respectively. Furthermore, amperometric detection of H2O2 with a low detection limit of 2.4 µM and a wide linear range of 3 to 530 µM were obtained. Meanwhile, the optimized electrode displayed no recognizable response towards some biomolecules such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, dopamine and glucose. The obtained results confirmed that the modified electrode shows high sensitivity and selectivity as a H2O2 biosensor with improved reproducibility and stability.",Direct Z-scheme heterostructure of p-CuAl2O4/n-Bi2WO6 composite nanofibers for efficient overall water splitting and photodegradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075672,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 21,"Constructing heterostructures can facilitate photoinduced charge separation, leading to enhanced photocatalytic performance. However, spatial separation of charge carriers in traditional type II heterojunctions is at the expense of their redox ability. In this paper, well-designed direct Z-scheme systems (ZSS) of p-CuAl2O4/n-Bi2WO6 composite nanofibers with uniform non-woven web nanostructure was built by electrospinning technique and solvothermal reactions. The formation mechanism of the ZSS and the charge migration pathway is investigated in detail. Results show that as-prepared composite nanofibers exhibit desirable photocatalytic performance for overall water splitting due to its stronger redox power and efficient charge separation. Meantime, it shows great activity for photodegradation of various organic pollutant models (RhB, MO, 4-NP), which is 1 order of magnitude higher than the single-component CuAl2O4 and Bi2WO6. Furthermore, the composite nanofibers exhibit well separable properties by natural sedimentation because of its ultra-long and non-woven web nanostructure. The paper explores CuAl2O4 and its Z-scheme heterostructures in water splitting for the first time, which may highlight its new applications.",Health-related quality of life of breast cancer patients after accelerated partial breast irradiation using intraoperative or external beam radiotherapy technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075670,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019 06 14,To compare health-related quality of life (HRQL) in elderly breast cancer patients between two types of Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation: intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and external beam APBI (EB-APBI).,New biomarkers of human papillomavirus infection in epidermodysplasia verruciformis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075668,Annals of diagnostic pathology,2019 05 22,"The cause of epidermodysplasia verruciformis is infection by human papillomavirus, usually types 5 or 8, and it exhibits a high potential for malignant transformation. The diagnostic histologic features of epidermodysplasia verruciformis are not always present and can be mimicked by non-viral diseases. The purpose of this study was to interrogate such lesions for new potential biomarkers to aid in the diagnostic accuracy. HPV DNA was high copy and localized to the upper half of the lesion in cells with cytologic features that included perinuclear halos, blue-grey cytoplasm, and hyper/parakeratosis. Serial section analyses demonstrated that there was increased expression of importin-β, exportin-5, Mcl1, p16, Ki67 and PDL1 in 13/13 epidermodysplasia verruciformis lesions. Each of these proteins localized primarily to the less differentiated cells in the parabasal aspect of the lesion. Only Ki67 and exportin-5 were expressed in the normal epithelia, though much less so, in 13/13 aged matched controls. It is concluded that the host response to HPV 5/8 infection in epidermodysplasia verruciformis includes the up regulation of several proteins including p16, Ki67, importin-β, exportin-5, Mcl1, and PDL1. Thus, these proteins may serve as new biomarkers of this disease that can aid in cases that are equivocal for epidermodysplasia verruciformis on histologic examination."

B, Biology",2019 06 03,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer uses photosensitizers (PS), a light source and oxygen to generate high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that exert a cytotoxic action on tumor cells. Recently, it has been shown that mixed non-symmetrical diaryl porphyrins, with two different pendants, are more photodynamically active than symmetrical diaryl porphyrins. In the present study, we investigate the in vitro photodynamic effects of four novel non-symmetrical diaryl porphyrins, two of which bear one pentafluoro-phenyl and one bromo-alkyl (apolar) pendant, whereas the two others bear one pentafluoro-phenyl and one cationic pyridine pendant. The four compounds were tested in a small panel of human cancer cell lines, and their photodynamic activities were compared with that of m-THPC (Foscan), currently the most successful PS approved for clinical use in cancer PDT. The results of the cytotoxicity studies indicate that the two molecules bearing the cationic pendant are more potent in vitro than those with the apolar pendant, and that they are as potent as Foscan. To gain further insights into the mechanism of PS-induced phototoxicity, induction of apoptotic, autophagic and necrotic cell death, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated in cancer cells following exposure to the PSs and irradiation. The effect of the PSs on the migratory activity of the cells was also assessed. The data obtained from this work support a greater potency of diaryl porphyrins with a positive charge in inducing cell death, as compared to those with the bromo-alkyl pendant; most importantly, some of these novel compounds exhibit features that might make them superior to the clinically approved PS Foscan.",Eye movement tracking in pediatric obsessive compulsive disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075652,Asian journal of psychiatry,2019 06 11,"Till date researchers have elucidated the neurobiological substrates in OCD using methods like neuroimaging. However, a potential biomarker is still elusive. The present study is an attempt to identify a potential biomarker in pediatric OCD using eye tracking. The present study measured pro-saccade and anti-saccade parameters in 36 cases of pediatric OCD and 31 healthy controls. There was no significant difference between cases and controls in the error rate, peak velocity, position gain and latency measures in both pro-saccade and anti-saccade eye tracking tasks. With age, anti-saccades become slower in velocity, faster in response and more accurate irrespective of disorder status of the child. Pro-saccades also show a similar effect that is less prominent than anti-saccades. Gain measures more significantly vary with age in children with OCD than the controls, whereas latency measures positively correlated with age in children with OCD as opposed to being negatively correlated in the controls. Findings of this study do not support any of the eye tracking measures as putative diagnostic bio-markers in OCD. However, latency and gain parameters across different age groups in anti-saccade tasks need to be explored in future studies.",Assessing the attitudes of medical students towards psychiatry: A new paradigm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075651,Asian journal of psychiatry,2019 06 11,"Gauging the probability that medical students will select psychiatry as a career is a challenge, especially in Saudi Arabia, where the profession of psychiatry has still to gain ground.

Seizures were induced in experimental rats by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of CGP35348 (0.64 μmol in 3 μL) for three consecutive days; control rats received no injection. Rats were first trained to criterion on an open radial arm maze (RAM) with 4 of the 8 arms baited, then received seizure and control treatment, and tested again on the RAM during the first week (days 1-5) and fourth week (days 22-29) after the last injection. An initial i.c.v.

The K90 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) has a tetrasaccharide repeat (K90 unit), which begins with d-GlcpNAc and contains Pse5Ac7Ac. The higher sugar was cleaved by mild acid hydrolysis of the CPS, and structures of the initial and modified polysaccharides were established by 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. K90 contains α-d-Galp-(1 → 6)-d-GlcpNAc and α-d-GlcpNAc-(1 → 3)-d-GlcpNAc fragments, and formation of these glycosidic linkages is catalysed respectively by Gtr14 and Gtr15. The gtr14 and gtr15 genes occur in several A. baumannii KL gene clusters, including KL5 and KL7 that carry itrA2 rather than itrA3. As ItrA2 introduces d-GalpNAc rather than d-GlcpNAc as the first monosaccharide, Gtr15 can transfer d-GlcpNAc to either of these amino sugars, suggesting that this enzyme has relaxed specificity. Consequently, the third, novel glycosyltransferase, Gtr163, forms the β-(2 → 3) linkage between Pse5Ac7Ac and d-Galp. Wzy polymerases encoded by KL90 and KL7 are 54% identical and form the same linkage between the K units to give branched polysaccharides with the same main chain but different disaccharide side chains, β-Pse5Ac7Ac-(2 → 3)-d-Galp in K90 and α-Leg5Ac7Ac-(2 → 6)-d-Galp in K7."

In this study, we prepared a series of halogen-free and biocompatible choline-fatty-acid-based ILs with different chain lengths and degrees of saturation, and we then investigated their micellar properties in aqueous solutions. Characterization of the synthesized surface-active ILs (SAILs) was performed by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and elemental analysis. The surface-active properties of the SAILs were investigated by tensiometry, conductometry, and dynamic light scattering measurements. The critical micelle concentration of the SAILs was found to be 2-4 times lower than those of conventional surfactants. The thermodynamic properties of micellization (ΔG0m, ΔH0m, and ΔS0m) indicate that the micellization process of the SAILs is spontaneous, stable, and entropy-driven at room temperature. The cytotoxicity of the SAILs was evaluated using mammalian cell line NIH 3T3. Importantly, [Cho][Ole] shows lower toxicity than the analogous ILs with conventional surfactants.

NTETD was examined as a corrosion inhibitor for low carbon steel in 15% HCl solution using weight loss, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), linear polarization (LPR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDAX), atomic force spectroscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. It was found that, the optimum concentration of NTETD is 300 mg/L. With this concentration, inhibition efficiency above 93% is achievable. Results from PDP show that, NTETD acted as a mixed type corrosion inhibitor but with principal effect on cathodic corrosion half reactions. The calculated value of the adsorption-desorption equilibrium constant (1.015 × 103) reveals a strong bonding between NTETD molecules and the steel surface. The EDAX, FTIR, and XPS results confirm the adsorption of NTETD molecules on the steel surface.

The synthesized catalysts were characterized by XRD, XPS, HRTEM, FESEM-EDX mapping and N2 adsorption-desorption. The results showed that the crystal unit cell of Fe3O4 was enlarged due to the implantation of small amount of Cu(I) into the Fe3O4 structure (Fe2.85Cu0.15O4). With increased Cu content, the catalyst was dominated with Cu2O and the Fe3O4 phase disappeared, the catalytic performance of Fe-Cu bimetal oxide became worse. The Cu(I)-Fe3O4/C composite was enriched with Fe(II), Fe(III) and Cu(I) sites. The prepared Cu-Fe bimetal oxide/C composite exhibited higher specific TOF and oxidation efficiency E on carbamazepine oxidation than Fe2.85Cu0.15O4 and Fe3O4. The enhanced catalytic reactivity was attributed to the synergetic effect of surface Fe and Cu species on the H2O2 activation. The dissolved metals induced catalytic reaction at pH 4.5-8.1 was ignorable. Thus, the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 by Cu-Fe3O4/C at near neutral pH was controlled by interface reactions.

Bile salts play an important role in the solubilisation of poorly soluble compounds in the gastrointestinal tract (gut) prior to absorption. When a poorly water-soluble drug is delivered using a hydrophilic polymer based solid dispersion oral formulation, it is still unclear whether there are any polymer-bile salt interactions, which may influence the drug dissolution and solubilisation. This study, using two widely used hydrophilic model polymers, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and polyvynilpirrolidone (PVP), and sodium taurocholate (NaTC) as the model bile salt, aims to investigate the interactions between the polymers and bile salts in simulated fed state (FeSSIF) and fasted state (FaSSIF) gut fluids. The nature of the interactions was characterised using a range of NMR techniques. The results revealed that the aggregation behaviour of NaTC in FaSSIF and FeSSIF is much more complex than in water. The addition of hydrophilic polymers led to the occurrences of NaTC-HPMC and NaTC-PVP aggregation. For both systems, pH and ionic strength strongly influenced the aggregation behavior, while the ion type played a less significant role. The outcome of this study enriched the understanding of the aggregation behaviour of bile salts and typical hydrophilic pharmaceutical polymers in bio-relevant media. Due to the high surface-activity of the bile salts and their ability to interact with polymers, such aggregation behaviour is expected to play a role in drug solubilisation in the gut when the drug is delivered by hydrophilic polymer based dispersions.",Microstructure evolution during nano-emulsification by NMR and microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075628,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 27,"Microstructure evolution in emulsions as a function of composition is of great interest but fundamentals have not yet been fully elucidated.

Panels of healthy research dogs consumed kibbled weight loss diets with either a l round (pastille) or a cross shape. Two panels ('small-size' panel, dogs<10 kg 'all-size' panel, dogs with a range of sizes) were used to determine palatability (study 1), whilst a third panel ('consumption kinetics panel') was used to determine voluntary food intake [VFI] and meal duration (study 2). Study 3 was a field trial where the cross kibble was fed to client-owned overweight dogs undergoing controlled weight loss, and attitudes of owners were sort. In study 1, dogs in the all-size panel consumed more of the cross-kibble diet than of the round-kibble diet (P < .001), but there was no significant difference in dogs of the small-size panel (P = 1.000). In study 2, VFI was broadly similar for both diets, with no difference in total consumption across all four meals (P = .370). However, meal duration was significantly longer for the cross kibble (meal 1: 292 s; meal 2: 650 s) compared with the round kibble (meal 1: 186 s; meal 2: 282, P < .001 for both). In study 3, owners observed more chewing behaviour (P = .031), slower ingestion speed (P = .031), and a significant decrease in food-seeking behaviour (P = .020) when eating the cross-kibble compared with the round-kibble. Altering the kibble shape of a canine therapeutic weight loss diet can decrease ingestion speed without affecting palatability, but studies are now required to determine the effect on outcomes of weight management.","Clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcome in 145 cows with type-2 abomasal ulcer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075614,Research in veterinary science,2019 05 27,"This study involved 145 cows with type-2 abomasal ulcer. The most common clinical signs were, in decreasing order of frequency, depressed demeanour (100%), partial or complete anorexia (93%), rumen atony (91%), tachycardia (90%), dark or black manure (80%), prolonged capillary refill time (71%), pale mucous membranes (69%) and tachypnoea (62%). The most common abnormal laboratory findings were azotaemia (89%), low haematocrit (82%), hypokalaemia (81%), hypoproteinaemia (74%) and metabolic acidosis (61%). Ten cows were euthanased immediately after, or died during, the initial examination, and treatment was started (day 0) in 135 cows. Treatment included blood transfusion, sodium chloride/glucose solution, calcium borogluconate, vitamin C and metamizole. Fourteen cows also underwent right-flank laparotomy because of displaced abomasum (n = 7) or to rule out other causes of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (n = 7). The mean heart rate decreased significantly from 108 bpm on day 0 to 88 bpm on day 3. The haematocrit decreased significantly in cows that did not receive blood and increased significantly in the transfused cows during this period. The plasma protein concentration also increased significantly in transfused cows. Ninety-one (67%) of the 135 treated cows recovered and were discharged after a mean hospitalisation period of nine days, and 44 cows (33%) failed to respond to treatment and were euthanased or died. Aggressive treatment, which should include blood transfusion when indicated, is warranted in valuable cows because >50% can be expected to return to full production in the long term.",Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics: A potential universal method for diagnosing cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075613,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 05 24,"Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide. It affects an unfathomable number of people, with almost 16 million Americans currently living with it. While many cancers can be detected, current diagnostic efforts exhibit definite room for improvement. It is imperative that a person be diagnosed with cancer as early on in its progression as possible. An earlier diagnosis allows for the best treatment and intervention options available to be presented. Unfortunately, existing methods for diagnosing cancer can be expensive, invasive, inconclusive or inaccurate, and are not always made during initial stages of the disease. As such, there is a crucial unmet need to develop a singular universal method that is reliable, cost-effective, and non-invasive and can diagnose all forms of cancer early-on. Raman spectroscopy in combination with advanced statistical analysis is offered here as a potential solution for this need. This review covers recently published research in which Raman spectroscopy was used for the purpose of diagnosing cancer. The benefits and the risks of the methodology are presented; however, there is overwhelming evidence that suggests Raman spectroscopy is highly suitable for becoming the first universal method to be used for diagnosing cancer.",Cookie or clementine? Psychophysiological stress reactivity and recovery after eating healthy and unhealthy comfort foods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075612,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 06 11,"Many people eat unhealthy foods that are high in calories, fat, or sugar when feeling stressed, yet little is known about whether this unhealthy comfort eating actually comforts. Additionally, prior research has not tested whether healthy comfort eating of fruits and vegetables might also alleviate stress, or whether comfort eating during the stress anticipation phase versus immediately after a stressful event is more beneficial for stress relief. The present experiment tested whether unhealthy and healthy comfort eating reduce acute psychophysiological responses to a socially evaluative stressor. Participants (N = 150 healthy women) underwent the Trier Social Stress Test in the lab and were randomly assigned to one of five conditions according to a 2 (food type: unhealthy vs. healthy) x 2 (eating timing: during stress anticipation vs. after the stressor) + 1 (no food control) between-subjects design. Stress outcomes included mood, cognitive appraisals, rumination, salivary cortisol, heart rate variability, and pre-ejection period. Unhealthy and healthy comfort eating did not dampen reactivity or enhance recovery of psychophysiological stress compared to control, and no differences in reactivity or recovery were found by comfort food type. Findings suggest that by replacing unhealthy comfort foods with fruits and vegetables, women will not be sacrificing any stress-reducing benefits and can inherently improve the quality of their diet while avoiding potential drawbacks of unhealthy comfort eating (e.g., links with abdominal obesity).",A dissociation between speech understanding and perceived reverberation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075611,Hearing research,2019 06 16,"As direct-to-reverberant energy ratio (DRR) decreases or decay time increases, speech intelligibility tends to decrease for both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Given this relationship, it is easy to assume that perceived reverberation (reverberance) would act as an intermediary-as physical reverberation increases, so does reverberance, and speech intelligibility decreases as a result. This assumption has not been tested explicitly. Two experiments were conducted to test this hypothesis. In Experiment 1, listeners performed a magnitude estimation task, reporting reverberance for speech stimuli that were convolved with impulse responses whose reverberant properties were manipulated. Listeners reported a decrease in reverberance when the DRR was increased at both ears (Natural Room condition), but not when it was increased at only the ear nearest the source (Hybrid condition). In Experiment 2, listeners performed a speech intelligibility task wherein noise-masked speech was convolved with a subset of the impulse responses from Experiment 1. As predicted by the speech transmission index (STI), speech intelligibility was good in cases where at least one ear received non-reverberant speech, including the Hybrid listening condition in Experiment 1. Thus, the Hybrid listening condition resulted simultaneously in high reverberance (Exp. 1) and high speech intelligibility (Exp. 2), demonstrating that reverberance and speech intelligibility can be dissociated.",Exploring the effect of chirality on the therapeutic potential of N-alkyl-deoxyiminosugars: anti-inflammatory response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections for application in CF lung disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075609,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 27,"In the frame of a research program aimed to explore the relationship between chirality of iminosugars and their therapeutic potential, herein we report the synthesis of N-akyl l-deoxyiminosugars and the evaluation of the anti-inflammatory properties of selected candidates for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Target glycomimetics were prepared by the shortest and most convenient approach reported to date, relying on the use of the well-known PS-TPP/I2 reagent system to prepare reactive alkoxyalkyl iodides, acting as key intermediates. Iminosugars ent-1-3 demonstrated to efficiently reduce the inflammatory response induced by P. aeruginosa in CuFi cells, either alone or in synergistic combination with their d-enantiomers, by selectively inhibiting NLGase. Surprisingly, the evaluation in murine models of lung disease showed that the amount of ent-1 required to reduce the recruitment of neutrophils was 40-fold lower than that of the corresponding d-enantiomer. The remarkably low dosage of the l-iminosugar, combined with its inability to act as inhibitor for most glycosidases, is expected to limit the onset of undesired effects, which are typically associated with the administration of its d-counterpart. Biological results herein obtained place ent-1 and congeners among the earliest examples of l-iminosugars acting as anti-inflammatory agents for therapeutic applications in Cystic Fibrosis.",Lipophilic efficient phenylthiazoles with potent undecaprenyl pyrophosphatase inhibitory activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075608,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 27,"Antibiotic resistance remains a pressing medical challenge for which novel antibacterial agents are urgently needed. The phenylthiazole scaffold represents a promising platform to develop novel antibacterial agents for drug-resistant infections. However, enhancing the physicochemical profile of this class of compounds remains a challenging endeavor to address to successfully translate these molecules into novel antibacterial agents in the clinic. We extended our understanding of the SAR of the phenylthiazoles' lipophilic moiety by exploring its ability to accommodate a hydrophilic group or a smaller sized hetero-ring with the objective of enhancing the physicochemical properties of this class of novel antimicrobials. Overall, the 2-thienyl derivative 20 and the hydroxyl-containing derivative 31 emerged as the most promising antibacterial agents inhibiting growth of drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration as low as 1 μg/mL. Remarkably, compound 20 suppressed bacterial undecaprenyl pyrophosphatase (UppP), the molecular target of the phenylthiazole compounds, in a sub nano-molar concentration range (almost 20,000 times more potent than the lead compounds 1a and 1b). Compound 31 possessed the most balanced antibacterial and physicochemical profile. The compound exhibited rapid bactericidal activity against S. aureus, and successfully cleared intracellular S. aureus within infected macrophages. Furthermore, insertion of the hydroxyl group enhanced the aqueous solubility of 31 by more than 50-fold relative to the first-generation lead 1c.",Identification of the co-existence of low total organic carbon contents and low pH values in agricultural soil in north-central Europe using hot spot analysis based on GEMAS project data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075607,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"Total organic carbon (TOC) contents in agricultural soil are presently receiving increased attention, not only because of their relationship to soil fertility, but also due to the sequestration of organic carbon in soil to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In this research, the spatial patterns of TOC and its relationship with pH at the European scale were studied using hot spot analysis based on the agricultural soil results of the Geochemical Mapping of Agricultural Soil (GEMAS) project. The hot and cold spot maps revealed the overall spatial patterns showing a negative correlation between TOC contents and pH values in European agricultural soil. High TOC contents accompanying low pH values in the north-eastern part of Europe (e.g., Fennoscandia), and low TOC with high pH values in the southern part (e.g., Spain, Italy, Balkan countries). A special feature of co-existence of comparatively low TOC contents and low pH values in north-central Europe was also identified on hot and cold spot analysis maps. It has been found that these patterns are strongly related to the high concentration of SiO2 (quartz) in the coarse-textured glacial sediments in north-central Europe. The hot spot analysis was effective, therefore, in highlighting the spatial patterns of TOC in European agricultural soil and helpful to identify hidden patterns.",Effects of sodium hypochlorite concentration on the methanogenic activity in an anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075606,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"The effect of membrane cleaning chemical, NaOCl on specific acetoclastic methanogenic activity (SAMA) of biomass in the anaerobic fluidized membrane bioreactors (AFMBRs) was assessed. Granular activated carbon (GAC) was used as a fluidizing media in the AFMBR to provide membrane scouring effect and surface for biofilm attachment. Effect of NaOCl on methane production was negligible for GAC with biofilm (bGAC) samples up to 150 mg NaOCl/g VSS, but was significant for the bulk liquid samples with noticeable lag period over 300 h even at the dosage of 50 mg NaOCl/g VSS. The toxicity of NaOCl on methane production was reduced in samples with virgin GAC (vGAC) by allowing 14 days of biomass buildup period prior to NaOCl addition, although the vGAC alone did not alleviate the toxicity. The results revealed that NaOCl concentrations beyond 100 mg/L within the reactor inhibited methanogenic activity and the effects were more pronounced on suspended biomass than the immobilized biomass on GAC.",Spatial and temporal occurrence of pharmaceuticals in UK estuaries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075605,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"There is a lack of data on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in estuaries worldwide, with little understanding of their temporal and spatial variations globally. Ibuprofen, paracetamol, diclofenac, trimethoprim and citalopram were measured in twelve estuaries in the UK. Initially, these compounds were monitored in the Humber Estuary, where samples were taken every two months over a twelve month period in order to assess their spatial and temporal variations. Ibuprofen was found at some of the highest concentrations ever measured in an estuary globally (18-6297 ng l-1), with paracetamol also measured at relatively high concentrations (4-917 ng l-1) in comparison to the other compounds. In terms of spatial distribution, a pattern was observed where the highest concentrations were found at a site at which wastewater is discharged, whilst compound concentrations were often lower upstream and downstream of this site. The downstream profile of pharmaceuticals differed temporally with concentrations highest downstream when input from wastewater effluent was highest. Eleven further estuaries were sampled around the UK in order to put the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the Humber Estuary into a wider context. Pharmaceutical concentrations in the other estuaries sampled were <210 ng l-1 but, again, ibuprofen and paracetamol were found at concentrations higher than other compounds, whereas diclofenac and citalopram were absent in many estuaries. The Humber, which is the receiving environment for the sewage effluent of approximately 20% (13.6 million people) of the population of England, was observed to have the highest overall concentration of pharmaceuticals in contrast to the other estuaries sampled, thereby representing a worst case scenario for pharmaceutical pollution."

The objective of this study is to perform an environmental diagnosis from a social-ecological perspective by considering both ecological and urban development descriptors of an urban basin. We selected 12 sampling sites of the Langueyú upper basin where social and ecological descriptors were determined. We arranged sampling sites according to their physicochemical characteristics (pre-urban, urban and post-urban sites). An ecological index was defined from habitat and biological descriptors: vegetation cover, richness and total density of invertebrates and organic matter. The index determined that urban and post-urban sites showed similar characteristics, and pre-urban sites presented the best habitat and biological conditions. An urbanisation index was defined from urban development descriptors: distance to the stormwater drainage network, number of industries, distance to a house without sewage, impervious surface and housing density. The results showed that the pre-urban and post-urban sites share a greater similarity in relation to the urban descriptors but with different impact in ecological quality. The headwaters in the hills (pre-urban zone) still presents a very good ecological condition (although threatened by urbanisation and tourism); however, once it crosses the dense urban area, no >5 km distance, the environmental degradation is alarming. We were able to determine that the structural measures associated with greater urbanisation, added to illegally connected sewer pipes and illegally industrial connections, produce the ecological degradation of the stream. This environmental diagnosis allowed us a deep understanding of the urbanisation impact on the ecological integrity of an urban stream in a developing country which, like many others, doesn't have monitoring programs or an integrated vision of water resources.",Removal of chelated heavy metals from aqueous solution: A review of current methods and mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075592,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"Water contamination with heavy metal ions and organic compounds such as citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, tartrate, pharmaceuticals, surfactants and natural organic matter, is a serious problem in the natural environment. Although many methods have been effectively applied to the removal of heavy metal complexes from aqueous solution, there is a lack of information available on the mechanisms, advantages and disadvantages of these various methods. This review summarizes the various treatment methods applied to the removal of heavy metal complexes, with a summary of the mechanisms of action and recent research progress. The methods reviewed in detail include electrolysis, membrane separation, adsorption, precipitation, replacement-coprecipitation, TiO2 photocatalysis and Fenton oxidation-precipitation, with the advantages and disadvantages of each method discussed. Furthermore, the heavy metal complex removal mechanisms are analyzed comprehensively. Results show that the adsorption method exhibited unique merits, showing much promise for future development. Finally, this review comprehensively analyzes future prospects and developments in methods for removal of chelated heavy metals.","Winds of change, developing a non-target plant bioassay employing field-based pesticide drift exposure: A case study with atrazine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075591,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"A field-scale, spray drift study with atrazine was conducted to simultaneously measure spray drift deposition, airborne interception and corresponding biological effects on two sensitive plant species (cucumber and lettuce). Applications of AAtrex 4L (atrazine) were made using ultra-coarse nozzles (TeeJet TTI11004) under worst-case drift potential conditions of bare soil and high wind speeds (i.e. >10 mph; >16 kph). This study was replicated 4 times, each with two parallel spray swaths (92.5 ft or 28 m per swath) perpendicular to wind direction. Within each replicate application, three sampling lines were used to measure drift deposition (using stainless-steel discs) at distances out to 400 ft (122 m), airborne interception (using stainless-steel rods) at distances out to 75 ft (23 m), and potential direct plant effects at 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 ft (1.5, 4.6, 7.6, 10.7, and 13.7 m) from the downwind edge of the spray swath. Corresponding upwind control discs and plants were also included in each replicate. Each replicate application targeted steady wind speeds between 10 and 15 mph (16 and 24 kph) within a 30-degree angle of the downwind field orientation. On average, each 10% increase in distance from the spray zone resulted in approximately 14% less ground-deposited atrazine. Between 7 and 41× more atrazine mass was collected from vertical rods (airborne drift), compared to horizontally placed stainless-steel discs (ground deposition). Cucumber and lettuce plants exposed to spray drift were monitored for biological effects over 21 days post-application according to standard protocols. Endpoints of survival, weight (biomass), and shoot length were evaluated by comparing distance groups to up-wind controls. Overall, when trials were combined, the aggregate lowest observable effect distance (LOED) was 5-ft (1.5 m) and the aggregate no observable effects distance (NOED) was 15-ft (4.6 m), with cucumbers affected more than lettuce.","Effects of brownification and warming on algal blooms, metabolism and higher trophic levels in productive shallow lake mesocosms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075590,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"An increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in inland waters has been reported across the northern temperate region but the effects of this on whole lake ecosystems, often combined with other anthropogenic stressors like nutrient inputs and warming, are poorly known. The effects of these changes on different component of the ecosystem were assessed in an experiment using twenty-four large (3000L) outdoor mesocosms simulating shallow lakes. Two different temperature regimes (ambient and ambient +4 °C) combined with three levels of organic matter (OM, added as filtered peaty water), simulating the DOC increase that is predicted to take place over the next 4 to 21 years were used. Neither temperature nor OM had significant effects on net ecosystem production, respiration or gross primary production. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration was not significantly affected by warming, however in summer, autumn and winter it was significantly higher in mesocosms receiving intermediate OM levels (July-Feb DOC concentrations 2-6 mg L-1). Summer cyanobacterial blooms were highest in intermediate, and lowest in the highest OM treatments. OM concentration also influenced total macroinvertebrate abundance which was greater in spring and summer in mesocosms with intermediate and high OM. Fish abundance was not significantly affected by OM concentration, but abundance was greater in ambient (55 fish subsample-1) compared to heated mesocosms (17 fish subsample-1) and maximum abundance occurred two weeks later compared to heated mesocosms. The results suggest that changes in OM may have a greater effect on shallow lakes than temperature and that phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria, benefit from intermediate OM concentrations, therefore, nuisance algal blooms might increase in relatively clear shallow eutrophic lakes where DOC concentrations increase.",Perinatal dioxin exposure and neurodevelopment of 2-year-old Vietnamese children in the most contaminated area from Agent Orange in Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075589,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"Bien Hoa airbase is the most contaminated area of dioxin contamination from Agent Orange in Vietnam, but little is known about the neurodevelopmental effects of perinatal dioxin exposure on children living nearby. We recruited 210 mother-newborn resident pairs in 2012 and 78 pairs in 2015 and followed them for 2 years to assess the children's neurodevelopment. As a control group, we used 120 mother-child pairs recruited in 2014 in the Ha Dong district of Ha Noi City, an unexposed area. Perinatal dioxin exposure levels were indicated by levels of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and toxic equivalency values of polychlorodibenzodioxins, polychlorodibenzofurans, and nonortho-polychlorinated biphenyls (TEQ-PCDD/Fs/noPCBs) in maternal breast milk. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III) were used to assess neurodevelopment, and scores in each domain were compared between children with different exposure levels using general linear regression models and stratification by sex. Decreased expressive and composite language scores in boys and gross motor scores in girls were found in children exposed to TCDD ≥ 5.5 (pg/g lipid) compared with children with TCDD < 1.8. However, in matched pair analysis between children with TCDD ≥ 5.5 and <1.8 (pg/g lipid), lower expressive and composite language scores in boys exposed to TCDD ≥ 5.5 were significant, but lower gross motor scores in girls did not reach statistical significance. In addition, significant association was found between levels of PCDD congeners other than TCDD and gross motor scores in boys. These findings suggest that perinatal exposure of TCDD and other PCDD congeners affects development of language and gross motor skills, respectively, in boys at 2 years of age exposed to dioxins originating from Agent Orange in Vietnam.",Increasing sensitivity of alpine grasslands to climate variability along an elevational gradient on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075588,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"Monitoring and mapping the sensitivity of grassland ecosystems to climate change is crucial for developing sustainable local grassland management strategies. The sensitivity of alpine grasslands to climate change is considered to be high on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), yet little is known about its spatial pattern, and particularly the variations between different elevations. Here, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and three climate variables (air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation), we modified a vegetation sensitivity index-approach to capture the relative sensitivity of alpine grassland productivity to climate variability on the QTP during 2000-2016. The results show that alpine grasslands on the southern QTP are more sensitive to climate variability overall, and that the climate factors driving alpine grassland dynamics are spatially heterogeneous. Alpine grasslands on the southern QTP are more sensitive to temperature variability, those on the northeastern QTP display strong responses to precipitation variability, and those on the central QTP are primarily influenced by a combination of radiation and temperature variability. The sensitivity of alpine grasslands to climate variability increases significantly along an elevational gradient, especially to temperature variability. This study underscores that alpine grasslands at higher elevations on the QTP are more sensitive to climate variability than those at lower elevations at the regional scale.",Mucous cell responses to contaminants and parasites in shorthorn sculpins (Myoxocephalus scorpius) from a former lead‑zinc mine in West Greenland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075587,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"Previous studies of sculpins from the former lead (Pb) - zinc (Zn) mine near Maarmorilik, West Greenland, have shown that these fish are affected by heavy metal exposure from the mine. In this study, we applied mucosal mapping (a stereological method for mucosal quantification in fish) to uncover interactions between the host, parasites and heavy metal exposure (Pb and Zn) in shorthorn sculpins from the Maarmorilik mining site at a gradient of 3 stations. Skin and gill mucosal epithelia of shorthorn sculpins were significantly affected and reflected the exposure to environmental heavy metals and parasites. Size of skin mucous cells was significantly smallest in the sculpin from the station 3 where heavy metal contamination was lowest and the skin parasite load was highest. Gill filament mucous cells were largest and densest in fish from station 1 which was the most contaminated site. In gill lamellae the density of mucous cell followed a toxicity gradient and was significantly highest at the most contaminated station and significantly lowest at the least contaminated station. The persistent presence of toxic Pb and Zn levels in the sediment at the most contaminated station may have induced a small but measurable reduction in the surface area available for respiration and may have affected diffusion distance. The strong correlation between size of filamentous mucous cells and Pb concentrations in liver suggests that these cells can play an active role in reducing the somatic load of Pb in sculpin. We suggest that mucosal mapping can be used to assess effects of contaminant and parasite exposure in future environmental field studies.",Integrated mild ozonation with biofiltration can effectively enhance the removal of naphthenic acids from hydrocarbon-contaminated water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075586,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"An innovative biofiltration-ozonation-biofiltration process was established and applied for the treatment of oil sands process water (OSPW).

Oxidized NAs showed higher resistance to the biofiltration process than classical NAs. The mild ozonation process (with utilized ozone dose of 30 mg/L) removed 84.8% of classical NAs and 11.5% of oxidized NAs from the biofiltrated OSPW with a degradation efficiency of 0.3 mg classical NAs/mg O3 and 0.1 mg oxidized NAs/mg O3. However, by using the same utilized ozone dose, the degradation of classical NAs and oxidized NAs from raw OSPW was 32.1% and 3.9% with ozonation efficiency of 0.1 mg classical NAs/mg O3 and 0.0 mg oxidized NAs/mg O3, respectively. Compared with the biofiltration pretreatment, the post biofiltration process (with HRT of 8 h) showed higher degradation effect on oxidized NAs with removal ratio of 22.9% and removal rate of 0.4 mg/L/h, but showed lower degradation effect on classical NAs with removal ratio of 6.7% and removal rate of 0.0 mg/L/h. After biofiltration-ozonation-biofiltration treatment, the microbial community structure in the biofilter was investigated by next generation sequencing. Proteobacteria and Rhodococcus were dominant bacterial phyla and genus in the biofilter, the abundance of which were 47.21% and 9.50% which were different from those in raw OSPW (62.88% and 0.72%). The change of microbial community structure could be resulted from the interaction between microbial community and the circulating OSPW. The ozonation integrated biodegradation process removed 89.3% and 34.0% of classical and oxidized NAs from OSPW which shows high potential to be applied by the oil and gas industry.",Risk assessment of plastic pollution on marine diversity in the Mediterranean Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075585,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 25,"Plastic marine pollution is an increasing threat to global marine diversity. Quantifying this threat is particularly difficult and complex, especially when evaluating multiple species with different ecological requirements. Here, we examine the semi-enclosed basin of the Mediterranean Sea where the inputs of plastic pollution and its impact on marine diversity are still widely unknown. Eighty-four species from six taxonomic classes were evaluated to assess the risk of ingesting plastic marine debris, integrating inter-specific factors such as plastic exposure rates and life history traits (e.g., motility, habitat, and body size). Species were modelled within a spatial context to identify and estimate their exposure to plastic ingestion across the Mediterranean Sea using literature data, species distribution maps and plastic dispersion models. Our approach identified hotspots for the risk of plastic ingestion across multiple taxa in the Mediterranean Sea, highlighting that coastal species are at higher risk of ingesting plastic in the marine environment than open-sea species. The plastic exposure analysis indicated that species with larger home ranges were more at risk of exposure with increased distances while local species were more likely to be exposed to plastic closer to the centre of their home range location. The approach used in this study can be applied to support management and mitigation efforts throughout the Mediterranean Sea and in other geographic regions to minimize the impact of plastic pollution on marine diversity.",Simultaneous removal of fluoride and arsenic from well water by electrocoagulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075584,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"The co-occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater presents a problem in many, mostly arid, regions of Latin America and the world. These pollutants cause significant health problems and are difficult to remove simultaneously from drinking water. In this study, the electrocoagulation process for the simultaneous removal of fluoride and arsenic was evaluated in well from the state of Durango, Mexico, in order to both solve the local problem and determine how to apply the method generally. Tests were carried out with different times, concentrations, initial pH values, and electric current densities, with iron and aluminum as electrode materials. The removal efficiencies in simultaneous presence were 85.68% for fluoride and approximately 100% for arsenic. The final concentrations for both pollutants were below the drinking water limits established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Mexican regulations. The optimum conditions of the electrocoagulation process found were a current density of 4.5 mA/cm2, an initial pH of 5, and a treatment time of 15 min, considering initial fluoride and arsenic concentrations of 5 mg/L and 80 μg/L, respectively."

The challenge of the segmentation work mainly roots in various artifacts in the image. Most of the published methods involve the establishment of complex models but do not behave well on images with artifacts. In this study, aiming at automatically delineating borders in IVUS frames acquired by 20 MHz ultrasound probes, we present a fuzzy clustering-initialized hierarchical level set evolution (FC-HLSE) method. A cluster selection strategy based on the spatial fuzzy c-means (FCM) is proposed to generate the initial value and regularization term of the level set evolution (LSE). The contour convergence splits into two LSE steps between which an ingenious contour extraction (consisting of the morphological processing, the seek and linear interpolation, the gradient-based and circular fitting-based refinement) is carried out. We evaluate the proposed methodology on the publicly available 435 images by comparing auto-segmented results with the ground truth. The performance of the method is quantified using the Jaccard measure (JM), the Hausdorff distance (HD), the percentage of area difference (PAD), the linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Results reveal that our method can handle images with or without artifacts. The algorithm is able to extract the lumen/MA border with the JM of 0.90/0.89, the HD of 0.31/0.40 mm, the PAD of 0.07/0.08 in average, which is better in some cases compared with several state-of-the-art methods.",Derivation of an optimal trajectory and nonlinear adaptive controller design for drug delivery in cancerous tumor chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075570,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 06 09,"Numerous models have investigated cancer behavior by considering different factors in chemotherapy. The subject of a controller design approach for these models in order to find the best rate of drug injection during the course of treatment has recently attracted much attention. The rate of drug injections is very important in chemotherapy, as it not only causes cancer cells to die, but also kills healthy cells. On the other hand, by modeling tumor growth behavior in each patient, different parameters for the dynamics of the system should be considered. In this study, optimal control signals were obtained for the most recent model of chemotherapy, using the steepest descent method. The logic of the solution was biologically compared to the experimental results. Then an adaptive controller, considering this path as the desired optimal trajectory, directs the system towards it. The global stability of the closed-loop system is achieved by means of the Lyapunov stability theory and Barbalat lemma. It is worth noting that some of the system parameters are estimated using an online recursive estimation method. Simulation results indicate the performance and effectiveness of the designed controller. The estimation parameters are also verified using experimental data from available studies.",Bidirectional General Graphs for inference. Principles and implications for medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075569,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 05 22,"Probabilistic inference methods require a more general and realistic description of the world as a Bidirectional General Graph (BGG). While in its original form the Bayes Net (BN) has been promoted as a predictive tool, it is more immediately a way of testing a hypothesis or model about interactions in a system usually considered on a causal basis. Once established, the model can be used in a predictive way, but the problem here is that for a traditional BN the hypotheses or models that can be formed are limited to the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) by definition. Three interrelated features are highlighted that represent deficiencies of the DAG which are corrected by conversion to a method based on a BGG: (i) lack of intrinsic representation of coherence by Bayes' rule, (ii) relatedly the need to consider interdependence in parent nodes, and (iii) the need for management of a property called recurrence. These deficiencies can represent large errors in absolute estimates of probabilities, and while relative and renormalized probabilities ameliorate that, they can often make much of a net superfluous through cancelations by division. The Hyperbolic Dirac Net (HDN) based on Dirac's quantum mechanics is a solution that led naturally to avoiding these deficiencies. It encodes bidirectional probabilities in an h-complex value rediscovered by Dirac, i.e. with the imaginary number h such that hh = +1. Properties of the HDN described previously are reviewed (though emphasis is on descriptions in familiar probability terms), the issue of recurrence is introduced, methods of construction are simplified, and the severity of the quantitative differences between BNs and analogous HDNs are exemplified. There is also discussion of how results compare with other approaches in practice.",Experimental investigation of cranial fracture initiation in blunt human head impacts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075567,Forensic science international,2019 06 03,"The relationship between the point of blunt impact and the location of cranial fracture initiation continues to be poorly understood. The current study used high-speed video to capture cranial fracture initiation and propagation in impact experiments on twelve unembalmed, intact human cadaver heads. Video footage provided direct evidence that blunt cranial impacts can produce linear fractures initiating peripheral to the impact site. Four tests produced only remote peripheral linear fractures with no damage at the known point of impact, demonstrating that the pattern of linear fractures does not necessarily indicate impact site. The range of variation observed in these experiments suggests that cranial fracture formation is more complex than it is typically described in the current literature. Differences in biomechanical and fracture results obtained with three different shaped implements provided evidence that impact surface is one important factor influencing the outcomes of blunt cranial impacts.",A practical study on direct PCR amplification using the GlobalFiler™ PCR Amplification Kit on human bloodstains collected with microFLOQ™ Direct swabs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075566,Forensic science international,2019 06 03,"Rapid DNA profiling of casework samples is a powerful tool that can support law enforcement agencies in the quick apprehension of perpetrators before they re-offend or escape the jurisdiction. This present study evaluated the feasibility of direct PCR amplification, using the microFLOQ™ Direct swab, for generating DNA profiles (from bloodstains) within 3 h. The swab tip is coated with nylon fibers pre-treated with cell lysing agent, which allows for the direct PCR amplification of collected samples without DNA extraction and quantification, thereby shortening the time required to obtain a DNA profile. Samples collected were directly amplified using GlobalFiler™ PCR Amplification Kit with and without the presence of a PCR additive. Addition of the PCR additive enhanced the peak heights of DNA profiles by approximately 2 fold. Hence, an additive could improve results obtained in the absence of a DNA purification step, especially since casework samples may contain PCR inhibitors. Subsequently, these swabs, amplified using the GlobalFiler™ PCR Amplification Kit with PCR additive, were evaluated on common substrates encountered in routine casework samples submitted with bloodstains, such as denim jeans, knife blade, tissue paper, leather belt, shirt, and blood swabs. The minimum peak heights observed were generally above the analytical and stochastic thresholds established by the laboratory. Finally, the microFLOQ™ Direct swab workflow was compared to the laboratory's standard workflow of DNA profiling comprising of conventional processing steps such as extraction using the DNA-IQ™ chemistry on Maxwell® 16, followed by quantification, amplification and capillary electrophoresis. The average peak heights of the DNA profiles generated by direct PCR amplification were similar or exceeded those generated using the standard workflow. This study clearly demonstrates that direct PCR amplification using microFLOQ™ Direct swab can be used in a rapid workflow to obtain DNA profiles from casework samples.",The role of the gunshot residue expert in case review - A case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075564,Forensic science international,2019 06 03,This paper details the review of the gunshot residue (GSR) evidence relating to a 2002 murder involving the discharge of a pistol where the Prosecution used the GSR findings together with voice identification evidence and obtained a conviction in the case of R v Dwaine George. Mr George was subsequently represented by Cardiff University Law School's Innocence Project who made representations to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) based on issues relating to the GSR evidence. The CCRC commissioned their own expert review and based on these findings referred the conviction to the Court of Appeal stating that in their opinion the weight of the GSR evidence was not appropriately conveyed to the jury at the original Trial and there should have been a warning relating to the limited significance that could be attached to the evidence. The Court of Appeal concluded that had the jury been aware of the full extent of the potential alternative sources of GSR in the case and the limited number of particles found on a jacket related to Mr George then this would have affected the decision of the Trial jury. The appeal was allowed and the convictions were quashed.,Upper limits on perturbations of nuclear decay rates induced by reactor electron antineutrinos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075563,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,"We report the results of an experiment conducted near the High Flux Isotope Reactor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, designed to address the question of whether a flux of reactor-generated electron antineutrinos (ν¯e) can alter the rates of weak nuclear interaction induced decays of 54Mn, 22Na, and 60Co.

Petroleum coke has been proposed as an industrial-scale sorbent to reduce concentrations of organic chemicals in oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). However, PC contains up to 1000 mg of vanadium (V) per kg of PC, and during the treatment it leaches from coke reaching levels of up to 7 mg/L in ""treated"" OSPW. Little information is available on how common water quality variables affect the toxicity of V to aquatic organisms. Here descriptive relationships are presented to describe how site-specific surface water characteristics representative of the Alberta oil sands region influence the toxicity of V to Daphnia pulex. Results revealed that when D. pulex was exposed to an increase in pH, a threshold relationship was found where acute V toxicity increased from a lethal median concentration (LC50) of 1.7 to 1.2 mg V/L between pH 6 and 7 and then levelled off at around 1 mg V/L. When alkalinity (from 75 to 541 mg/L as CaCO3) and sulphate (from 54 to 394 mg/L) increased, the acute toxicity of V decreased slightly with LC50s changing from 0.6 to 1.6, and from 0.9 to 1.4, respectively. When the length of V exposure was extended (from 2 to 21 d), only an increase of sulphate from 135 to 480 mg/L caused a slight increase in V toxicity from a LC50 of 0.6 to 0.4 mg V/L, the opposite trend seen in the acute exposures. In addition, the influence of two OSPW representative mixtures of increasing sodium and sulphate, and increasing alkalinity and sulphate on V acute toxicity to D. pulex were evaluated; only the mixture of increasing sodium (from 18 to 536 mg/L) and sulphate (from 55 to 242 mg/L) caused a slight decrease in V acute toxicity (LC50 1.0-2.1 mg V/L). Evidence is presented that variations in surface water chemistry can affect V toxicity to daphnids, although only to a small degree (i.e. within a maximum factor of 2 in all cases evaluated here). These relationships should be considered when creating new water quality guidelines or local benchmarks for V."

Plasma selenium and red blood cell cadmium and lead concentrations were measured by ICP-MS. Urinary arsenic species were determined via HPLC-HG-AAS and were summed to determine the total urinary arsenic concentration.

Upon suitable thiolation using dithiothreitol (DTT), the Fe3O4(core)-Au(shell) nanocomposite (DTT-Fe3O4@Au) has been fabricated that can detect As(III) in aqueous solution with significantly low limit of detection and holds potential for selective removal of As(III) from water owing to its magnetic core. Due to high affinity of -SH groups for As(III), the nanoparticles undergo aggregation in the presence of As(III), resulting in a significant decrease in absorbance, yielding the limit of detection (LOD) as 0.86 ppb, which is much lower than the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended threshold value of 10 ppb. UV-vis spectroscopy in conjunction with dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy techniques have further elaborated the detailed interaction between As(III) and DTT-Fe3O4@Au nanocomposite regarding their size dynamics and solution behaviour during the interaction. Moreover, ca.70% removal of As(III) from aqueous solution by DTT-Fe3O4@Au has been observed by ICP-MS measurement strengthening the potential of this nanocomposite as a dual-functional probe and filter.",Is the rate of virological failure to cART continuing to decline in recent calendar years?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075548,Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,2019 06 10,"Despite the high rate of virological success of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV infected individuals continue to fail.

Each phytopathogen can parasitise some plant species, but most plant species are nonhosts that are innately immune due to a series of physical, chemical and inducible defenses these nonadapted pathogens cannot overcome. New evidence supports the NHR paradigm that posits the inability of potential pathogens to colonise nonhost plants is frequently due to molecular incompatibility between pathogen virulence factors and plant cellular targets. While NHR is durable, it is not insurmountable. Environmental changes can facilitate pathogen host jumps or alternatively result in new encounters between previously isolated plant species and pathogens. Climate change is predicted to substantially alter the current distribution of plants and their pathogens which could result in parasitism of new plant species.",PTBP1 enhances exon11a skipping in Mena pre-mRNA to promote migration and invasion in lung carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075540,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Gene regulatory mechanisms,2019 05 19,"Alternative splicing (AS) events occur in the majority of human genes. AS in a single gene can give rise to different functions among multiple isoforms. Human ortholog of mammalian enabled (Mena) is a conserved regulator of actin dynamics that plays an important role in metastasis. Mena has been shown to have multiple splice variants in human tumor cells due to AS. However, the mechanism mediated Mena AS has not been elucidated. Here we showed that polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) could modulate Mena AS. First, PTBP1 levels were elevated in metastatic lung cancer cells as well as during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Then, knockdown of PTBP1 using shRNA inhibited migration and invasion of lung carcinoma cells and decreased the Mena exon11a skipping, whereas overexpression of PTBP1 had the opposite effects. The results of RNA pull-down assays and mutation analyses demonstrated that PTBP1 functionally targeted and physically interacted with polypyrimidine sequences on both upstream intron11 (TTTTCCCCTT) and downstream intron11a (TTTTTTTTTCTTT). In addition, the results of migration and invasion assays as well as detection of filopodia revealed that the effect of PTBP1 was reversed by knockdown of Mena but not Mena11a+. Overexpressed MenaΔ11a also rescued the PTBP1-induced migration and invasion. Taken together, our study provides a novel mechanism that PTBP1 modulates Mena exon11a skipping, and indicates that PTBP1 depends on the level of Mena11a- to promote lung cancer cells migration and invasion. The regulation of Mena AS may be a potential prognostic marker and a promising target for treatment of lung carcinoma.",DISC1 promotes translation maintenance during sodium arsenite-induced oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075539,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Gene regulatory mechanisms,2019 05 22,"Variation in Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) increases the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. However, the functions of DISC1 associated with the development of these diseases remain unclear. DISC1 has been reported to inhibit Akt/mTORC1 signaling, a major regulator of translation, and recent studies indicate that DISC1 could exert a direct role in translational regulation. Here, we present evidence of a novel role of DISC1 in the maintenance of protein synthesis during oxidative stress. In order to investigate DISC1 function independently of Akt/mTORC1, we used Tsc2-/- cells, where mTORC1 activation is independent of Akt. DISC1 knockdown enhanced inhibition of protein synthesis in cells treated with sodium arsenite (SA), an oxidative agent used for studying stress granules (SGs) dynamics and translational control. N-acetyl-cysteine inhibited the effect of DISC1, suggesting that DISC1 affects translation in response to oxidative stress. DISC1 decreased SGs number in SA-treated cells, but resided outside SGs and maintained protein synthesis independently of a proper SG nucleation. DISC1-dependent stimulation of translation in SA-treated cells was supported by its interaction with eIF3h, a component of the canonical translation initiation machinery. Consistent with a role in the homeostatic maintenance of translation, DISC1 knockdown or overexpression decreased cell viability after SA exposure.

This novel function of DISC1 might be involved in its association with pathologies affecting tissues frequently exposed to oxidative stress."

Exploiting DNA damage repair defects via inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is becoming an attractive therapeutic option. The TOPARP-A clinical trial demonstrated that the PARP inhibitor olaparib may be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer. However, several unanswered questions regarding the use of olaparib remain: 1) How do we best stratify patients for olaparib treatment? 2) Where do we place olaparib in the treatment sequence paradigm? 3) Is there cross-resistance between olaparib and currently used therapies? Here, we tested putative cross-resistance between current therapies and olaparib in treatment-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer models. Docetaxel-resistant cells exhibited robust resistance to olaparib which could be attributed to blunted PARP trapping in response to olaparib treatment. Upregulated ABCB1 mediates cross-resistance between taxanes and olaparib, which can be overcome through decreasing ABCB1 expression or inhibiting ABCB1 using elacridar or enzalutamide. We also show that combining olaparib with enzalutamide is more effective in olaparib-sensitive cells than either single agent. Our results demonstrate that cross-resistance between olaparib and other therapies could blunt response to treatment and highlight the need to develop strategies to maximize olaparib efficacy.",Climate change induced range shifts in seaweeds distributions in Europe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075527,Marine environmental research,2019 06 10,"There are evidences of how climate change is affecting seaweeds distribution and the ecosystems services they provide. Therefore, it is necessary to consider these impacts when managing marine areas. One of the most applied tools in recent years to deal with this are species distribution models, however there are still some challenges to solve, such as the inclusion of hydrodynamic predictors and the application of effective, transferable and user-oriented methodologies. Five species (Saccorhiza polyschides, Gelidium spinosum, Sargassum muticum, Pelvetia canaliculata and Cystoseira baccata) in Europe and 15 variables were considered. Nine of them were projected to the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 for the mid-term (2040-2069) and the long term (2070-2099). Algorithms for each species were applied to generate models that were assessed by comparison of probabilities and observations (area under the curve, true skill statistics, Boyce index, sensitivity, correct classification rate), niches overlap (Schoener's D, Hellinger's I), geographical similarity (interquartile range) and ecological realism. Models built demonstrated very good predictive accuracy and sensitivity, without overfitting risk. A medium overlap in the historical and RCPs environmental conditions were obtained, therefore the models can be considered transferable and results accurate because only some isolated points were detected as outliers, corresponding to low probabilities. The areas of S. polyschides and G. spinosum have been identified to be dramatically reduced, meanwhile S. muticum and C. baccata were predicted to expand their range. P. canaliculata was expected to keep its sites of presence but with a decrease in its probability of occurrence. For all species it was remarkable the importance of hydrodynamic variables and parameters representing extreme conditions. Spatially predictions of the potential species and areas at risk are decisive for defining management strategies and resource allocation. The performance and usefulness of the approach applied in this study have been demonstrated for algae with different ecological requirements (from upper littoral to subtidal) and distributional patterns (native and invasive), therefore results can be used by marine planners with different goals: marine protected areas designation, monitoring efforts guiding, invasions risk assessment or aquaculture facilities zonation.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075526,Parasitology international,2019 05 19,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an inflammatory disease caused by the activity of effector immune cells, such as the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines. Helminth immunomodulation in the host has been shown to have therapeutic implications in IBD. In the present study, we investigated whether Metagonimus miyatai infection could ameliorate inflammatory diseases. Mice were infected with M. miyatai, and colitis was then induced through oral administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Weight loss, stool consistency, gross bleeding, colon length, and tissue inflammation were assessed by macroscopic and microscopic examinations. In addition, regulatory cytokine expression was observed in colon tissue by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that M. miyatai infection decreased the clinical severity of DSS-induced colitis, including weight loss, bloody diarrhea, shortening of the colon, and colon tissue damage in mice (p < .05). The expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1b, and cyclooxygenase-2 in mice infected with helminth were lower than those in DSS-treated mice without helminthic infection (p < .05).

Until recently only the electron spin D coupling was explicitly included in quantifying the DNP mechanism. Recent literature discusses the potential role of J coupling in DNP, but does not provide an account of the distribution and source of electron spin J coupling of commonly used biradicals in DNP. In this study, we quantified the distribution of electron spin J coupling in AMUPol and TOTAPol biradicals using a combination of continuous wave (CW) X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lineshape analysis in a series of solvents and at variable temperatures in solution - a state to be vitrified for DNP. We found that both radicals show a temperature dependent distribution of J couplings, and the source of this distribution to be conformational dynamics. To qualify this conformational dependence of J coupling in both molecules we carry out Broken Symmetry DFT calculations which show that the biradical rotamer distribution can account for a large distribution of J couplings, with the magnitude of J coupling directly depending on the relative orientation of the electron spin pair. We demonstrate that the electron spin J couplings in both AMUPol and TOTAPol span a much wider distribution than suggested in the literature. We affirm the importance of electron spin J coupling for DNP with density matrix simulations of DNP in Liouville space and under magic angle spinning, showcasing that a rotamer with high J coupling and optimum relative g-tensor orientation can significantly boost the DNP performance compared to random orientations of the electron spin pair. We conclude that moderate electron spin J coupling above a threshold value can facilitate DNP enhancements.","Validation of a multiplex qPCR assay for detection and quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque samples.

The recently developed nanocatalytic cancer therapy based on catalytic Fenton reaction represents one of the promising paradigms for potential clinical translation, which has got fast progress very recently. This progress report discusses the rational design and fabrication of Fenton reaction-based nanocatalysts for triggering the in-situ Fenton chemical reaction within tumor microenvironment to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which is highly efficient for killing the cancer cells and suppressing the tumor growth. Several strategies for optimizing the nanocatalytic cancer-therapeutic efficiency of Fenton reaction have been highlighted, including screening high-performance Fenton nanocatalysts, increasing peroxide-hydrogen amounts as the reactants, changing the Fenton-reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, acidity and photo-triggering), and Fenton reaction-based synergistic cancer therapy such as some sequential nanocatalytic reactions with improved therapeutic outcome. The facing challenges and future developments of Fenton reaction-based nanocatalytic cancer therapy are also discussed for further promoting the clinical translation of this emerging cancer-therapeutic modality to benefit the cancer patients.",The role of NMR spectroscopy in mapping the conformational landscape of GPCRs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075520,Current opinion in structural biology,2019 06 13,"Over recent years, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has developed into a powerful mechanistic tool for the investigation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). NMR provides insights which underpin the dynamic nature of these important receptors and reveals experimental evidence for a complex conformational energy landscape that is explored during receptor activation resulting in signalling. NMR studies have highlighted both the dynamic properties of different receptor states as well as the exchange pathways and intermediates formed during activation, extending the static view of GPCRs obtained from other techniques. NMR studies can be undertaken in realistic membrane-like phospholipid environments and an ever-increasing choice of labelling strategies provides comprehensive, receptor-wide information. Combined with other structural methods, NMR is contributing to our understanding of allosteric signal propagation and the interaction of GPCRs with intracellular binding partners (IBP), crucial to explaining cellular signalling.",Lipid droplet biogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075519,Current opinion in cell biology,2019 06 04,"Lipid droplets (LDs) store neutral lipids in their core as an energy source when nutrients are scarce. The center of an LD is hydrophobic, and hence it is surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer, unlike other organelles that have an aqueous interior and are bounded by a phospholipid bilayer. LDs arise from the ER, where neutral lipid synthesis enzymes are localized. A combination of biophysical analysis and modeling, in vitro reconstitution and cell biological analyses has provided a great deal of information over the past few years on the process of LD biogenesis from the ER. In addition to lipid composition, four protein families (seipin proteins, perilipins, FIT proteins and ER shaping proteins) are crucial for LD biogenesis. Recent studies have shown that LDs preferentially arise, along with peroxisomes, at special ER sites marked by the reticulon-like Pex30/MCTP2 protein. New functions for perilipins and FIT family proteins have been uncovered, and the cryo-electron microscopy structure of seipin coupled with high resolution imaging in cells has provided a more comprehensive picture of its function in LD biogenesis. Seipin, along with other proteins such as Rab18 and its effector NRZ, have been shown to carry out their functions at least in part through regulation of ER-LD contact sites, whose establishment and maintenance have emerged as an essential component of LD biogenesis and maturation."

This diversity has been characterized and studied at higher taxonomic levels, but limited analyses have been performed among closely related genera with contrasting floral traits due to the lack of fully resolved phylogenetic relationships. Here, we used four representative transcriptomes to develop an exome capture (target enrichment) bait for the entire subfamily and applied it to the Anthonotha clade using a complete data set (61 specimens) representing all extant floral diversity. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered congruent topologies using ML and Bayesian methods. Anthonotha was recovered as monophyletic contrary to the remaining three genera (Englerodendron, Isomacrolobium and Pseudomacrolobium), which form a monophyletic group sister to Anthonotha. We inferred a total of 35 transitions for the seven floral traits (pertaining to flower symmetry, petals, stamens and staminodes) that we analyzed, suggesting that at least 30% of the species in this group display transitions from the ancestral condition reconstructed for the Anthonotha clade. The main transitions were towards a reduction in the number of organs (petals, stamens and staminodes). Despite the high number of transitions, our analyses indicate that the seven characters are evolving independently in these lineages. Petal morphology is the most labile floral trait with a total of seven independent transitions in number and seven independent transitions to modification in petal types. The diverse petal morphology along the dorsoventral axis of symmetry within the flower is not associated with differences at the micromorphology of petal surface, suggesting that in this group all petals within the flower might possess the same petal identity at the molecular level. Our results provide a solid evolutionary framework for further detailed analyses of the molecular basis of petal identity.",Genetic data reveals a complex history of multiple admixture events in presently allopatric wild gingers (Asarum spp.) showing intertaxonomic clinal variation in calyx lobe length.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075504,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2019 06 03,"Clinal variation is a major pattern of observed phenotypic diversity and identifying underlying demographic processes is a necessary step to understand the establishment of clinal variation. The wild ginger series Sakawanum (genus Asarum) comprises four taxa, which exhibit intertaxonomic clinal variation in calyx lobe length across two continental islands isolated by a sea strait. To test alternative hypotheses of the evolutionary history and to determine the implications for the formation of clinal variation, we conducted approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analysis and ecological niche modeling (ENM). ABC analysis indicated that the scenario assuming multiple admixture events was strongly supported. This scenario assumed two admixture events occurred between morphologically distinct taxa, likely leading to the generation of intermediate taxa. One of the admixture events was estimated to have occurred during the last glacial maximum (LGM), during which the taxa were estimated to have formed a common refugia in southern areas by ENM analysis. Although four taxa are currently distributed allopatrically on different islands and trans-oceanic dispersal appears unlikely, the formation of a land bridge and the geographic range shift to refugia would have allowed secondary contact between previously isolated taxa. This study suggests that clinal variation can be shaped by demographic history including multiple admixtures due to climatic oscillations.",Suppression of limb regeneration by RNA interference of WNT4 in the swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075503,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 06 11,"The functions of Wnt signalling in crab limb regeneration are poorly understood. Herein, we isolated and characterised the full-length cDNA of WNT4 from Portunus trituberculatus, designated PtWNT4. The 4831 bp cDNA encodes 323 amino acid polypeptide. Protein structure prediction showed that PtWNT4 has a conserved WNT domain. The PtWNT4 gene was expressed in all regenerative limb stages, and was upregulated from stage I, with highest expression in stage III, and expression then declined in stages IV and V. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong localisation at loose connective tissue during limb regeneration, but PtWNT4 protein levels decreased upon formation of muscle fibers. Injection of WNT4 dsRNA into regenerative limbs significantly decreased PtWNT4 mRNA levels from 36 h to 5 days after injection, indicating successful gene silencing. RNA interference knockdown of PtWNT4 expression greatly retarded limb regeneration compared with the control group. Blastema emergence phenotype analysis revealed limb regeneration rates of 0, 31.5% and 40.5% for the dsWNT4 group at 36 h, 3 days and 5 days, respectively, compared with 29.95%, 83.0% and 92.5% for the saline-injected control groups (p <0.05). Expression analysis on the WNT4 using RNAi provide important information for understanding its functional mechanism during limb regeneration in P. trituberculatus.

Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 06 11,"Cherax quadricarinatus, as one of the world's most valuable freshwater shrimp species, has received extensive attention in recent years. As males grow larger and faster than females, development of the sex control breeding techniques is of great interest, but knowledge on sex determination and differentiation in C. quadricarinatus remains poorly unknown. Sxl (Sex-lethal) is an important gene in the sexual differentiation regulatory hierarchy. It reflects the ratio of sex chromosomes to autosomes into molecule changes and directs sex-specific splicing forms of precursor mRNA. In the present study, the full-length cDNA sequences of four Sxl splice variants were identified from C. quadricarinatus, designated as CqSxl1, CqSxl2, CqSxl3 and CqSxl4, respectively. Sequence analysis determined different splicing sites near the translation termination region of four Sxl transcript isoforms. Two highly conserved classical RRM domains were found according to predicted secondary structures of Sxl proteins. mRNA expression of CqSxl in different tissues, developmental stage of embryos and testes were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR. Among four isoforms, CqSxl3 showed tissue specificity with higher expression levels in testis than in ovary. CqSxl1 and CqSxl4 were found widely expressed in various tissues and CqSxl2 was almost undetectable. In early developmental stages, the expression levels of CqSxl1/3/4 gradually increased along with embyonic development. In addition, CqSxl genes presented the higher transcript levels in the early stage of testis development. Furthermore, CqSxl3 silencing induced a significant decrease of the transcript of Cq-IAG, an androgenic hormone-encoding gene responsible for masculine development. These data indicate that CqSxl3 might be involved in male sex determination in C. quadricarinatus. Our study will contribute to understanding the mechanism of sex determination in C. quadricarinatus, and also can provide theoretical guidance for establishing a sex control technology.",Hypoxia enhances blood O2 affinity and depresses skeletal muscle O2 consumption in zebrafish (Danio rerio).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075501,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 06 11,"Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are widely used animal models. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying hypoxia tolerance in this species have remained poorly understood. In the present study, we have determined the effects of hypoxia on blood-O2 transport properties and mitochondrial respiration rate in permeabilized muscle fibres of adult zebrafish exposed to either 1) a gradual decrease in O2 levels until fish lost equilibrium (~1 h, acute hypoxia), or 2) severe hypoxia (PO2 ∼ 15 Torr) for 48 h (prolonged hypoxia). Acute, short-term hypoxia caused an increase in hemoglobin (Hb) O2 affinity (decrease in P50), due to a decrease in erythrocyte ATP after erythrocyte swelling. No changes in isoHb expression patterns were observed between hypoxic and normoxic treatments. Prolonged hypoxia elicited additional reponses on O2 consumption: lactate accumulated in the blood, indicating that zebrafish relied on glycolysis for ATP production, and mitochondrial respiration of skeletal muscle was overall significantly inhibited. In addition, male zebrafish had higher hypoxia tolerance (measured as time to loss of equilibrium) than females. The present study contributes to our understanding of the adaptive mechanisms that allow zebrafish, and by inference other fish species, to cope with low O2 levels.",Photochemical behavior of ferrihydrite-oxalate system: Interfacial reaction mechanism and charge transfer process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075500,Water research,2019 06 04,"Heterogeneous photochemical reactions associated with natural iron (hydr)oxides and oxalic acid have attracted a great deal of scientific attention in the application of organic pollutants degradation. However, the reaction mechanism is still unclear due to the complicated iron cycles and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this study, the in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was implemented to investigate the adsorption process and photochemical behavior of oxalic acid on the surface of ferrihydrite. A comprehensive reaction mechanism from the perspective of charge transfer process, including homogeneous-heterogeneous iron cycling and ROS generation, was illustrated in detail. We found that oxalic acid was first adsorbed on the surface of ferrihydrite with a mononuclear bidentate binding geometry. Interestingly, this mononuclear bidentate complex on the surface of ferrihydrite was stable under visible light irradiation. Subsequently, the whole complex departed from ferrihydrite surface through non-reduction dissolution with the form of Fe(C2O4)+. In the solution, the Fe(C2O4)+ complexes would quickly convert to Fe(C2O4)2- complexes. Under visible light irradiation, the electrons generated from the photolysis of Fe(C2O4)2- complex reacted with O2 to form O2•-/•OOH. Meanwhile, Fe(III) was reduced to Fe(II). Finally, the produced O2•-/•OOH could react with Fe(II) through a one-step way to generate •OH, which possessed higher •OH formation efficiency than that through the two-step way of H2O2 as the intermediates. This study helps us with understanding of in-situ photochemical reaction mechanism of ferrihydrite-oxalic acid system, and also provides guidance to effectively utilize widespread iron (hydr)oxides and organic acids in natural environment to develop engineered systems for water treatment.","Oyster farming control on phytoplankton bloom promoted by thermal discharge from a power plant in a eutrophic, semi-enclosed bay.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075499,Water research,2019 06 04,"Temperature increase caused by thermal discharge from power plants promotes phytoplankton growth and frequent bloom in eutrophic subtropical waters, particularly in cold seasons. Suspension filter-feeding bivalves show size-selective grazing on phytoplankton. Thus, we hypothesized that algal bloom under thermal stimulation could be controlled and that phytoplankton community was structured by oyster farming. Here, ten cruises were conducted in two oyster farms (OFs) and control areas (CAs) adjacent to the Ninghai Power Plant in the upper section of Xiangshan Bay during 2009-2015. We found that thermal discharge induced severe winter algal blooms. Phytoplankton abundance and chlorophyll a (chla) were significantly lower (46.3% and 28.3%, respectively) in OF than in CA, indicating a high filtration efficiency by oysters and the associated biofouling assemblages. In addition, oyster farming significantly increased species richness (by 26.3%), Shannon-Wiener diversity (by 38.3%), and Pielou's evenness indices (by 28.8%) and reduced suspended solids (by 12.2%), total organic carbon (by 18.4%), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (by 1.5%), and phosphorus (by 3.7%). Furthermore, oyster farming considerably reduced (increased) micro-chla contribution (pheophytin/chla) by 34.8% (71.1%), suggesting a strong size-selective grazing on phytoplankton. Analysis of similarity revealed a significant difference in phytoplankton community composition between OF and CA. However, after the removal of culture rafts, all the abundance, chla, species diversity, dominant species, size structure, and community composition of phytoplankton showed no significant difference. Our study demonstrated that oyster farming effectively alleviated eutrophication and algal bloom and enhanced phytoplankton diversity, which provides guidance for aquaculture and ecological restoration in subtropical coastal eutrophic waters.",Epitope mapping and characterization of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal modified-human serum albumin using two different polyclonal antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075498,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 06 10,"Lipids are susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species, and from lipid oxidation reactions many short chain lipid peroxidation products can be formed. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is one of the most abundant and cytotoxic lipid oxidation products and is known to form covalent adducts with nucleophilic amino acids of proteins. HNE-modified proteins have value as biomarkers and can be detected by antibody-based techniques, but most commercially available antibodies were raised against HNE-keyhole limpet hemocyanin. We used HNE-treated human serum albumin (HSA) to raise sheep antiserum and report for the first time the use of covalently modified peptide arrays to assess epitope binding of antibodies (Abs). Peptide arrays covering the sequence of HSA and treated post peptide synthesis with HNE were used to compare the different binding patterns of a commercial polyclonal antibody (pAb) raised against HNE-treated KLH and an in-house anti-HNE enriched pAb. The results were correlated with analysis of HNE-modified HSA by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Both anti-HNE pAbs were found to bind strongly to eight common peptides on the HNE-treated HSA membranes, suggesting that HNE adducts per se induced an immune response in both cases even though different immunogens were used. Both antibodies bound with the highest affinity to the peptide 365DPHECYAKVFDEFKPLV381, which contains K378 and was also shown to be modified by the mass spectrometry analysis. Overall, the commercial anti-HNE pAb showed better specificity, recognizing nine out of the eleven adducts found by MS/MS, while the in-house enriched pAb only recognizes six. Nevertheless, the in-house pAb recognized specific peptides that were not recognized by the commercial pAb, which suggests the presence of clones uniquely specific to HNE adducts on HSA."

However, OSR has fewer long-term aneurysm-related complications such as endoleak or late rupture. Patients treated with EVAR and OSR have similar survival rates within two years following surgery, and OSR does not require intensive surveillance. Few have examined if patient preferences are aligned with the type of treatment they receive for their AAA. While many assume that patients may universally prefer the less invasive nature of EVAR, our preliminary work suggests that patients who value the lower risk of late complications may prefer OSR. In this study, called The PReferences for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (PROVE-AAA) trial, we describe a cluster-randomized trial to test if a decision aid can better align patients' preferences and their treatment type for AAA. Patients enrolled in the study are candidates for either endovascular or open repair, and are followed at VA hospitals by vascular surgery teams who regularly perform both types of repair. In Aim 1, we will determine patients' preferences for endovascular or open repair and identify domains associated with each repair type. In Aim 2, we will assess alignment between patients' preferences and the repair type elected, and then compare the impact of a decision aid on this alignment between the intervention and control groups. This study will help us to accomplish two goals. First, we will better understand the factors that affect patient preference when choosing between EVAR and OSR. Second, we will better understand if a decision aid can help patients be more likely to receive the treatment strategy they prefer for their AAA. Study enrollment began on June 1, 2017.

BMCs self-assemble and are spatially delimited by a semi-permeable shell made up of hexameric, trimeric, and pentameric shell proteins. Bioengineers aim to recapitulate the organization and efficiency of these complex biological architectures by redesigning the shell to incorporate non-native enzymes from biotechnologically relevant pathways. To meet this challenge, a diverse set of synthetic biology tools are required, including methods to manipulate the properties of the shell as well as target and organize cargo encapsulation. We designed and determined the crystal structure of a synthetic shell protein building block with an inverted sidedness of its N- and C-terminal residues relative to its natural counterpart; the inversion targets genetically fused protein cargo to the lumen of the shell. Moreover, the titer of fluorescent protein cargo encapsulated using this strategy is controllable using an inducible tetracycline promoter. These results expand the available set of building blocks for precision engineering of BMC-based nanoreactors and are compatible with orthogonal methods which will facilitate the installation and organization of multi-enzyme pathways.",Translational Regulation of Plant Response to High Temperature by a Dual Function tRNAHis Guanylyltransferase in Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075443,Molecular plant,2019 05 10,"Plants are sessile organisms, and have thus evolved numerous strategies to acclimate to changes in environmental temperature. There is emerging evidence to describe the molecular basis of this acclimation. In this study, we identified a tRNAHis guanylyltransferase, AET1, that contributes to the modification of pre-tRNAHis and is required for normal growth under high temperature conditions in rice. Interestingly, AET1 possibly interacts with both RACK1A and eIF3h in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum). Notably, AET1 can directly bind to the OsARF mRNAs including the uORFs of OsARF19 and OsARF23, indicating that AET1 is associated with translation regulation. Furthermore, polysome profiling assays suggest that the translational status remains unaffected in the aet1 mutant, but that the translational efficiency of OsARF19 and OsARF23 is reduced; moreover, the OsARF23 protein levels are obviously decreased in the aet1 mutant under high temperature, implying that AET1 regulates auxin signaling in response to high temperature. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that AET1 plays a dual function in tRNA modification and translational control involved in the regulation of the environmental temperature response in rice.",Grapefruit juice prolongs the QT interval of healthy volunteers and patients with long QT syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075442,Heart rhythm,2019 06 06,The list of medications linked to drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) is diverse.

Pulse-response experiments were performed. In-line measurements inside the feed frame were compared to measurements on the actual produced tablets and the influence of different tableting parameters on the concentration profiles were studied. Turret speed had a major influence on the concentration profiles and RTD parameters. The in-line and off-line concentration profiles did not align with each other as spiking material was still detected in the tablets when no spiking material was observed in the powder blend by the in-line measuring method. The cause of this mismatch between the in-line and off-line curves was the in-line measuring position. By adjusting the position of the NIR probe to the bottom of the feed frame instead of at the top of the feed frame, a perfect alignment between in-line and off-line concentration curves was acquired. In-line measurements at the bottom of the feed frame could, if optimisation to avoid probe fouling is possible, be ideal for real-time measurement and control of the blend concentration during tableting. When probe fouling cannot be avoided, the correlation between the in-line measured concentration at the top of the feed frame and the concentration of the produced tablets should be investigated and modelled to enable real-time measurement and control based on in-line measurements.",Quantitation of trace amorphous solifenacin succinate in pharmaceutical formulations by transmission Raman spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075440,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"It is important to quantify amorphous solid in active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) of formulations to guarantee high-quality pharmaceutical products.

A technical advance can be found in that delivery efficiency is significantly enhanced by effective adhesion of PNVs to the cell membrane, which is characterized noninvasively by using a confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)-based skin visualization technique. To this end, the PNVs with a soft core phase were fabricated through co-assembly of two amphiphilic triblock copolymers, poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PCL-b-PEO) and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO). The softness of PNVs was tuned successfully, while maintaining the particle size at ∼110 nm, by incorporation of PEO-b-PPO-b-PEO into the PNVs to a volume fraction of 0.3. Through an ex vivo skin penetration test, we showed that transactivating transcriptional activator (TAT)-decorated soft PNVs could not only exert strong adhesion to skin but also increase cellular uptake, leading to a transdermal delivery efficiency that is twice that of a hard PNV control. Moreover, CLSM-based noninvasive visualization of a fluorescent drug probe in the skin showed that the adhesiveness and softness of the PNVs contributed directly to the enhancement of transdermal delivery.",Predicting the critical quality attributes of ibuprofen tablets via modelling of process parameters for roller compaction and tabletting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075438,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"Roller compaction is a low cost granulation process which application is sometimes limited by the granular loss of compactability and reduced drug dissolution rate. Hence, the design of a robust manufacturing process is key in order to ensure quality of tablets. In this study, for ibuprofen tablets with high drug loading (<7% excipients), the correlations between two critical process parameters (CPPs), namely roller force during granulation and compaction pressure during tabletting, and several critical quality attributes (CQAs) were investigated using a design of experiment (DoE) approach. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was utilized to identify the best regression model to predict CQAs such as disintegration, dissolution, weight uniformity, hardness, porosity and tensile strength for 200 and 600 mg ibuprofen tablets. The tabletting compaction pressure had a greater impact on the aforementioned CQAs than compactor roller force. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) correlation loading plot showed that compaction pressure was directly related to disintegration time, tensile strength and hardness, and inversely related to both the percentage of drug dissolved and porosity. The inverse correlations were observed for the roller force applied during dry granulation. Amongst all the regression models constructed, multiple linear regression (MLR) showed the best correlation between CPPs and CQAs.",Managing efficacy and toxicity of drugs: Targeted delivery and excretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075437,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"Medicine is a natural companion of mankind in the present era for mere survival from the deadly diseases in ever-increasing polluted environments. Hence, in recent years, major focus of pharmaceutical, medicinal and biophysical research has been navigated in exploring and developing new and simple avenues to enhance the efficacy of the administered drugs on one hand and to get rid of, or at least reduce, the toxic side effects of the excess drugs accumulated in human body on the other. A potential approach to amplify the efficacy of the administered drug is to develop proficient targeted drug delivery systems (DDSs). This review provides an essence of some newly developed simple but prospective strategies on enhancing the efficacy of drugs/bioactive molecules exploiting various drug delivery systems like micelles, cyclodextrins, liposomes etc. to serve the purpose of targeted delivery towards DNA, by endogenous and/or exogenous means. Improved bio-availability and solubilization of ionic drugs within the less polar target regions from the bulk aqueous phase has also been achieved through the introduction of some physiologically permissible salts. In the other context, in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate a simple technique for easy removal of the excess adsorbed drug molecules from the cell membranes/lipid bilayers by exploiting health-amiable supramolecular assemblies.

Hydrogels of PEG-AuNRs and PAH-AuNRs exhibited potent in vitro antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Furthermore, AuNPs of different shapes and surface modifications demonstrated low percentages of deposition into the main body organs after 21 days of daily wound treatment. Hydrogels of AuNRs could be a promising nano-platform for wound healing."

State-of-the art susceptibility correction (for example, FSL's TOPUP algorithm) typically requires data acquired twice with reverse phase encoding directions, referred to as blip-up blip-down acquisitions, in order to estimate an undistorted volume. Unfortunately, not all imaging protocols include a blip-up blip-down acquisition, and cannot take advantage of the state-of-the art susceptibility and motion correction capabilities. In this study, we aim to enable TOPUP-like processing with historical and/or limited diffusion imaging data that include only a structural image and single blip diffusion image. We utilize deep learning to synthesize an undistorted non-diffusion weighted image from the structural image, and use the non-distorted synthetic image as an anatomical target for distortion correction. We evaluate the efficacy of this approach (named Synb0-DisCo) and show that our distortion correction process results in better matching of the geometry of undistorted anatomical images, reduces variation in diffusion modeling, and is practically equivalent to having both blip-up and blip-down non-diffusion weighted images.",Improved synthetic T1-weighted images for cerebral tissue segmentation in neurological diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075421,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 06 15,"Structural cerebral MRI analysis in patients with neurological diseases usually requires T1-weighted datasets for tissue segmentation. For this purpose, synthetic T1-weighted images which are constructed from quantitative maps of the underlying tissue parameters such as the T1 relaxation time and the proton density (PD) may provide advantages over conventional datasets. However, in some cases synthetic images may suffer from specific artifacts, hampering accurate tissue segmentation. The goal was to improve a previously described method for the calculation of synthetic magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) datasets from quantitative T1 and PD maps. Improvements comprise a B0-correction for the water-selective excitation pulses employed in T1-mapping and the use of T1-based pseudo-PD maps. Synthetic T1-weighted MP-RAGE datasets were calculated, using the standard and the improved algorithm, for 10 patients with focal epilepsy (caused by focal cortical dysplasia in 9), 10 patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 healthy control subjects and segmented with the Freesurfer toolbox. Visual inspection disclosed that segmentation of the standard synthetic datasets was inaccurate in 6 out of 10 patients with epilepsy, 7 out of 10 patients with multiple sclerosis and 7 out of 10 healthy control subjects, while the improved synthetic datasets resulted in adequate segmentation outcomes in the majority of cases. Only for one patient with multiple sclerosis and one with epilepsy, segmentation in basal temporal regions was not sufficient. Furthermore, data based on the standard algorithm showed strong signal non-uniformities in basal regions. This effect was not present in the improved synthetic datasets.",7T GRE-MRI signal compartments are sensitive to dysplastic tissue in focal epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075420,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 06 15,"Ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging data obtained using a multi-echo gradient echo sequence has been shown to contain information on tissue microstructure. Quantitative assessment of water fraction, relaxation time and frequency shift using multi-compartment signal modelling may help improve our understanding of diseases and disorders affecting the human brain. In this study, we explored tissue microstructure information by analysing voxel compartment water fraction and frequency shifts derived from 7 T multi-echo gradient recalled echo MRI data. We aimed to test whether the parameters of a three compartment model could distinguish the normal cortex from the cortex affected by focal cortical dysplasia. We compartmentalised normal and dysplastic cortical regions in patients diagnosed with focal cortical dysplasia. We found the frequency shift parameter of the shortest T2⁎ signal compartment to be sensitive to regions of dysplastic tissue. We conclude that mathematical modelling of echo time dependent gradient recalled echo MRI signals in patients with focal cortical dysplasia can potentially delineate cortical areas that have undergone microstructural changes in comparison to normal tissue.","Non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for visualization and quantification of endovascular aortic prosthesis, their endoleaks and aneurysm sacs at 1.5 T.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075419,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 06 02,"After an endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR), a follow-up at 1, 6 and every 12 months is recommended for remainder of the patient's life. The diagnostic standard methods for diagnosing endoleaks and visualization of aneurysms in EVAR-patients are: invasive digital subtraction angiography (DSA), contrast enhanced (CE) computed tomographic angiography (CE-CTA), and magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA). These techniques, however, require the use of iodine- or gadolinium-based contrast agents with rare, but possibly life threatening side effects such as renal impairment, thyrotoxicosis and allergic reactions, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, and cerebral gadolinium deposition. The aim of this prospective study was to compare a non-contrast-enhanced MRI protocol (consist of four MRI methods) with DSA and CE-CTA for visualization and quantification of endovascular aortic prosthesis, their endoleaks and aneurysms.","Incidence of osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases in adults with cerebral palsy: A population-based cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075418,Bone,2019 06 01,"People with cerebral palsy (CP) may be at increased risk of musculoskeletal conditions due to various factors including malnutrition and abnormal levels of skeletal loading.

Little is known about how S. saprophyticus adapts to the pH shift that occurs during infection. Thus, in this study we aim to use a proteomic approach to analyze the metabolic adaptations which occur as a response by S. saprophyticus when exposed to acid (5.5) and alkaline (9.0) pH environments. Proteins related to iron storage are overexpressed in acid pH, whilst iron acquisition proteins are overexpressed in alkaline pH. It likely occurs because iron is soluble at acid pH and insoluble at alkaline pH. To evaluate if S. saprophyticus synthesizes siderophores, CAS assays were performed, and the results confirmed their production. The chemical characterization of siderophores demonstrates that S. saprophyticus produces carboxylates derived from citrate. Of special note is the fact that citrate synthase (CS) is down-regulated during incubation at acid pH, corroborating this result. This data was also confirmed by enzymatic assay. Our results demonstrate that iron metabolism regulation is influenced by different pH levels, and show, for the first time, the production of siderophores by S. saprophyticus. Enzymatic assays suggest that citrate from the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) is used as substrate for siderophore production.","Coronary artery disease associated specific modules and feature genes revealed by integrative methods of WGCNA, MetaDE and machine learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075415,Gene,2019 06 16,Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality globally. This work aimed to investigate the specific modules and feature genes associated with CAD.,Association study of SLC6A2 gene Thr99Ile variant (rs1805065) with athletic status in the Brazilian population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075414,Gene,2019 06 01,"Genetic variants in monoamine neurotransmitter genes have been recurrently associated with panic disorder, addiction and mood disorders. Recent evidence also indicates that norepinephrine neurotransmission can influence a series of psychophysical and psychobiological parameters related to athletic performance, and the presence of variants in the SLC6A2 (solute carrier family 6 member 2) gene, which encodes the norepinephrine transporter, can be detrimental to an adequate noradrenergic signaling. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to explore the SLC6A2 Thr99Ile variant (rs1805065) in a cohort composed of highly-trained individuals and non-trained individuals. A total of 1556 Brazilians: 926 non-athletes and 630 athletes (322 endurance athletes and 308 power athletes) were compared in this case-control association study. The Thr99Ile variant showed only two genotypes (C/C or C/T), and a low minor allele frequency of ≈1%. However, none of the power athletes had the mutant T-allele (i.e., the C/T genotype), which may be related to decreased norepinephrine transporter activity. The genotype distribution and allele frequency observed in power athletes were significantly different when compared to non-athletes or endurance athletes. Therefore, the presence of the T-allele may decrease the chance of belonging to the group of athletes involved in explosive physical tasks. These results still need to be replicated in independent cohorts. However, it appears reasonable to assume that there is an association between the SLC6A2 gene variant and power athletic status.","Type III collagen (COL3A1): Gene and protein structure, tissue distribution, and associated diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31075413,Gene,2019 06 01,"Collagen alpha-1(III) chain, also known as the alpha 1 chain of type III collagen, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the COL3A1 gene. Three alpha 1 chains are required to form the type III collagen molecule which has a long triple-helical domain. Type III collagen, an extracellular matrix protein, is synthesized by cells as a pre-procollagen. It is found as a major structural component in hollow organs such as large blood vessels, uterus and bowel. Other functions of type III collagen include interaction with platelets in the blood clotting cascade and it is also an important signaling molecule in wound healing. Mutations in the COL3A1 gene cause the vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS; OMIM 130050). It is the most serious form of EDS, since patients often die suddenly due to a rupture of large arteries. Inactivation of the murine Col3a1 gene leads to a shorter life span in homozygous mutant mice. The mice die prematurely from a rupture of major arteries mimicking the human vEDS phenotype. The biochemical and cellular effects of COL3A1 mutations have been studied extensively. Most of the glycine mutations lead to the synthesis of type III collagen with reduced thermal stability, which is more susceptible for proteinases. Intracellular accumulation of this normally secreted protein is also found. Ultrastructural analyses have demonstrated dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum and changes in the diameter of collagen fibers. Other clinical conditions associated with type III collagen are several types of fibroses in which increased amounts of type III collagen accumulate in the target organs."
