The aim of this study was to explore how nursing staff talk about patient care in Swedish forensic psychiatric care and the implications for the care given to patients. The theoretical framework is based on social constructionism and sheds light on how language use can be understood as a social action. Twelve interviews were conducted with nursing staff working in forensic psychiatric settings. The questions focused on patient care in relation to activities, security, relationships with patients, and rules and routines. The results show that nursing staff assignments are encouraging them to use various interpretative repertoires to make meaning about their practice. The three interpretative repertoires were ""taking responsibility for correcting patients' behavior,"" ""justifying patient care as contradictory practice,"" and ""patients as unpredictable."" However, although forensic psychiatric care emphasizes both security and care, nursing staff's use of these interpretative repertoires provided multiple interpretations that lead to contradictory ways of understanding patient care. These findings show that talk itself can be understood as problematic in various situations. A possible implication for clinical forensic nursing practice might be that the nurse-patient relationship does not support patients' best interests. For example, when language endows the patient with certain characteristics, this talk is justified and given meaning by its context and thus has an influence on a patient's individual need for care.","Clinical Course and Management of Dengue in Children Admitted to Hospital; A 5 Years Prospective Cohort Study in Jakarta, Indonesia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640199,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2019 01 14,"Dengue incidence is rising globally which was estimated 100 million per year, whereas in Indonesia was estimated 7.5 million per year.

It is used primarily in depression, especially with generalized anxiety disorder or chronic pain. This medicine is of interest because its mechanisms involved multiple aspects. In the current study, the antidepressant action of VEN was investigated by studying the histone acetylation and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) in rats exposed to chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) for 28 days. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a control group, VEN-treated control group, CUS group, and VEN-treated CUS group. VEN (23.4 mg/kg once daily) was administered to rats by intragastric gavage, whereas the same volume of vehicle was given to rats in the control and model groups. Rat behaviors, acetylated H3 at lysine 9 (acH3K9), acetylated H3 at lysine 14 (acH3K14), acetylated H4 at lysine 12 (acH4K12), histone deacetylase 5, and TH and TPH expression in the hippocampus were determined. Chronic VEN treatment significantly relieved the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, prevented the increase of histone deacetylase 5 expression and decrease of acH3K9 level, and promoted TH and TPH protein expression in the hippocampus of CUS rats. The results suggest that the preventive antidepressant mechanism of VEN is partly involved in the blocking effects on histone de-acetylated modification and then increasing TH, TPH expression.",Bronchoscopic device intervention in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640188,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,2019 01 28,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a heterogeneous syndrome associated with varying degrees of parenchymal emphysema and airway inflammation resulting in decreased expiratory flow, lung hyperinflation, and symptoms leading to decreased exercise tolerance and quality of life.

The main objective of this work was to quantify the impact of land cover changes, especially those for wetlands, on low flow support and high flow attenuation, through a sub-watershed analysis of the St. Charles River, Quebec, Canada. 1978 and 2014 land cover scenarios, depicting a decrease in wetland areas of 15% at the watershed scale, were integrated into the hydrological modelling platform PHYSITEL/HYDROTEL. The most sensitive model parameters were automatically calibrated at the sub-watershed scale using the dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) algorithm. Pairs of simulations (with and without wetlands) were generated and model outputs were compared to illustrate the differences between the hydrological services provided by the wetlands of the 1978 land cover scenario and those provided by the wetlands of the 2014 land cover scenario. Results showed that low flow support at the outlet of the watershed, in scenarios with wetlands, compared to without wetland, would have increased from 2 to 14% in the 1978 land cover scenario (depending on flow indicator) and from 3 to 20% given the 2014 land cover scenario, whereas high flow attenuation would have been reduced from 15-26% to 16-20%, respectively. Results showed that the effect of wetland change was different between sub-watersheds, but demonstrated that the loss of wetland areas generally leads to a loss of hydrological services and highlighted the need for wetland conservation programs and restoration actions.",Biowastes alone and combined with sulfur affect the phytoavailability of Cu and Zn to barnyard grass and sorghum in a fluvial alkaline soil under dry and wet conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640169,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Management of degraded soils (i.e., metal contaminated soils, salt affected soils, and soils with low organic matter content) by applying biowastes (e.g., biosolids and compost) and inorganic soil amendments such as sulfur is of great agro-environmental concern. Because Cu and Zn chemical behaviour may be altered with these additions, we aimed at studying the impact of mono- and co-application of different rates (1.25% and 2.5%) of biosolids, compost, and sulfur on the mobilization of Cu and Zn and their uptake in a fluvial soil contains low and high metal concentrations and under two distinct moisture regimes (wet, where we grew barnyard grass; dry, with sorghum). We measured metal fractions and potential availability, along with soil pH, as well as plant yield and metal content in both plants, in an attempt to identify differences in metal behaviour. We found that organic matter (OM) (increased with biosolids and compost application) and soil pH (dramatically reduced with added sulfur) highly affected Cu and Zn mobility. Plant yield increased with increasing soil OM content and decreased with decreasing soil pH, particularly in the 2.5% sulfur treatment. However, Cu absorption was different in the two studied moisture regimes, as it was higher in the wet soil (Cu-DOC complexes, encouraged under wet conditions, may explain this), while it was lower in the dry soil. The biosolid-added Cu was significantly more bioavailable to sorghum plants than the spiked Cu. Co-application of sulfur and biosolids showed significantly higher sorghum uptake of Cu than application of sulfur to the spiked soil with Cu. Zinc uptake decreased in the high compost application rate (2.5%). This behaviour can be explained with the altered geochemical metal fractionation: added metals were distributed mainly in the oxides and organic fraction, but in the wet soil the percentage was higher compared to the dry, possibly due to metal-DOC associations. Also the residual fraction was lower in the wet, denoting higher metal mobility. We conclude that the observed differences between wet and dry soil concerning the metal geochemical behaviour, as were induced by added OM (with biosolids and compost) and reduced pH (with sulfur), are mainly responsible for the markedly different metal uptake patterns. These results may be an aid for effective phyto-management of alkaline fluvial soils with low and high content of Cu and Zn under paddy- and upland cultivation systems.",Evaluation of data-driven models for predicting the service life of concrete sewer pipes subjected to corrosion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640168,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Concrete corrosion is one of the most significant failure mechanisms of sewer pipes, and can reduce the sewer service life significantly. To facilitate the management and maintenance of sewers, it is essential to obtain reliable prediction of the expected service life of sewers, especially if that is based on limited environmental conditions. Recently, a long-term study was performed to identify the controlling factors of concrete sewer corrosion using well-controlled laboratory-scale corrosion chambers to vary levels of H2S concentration, relative humidity, temperature and in-sewer location. Using the results of the long-term study, three different data-driven models, i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), as well as the interaction between environmental parameters, were assessed for predicting the corrosion initiation time (ti) and corrosion rate (r). This was performed using the sewer environmental factors as the input under 12 different scenarios after allowing for an initiation corrosion period. ANN and ANFIS models showed better performance than MLR models, with or without considering the interactions between environmental factors. With the limited input data available, it was observed that ti prediction by these models is quite sensitive, however, they are more robust for predicting r as long as the H2S concentration is available. Using the H2S concentration as a single input, all three data driven models can reasonably predict the sewer service life.",Effects of bacterial-feeding nematodes on soil microbial activity and the microbial community in oil-contaminated soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640167,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Rapid economic development has caused an increase in serious pollution problems due to the ever-increasing use of oil and its products, thus making oil pollution control an urgent task. Studies have shown that large amounts of bacterial-feeding nematodes are present in oil-contaminated soil; their function is as yet unclear. In this experiment, different densities of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) were inoculated into artificially simulated oil-contaminated soil to examine their effects on microbial activity and the microbial community in oil-contaminated soil. Six treatments were investigated: sterilized oil-contaminated soil as control 1 (FSP), nematode-free soil as control 2 (S), oil-contaminated soil (SP), oil-contaminated soil + 5, 10 or 20 individual C. elegans per gram of dry soil (i.e., SPN5, SPN10, SPN20). Results showed that oil pollution significantly increased the soil basal respiration. However, C. elegans weakened the soil basal respiration to different degrees and soil microbial respiration entropy essentially changed in line with the soil basal respiration. Oil pollution and C. elegans boosted catalase activity in contaminated soil by approximately 64.2-145.1%. Soil urease activity of SPN5, SPN10 and SPN20 was 88.5%, 126.7% and 109.0% stronger, respectively, than that of SP. The inoculation of C. elegans changed the microbial phospholipid fatty acid content in the oil-contaminated soil, including soil bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, Gram-positive bacteria (G+) and Gram-negative bacteria (G-). Therefore, this research demonstrates that C. elegans can stimulate microbial reproduction in oil-contaminated soil, enhance related soil enzyme activities and regulate soil microbial community structure and diversity, thereby improving the contaminated soil environment and promoting oil degradation.",Evaluation of distillery wastewater treatability in a customized photobioreactor using blue-green microalgae - Laboratory and outdoor study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640166,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Treatability of anaerobically digested distillery wastewater is challenging because of its high pollution load of COD up to 40,000 ppm. This research investigates the possibilities of retrofitting the effluent treatment plant (ETP) of a distillery with microalgae treatment step. For this, at first the photobioreactors of capacity 50 L and 500 L were customized for the cultivation of Spirulina sp. under xenon lamp and sunlight. The reactor supported the maximum specific growth rate up to 0.42 ± 0.03 d-1 in the 50 L reactor at laboratory and 0.10 ± 0.02 d-1 in the 500 L reactor at the outdoor for Spirulina sp. The treatability of wastewater of COD 30,000 ppm-40,000 ppm was carried out in those reactors with the Spirulina sp. of culture volume fraction 0.8 and 0.93 under xenon lamp and sunlight respectively. The chemical oxygen demand and total dissolved solids reduction were 60-70% in both the volume fractions of the culture. Ion chromatography analysis indicated the reduction of major inorganic pollutants in the wastewater by the Spirulina sp. The algae were sustainable when the culture volume fraction was increased from 0.8 to 0.93. Thus, the phycoremediation was shown the significant pollution reduction in the wastewater. The addition of this step is valuable and it benefits the distillery by not only improving the quality of wastewater but also through the generation of algae biomass that would be appropriate for animal feed or biofuel application. However, the detail biochemical study is needed for the best use of algae biomass and the treatment could be checked for the long run sustainability.",Photocatalytic treatment of palm oil mill effluent by visible light-active calcium ferrite: Effects of catalyst preparation technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640165,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a serious and expensive environmental problem in Malaysia. In this paper, CaFe2O4 is introduced as a novel photocatalyst for the degradation of POME under visible light irradiation. Two synthesis routes, auto-combustion and co-precipitation, and two calcination temperatures 550 °C and 700 °C were used to produce four CaFe2O4 catalysts AC550, AC700, CP550 and CP700. CP550 exhibited the greatest photocatalytic degradation at 56% chemical-oxygen-demand (COD) removal after 8 h of irradiation which dropped to 49% after three consecutive cycles indicating reasonable conversion and high recyclability. BET analysis indicated CP550 had the highest SBET (27.28 m2/g) and pore volume (0.077 cm3/g) which dropped precipitously for CP700 upon increasing the calcination temperature to an SBET of 9.73 m2/g and pore volume of 0.025 cm3/g due to annealing which created a smoother surface area as evidenced by the SEM images. UV-Vis DRS indicated CP550 had the highest band-gap (1.52 eV) which is likely due to the presence of a highly crystalline pure CaFe2O4 phase compared to the other products which existed as a mixture of Fe oxidation states evidenced by the XRD data. The PL spectra for all catalysts indicated significantly lower recombination rate for both CP550 and CP700. Introduction of IPA into the reaction mixture to eliminate hydroxyl radicals resulted in a diminishing of COD removal from 56% to 7% proving hydroxyl radicals to be the primary reactive species responsible for photodegradation of POME.",Age related changes of the motor excitabilities and central and peripheral muscle strength.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640164,Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,2019 03 21,"The purpose was to investigate the age effects on central versus peripheral sources of strength, fatigue, and central neural excitabilities.",A validated UPLC-MS/MS assay for the quantification of amino acids and biogenic amines in rat urine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640163,"Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 01 23,"A UPLC-MS/MS assay, employing a reversed-phase separation, has been applied to the analysis of a number of common amino acids and biogenic amines in rat urine. Analytes were derivatised, using 6‑aminoquinolyl‑N‑hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AccQTag Ultra™). Derivatisation with this reagent, by increasing the hydrophobicity of the analytes, enables better retention by improving reversed-phase chromatographic properties and also improves ionisation efficiency to enhance MS-detection. The method allows for the determination of 38 amino compounds in 7.5 min, including baseline resolution of critical isomers. The assay has been validated for the absolute quantification of 29 amino compounds in rat urine, over a concentration range of 0.6-200 μM, for the purpose of exploratory metabolite phenotyping. Acceptable linearity (R2 > 0.995) and intra- and inter-day accuracy (<20.7%) and precision (<20.1%) for these analytes was achieved. The limits of detection ranged from 1.2-12 fmol on column with 20 μL of sample. The remaining nine amines examined were not accurately quantified by this method but can be monitored for relative/fold change in biological samples. The use of the method is exemplified by the monitoring of changes in healthy male Sprague-Dawley rat urinary amino acid concentrations over a 7-day period.",Quantitative analysis of desomorphine in blood and urine using solid phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640162,"Journal of chromatography.

Despite continued reports of Krokodil use, confirmation via toxicological testing remains scarce. The lack of confirmed desomorphine reports may be in part due to the limited published analytical methodology capable of detecting desomorphine at forensically relevant concentrations. In an effort to assist with identification efforts, a robust analytical method was developed and validated. Solid phase extraction (SPE) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to determine desomorphine in blood and urine using a deuterated analog as the internal standard. Data was acquired using selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Extraction efficiencies in blood and urine were 69% and 90%, respectively. The limits of quantitation in blood and urine were 5 ng/mL and 8 ng/mL, ten-fold lower than previously published methods. Intra- and inter-assay CVs were 2-4% (n = 3) and 3-7% (n = 15), respectively. The method was fully validated in accordance with published guidelines for forensic use. Furthermore, it provides a means by which desomorphine can be identified in toxicology specimens at forensically relevant concentrations, without the need for derivatization."

The present study tests the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of different combinations of SMS-delivered BCTs. 149 young adults who screened positive for hazardous drinking completed a baseline survey in the Emergency Department. For the following 2-weeks, on days they typically drank (1 to 3 days per week), participants received ecological momentary assessments (EMA) of drinking plans and desire to get drunk; the next day they were prompted to report recall of number of drinks consumed the prior day. Participants who responded to at least 50% these EMA (N = 127) were randomized to one of five 12-week interventions: Cued Self-Monitoring (TRACK); Drinking Intentions Feedback (PLAN); Drinking Performance Feedback (USE); Adaptive Goal Support (GOAL); and a combination of BCTs (COMBO). 79% of all EMA were completed over 12 weeks, which decreased from around 93% on week 1 to 65% by week 12. Using EMA data, relative to TRACK, only COMBO showed significant reductions in binge drinking and max drinks per drinking episode over time. Using TLFB data, there were no significant differences between groups from baseline to 14- and 28-weeks follow-up. Results lay the groundwork for a larger trial testing the effects of BCTs on binge drinking for young adults.",The impact of sexual self-concept ambiguity on alcohol approach bias and consumption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640147,Addictive behaviors,2019 05 03,"The current work sought to examine both intra-individual and situational features that can predict heightened alcohol misuse among individuals who report sexual-orientation self-concept ambiguity (SSA). It was hypothesized that situations that evoke the salience of individuals' sexuality will contribute to alcohol misuse among individuals who report heightened SSA. In the first experiment, fifty-nine students were recruited from psychology subject pools at two large state universities. Following a writing manipulation, used to evoke a state of heightened self-focus on an individual's sexuality, participants completed the Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task, which served as a marker of implicit bias toward alcohol-related cues. In the second experiment, ninety-four women between the ages of 21 and 35 were recruited into a lab-based study. Utilizing procedures similar to the first experiment, we attempted to test our research questions in an ad lib drinking study. Among young adults with greater SSA, situations that induced heightened self-focus were predictive of increased approach bias toward alcohol-related cues and increased consumption of an ostensibly alcoholic beverage. Evidence supported a causal link between the situational salience of sexuality and acute risk of alcohol-approach bias and consumption behavior among those with heightened SSA. Preventive interventions may highlight variation in risk of alcohol misuse based on identity-related risk factors, such as sexual self-concept ambiguity, and drinking motivations.",Gender differences in subjective stress and neuroendocrine response to a stress task among individuals with opioid dependence: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640146,Addictive behaviors,2019 05 07,"Opioid dependence is a significant public health problem in the United States and the number of opioid overdose deaths among women has increased dramatically in comparison to men in the last few years.

The objectives of this study were to examine differences in substance use on and off school grounds between nonsheltered homeless, sheltered homeless, and nonhomeless public school students, and to examine the relationship between homelessness and substance use in school. Data were from a statewide representative sample from the California Healthy Kids Survey collected in 2011-2013, (n = 390,028). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied. Findings show that compared to nonhomeless students, homeless students, both sheltered and nonsheltered, reported higher rates of age at first time of use under the age of 10, and recent substance use, for an array of substances, indulging alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other illegal drugs. Additionally about 50% of nonsheltered homeless students, and 15% of sheltered homeless students reported having used substances in school in the past 30 days. Results from logistic regressions indicate that homelessness is associated with substance use in school. Particularly, nonsheltered homeless students were 17.41, 12.09, 11.36 and 17.59 times more likely to report smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using marijuana and using other illegal drugs (respectively) in school in the past 30 days, compared to nonhomeless students. Sheltered homeless students were also more likely to use substances in school compared to nonhomeless students, but less likely compared to nonsheltered students. Findings highlight the need to develop differentiated school-based responses to each homeless subgroup and have conceptual, scientific and policy implications.",Aberrations of anterior insular cortex functional connectivity in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640144,Psychiatry research. Neuroimaging,2019 06 13,"An emergent literature suggests that resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) functional connectivity (FC) patterns are aberrant in alcohol use disorder (AUD) populations. The salience network (SAL) is an established set of brain regions prominent in salience attribution and valuation, and includes the anterior insular cortex (AIC). The SAL is thought to play a role in AUD through directing increased attention to interoceptive cues of intoxication. There is very little information on the salience network (SAL) in AUD, and, in particular, there are no data on SAL FC in currently drinking, nontreatment seeking individuals with AUD (NTS). rsfMRI data from 16 NTS and 21 social drinkers (SD) were compared using FC correlation maps from ten seed regions of interest in the bilateral AIC. As anticipated, SD subjects demonstrated greater insular FC with frontal and parietal regions. We also found that, compared to SD, NTS had higher insular FC with hippocampal and medial orbitofrontal regions. The apparent overactivity in brain networks involved in salience, learning, and behavioral control in NTS suggests possible mechanisms in the development and maintenance of AUD.",The B-box bridge between light and hormones in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640143,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology",2019 04 01,"Plant development is meticulously modulated by interactions between the surrounding environment and the endogenous phytohormones. Light, as an external signal coordinates with the extensive networks of hormones inside the plant to execute its effects on growth and development. Several proteins in plants have been identified for their crucial roles in mediating light regulated development. Among these are the B-box (BBX) family of transcription factors characterized by the presence of zinc-finger B-box domain in their N-terminal region. In Arabidopsis there are 32 BBX proteins that are divided into five structural groups on the basis of the domains present. Several BBX proteins play important roles in seedling photomorphogenesis, neighbourhood detection and photoperiodic regulation of flowering. There is increasing evidence that besides light signaling BBX proteins also play integral roles in several hormone signaling pathways in plants. Here we attempt to comprehensively integrate the roles of multiple BBX proteins in various light and hormone signaling pathways. We further discuss the role of the BBX proteins in mediating crosstalk between the two signaling pathways to harmonize plant growth and development. Finally, we try to analyse the conservation of BBX genes across species and discuss the role of BBX proteins in regulating economically important traits in crop plants.",Evaluation of low-level diode laser irradiation and various irrigant solutions on the biological response of stem cells from exfoliated deciduous teeth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640142,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Cells were exposed to EDTA (5%, 8.5%, 17%), NaOCl (1%, 2.5%, 5%) ozonated water (5, 10, 20 μg/ml) and GaAlAs diode laser irradiation (energy densities of 0.5, 1, 1.5 j/cm2). Culture medium included D-MEM, supplemented with 15% foetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% gentamycin, amphotericin-B and served as control group. The prepared irrigants were added to the relevant wells and incubated with the cells at 37 °C for 5, 10 and 15 min. The cells in the laser group were also incubated at 37 °C for 5, 10 and 15 min after the laser application. Cell viability and proliferation were analysed with the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The percentage of cell viability showed a significant reduction in all concentrations of the EDTA and NaOCl groups when compared to the control group, diode laser irradiation and ozonated water groups at 5th, 10th and 15th minutes respectively but high cytotoxic effects of all EDTA and NaOCl groups with decreased over 50% of cell viability were observed at the 15th minute. Also EDTA group with 17% concentration (17%E) presented the lowest survival rate on SHEDs with mean of 21.67% ± 6.101 at this time interval. The lowest toxic effects were observed at the 5th minutes compared to other time periods at experimental groups. For detection of apoptotic cells, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labelling (TUNEL) method was performed. According to the MTT results, doses showed the highest toxicity (cell survival decreased over 50%) in each group were selected for TUNEL assay (17% EDTA; 1% NaOCl; 10 μg/ml Ozonated water; 1.5 j/cm2 diode laser irradiation). The significantly lowest percentages of TUNEL-positive cells were detected in ozonated water (10.67% ± 2.93) and diode laser irradiation (13.24% ± 7.61) compared to EDTA (39.89% ± 11.54) and NaOCl (31.15% ± 10.64) respectively. Also the difference between percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in EDTA and NaOCl groups was not significant.

The temporal features of both amplitude modulations and rise times characterize the speech envelope. Previous studies uncovered the inefficiency of the dyslexic brain to follow different amplitude modulations in speech. However, it remains to be investigated how the envelope's rise time mediates this neural processing. In this study we examined neural synchronization in students with and without dyslexia using auditory steady-state responses at theta, alpha, beta and low-gamma range oscillations (i.e., 4, 10, 20 and 40 Hz) to stimuli with different envelope rise times. Our results revealed reduced neural synchronization in the alpha, beta and low-gamma frequency ranges in dyslexia. Moreover, atypical neural synchronization was modulated by rise time for alpha and beta oscillations, showing that deficits found at 10 and 20 Hz were only evident when the envelope's rise time was significantly shortened. This impaired tracking of rise time cues may very well lead to the speech and phonological processing difficulties observed in dyslexia.",The impact of spelling regularity on handwriting production: A coupled fMRI and kinematics study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640140,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,2019 04 02,"Current models of writing assume that the orthographic processes involved in spelling retrieval and the motor processes involved in the control of the hand are independent. This view has been challenged by behavioral studies, which showed that the linguistic features of words impact motor execution during handwriting. We designed an experiment coupling functional magnetic resonance imaging and kinematic recordings during a writing to dictation task. Participants wrote orthographically regular and irregular words. The presence of an irregularity impacts both the initiation of the movement and its fine motor execution. At the brain level, the left inferior frontal and fusiform gyri, two regions belonging to the core of the written language system, were found to be sensitive to the presence of an irregularity and to its position in the word during writing execution. Moreover, the left superior parietal lobule, the left superior frontal gyrus and the right cerebellum, three motor-related regions, displayed a stronger response to irregular than regular words. These results constitute direct evidence that orthographic and motor processes occur in a continuous and interactive fashion during writing."

Green tea contains mainly catechins such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), while black tea is characterized by the presence of theaflavins. TNF-α, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates the endogenous inflammatory cascade, plays a key role in periodontitis. In the present study, we investigated the ability of tea compounds to attenuate TNF-α-mediated activation of the host inflammatory response in monocytes/macrophages as well as the protective effect of green and black tea polyphenols on gingival keratinocyte barrier dysfunction induced by TNF-α. Tea compounds inhibited both the activation of NF-κB and caspase-1 as well as IL-1β secretion by monocytes/macrophages. TNF-α time-dependently damaged keratinocyte tight junction barrier integrity, as determined by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and FITC-dextran transport. Green tea extract, EGCG, theaflavins, and to a lesser extent, black tea extract protected keratinocytes against the TNF-α-mediated breakdown of barrier integrity. The treatment of keratinocytes with tea polyphenols markedly mitigated the morphological changes of tight junction proteins such as zonula occludens-1 and occludin compared to cells exposed only to TNF-α, as determined by immunofluorescence. Tea polyphenols also time-dependently decreased the paracellular flux of TNF-α-treated keratinocytes. In conclusion, the ability of tea polyphenols to exert an anti-inflammatory effect and to attenuate the gingival epithelial barrier dysfunction induced by TNF-α supports their potential for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease.","The relationship between vitamin C status, the gut-liver axis, and metabolic syndrome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640128,Redox biology,2019 04 01,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of cardiometabolic risk factors, which together predict increased risk of more serious chronic diseases. We propose that one consequence of dietary overnutrition is increased abundance of Gram-negative bacteria in the gut that cause increased inflammation, impaired gut function, and endotoxemia that further dysregulate the already compromised antioxidant vitamin status in MetS. This discussion is timely because ""healthy"" individuals are no longer the societal norm and specialized dietary requirements are needed for the growing prevalence of MetS. Further, these lines of evidence provide the foundational basis for investigation that poor vitamin C status promotes endotoxemia, leading to metabolic dysfunction that impairs vitamin E trafficking through a mechanism involving the gut-liver axis. This report will establish a critical need for translational research aimed at validating therapeutic approaches to manage endotoxemia-an early, but inflammation-inducing phenomenon, which not only occurs in MetS, but is also prognostic of more advanced metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as the increasing severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases.",HSP22 suppresses diabetes-induced endothelial injury by inhibiting mitochondrial reactive oxygen species formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640127,Redox biology,2019 04 01,"The induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) by hyperglycemia is a key event responsible for endothelial activation and injury. Heat shock protein 22 (HSP22) is a stress-inducible protein associated with cytoprotection and apoptosis inhibition. However, whether HSP22 prevents hyperglycemia-induced vascular endothelial injury remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether HSP22 protects the vascular endothelium from hyperglycemia-induced injury by reducing mtROS production. We used a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection model to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, metabolic syndrome) and exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to high glucose following overexpression or silencing of HSP22 to explore the role of HSP22. We found that HSP22 markedly inhibited endothelial cell activation and vascular lesions by inhibiting endothelial adhesion and decreasing cytokine secretion. We performed confocal microscopy and flow cytometry assays using HUVECs and showed that HSP22 attenuated mtROS and mitochondrial dysfunction in hyperglycemia-stimulated endothelial cells. Mechanistically, using the mtROS inhibitor MitoTEMPO, we demonstrated that HSP22 suppressed endothelial activation and injury by eliminating hyperglycemia-mediated increases in mtROS. Furthermore, we found that HSP22 maintained the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission by mitigating mtROS in vitro. HSP22 attenuated the development of vascular lesions by suppressing mtROS-mediated endothelial activation in a T2DM mouse model. This study provides evidence that HSP22 may be a promising therapeutic target for vascular complications in T2DM.",Printable QR code paper microfluidic colorimetric assay for screening volatile biomarkers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640126,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 05 09,"We present a QR code paper microfluidic colorimetric assay that can exploit the hardware and software on mobile devices, and circumvent sample preparation by directly targeting volatile biomarkers. Our platform is a printable microarray of well-defined reaction regions, which outputs an instant diagnosis by directing the user to a URL containing their test result, while simultaneously storing epidemiological data for remote access and bioinformatics. To assist in the rapid identification of Escherichia coli in bloodstream infections, we employed an existing colorimetric reagent (p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde) and adapted its use to detect volatile indole, a biomarker produced by E. coli. Our assay was able to quantitatively detect indole in the headspace of E. coli culture after 12 h of growth (27.0 ± 3.1 ppm), assisting in species-level identification hours earlier than existing methods. Results were confirmed with headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-ToFMS), which estimated indole concentration in E. coli culture to average 32.3 ± 5.2 ppm after 12 h of growth.

The FP detection can rapidly sense ligand-analyte bindings by measuring molecule mobility, and thus, FP-based assays have been widely used for rapid diagnostics in clinics. Here, we implemented the FP detection apparatus using a 3D-printed compact holder and the built-in camera of a smartphone. The system offers accurate measurements of the degree of polarization by simultaneously detecting the fluorescence intensities parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of the excitation. The fluorescence signal of the sample is excited by a laser or light-emitting diode and separated by a polarization beam cube depending on the polarization. Parallel and perpendicular polarized emissions are projected onto two different regions of the sensor chip in the smartphone camera. A custom software app was developed to count the average intensity in the areas of interest and compute the degree of polarization. We validated the system by measuring the polarization of dye molecules dissolved in solutions with different viscosities. As an example of biomolecule sensing, a competitive FP immunoassay of Prostaglandin E2 was demonstrated using the developed system and exhibited the limit of detection of 1.57 ng/mL. The smartphone-based FP assay platform can also be implemented for the detection of toxins, disease biomarkers, and pathogens in resource-limited settings.",Focusing aptamer selection on the glycan structure of prostate-specific antigen: Toward more specific detection of prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640124,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 05 09,"The development of chemical sensors capable of detecting the specific glycosylation patterns of proteins offers a powerful mean for the early detection of cancer. Unfortunately, this strategy is scarcely explored because receptors recognizing the glycans linked to proteins are challenging to discover. In this work, we describe a simple method for directing the selection of aptamers toward the glycan structure of the glycoproteins, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as a model target. Using this strategy, we identified one aptamer (PSA-1) that binds the glycan moiety of PSA with reasonable affinity (a dissociation constant of 177 ± 65 nM). Interestingly, an electrochemical sensor with a sandwich format employing the identified aptamer as a signaling receptor, provides a tool of discriminating human PSA from the unglycosylated protein, with a limit of detection of 0.66 ng/mL. The sensor responds to different levels of PSA in serum, correlating well with chemiluminescence ELISA used in hospitals even with higher potential to discriminate clinically meaningful prostate cancer. Although validation on a larger cohort is needed, this is the first demonstration of an aptamer-based sensor to detect PSA by focusing in its glycan moiety.",E-DNA detection of rpoB gene resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in real samples using Fe3O4/polypyrrole nanocomposite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640123,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 05 09,"In this work, we achieved the selective detection of wild and mutated rpoB gene in M. tuberculosis using an electrochemical DNA (E-DNA) sensor based on polypyrrole/Fe3O4 nanocomposite bearing redox naphthoquinone tag on PAMAM (spaNQ/PAMAM/PPy/Fe3O4). The hybridization between a given probe and the complementary DNA target induced a large decrease in the naphthoquinone redox signal as measured by SWV and no cross-hybridization with single nucleotide mismatch DNA target occurred. Thanks to the catalytic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles combined with conducting properties of polypyrrole platform, we demonstrated that the transducing system allowed the detection of 1 fM of DNA target in a 50-µL drop corresponding to 3 × 104 copies of DNA. The sensor was able to detect the rpoB gene in PCR-amplified samples of genomic DNA and could also discriminate between the wild type rpoB gene and a single nucleotide mutated rpoB gene that provides resistance﻿ to rifampicin. Furthermore, the sensor could selectively detect the wild and mutant DNA in genomic samples without PCR amplification.","Changing trends in the Turkish maternal deaths, with a focus on direct and indirect causes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640122,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 30,Our aim is to evaluate trends in the direct and indirect causes' distribution using data from National Maternal Mortality Surveillance (2012-2015).,"Cryopreservation of human spermatozoa by vitrification versus conventional rapid freezing: Effects on motility, viability, morphology and cellular defects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640121,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 30,"Sperm cryopreservation has great potential for male infertility treatment as used in assisted reproduction technology (ART).

Spatially explicit exposure models offer a quantitative approach for evaluating and managing the potentially toxic effects of chronic fluoride consumption on wildlife. We monitored eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) inhabiting a high-fluoride environment in the buffer zone of an aluminium smelter in southeastern Australia between 2010 and 2013. We measured fluoride levels at 19 pasture sites and determined the foraging range of 37 individual kangaroos. A series of generalised linear models were developed to estimate bone fluoride accumulation as a function of pasture exposure. Model outputs were compared to identify the most appropriate predictive tool for kangaroo bone fluoride accumulation relative to exposure. Accounting for age there was a negative association between bone fluoride concentration and distance of the central emission point from both the mean centre of foraging range and the point of death. The mean foraging range centre was the best predictor, with point of death just as suitable (and simpler), whereas more complex parameters such as monthly and cumulative fluoride exposure were poor predictors of bone fluoride concentration. The more complex dietary fluoride exposure estimates did not improve predictive capability compared with the simple, spatial models. We conclude that in actively managed wildlife populations, simple, locally validated models can provide estimates of bone fluoride accumulation sufficient to support decision-making."

Abandonment of channelization structures in a 2.3-km-long reach within a forested corridor was followed by considerable channel widening during floods of 30- and 35-year recurrence interval, re-establishment of a multi-thread channel pattern and island development. Morphological and botanical surveys were conducted annually between 2011 and 2017 to determine the processes and patterns governing development of islands and their floristic complexity. Hydraulic conditions promoting establishment and persistence of islands were determined with one-dimensional hydraulic modelling of flood flows for 8 unmanaged river cross-sections with islands and 8 cross-sections in the adjacent channelized reaches. Average age, number of islands and their average and total area in the reach markedly increased over the study period. However, the increase was not steady but moderated by island erosion by flood flows, island establishment shortly after major floods and island coalescence in the years without such floods. Hydraulic modelling indicated that river cross-sections with islands are typified by significantly lower values of mean water depth, flow velocity, unit stream power and bed shear stress at flood flows than cross-sections in the adjacent, channelized reaches. Such conditions promote deposition of living driftwood on channel bars, initiating island development, and reduce the probability of erosion of existing islands. The total number of plant species on islands varied highly and either exceeded or was similar to that recorded on riparian forest plots in particular years. This study indicates that (i) island re-establishment in the river was initiated by substantial channel widening, (ii) variation in flood magnitudes exerts a considerable influence on the trajectory of island development, and (iii) the contribution of islands to the overall species richness of plant communities in the river corridor at early stages of island re-establishment may be highly varied.",Assessment of metals mobility during the alkaline treatment of highly acid phosphogypsum leachates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640108,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"This research evaluates the feasibility of an alkaline treatment system for highly acid leachates from a phosphogypsum stack located in an estuarine environment degraded by such pollution. The presented methodology consists of the addition of a Ca(OH)2 solution to the different types of phosphogypsum-related acidic leachates with the aim to increase their pH and subsequently, to provoke the precipitation and immobilization of the dissolved contaminants. In fact, phosphates and fluorides reached removal of 100% and 90%, respectively. As regards metals, removal values close to 100% were reached for Fe, Al, Cr, Cd, U and Zn, whereas it did not seem to be totally effective for other elements such as As (removal of 57-82%) and Sb (4-36%). The decrease of contaminant concentrations was caused probably by co-precipitation and/or adsorption to phosphate phases, together with by fluoride precipitation. The solid phases formed during the treatment were subjected to two standard leaching tests (EN 12457-2 from the EU and TCLP from the US) in order to conduct a risk and management assessment. In this context, some of the precipitates formed during the treatment would be classified as hazardous wastes, due to the high concentration of As leached. Moreover, the potential economic costs of a convectional active treatment system were also explored. This study sets the basis for a new research line with the aim to minimise the impact of the phosphogypsum stacks worldwide to their adjacent environment.","Properties of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in Shandong, China: Daily fluctuation, influencing factors, and spatiotemporal distribution.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640107,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Characteristics of the spatial and temporal distribution of air pollutants may reveal the cause of air pollution, especially for large regions where the anthropogenic pollutant emission is concentrated. This study addresses this issue by focusing on Shandong province, which has the highest air pollutant emissions in China. First, the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of the observed concentrations of conventional pollutants are analyzed in detail. The most prominent indicator of the problem (PM2.5), was selected as the key analytical object. On the spatial scale, the Multivariate Moran model was used to identify factors affecting the spatial distribution of PM2.5. On the time scale, wavelet analysis was used to explore the fluctuation characteristics of PM2.5 at different time periods. Results show that there are significant regional differences in pollutant concentration within Shandong province. The concentration of particulate matter and gaseous pollutants in western and northern Shandong is significantly higher than eastern Shandong. The average concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 were highest in winter and lowest in summer, whereas concentration of O3 peaked in summer. For PM2.5, the annual mean concentration has a significant spatial correlation with SO2 emission, GDP per capita, population density and energy consumption per unit of GDP; in addition, the correlation between different regions and various indices is different. On the time scale, the fluctuation energy of PM2.5 concentrated in Dezhou and Liaocheng is the strongest on December 18 and 19, 2015. The inversion temperature has a strong influence on the daily variation of PM2.5 concentration. The formation and evolution of atmospheric pollution, therefore, can be explored by combining the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants, providing a comprehensive analytical method for atmospheric pollution in different regions.",Understanding urban expansion combining macro patterns and micro dynamics in three Southeast Asian megacities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640106,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Rapid urbanization accelerates urban expansion, especially in populous areas, such as Southeast Asia. The urban forms and changes at the macro level and the dynamics at the patch level are interrelated. Considering its spatiotemporal interdependences and global-local interactions, we propose a framework to quantify urban expansion by combining macro patterns and micro dynamics. Taking three Southeast Asian megacities, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and Manila, as examples, we calculate the urban land densities in concentric rings (macro pattern) and the proximity expansion index (PEI) of new urban patches (micro dynamic) to compare the urban form changes and expansion patterns based on Landsat imagery in 1990, 2000, and 2014. The results show that the urban form changes have close relationships with the local urban patch dynamics. The macro- and micro-level results in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City are interrelated and consistent and the explainable inconsistent results in Manila further reveal the necessity of combination of two scopes. The three megacities developed in different manners, thereby resulting in diverse urban forms and changes. Other methods and technologies combining macro and micro perspectives are encouraged to better understand urban expansion.",The design of a polyaniline-decorated three dimensional W18O49 composite for full solar spectrum light driven photocatalytic removal of aqueous nitrite with high N2 selectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640105,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Photocatalysis using solar energy is the most promising green technology for nitrite removal. However, effective photocatalytic performance is often challenged by the limited light absorption, utilization of expensive noble metals and undesired products (nitrate and ammonium). Here, we report for the first time that a full solar light response polyaniline-decorated three dimensional W18O49 composite (PANI@W18O49), a noble metal-free photocatalyst, possesses excellent photocatalytic activity for aqueous nitrite removal with high N2 selectivity. The prepared sample was thoroughly identified via XRD, Raman, FTIR, SEM, TEM, UV-vis DRS and PL. The catalytic results demonstrated that over 80% N2 selectivity (initial concentration 1.0 mM) was achieved through the PANI@W18O49 without sacrificial agent under 300 W Xe lamp irradiation for 60 min. Such advantages were attributed to the built-in junction between n-type W18O49 and p-type PANI, offering suitable redox levels of electron-hole pairs for NO2- reaction. The modification of PANI also benefited the light harvesting ability and activated carriers migration, the calculated rate constant of PANI@W18O49 is about four times as high as that of W18O49. The current study not only prepared a promising photocatalyst, but also provides new insights into improving the photocatalytic activity and N2 selectivity for nitrite treatment.",Removal of steroid hormones and biocides from rural wastewater by an integrated constructed wetland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640104,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"Steroid hormones and biocides are regarded as emerging contaminants in rural wastewater in China, owing to their widespread occurrence and adverse effects on both aquatic organisms and humans. Constructed wetlands (CWs) are an alternative technology for cost-effective and efficient decentralized rural sewage treatment. In this study, an integrated constructed wetland (ICW) system was built and used to treat a typical rural wastewater mixture composed of domestic sewage and livestock wastewater from a small village. As expected, five steroid hormones (ADD, AED, 19-NTD, T, and P) and four biocides (DEET, TCS, CBD, and MP) were detected in the influent in concentrations ranging from 30.5 ± 1.25 ng/L to 105 ± 5.14 ng/L and from 63.4 ± 2.85 ng/L to 515 ± 19.7 ng/L, respectively. The ICW system effectively removed the detected steroid hormones (97.4 ± 0.09%) and biocides (92.4 ± 0.54%). Based on the measured concentrations, the total pollution loadings of the detected steroid hormones and biocides in the influent were calculated to be 2330 ± 26.5 μg/day and 5710 ± 196 μg/day, which decreased to 60.8 ± 1.44 μg/day and 433 ± 25.6 μg/day in the final effluent. The risk quotients for these steroid hormones and biocides in the effluent from the ICW system were lower than those from reported wastewater treatment plants, indicating that CWs are a promising technology for removing contaminants including steroid hormones and biocides in rural wastewater, although additional efforts are required to optimize and improve the design of CWs before the steroid hormones and biocides present in the effluent can be safely and directly discharged into the environment.","Lead isotopic fingerprinting as a tracer to identify the pollution sources of heavy metals in the southeastern zone of Baiyin, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640103,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Baiyin (Gansu Province, China) is a heavily industrialized city with non-ferrous metal mining, ore dressing, and chemical production. The surrounding district has suffered from serious heavy metals (HMs) contamination over half a century. In this study, a Pb isotopic approach was adopted to trace the sources of HMs and explore the environmental behaviors of HMs in the area surrounding Baiyin. HMs concentrations in topsoil showed a clear decrease as the distance from the ore district increased, which suggested that atmospheric transportation is one of the main pathways of HMs dispersal. The Dongdagou irrigation area was an exception where contaminated water from Dongdagou had been used for a long time. The plots of 206Pb/207Pb vs. 208Pb/206Pb and 1/Pb vs. 206Pb/207Pb from the topsoil samples could be described in terms of a binary mixing model with the two average 206Pb/207Pb end-members being (1) the mining and smelting activities (1.1494) and (2) the soil background (1.1992). The relative anthropogenic contribution quickly decreased from 88.3% in the ore district to 30.6% in the Yellow River irrigation area. These results suggested that HMs in the Baiyin District were mainly contributed by anthropogenic mining and smelting activities. The isotope ratios of 206Pb/207Pb in the sediments maintained a consistent low level from the ore district to the Yellow River irrigation area, thereby suggesting that HMs from anthropogenic sources could also be transported over a long distance in the river systems. Moreover, the positive correlation between S content and HMs concentrations in topsoil and sediment confirmed that the HMs mainly originated from the sulfide deposits and smelters.",Road effects on bat activity depend on surrounding habitat type.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640102,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"The effects of roads on bats are still a poorly documented issue. Most of the available research focuses on large and high-traffic highways, while low-medium-traffic roads are often assumed to have negligible impacts. However, small roads are ubiquitous in landscapes around the world. We examined the effects of these roads, as well as habitat types, on the activity of three bat guilds (short-, mid- and long-range echolocators) and the most common bat species Pipistrellus kuhlii. We performed three bat acoustic surveys between May and October 2015, with these surveys being performed along twenty transects that were each 1000 m long and perpendicular to three roads with different traffic volumes. The surveys were performed in dense Mediterranean woodland (""montado"") and open agricultural field habitats, which were the two dominant land uses. At each transect, bat activity was simultaneously registered at 0, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 m from the road with the use of an ultrasound recorder. According to the generalized linear mixed effects models, the overall activity of bats and of the short- and mid-range echolocators increased with increased distance from the roads and was dependent on the surrounding habitats. In contrast, the long-range echolocators and P. kuhlii were more tolerant to road. Our results also show that the activity was higher in woodland areas, however road verges seem to be a significant habitat in an open agricultural landscape. The major negative effects extended to approximately 300 m from the roads in woodlands and penetrate further into the open field (>500 m). The management of roadside vegetation, combined with the bat habitat improvement in areas that are further from the roads, may mitigate the negative effects. To make road-dominated landscapes safer for bats, the transport agencies need to balance the trade-offs between habitat management and road kill risk.","Highly time-resolved analysis of seasonal water dynamics and algal kinetics based on in-situ multi-sensor-system monitoring data in Lake Taihu, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640101,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"Predicting algal blooms is challenging due to rapid growth rates under suitable conditions and the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes involved. Physico-chemical parameters, monitored in this study by a high-resolution in-situ multi-sensor system and derived from lab-based water sample analyses, show the seasonal variation and have different degrees of vertical gradients across the water column. Through analyzing the changes and relations between multi-factors, we reveal pictures of water quality dynamics and algal kinetics. Nitrate has regular seasonal changes different to the seasonal patterns of total dissolved Phosphorus. Positive correlations are found between Chlorophyll a fluorescence and temperature, wind-induced resuspension and mixing promote the augment of Cyanobacteria fluorescence (Phycocyanin) signal. While the resuspension can also result in the increase of turbidity and affect the light environment for hydrophytes, the algal scums are the main reason for the high turbidity on the surface, which lower the illumination radiation in the water body. Those parameters are the primary dominants responsible for the change of algae from our monitoring data, which could be used as indicators for the dynamic changes of algae in the future.",Treatment of de-icing contaminated surface water runoff along an airport runway using in-situ soil enriched with structural filter materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640100,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Airport surface runoff during wintertime contains high concentrations of pavement de-icing fluids (PDFs). Uncontrolled discharge of this runoff poses a potential environmental hazard for the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem. Several technologies for collection, transportation and treatment of contaminated runoff water are available, mainly technical systems, which require high operation and maintenance efforts. For moderately contaminated runoff, the discharge to a wastewater treatment plant is usually applied. In this study, a passive soil-based filter is proposed to treat the contaminated surface water runoff. The degradation of two PDFs was under investigation, namely Safeway® KA-Hot based on potassium acetate, and urea. The main research objective was to determine the capability of the in-situ soil and a soil based filter using zeolite and perlite as additional filter media to degrade the organic pollutants in the runoff. Column experiments at temperatures between 3 °C and 5 °C were carried out to determine the degradation potential when using 50% in-situ soil mixed with zeolite and perlite. Besides TOC, the nitrogen degradation was also under investigation. Due to the low temperatures, available nutrients are a key factor for the TOC degrading microorganisms. Overall TOC reduction rates were found from 76% up to 98%, with TOC effluent concentrations in the range of 18 to 870 mg·L-1, depending on the influent concentration. Based on the results, the use of a soil-based filter is a promising, passive, natural based solution for the treatment of de-icing runoff."

This study presents an integrated analysis of land use dynamics and the resultant ecological impacts on sustainable development over the past 25 years (1990-2015) in response to urban development. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were employed to examine the spatiotemporal trajectory of land use changes. Based on the analysis of the equivalent factor table for land use types and ecosystem services value (ESV), the value of ecosystem services was calculated in the case study of Fuyang, China. Correlations were identified between ESV and a family of landscape fragmentation metrics. The results showed that the area affected by land use changes represented 33.35% of the total study area and caused a 31.74 million US$·a-1 decrease in ESV from 1990 to 2015. The ESV was spatially imbalanced and generally low in urban areas. Ecological plans for cropland reforestation and urban green projects were effective in slowing ESV losses while urban areas rapidly developed. In addition, total ESV was negatively correlated with edge density (ED), patch density (PD), landscape shape index (LSI), and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) but positively correlated with aggregation index (AI), suggesting that landscape fragmentation had an adverse impact on the overall ESV in Fuyang. Therefore, sustainable land use planning must be integrated with landscape patterns to provide useful guidance regarding the spatial regulation of a given area to protect and improve ecosystem services.",Experimental designs of field-based constructed floating wetland studies: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640088,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"A Constructed Floating Wetland (CFW) is a relatively recent innovation in stormwater treatment and is a hydroponic device that is designed to move up and down with changing water levels as urban runoff enters a stormwater retention pond. This floating capability is designed to improve the pollutant removal efficiency of the CFW. The CFW studies undertaken so far have produced encouraging results under a range of conditions such as system size, inflow pollutant concentrations, climatic conditions, and coverage ratio. However, these results have not yet been drawn together to better understand how the various design features of a CFW influence its performance. This paper reviews the available field investigations with the aim of helping guide and improve the experimental designs and installations of future CFW installations. This in turn will improve the knowledge and acceptance of these recently developed stormwater treatment systems. One of the findings of this review was that using a percentage coverage design approach may not be as effective as improving the design efficiency. Understanding the hydraulics of the entire pond and CFW system is also critical to effective design. The review also found that the performance evaluation of future CFW installations would be improved if consideration is given to including both baseline monitoring and experimental controls.",Characterization and quantification of PM2.5 emissions and PAHs concentration in PM2.5 from the exhausts of diesel vehicles with various accumulated mileages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640087,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Road traffic is one of the main sources of particulate matter in the atmospheric environment. Notwithstanding its significance, there are noteworthy challenges in quantitative assessment of its contribution to the concentrations of airborne. This study reports on the characterization and quantification of PM2.5 emissions and PAHs concentration in PM2.5 from the exhausts of on-road diesel vehicles with various accumulated mileages in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. Urban areas could be a subject matter not just in connection to deprived air quality, but similarly to pollution of other significant environmental media by air contaminants. To that end, our study intends to estimate the PM2.5 emissions from diesel vehicles using diesel fuels and to analyze the PM2.5 emissions and PAHs concentration in PM2.5. In this study, particulate matters (PM2.5) were characterized and quantified from a place impacted by diesel vehicles fueled with diesel in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The tested diesel vehicles with various accumulated mileages overs the model year comprising of the vehicles registered from 1984 to 2012 from different manufacturers (or brands) ranging from 8733 to 965,026 km (average 445,433 km) accumulative mileages. Exhaust constituents include CO, NOx, PM2.5 and particle phase PAHs. The concentrations of twenty-one (21) priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were studied in the samples by their relationship with atmospheric PM2.5. However, in relations to cumulative mileages, lower cumulative mileage (mileage <20,000 km) has the lowest CO and NOx emission factors. The mileage ranged from 20,001 to 30,000 km had an increased CO and NOx emission factors, respectively. Interestingly, with the increased high number of mileages ranged from 30,001 to 50,000 km, CO and NOx emission factor was observed to be declining, respectively. This could be attributed to the technological changes on new diesel vehicle models. But nonetheless, the trend of CO emission factor was found to be higher with an increasing of cumulative mileages as compared to the mileage that reached lower than 30,000 km.",Impacts of Chinese Grain for Green program and climate change on vegetation in the Loess Plateau during 1982-2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640086,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"Remote sensing based vegetation index provides a practical method for the monitoring of vegetation dynamics at regional and global scales. Here, using a long-term remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, we quantified the vegetation changes in the Loess Plateau (LP) over the last three decades (1982-2015), which includes the period before the Chinese""Grain for Green Program""(GGP) was launched (1982-1999), and the period after the GGP (1999-2015). The correlations between the NDVI and four climate related variables, i.e., precipitation, temperature, root-soil moisture (RSM), and a drought proxy-standardized evapotranspiration deficit index (SEDI), were also examined. The results indicated that, (i) the GGP strongly changed the vegetation in the LP. The growing-season mean NDVI (GSM-NDVI) and the annual mean NDVI (AM-NDVI) decreased slightly before the GGP launched in 1999, with slopes of -3.38×10-3 and-8.00×10-4year-1, respectively. However, they showed slight and significant (p<0.05) increases after the GGP, with slopes of 4.75×10-3 and 2.32×10-3year-1, respectively. (ii) Climate change (i.e., warming and drying) resulted in adverse effects on vegetation in the LP during the period before the GGP. However, the observed changes (i.e., wetting and reduced drought) exerted positive effects on the vegetation during the period after the GGP. (iii) Inter-annual variations of spatially averaged NDVI over the LP were primarily determined by RSM rather than any other climate related variables. In the southeastern LP, the inter-annual variation of GSM-NDVI was mainly determined by precipitation and SEDI, while the inter-annual variation of AM-NDVI was mainly caused by SEDI and RSM. Inter-annual variations of both GSM-NDVI and AM-NDVI were mainly determined by SEDI and RSM in the northwestern LP, and by temperature in the southwestern LP.",A new molecular weight (MW) descriptor of dissolved organic matter to represent the MW-dependent distribution of aromatic condensation: Insights from biodegradation and pyrene binding experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640085,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"In this study, we utilized a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) system that was equipped with a fluorescence emission scanning mode to explore the heterogeneous distribution of the humification index (HIX) values within bulk dissolved organic matter (DOM). The HIX-based SEC chromatograms showed that the molecular weight (MW)-dependent distribution of aromatic condensation was heavily affected by the DOM sources and the progress of biodegradation. The HIX heterogeneity across different MW was more pronounced for terrestrial versus aquatic DOM sources. Microbial incubation of leaf litter DOM led to the initial enhancement of the HIX at a relatively low MW, followed by a gradual increase at larger MW values. The dynamic changes of the HIX can be attributed to (1) the preferential removal of non-aromatic or less-aromatic molecules by microorganisms, (2) the production of microbial metabolites, (3) microbial humification, and (4) self-assemblage of humic-like molecules. From the SEC chromatograms, the HIX-based average molecular weight (or MWHIX) was proposed as a unifying surrogate to represent an MW that was highly associated with aromatic condensation. The MWHIX discriminated four different DOM sources and described well the biodegradation-induced changes. The MWHIX also presented a good positive correlation with pyrene organic carbon-normalized binding coefficients (Koc). The prediction capability of the MWHIX for pyrene Koc was higher than those based on the single descriptors of bulk DOM, such as HIX and MW, which revealed its superior linkage with the DOM reactivity related to both MW and HIX.",The potential use of Piwi-interacting RNA biomarkers in forensic body fluid identification: A proof-of-principle study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640084,Forensic science international. Genetics,2019 03 14,"In the forensic community, RNA profiling has been investigated as a potential method to identify body fluids. Several RNA molecules, including messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA), have been explored as biomarkers to distinguish different body fluids and have led to considerable interest in the development of RNA biomarkers for forensic purposes. Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), a class of noncoding RNAs, is a potential biomarker for body fluid identification because of its short length (˜24-32 nt) and specific expression pattern in human tissues. In this proof-of-principle study, we examined the expression levels of four carefully selected piRNAs in forensically relevant biological fluids (venous blood, saliva, semen, menstrual blood and vaginal secretions) using TaqMan quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan qPCR). piR-55521, which was not detectable in saliva, can differentiate semen from other body fluids because it was strongly expressed in semen compared to the remaining three fluids (> 4000-fold change). Furthermore, piR-55521 could be detected in semen samples made from as little as 200 pg of total RNA, and addition of female component had no effect on the detection limit. Furthermore, the expression differences of other piRNAs, piR-61648, piR-43994 and piR-33151, were statistically significant between at least two types of body fluids. Stability tests also indicated that these piRNAs could be effectively detected in dried samples under laboratory and outdoor conditions for at least six months. Although limited to four piRNAs, this study suggests that the expression pattern of piRNAs could be used to identify body fluids, and that piRNA (piR-55521) is specifically expressed in semen. Such findings suggest that additional work could identify other piRNAs that could serve as biomarkers to identify body fluids.",A comparative study for the isolation of exogenous trace DNA from fingernails.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640083,Forensic science international. Genetics,2019 03 14,"Often fingernails from a victim or suspect involved in a physical assault, such as murder or sexual assault, are submitted to crime laboratories for DNA testing of foreign/exogenous biological material; however, very few studies have been conducted comparing the effectiveness of different sampling methods on the removal of foreign/exogenous DNA while minimizing the fingernail endogenous DNA. In this study three different sampling methods (swabbing, PBS soak, and PrepFiler® lysis buffer soak) were compared in order to identify one that minimizes the amount of endogenous DNA removed and maximizes the amount of foreign/exogenous male DNA removed. The samples were processed using the Tecan HIDEVO150 robot in order to reduce analyst time and the DNA mixtures were interpreted using the probabilistic genotyping software STRmix™. For each sampling method the quantity of male DNA, the mixture proportions, the number of foreign/exogenous male alleles detected, the amount of DNA degradation, and the discrimination power via the likelihood ratio obtained for the foreign/exogenous male DNA donor were determined and compared. The PrepFiler® lysis buffer soak and swabbing sampling methods appear to be equally effective at removing foreign/exogenous DNA from fingernails; however, the lysis buffer soak sampling method extracts more female endogenous DNA from the fingernail and the female DNA is degraded. Marginally higher likelihood ratios were obtained for the swab samples versus the PrepFiler® lysis buffer soak samples; therefore, it was determined that the swabbing sampling method was the best sampling method for the recovery of foreign exogenous DNA from fingernails while minimizing the amount of endogenous DNA removed.",Perinatal polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated dibenzofurans exposure are associated with DNA methylation changes lasting to early adulthood: Findings from Yucheng second generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640082,Environmental research,2019 02 03,"Epigenome-wide DNA methylation has not been studied in men perinatally exposed to PCBs and dioxins. Therefore, we examined whether perinatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) induces sustained methylation changes lasting to early adulthood. We used the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to assess DNA methylation in whole blood among Yucheng second generation (people perinatal exposed to high PCBs and PCDFs) compared with referents. Thirty male offspring from the Yucheng cohort were randomly selected and matched with 30 male offspring from the Yucheng' neighborhood referents with similar backgrounds. Methylation differences between the Yucheng second generation and non-exposed referents were identified using a P value < 1.06 × 10-7. Differential DNA methylation with epigenome-wide statistical significance was observed for 20 CpGs mapped to 11 genes, and 19 CpGs were correlated with gestational levels of PCBs or PCDF toxic equivalency (PCDF-TEQ) with the same direction of effect. Among the 11 genes, AHRR and CYP1A1 are involved in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway known to mediate dioxin toxicity. MYO1G, FRMD4A, ARL4C, OLFM1, and WWC3 were previously reported to be related to carcinogenesis. This is the first study examining genome-wide DNA methylation among people perinatally exposed to high concentrations of PCBs and PCDFs. We observed novel differential methylation of several genes, indicating that modifications of DNA methylation associated with perinatal PCB and PCDF exposure may persist in exposed offspring for more than 20 years. Furthermore, involvement of several carcinogesis-related genes suggested a potential in utero epigenetic mechanisms.",Determinants of oil-spill cleanup participation following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640081,Environmental research,2019 02 05,"On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, spilling over 4.9 million barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico over an 87-day period and developing into a long-term environmental disaster that affected people living in Gulf Coast states.

The morphology, component, functional groups and electromagnetic properties are detected by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra (FTIR), Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) and Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). Compared to non-covalently bonded nanocomposites, the covalently bonded CoFe2O4/graphene nanocomposites have outstanding electromagnetic wave absorption properties. We found that the maximum reflection loss value reached at -55.2 dB and the absorption bandwidth with reflection loss below -10 dB was about 5.4 GHz at 1.7 mm of thickness. The efficiency is attributed to the introduction of amide bonds in the nanocomposites. As a stable carrier channel, amide bonds can promote the migration rate of electrons and binding degree between CoFe2O4 and graphene nanosheets, which provide a crucial impact on electromagnetic parameters and polarization modes of materials, thus improving the absorption capacity of electromagnetic waves. It can be inferred that the nanocomposites have a broad application prospect in the field of electronic instruments, aerospace, military radars and national defense security fields.","Water loading driven size, shape, and composition of cetyltrimethylammonium/hexanol/pentane reverse micelles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640068,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 03 04,"Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/hexanol reverse micelles have found a variety of applications that demand control over physical parameters. Water content or loading is among the most basic tunable components and is the major driver of the physical properties of these systems. This study uses small-angle scattering with contrast variation to characterize these systems as a function of water loading. The scattering data were analyzed with a variety of approaches, resulting in converging physical specifications. Equations that describe basic physical parameters were determined that allow for characterization and manipulation of the CTAB/hexanol reverse micelle surfactant system. The shape of the reverse micelles was revealed to be slightly ellipsoidal and varies slightly through the water loading range. The surfactant shell is shown to contain a higher fraction of hexanol upon addition of water. Analysis reveals that the size, shape, and surfactant/cosurfactant composition are directly tunable by variation of the water content and that these properties are consequences of the balance of forces present in the reverse micelles.",Role of particles in the rheology of solid-stabilized high internal phase emulsions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640067,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 03 04,The presence of colloidal particles on fluid interfaces can have a significant impact on the rheology of solid-stabilized high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs).,Long-term physical evolution of an elastomeric ultrasound contrast microbubble.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640066,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 03 04,"One of the main assets of crosslinked polymer-shelled microbubbles (MBs) as ultrasound-active theranostic agents is the robustness of the shells, combined with the chemical versatility in modifying the surface with ligands and/or drugs.

Previous studies showed the role of second language (L2) proficiency, as a proxy for dominance, on language control. However, the role of other aspects of the bilingual experience - such as age of acquisition and daily exposure - are relatively unexplored. In this study, we used a cued language switching task to examine language switching and mixing in two groups of highly proficient bilinguals with different linguistic backgrounds, to understand how the ability to control languages is shaped by linguistic experience. Our analysis shows that the ability to switch between languages is not only modulated by L2 proficiency, but also by daily L2 exposure. Daily L2 exposure also affects language mixing. Finally, L2 age of acquisition predicts naming latencies in the L2. Together, these findings show that language dominance is characterised by multiple aspects of the bilingual experience, which modulate language control.",Generation of an induced pluripotent stem cell line (CSC-46) from a patient with Parkinson's disease carrying a novel p.R301C mutation in the GBA gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640063,Stem cell research,2019 04 30,"Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene have been associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). An induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line was generated from a 60-year old patient diagnosed with PD and carrying a new mutation variant p.R301C in GBA. Using non-integrating Sendai virus-based technology, we utilized OCT3/4, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4 transcription factors to reprogram skin fibroblasts into iPSCs. The generated iPSC line retained the mutation, displayed expression of common pluripotency markers, differentiated into the three germ layers, and exhibited normal karyotype.

We show in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) that an ambient oxygen-induced oxidative stress response elicited by culture in a hypoxic atmosphere (0.5% O2) correlates with the expression of 2OG dioxygenases, which oxidise DNA (TET1, 2, 3) and histone H3 (KDM4C), the former reflected by elevation in genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). siRNA-mediated targeting of KDM4C and TET1-3 induces hESC differentiation. Under ambient atmospheric oxygen (21% O2), exposure to a low inhibitory concentration of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, IC10), as a model of chemically-induced oxidative stress, suppresses antioxidant gene expression, reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and induces hESC differentiation. Co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine promoted anti-oxidant, pluripotency and 2OG dioxygenase gene expression, elevated genomic hydroxymethylation and blocked induction of differentiation. Transient ectopic expression of KDM4C or TET1 in ambient atmospheric oxygen achieved the same.

Pre-licensure nursing students rarely have opportunities to practice interprofessional communication skills with other healthcare providers even though lack of this skill competency may lead to patient harm. This article explores the feasibility of using story-guided online deliberate practice sessions as an educational strategy to improve students' interprofessional critical communication competency. The design and testing of asynchronous online deliberate practice session prototypes is described and the implementation and evaluation of two online deliberate practice sessions into a nursing course is reported. The online format provided students with convenient opportunities to develop competency in critical communication skills using SBAR in a safe environment. Results from the prototype testing and student evaluation indicated that students had an overall positive experience. The online deliberate practice sessions provided a low-cost, flexible practice experience to develop critical communication skills and were evaluated as highly satisfactory and easy to navigate. The optimal number of practice sessions needed to attain competency, retain skills, and impact patient outcomes require further longitudinal study.","Reliability and validity study of the Spanish adaptation of the ""Creighton Simulation Evaluation Instrument (C-SEI)"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640046,Nurse education in practice,2019 04 29,"There are multiple advantages to using human patient simulation (HPS) as a teaching method for clinical nursing education.

AFT was subjected to stress degradation studies under hydrolytic (acid, base and neutral), oxidative, thermal and photolytic conditions to investigate the inherent stability of the drug. The present study describes the simple and rapid HPLC method development for the selective separation of the AFT and its degradation products. The drug and degradation products were separated on Agilent Eclipse plus C18 (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μ) column with ammonium acetate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.7) in gradient elution mode. The drug was found to be unstable in all the conditions studied. The developed chromatographic method was extended to tandem mass spectrometry (QTOF-MS) for the characterization of the degradation products. A total of 11 unknown degradation products were characterized using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS/MS). Two major degradation products (DP2 and DP3) were isolated using preparative HPLC and their structures were confirmed by conducting 1H and 13C NMR experiments. The isolated DPs were evaluated for their anticancer potential using non small cell lung cancer cell line A549. The IC50 values for AFT, DP2 and DP3 were found to be 15.02 ± 1.49, 25.00 ± 1.26 and 32.56 ± 0.11 respectively.

Schneid (Buxaceae) were investigated for a panoply of bioassays. Biological profiles were established by determining antioxidant and enzyme inhibition profiles. Toxicity was tested using MTT cell viability assay on five different human cancer cell lines i.e, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, CaSki, DU-145 and SW-480. For chemical fingerprinting, total bioactive contents and UHPLC-MS secondary metabolites profile were determined. Generally, both aerial and stem methanol extracts had highest total bioactive contents, radical scavenging and reducing power potential. DCM and n-hexane extracts were found to be most active for total antioxidant and metal chelating activity. The UHPLC-MS analysis of methanol extracts revealed the presence of several phenolic, flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin and depsipeptide derivatives. All the extracts were significantly active against butyrylcholinesterase, whereas moderate inhibition was observed for acetylcholinesterase, α-glucosidase and urease. Similarly, a considerable level of cytotoxicity was observed against all the tested cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 26 to 225.9 μg/mL. Aerial methanol and stem n-hexane extracts were found to be most cytotoxic. Principal component analysis was also performed to find any possible correlation between biological activities and total bioactive contents.

To explore the use of other analytical methods, the USP Biologics Department conducted a multi-laboratory collaborative study. The study determined the inter-laboratory variability for peptide quantitation using the following methods: HPLC assay, quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy, or amino acid analysis (AAA). The three methods were compared with regard to their suitability for quantitation of the nonapeptide oxytocin. In this study, the HPLC assay method using the same peptide bulk material as the standard showed the lowest inter-lab variability. The coefficient of variation (%CV) was calculated without counting the uncertainty associated with the purity assignment of the standard with mass balance. The proton qNMR method is a direct measurement of the peptide against an internal standard, which is not difficult to perform under common laboratory conditions. Because of the simpler operation and shorter analytical time, qNMR as a primary method for peptide reference standard value assignment deserves further exploration.",Examining determinants of geographic variation in colorectal cancer mortality in North Carolina: A spatial analysis approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640041,Cancer epidemiology,2019 03 31,"A recent study using national data from 2000 to 2009 identified colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality ""hotspots"" in 11 counties of North Carolina (NC).

We identified several inhibitors and stimulators of aggregation and achieved a screening reproducibility >85% for all data. We identified 18 potential inhibitors (= 1.1% of the library) and 10 stimulators (= 0.6% of the library) of tau aggregation in this cell model of tau pathology. The results provide insights into the regulation of cellular tau aggregation and the pathways involved in this process (e.g., involving signaling via p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, histone deacetylases, vascular endothelial growth factor, rho/ROCK). For example, inhibitors of protein kinases (e.g., p38) can reduce tau aggregation, whereas inhibitors of deacetylases (histone deacetylases) can enhance aggregation. These observations are compatible with reports that phosphorylated or acetylated tau promotes pathology.",Repetitive motion compensation for real time intraoperative video processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640039,Medical image analysis,2019 05 02,"In this paper, we present a motion compensation algorithm dedicated to video processing during neurosurgery. After craniotomy, the brain surface undergoes a repetitive motion due to the cardiac pulsation. This motion as well as potential video camera motion prevent accurate video analysis. We propose a dedicated motion model where the brain deformation is described using a linear basis learned from a few initial frames of the video. As opposed to other works using linear basis for the flow, the camera motion is explicitly accounted in the transformation model. Despite the nonlinear nature of our model, all the motion parameters are robustly estimated all at once, using only one singular value decomposition (SVD), making our procedure computationally efficient. A Lagrangian specification of the flow field ensures the stability of the method. Experiments on in vivo data are presented to evaluate the capacity of the method to cope with occlusion or camera motion. The method we propose satisfies the intraoperative constraints: it is robust to surgical tools occlusions, it works in real time, and it is able to handle large camera viewpoint changes."

In genus level, the most dominant bacteria in O-GM-BA were Salmonella and Trabulsiella, accounting up to 83.04%, moreover, representative exoelectrogens (Geobacter) were enriched, which contributed to OTC biodegradation and electrochemical performances; abundant degrading bacteria (Moheibacter, Comamonas, Pseudomonas, Dechloromonas, Nitrospira, Methylomicrobium, Pseudorhodoferax, Thiobacillus, Mycobacterium) were enriched in O-GM-BC, which contributed to the maximum removal efficiency of OTC; coding resistance genes of efflux pump, ribosome protective protein and modifying or passivating were all found in O-GM-BE, and this explained the OTC removal mechanisms from gene level."

Here, we present a non-targeted pixel-based fingerprinting analysis documenting the removal of a complex mixture of gasoline VOCs by Hedera helix under dynamic chamber conditions allowing for air exchange and continuous gasoline exposure. For 15 days, the entire potted plant was exposed to gasoline; subsequently, the epigeous plant parts were removed and the soil microcosm (i.e. soil, plant roots and microorganisms) was exposed to gasoline for another eight days. Quantitative analysis was performed for heptane, 3-methylhexane, toluene, ethylbenzene and m,p-xylenes, and the CHEMSIC method (CHEMometric analysis of Selected Ion Chromatograms) was used for non-targeted pixel-based fingerprinting analysis. The quantitative analysis demonstrated that the presence of potted plants or pots without epigeous plant parts led to a reduction of selected VOCs by 16.7-22.6%. The CHEMSIC method confirmed this and revealed that all gasoline VOCs were reduced in concentration when H. helix was present. The estimate for the total VOC removal was in the range of 11-32%. The removal was highest for samples where the epigeous plant parts were absent and compounds known to be hard to degrade by microorganisms such as dimethylcyclopentanes were removed the least compared to compounds more easily degraded by microorganisms such as heptane when epigeous plant parts were removed. All findings support the conclusion that the soil microcosm was the main responsible for the removal of VOCs.",Biotransformation of 4-nitrophenol by co-immobilized Geobacter sulfurreducens and anthraquinone-2-sulfonate in barium alginate beads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640004,Chemosphere,2019 03 15,"Geobacter sulfurreducens and anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS) were used suspended and immobilized in barium alginate during the biotransformation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The assays were conducted at different concentrations of 4-NP (50-400 mg/L) and AQS, either in suspended (0-400 μM) or immobilized form (0 or 760 μM), and under different pH values (5-9). G. sulfurreducens showed low capacity to reduce 4-NP in absence of AQS, especially at the highest concentrations of the contaminant. AQS improved the reduction rates from 0.0086 h-1, without AQS, to 0.149 h-1 at 400 μM AQS, which represent an increment of 17.3-fold. The co-immobilization of AQS and G. sulfurreducens in barium alginate beads (AQSi-Gi) increased the reduction rates up to 4.8- and 7.2-fold, compared to incubations with G. sulfurreducens in suspended and immobilized form, but in absence of AQS.

In this study, we demonstrate the abiotic reductive deiodination of the iodinated contrast media iopromide, iopamidol and diatrizoate in the presence of corrinoids. In addition, triiodinated benzoic acid derivatives with iodine atoms bound at different positions were investigated. Corrinoids like cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) and dicyanocobinamide served as electron shuttles and as catalysts between the reducing agent (e.g., titanium (III) citrate) and the electron accepting iodinated compound. The concentration decrease of the iodinated compounds followed first-order kinetics with rate constant kobs depending on the iodinated compound. A linear correlation between the rate of iodide release and the corrinoid concentration was observed, with deiodination rates for dicyanocobinamide twice as high as for vitamin B12. Reducing agents with a less negative standard redox potential like dithiothreitol or cysteine caused slower deiodination as the cobalt center was only reduced to its CoII oxidation state. With a temperature increase from 11 to 23 °C, the concentrations of released iodide doubled. A complete deiodination was only observed for the iodinated contrast media but not for structurally similar iodinated benzoic acid derivatives.",Effects of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on pyrene adsorption and desorption in soils: The role of soil constituents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640002,Chemosphere,2019 03 15,"Once entering soil, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can influence the fate of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in soil due to its strong adsorption capacity. This process may be influenced by the interactions between CNTs and soil constituents. The mechanisms therein were investigated in the present study by examining pyrene adsorption/desorption on one CNTs, two soils (black soil and paddy soil), and mixtures thereof. CNTs' amendment enhanced soil site heterogeneity and adsorption capacity of pyrene while it was less than that predicted by the sum of the individual adsorption on soils and CNTs, which was more obvious at low aqueous concentrations. This could be due to the interactions between soil constituents (dissolved organic matter (DOM) and clays) and CNTs. Modification of CNTs by DOM attenuated pyrene adsorption by 14.9%-66.1%, which was ascribed to occupying of surface adsorption sites, pore blockage of CNTs' aggregates, enhancement of surface polarity, and enhancement of pyrene solubility in aqueous phase. The coexistence of clay (kaolinite) also showed inhibition on pyrene adsorption onto CNTs with a reduction of 19.2%-40.2%. This could be ascribed to that the attachment of clay particles on CNTs' aggregates could cover the surface adsorption sites and enhance the surface polarity of CNTs. The effect of CNTs amendment on pyrene desorption hysteresis differed among soils. The hysteresis index of the black soil doubled after CNTs' amendment while that of paddy soil remained unchanged. The results of this study provide insights into the possible effects of CNTs on the fate of HOCs in real soil environment.",The uptake of microfibers by freshwater Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) varies based upon physicochemical properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640001,Chemosphere,2019 03 15,"Microplastic is an umbrella term that covers particles with various physical and chemical properties. However, microplastics with a consistent shape, polymer type and size are generally used in exposure studies (e.g., spherical polyethylene or polystyrene beads 1-100 μm in size). In the present study, we exposed freshwater Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) to microfibers with different physicochemical properties at concentrations of 100 and 1000 fibers/L. The first experiment in this study exposed clams to microfibers made from six different polymers, demonstrating that Asian clams uptake more polyester (PET) (4.1 items/g) relevant to other polymers. The next experiment exposed clams to PET fibers of different size classes, demonstrating that uptake in the size range 100-250 μm (1.7 items/g) was greater than other size classes. These results suggest that physicochemical properties such as polymer and size play important roles in the uptake of microfibers by organisms. Thus, we strongly suggest that the properties of microplastics used in future laboratory exposure experiments be considered, with the aim of being ""environmentally relevant"", i.e., similar to what is found in nature.",Detection of oxazolidinone and phenicol resistant enterococcal isolates from duck feces and carcasses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30640000,International journal of food microbiology,2019 05 02,"The heavy use or abuse of antimicrobials in food animals has caused an increase in antimicrobial resistance in enterococci of animal origin, which could get transmitted to those of human origin via the food chain. Since duck meat consumption has been on the rise in Korea, we conducted this study to provide information about the antimicrobial resistance of the enterococci obtained from healthy ducks and their carcasses. A total of 82 Enterococcus faecium and 174 E. faecalis isolated from duck fecal and carcass samples were investigated for antimicrobial resistance to 16 agents, using broth dilution method, and were further characterized using molecular methods. Most of E. faecium (84.1%) and E. faecalis (87.9%) isolates were resistant to one or more antimicrobials. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) isolates were observed in both E. faecium (40.2%) and E. faecalis (33.9%) with high frequencies. High rate of resistance was observed for tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin in both E. faecium and E. faecalis. Resistance to gentamicin, vancomycin, and daptomycin, in both E. faecium and E. faecalis, was, if at all, very rare. However, linezolid resistance was observed in nine E. faecium (11.0%) and one E. faecalis (0.6%). All, but one, Linezolid resistant (LR) isolates were also resistant to chloramphenicol and florfenicol. The novel transferable oxazolidinone and phenicol resistant gene, optrA, was found in six E. faecium isolates. All of them co-carried phenicol exporter gene fexA. None of the LR isolates had mutation in the 23S ribosomal RNA and in the ribosomal protein L3. Six LR E. faecium isolates had Asn130Lys mutation in the ribosomal protein L4, of which five also carried optrA gene. None of the isolates carried the multi-resistance gene cfr. Transfer of oxazolidinone and phenicol resistance was observed in five among the 10 LR isolates; two of them had optrA and fexA genes. Multi-drug resistant Enterococcus that also carried the resistance gene to a last-resort antimicrobial is a major concern for public health. Thus, to prevent the introduction of last-resort antimicrobial resistance into food chain, continuous surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in duck is imperative.",Metabolomics and bacterial diversity of packaged yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and salmon (Salmo salar) show fish species-specific spoilage development during chilled storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639999,International journal of food microbiology,2019 05 02,"Microbial (colony counts, 16S rRNA gene amplification), chemical (pH, 1H NMR spectroscopy) and sensory changes in raw Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) and tuna (Thunnus albacares) fillets stored under vacuum at 3 °C were evaluated over a period of 12 days. Both species of fish are globally important and among the ten most consumed fishes in the world. Although the sensory analyses showed a decrease in the quality of both fish species, only the salmon fillets were considered spoiled at the end of the storage period. In salmon, trimethylamine was the main spoilage product and bacterial colony counts reached an average of 7.3 log10 cfu/g. The concentration of glucose decreased and the concentration of organic acids increased during storage revealing glucose fermentation. Photobacterium was the dominating genus in the salmon studied. In the tuna studied, the bacterial colony counts reached only an average of 4.6 log10 cfu/g. The dominating bacteria in tuna were Pseudomonas spp. Glucose levels did not decrease, suggesting that amino acids and lactate most likely acted as carbon sources for bacteria in tuna. In conclusion, the study revealed that salmon was clearly a more perishable fish than tuna.",Wing measurement can be used to identify European blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) of forensic importance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639998,Forensic science international,2019 03 14,"Correct species identification is a crucial step in research and the practice of forensic entomology. At the moment the most common and widely used tool for this purpose are taxonomic keys based on morphological characters. During recent decades molecular methods have been used more and more often for species identification. Automated species identification can also be based on wing measurements. This method proved to be reliable in the case of some groups of necrophagous Diptera from various geographical regions. Up to now, this method has not been applied to a wide range of species of European Calliphoridae. We have used 968 specimens representing 15 species and 6 genera. Identification was based on 15 landmarks located at wing vein junctions. Wing shape differed markedly between the studied species. The overall correct classification rate at the level of species was 97.1%. Seven species, including Calliphora vomitoria, Chrysomya albiceps, Phormia regina, Protophormia terraenovae and Lucilia sericata were identified without error. Lucilia caesar and Lucilia illustris, which are considered relatively difficult to distinguish, were correctly classified in 93.0% and 94.1% cases, respectively. The correct classification rate at the level of genera was 99.2%. The results presented here suggest that wing measurements are a promising alternative to other methods of identification of necrophagous Calliphoridae. This method can be particularly useful for identification of large samples of females collected during carrion succession studies. It can also be used to double check identification performed by a taxonomist using traditional methods.",Green synthesis of multi-color emissive carbon dots from Manilkara zapota fruits for bioimaging of bacterial and fungal cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639997,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology",2019 04 01,"Natural resources have widely been used as precursors for the preparation of ultra-small carbon dots (C-dots) due to ease of availability, low cost and C-dots with high quantum yields (QYs). Herein, water dispersible multi-color emissive C-dots were obtained from Manilkara zapota fruits. The emission of C-dots was well tuned by sulphuric acid and phosphoric acids, which results to generate blue-, green- and yellow- C-dots. The fabricated C-dots exhibit blue, green and yellow color emissions when irradiated them under UV light at 365 nm. The emission/excitation peaks of blue-, green-, and yellow- C-dots were observed at 443, 515 and 563 nm when excited at 350, 420 and 440 nm, respectively. The QYs of blue-, green-, and yellow- C-dots are 5.7, 7.9 and 5.2%. The average sizes of blue- green- and yellow- C-dots are 1.9 ± 0.3, 2.9 ± 0.7and 4.5 ± 1.25 nm, respectively. Because of ultra-small size and biocompatibility, three C-dots act as promising bioimaging agents for imaging of cells (E. coli, Aspergillus aculeatus and Fomitopsis sp). The cytotoxicity on HeLa cells indicates that three C-dots have non-toxic nature, which confirms their biocompatibility. The ultra-small C-dots were effectively distributed in the cytoplasm of the cells, ensuring the potential applications in cell imaging and biomedical studies.",Synthesis of ecofriendly copper oxide nanoparticles for fabrication over textile fabrics: Characterization of antibacterial activity and dye degradation potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639996,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology",2019 04 01,"Growing concerns over the toxicity of metallic nanoparticles synthesized using physical and chemical techniques seems to be a major hurdle for researchers. Green synthesis of nanoparticles is one of the promising, ecofriendly and safer methods. Utilizing plant sources as reducing agents will replace the use of toxic chemicals for nanoparticle synthesis. Among the various nanoparticles, copper has been theoretically and practically proved for its antimicrobial properties. However, to reduce the risk of copper toxicity, Ruellia tuberosa (R. tuberosa) aqueous extract is used for the synthesis of CuONPs in the present study. Nonetheless, till date no work has been reported on the use of R. tuberosa aqueous extract for the synthesis of CuONPs. In the present study, aqueous extract of R. tuberosa has been used for the synthesis of CuONPs. The synthesis of CuONPs was confirmed by the absorption peak at 327 nm representing the nanorods with an average size of 83.23 nm. Further, the CuONPs revealed antimicrobial effects against clinical pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Embedding CuONPs on cotton fabrics showed bactericidal activity against the bacterial pathogens. In addition, the photocatalytic property of the CuONPs was divulged by their crystal violet (CV) dye degradation potential. Thus, the green synthesized CuONPs using R. tuberosa could provide a remedy against bacterial pathogens in hospital and industrial environments."

Ingestion of microplastics by biota, including freshwater zooplankton has been well studied, however, despite keystone species in freshwater food webs, the molecular response (e.g. oxidative defense) of zooplankton in response to microplastics is still in its infancy. The thioredoxin (TRx) system has a vital function in cellular antioxidative defense via eliminating the excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of thioredoxin reductase (TRxR), due to its triggering the TRx catalysis cascade. The present study identified TRxR in Daphnia magna (Dm-TRxR) for the first time, and found that the full-length cDNA was 1862 bp long, containing an 1821-bp open reading frame. Homologous alignments showed the presence of conserved catalytic domain CVNVGC and the seleocysteine (SeCys) residue (U) located in the N- and C- terminal portions. Subsequently, the expression of Dm-TRxR, together with permease, arginine kinase (AK), was investigated by approach of quantitative real-time PCR after exposure to four (1.25-μm) polystyrene (PS) microbeads concentrations: 0 (control), 2, 4 and 8 mg L-1 for 10 days. Dm-TRxR, permease and AK mRNA were significantly upregulated after exposure to 2, 4 mg L-1 of PS, but then declined in the presence of 8 mg L-1 PS. The gene expression results suggested that oxidative defense, energy production and substance extra cellular transportation were significantly regulated by microplastic exposure. Collectively, the present study will advance our knowledge regarding the biological effects of microplastic pollution on zooplankton, and builds a foundation for freshwater environmental studies on mechanistic and biochemical responses to microplastics.","Sequential usage of diamond bur for CAD/CAM milling: Effect on the roughness, topography and fatigue strength of lithium disilicate glass ceramic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639981,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 02 02,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sequential usage (milling order) of CAD/CAM diamond burs on the surface roughness, topography and fatigue performance of a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic. Seventy-two (72) ceramic discs (Ø= 13.5 mm; thickness= 1.2 mm; IPS e.max CAD) were milled using four pairs of burs and allocated into three groups (n = 24) according to the milling sequence: 1 through 6 (1-6), 7 through 12 (7-12), and 13 through 18 (13-18). The burs were evaluated under SEM at the different milling stages to depict any degradation generated by the milling sequence. Fatigue performance was assessed by a stepwise approach (initial strength of 20 MPa for 5000 cycles; incremental steps of 20 MPa for 20,000 cycles each until fracture; frequency of 20 Hz) using the ISO 6872:2015 recommendation for piston-on-three-balls biaxial flexure strength tests. Surface roughness, topography analysis and fractography of the failed discs were also performed. Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Mantel-Cox post hoc test) showed that the milling sequence had no effect on the fatigue strength (190 - 201 MPa) or the number of cycles until fracture (174,958 - 180,087 cycles). Ceramic topography and roughness (Ra, Rz and RSm parameters) were similar among the groups, even though SEM analysis depicted CAD/CAM diamond burs degraded over time. Fractography evidenced all failures starting from surface defects introduced by milling at the samples' tensile side. The sequential usage of CAD/CAM diamond burs (milling order) does not affect the lithium disilicate surface roughness, topography or fatigue performance.",Static and time-dependent mechanical response of organic matrix of bone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639980,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 02 02,"Bone derives its mechanical strength from the complex arrangement of collagen fibrils (type-I primarily) reinforced with hydroxy-apatite (HAp) mineral crystals in extra- and intra-fibrillar compartments. This study demonstrates a novel approach to obtain organic matrix of bone through its demineralization as well as mechanically characterize it at small length scales using static and dynamic indentation techniques. Sample surface preparation protocol used in the present work maintained the surface integrity of demineralized bone samples which resulted sample surface of roughness (RMS) magnitude of approximately 14 nm (averaged over 1 × 1 μm2 ﻿area duly verified by atomic force microscope (AFM)). Elemental composition analysis via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (for probed depth upto 2 μm) confirmed the complete removal of HAp mineral from bone samples during their demineralization using EDTA leaving collagen molecule assemblies unaffected as represented by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging. The modulus magnitudes of organic matrix obtained using from quasistatic as well as dynamic indentations (at constant frequency of 30 Hz) as ∼2.6 GPa and 4.5 GPa respectively, demonstrated the influence of loading rate on the estimated mechanical properties. For indentation depth to surface roughness ratio greater than ∼5:1, interestingly, measured material properties of organic matrix were found to depend on increasing magnitude of indentation depth of up to ∼500 nm value which probed from few collagen fibrils to next level of hierarchy i.e. collagen fibers. These findings are very useful to accurately determine the elastic and visco-elastic response of organic matrices of mineralized tissues for various applications including tissue engineering, bio-mimetics, etc.","Evaluation of genetic polymorphisms in MMP2, MMP9 and MMP20 in Brazilian children with dental fluorosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639979,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,2019 03 11,"Recent studies suggested that genetics contribute to differences in dental fluorosis (DF) susceptibility among individuals having the same environmental exposure. This study evaluated if MMP2, MMP9 and MMP20 are expressed during enamel development and assessed the association between polymorphisms in these genes with DF. Mice susceptible and resistant to DF were used to evaluate if MMPs were candidate genes for DF. The animals received fluoride and their enamels were used for immunohistochemistry. Additionally, 481 subjects from a city with fluoridation of public water supplies were recruited. Genotyping was performed using real time PCR. Allele/genotype frequencies were compared between groups. MMP2, MMP9 and MMP20 immunostaining was detected in both animal groups. DF was observed in 22.4% of the subjects.

The present study addressed this gap, and also evaluated whether these state-based effects were stronger for individuals with trait-level body image disturbances (internalization and body dissatisfaction). Eighty-four women completed baseline measures of trait internalization and body dissatisfaction, and then reported momentary experiences of body dissatisfaction, appearance self-monitoring, appearance-related comments, and appearance-based comparisons at up to 10 random times daily for seven days. Multilevel analyses confirmed that both appearance comparisons and commentary (both negative and positive) were predictive of changes in state body dissatisfaction when modelled individually as well as in a combined (full) model. Appearance self-monitoring was not a significant predictor, either individually or in the full model. These within-person relationships were not moderated by individual differences in trait body dissatisfaction and internalization of appearance standards. Accordingly, experiences of body dissatisfaction in daily life may be a common reaction to negative appearance comments and unflattering comparisons, yet positive comments and/or efforts to avoid appearance-based comparisons may have a positive effect on one's body image.",Hypoxia Patterns in Primary and Metastatic Prostate Cancer Environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639975,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"Metastatic dissemination continues to be a major cause of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality, creating a compelling need to understand factors that play a role in the metastatic cascade. Since hypoxia plays an important role in PCa aggressiveness, we characterized patterns of hypoxia in the primary tumor and metastatic environments of a human PCa xenograft. We previously developed and characterized an imaging strategy based on the hypoxia response element (HRE)-driven expression of long-lived enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and short-lived luciferase (luc) fused to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain in human PCa PC-3 cells. Both reporter proteins were placed under the transcriptional control of a five-tandem repeat HRE sequence. PC-3 cells also constitutively expressed the tdTomato red fluorescent protein, allowing cancer cell detection in vivo. This ""timer"" strategy can provide information on the temporal evolution of HIF activity and hypoxia in tumors. Here, for the first time, we performed in vivo and ex vivo imaging of this dual HIF reporter system in PC-3 metastatic tumors implanted orthotopically in the prostate and PC-3 nonmetastatic tumors implanted subcutaneously. We observed distinct patterns of EGFP and luc expression in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors, and in metastatic nodules, that provide new insights into the presence of hypoxia at primary and metastatic tumor sites, and of the role of hypoxia in metastasis.",The role of nucleus accumbens shell on acquisition and retrieval stages of morphine state dependent learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639974,Asian journal of psychiatry,2019 05 08,"In the present study, the effect of transient inactivation of the shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens (NAC shell) by lidocaine on the acquisition and retrieval stages of passive avoidance learning (PAL) and memory and morphine state-dependent learning (SDL) in male wistar rats was investigated.",Perceived stress and barriers to seeking help from mental health professionals among trainee doctors at a tertiary care centre in North India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639973,Asian journal of psychiatry,2019 05 08,"To assess the level and causes of perceived stress, and the barriers to seeking help from mental health professionals among Resident doctors at a tertiary care centre in North India.",Attention biases and social-emotional development in preschool-aged children who have been exposed to domestic violence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639972,Child abuse & neglect,2019 02 10,School-aged children and adolescents exposed to domestic violence (DV) disproportionality attend to threatening and sad cues in their environment.

For children, European recommendations indicate maintenance doses varying from 30 to 100 mg/kg/day for this indication. Since cumulated dose was associated with retinal toxicity, it is essential to administrate the lowest effective dose to patients. This work was conducted with the purpose to determine the pediatric doses of vigabatrin that allow a similar exposure than effective doses in adults (2-3 g/day) through a pharmacokinetic (PK) study, using both pediatric and adult data. For this study, we focused on the active S(+) enantiomer of vigabatrin. First, the adult effective exposition range of vigabatrin-S was determined from an adult PK model. Then, this same model was scaled to the pediatric population using allometry and maturation principles to account for growth and development. The ability of the model to predict pediatric data was assessed by comparing population predictions with observed pediatric data. Finally, the extrapolated pediatric model was used to simulate pediatric expositions which were compared to the adult exposition range (36.5-77.9 mg.h/L). From those simulations, we determined that, for children aged between 3 months and 18 years, doses between 40 and 50 mg/kg/day allow vigabatrin-S expositions similar to those found in adults at the recommended posology. We proposed those doses as optimal maintenance doses that may be increased, if necessary, by slow titration.",Protective effect of N-acetylcysteine on fenitrothion-induced toxicity: The antioxidant status and metabolizing enzymes expression in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639957,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 26,"The existence of fenitrothion (FNT) in the soil, water, and food products has harmful effects on non-target organisms. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effects of FNT and the possible ameliorative effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor of intracellular GSH, on FNT-induced toxicity. For this purpose, thirty-two adult male albino rats were allocated into control group and groups treated with NAC (200 mg/kg), FNT (10 mg/kg) and FNT + NAC via gastric tube daily for 28 days. FNT intoxication significantly reduced food intake, water intake, body weight, and body weight gain and altered the expression of phase I and phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes-cytochrome P450 (CYP1A1) and glutathione S-transferase (GSTA4-4). In hepatic, renal and brain tissues, FNT induced oxidative stress, hepatopathy, nephropathy, and encephalopathy, and significantly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, FNT exposure significantly elevated the level of hepatic and renal injury biomarkers and significantly inhibited the brain acetylcholinesterase activity. Co-administration of NAC with FNT modulated most of these altered biochemical, oxidative and inflammatory markers and restored the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes expression and histological structures. Our study indicated the involvement of oxidative damage, inflammation, and alteration of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes expression in FNT-induced toxicity and revealed that they were significantly improved by NAC co-treatment. These findings suggest that NAC administration might protect against FNT-induced toxicity in non-target organisms, including humans.",Botulinum toxin-treatment of localized provoked vulvodynia refractory to conventional treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639955,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 30,We wanted to evaluate the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (botulinum toxin) treatment on vulvodynia refractory to conventional treatment.,Antenatal corticosteroid therapy: Historical and scientific basis to improve preterm birth management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639954,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 30,"The purpose of this review is to describe the historical and scientific basis of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) therapy, to improve the management of preterm birth and decreasing rates of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and perinatal mortality in premature infants.",Advanced stage (IIIC/IV) endometrial cancer: Role of cytoreduction and determinants of survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639953,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2019 05 30,Primary aim of this study was to assess the impact of optimal cytoreduction in women who had surgical treatment of advanced stage (IIIC/IV) endometrial cancer.

The actin cytoskeleton has been long viewed as a central player facilitating diverse mechanotransduction pathways due to the notion that it is capable of receiving, processing, transmitting, and generating mechanical stresses. Recent work has begun to uncover the roles of mechanical stresses in modulating the activity of key regulatory actin-binding proteins and their interactions with actin filaments, thereby controlling the assembly (formin and Arp2/3 complex) and disassembly (ADF/Cofilin) of actin filament networks. In this review, we will focus on discussing the current molecular understanding of how members of the formin protein family sense and respond to forces and the potential implications for formin-mediated mechanotransduction in cells.",Budding yeast Rtt107 prevents checkpoint hyperactivation after replicative stress by limiting DNA damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639951,DNA repair,2019 04 02,"Cells respond to DNA damage by activating cell cycle checkpoints, arresting cell division or DNA replication while damage is repaired. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53 leads to cell cycle arrest, with Rad53 deactivation required for proper resumption of the cell cycle. Rtt107 is a S. cerevisiae protein that acts as a scaffold in the response to DNA damage, and rtt107Δ mutants exhibit prolonged activation of Rad53 when subjected to replication stress. This phenotype has been attributed to checkpoint dampening, wherein an Rtt107-Slx4-Dpb11 interaction limits formation of a Rad9-Dpb11 complex that promotes Rad53 activation. However, we found that the rtt107Δ mutant contains higher levels of DNA damage during replication stress, presenting an alternative possible cause of Rad53 hyperactivation. We therefore sought to address the relevance of checkpoint dampening to the Rad53 hyperactivation phenotype of the rtt107Δ mutant by using a rad9-ST462,474AA allele that specifically disrupts Rad9-Dpb11 interaction. Incorporation of the rad9-ST462,474AA allele slightly suppressed the rtt107Δ mutant's DNA damage sensitivity phenotypes, while having little effect on Rad53 hyperactivation. This indicated that in the context of acute replication stress, Rad53 hyperactivation in the rtt107Δ mutant did not primarily result from Rad9-Dpb11 interaction. A H2A-S129A mutation, which generally reduces Rad9-mediated Rad53 activation, led to more robust suppression of rtt107Δ mutant phenotypes. Suppression of rtt107Δ mutant DNA damage sensitivity by the H2A-S129A or the rad9-ST462,474AA alleles required intact DNA damage tolerance pathways, indicating a reliance of the rtt107Δ mutant on tolerance pathways for reasons other than misregulation of Rad53 activity. Collectively, this work proposed a revised model of Rad53 hyperactivation after acute replicative stress in the rtt107Δ mutant, in which this phenotype was primarily a consequence of excess DNA damage.",Clinical effectiveness of novel rosacea therapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639950,Current opinion in pharmacology,2019 05 15,"Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease that is difficult to manage because of the unknown etiology and due to its variable manifestations.

Following administration of saline or Wuziyanzong pill on the 15th day, 20 mg kg-1 dapoxetine was administered to all rats. Blood was collected from the tail vein (0.3 mL) at multiple time points, and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used to determine the concentration of dapoxetine and its main metabolites, dapoxetine-N-oxide and desmethyldapoxetine in rats. Pharmacokinetic analysis of dapoxetine showed that area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of the Wuziyanzong pill group were decreased, while plasma clearance (CLz) was increased compared with control group (P < 0.01). The HPLC method for determination of dapoxetine in vitro was accurate and specific. The UHPLC-MS/MS method established for determination of dapoxetine and its major metabolites in rat plasma was rapid and specific, which met the requirements of pharmacokinetic guidelines. Wuziyanzong pill had a weak inhibitory effect on metabolism of dapoxetine in vitro, but had a very strong induction effect in vivo, suggesting the dosage of dapoxetine should be increased when administered in combination with Wuziyanzong pill.","Validation of a UPLC-PDA method to study the content and stability of 5-chloro 8-hydroxyquinoline and 5,7-dichloro 8-hydroxyquinoline in medicated feed used in swine farming.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639930,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 02 20,"A new, rapid, simple and specific method to determine 5-chloro 8-hydroxyquinoline (5-HQ) and 5,7-dichloro 8-hydroxyquinoline (5,7-HQ) stability in swine feed was optimized and validated.

A key component in this regard is the periodontal ligament (PDL). The role of the bone underlying the PDL is less well defined. We study the interplay between the PDL and the underlying alveolar bone when loaded in the minipig. Using an Instron loading device we confirmed that the force-displacement curves of the molars and premolars of relatively fresh minipig intact mandibles are similar to those obtained for humans and other animals. We then used this information to obtain 3D images of the teeth before and after loading the tooth in a microCT such that the load applied is in the third linear part of the force displacement curve. We observed that at many locations there is a complimentary topography of the cementum and alveolar bone surface, strongly suggesting an active interplay between the tooth and the bone during mastication. We also observed that the loaded tooth does not come into direct contact with the underlying bone surface. A highly compressed layer of PDL is present between the tooth and the bone. The structure of the bone in the upper furcation region has a unique appearance with little obvious microstructure, abundant pores that have a large size range and at many locations the bone at the PDL interface has a needle-like shape. We conclude that there is a close interaction between the tooth, the PDL and the underlying alveolar bone during mastication. The highly compressed PDL layer that separates the tooth from the bone may fulfill a key shock absorbing function.",Rapid tilt-series acquisition for electron cryotomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639925,Journal of structural biology,2019 02 27,"Using a new Titan Krios stage equipped with a single-axis holder, we developed two methods to accelerate the collection of tilt-series.

CA IX has emerged as a cancer drug target but development of isoform-specific inhibitors is challenging due to other highly conserved CA isoforms. In this study, a CA IXmimic construct was used (CA II with seven point mutations introduced, to mimic CA IX active site) while maintaining CA II solubility that make it amenable to crystallography. The structures of CA IXmimic unbound and in complex with saccharin (SAC) and a saccharin-glucose conjugate (SGC) were determined using joint X-ray and neutron protein crystallography. Previously, SAC and SGC have been shown to display CA isoform inhibitor selectivity in assays and X-ray crystal structures failed to reveal the basis of this selectivity. Joint X-ray and neutron crystallographic studies have shown active site residues, solvent, and H-bonding re-organization upon SAC and SGC binding. These observations highlighted the importance of residues 67 (Asn in CA II, Gln in CA IX) and 130 (Asp in CA II, Arg in CA IX) in selective CA inhibitor targeting.",Neural systems underlying reward cue processing in early adolescence: The role of puberty and pubertal hormones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639923,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 03 15,"Affective neuroscience research suggests that maturational changes in reward circuitry during adolescence present opportunities for new learning, but likely also contribute to increases in vulnerability for psychiatric disorders such as depression and substance abuse. Basic research in animal models and human neuroimaging has made progress in understanding the normal development of reward circuitry in adolescence, yet, few functional neuroimaging studies have examined puberty-related influences on the functioning of this circuitry. The goal of this study was to address this gap by examining the extent to which striatal activation and cortico-striatal functional connectivity to cues predicting upcoming rewards would be positively associated with pubertal status and levels of pubertal hormones (dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone, estradiol). Participants included 79 adolescents (10-13 year olds; 47 girls) varying in pubertal status who performed a novel reward cue processing task during fMRI. Pubertal maturation was assessed using sex-specific standardized composite measures based on Tanner staging (self-report and clinical assessment) and scores from the Pubertal Development Scale. These composite measures were computed to index overall pubertal maturation as well as maturation of the adrenal and gonadal axes separately for boys and girls. Basal levels of circulating pubertal hormones were measured using immunoassays from three samples collected weekly upon awakening across a three-week period. Results indicated greater striatal activation and functional connectivity between nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to reward cue (vs. no reward cue) on this task. Also, girls with higher levels of estradiol showed reduced activation in left and right caudate and greater NAcc-putamen connectivity. Girls with higher levels of testosterone showed greater NAcc connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex and the insula. There were no significant associations in boys. Findings suggest that patterns of activation and connectivity in cortico-striatal regions are associated with reward cue processing, particularly in girls. Longitudinal follow-up neuroimaging studies are needed to fully characterize puberty-specific effects on the development of these neural regions and how such changes may contribute to pathways of risk or resilience in adolescence."

XPS spectra, as accurately reflection of different chemical environments where a particular element was located, provided an effective way to identify the six isomers of C32. The NEXAFS spectra, which were commonly used in the electronic structure detection, captured information of unoccupied orbital and showed many recognizable characteristics. To further investigate the source of spectral features, the spectral components calculated from different types of carbon atoms in each C32 isomer also have been well explored and discussed.",True colors: A literature review on the spatial distribution of eye and hair pigmentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639910,Forensic science international.

Here, we aim at compiling information on the spatial distribution of eye and hair coloration in order to use this as prior knowledge to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we conducted a detailed literature review and created maps showing the eye and hair pigmentation prevalence both by countries with available information and by interpolation in order to obtain prior estimates for populations without available data. Furthermore, we assessed the association between these two traits in a very large data set. A strong limitation was the quite low amount of available data, especially outside Europe.

This differential degradation pattern can be followed with a qPCR assay that quantifies ∼90 bp amplicons produced from the 5' and 3' ends of 4 transcripts chosen from the transcriptome of blood because of their degradation kinetics, determined initially using RNA sequencing. Statistical analysis of degradation kinetics suggests, depending upon the age of the sample, the age of blood stains can be accurately estimated to within 2-4 weeks for stains less than 6 months of age and 4-6 weeks for stains 6 months to 1 year old.",Associations between repeated measure of plasma perfluoroalkyl substances and cardiometabolic risk factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639908,Environment international,2019 05 02,Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals that may affect components of metabolic risk through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor but epidemiological data remain scarce and inconsistent.,Occurrence and human health implications of chemical contaminants in vegetables grown in peri-urban agriculture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639907,Environment international,2019 05 02,"Recent studies have proven that vegetables cultivated in peri-urban areas are exposed to a greater concentration of organic microcontaminants (OMCs) and trace elements (TEs) than those grown in rural areas. In this study, the occurrence and human health risk of chemical contaminants (16 TEs and 33 OMCs) in edible parts of lettuce, tomato, cauliflower, and broad beans from two farm fields in the peri-urban area of the city of Barcelona and one rural site outside the peri-urban area were assessed. The concentration of TEs and OMCs (on fresh weight basis) ranged from non-detectable to 17.4 mg/kg and from non-detectable to 256 μg/kg, respectively. Tomato fruits showed the highest concentration of TEs and OMCs. Principal component analysis indicated that the occurrence of chemical contaminants in vegetables depended on the commodity rather than the location (peri-urban vs rural). Risk assessment using hazardous quotient (HQ) and threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approaches showed that the risk for the consumption of target vegetables in the peri-urban area was low and similar to that observed for the rural site. Total HQ values for TEs were always below 1, and a minimum consumption of 150 g/day for children and 380 g/day for adults is required to reach the TTC due to the presence of pesticides. Further studies are needed to estimate the combined effect of TEs and OMCs on human health.",Key structural features promoting radical driven degradation of emerging contaminants in water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639906,Environment international,2019 05 02,"Diverse contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) can be found in nowadays aquatic environment, possessing high potential to cause adverse ecological and human health effects. Due to their recalcitrance, conventional water treatment methods are shown to be inadequately effective. Thus, their upgrade by advanced oxidation processes, involving the generation of highly reactive species (HO and SO4-), is highly demanded. In order to assess the susceptibility of CECs by HO and SO4-, as well as to determine the corresponding reaction rate constants kHO and kSO4-, the complex experimental studies has to be maintained. The alternative is the application of modeling approaches which correlate structural characteristics with activities/properties of interest, i.e. quantitative structure activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR). In this study kHO and kSO4- of fifteen selected CECs were determined by competitive kinetics, and afterward used to elucidate key structural features promoting their degradation. In that purpose, QSPR models were constructed using multiple linear regression (MLR) combined with genetic algorithm (GA) approach. The models were submitted to the internal and external validation (using additional set of 17 CECs). Selected 3-variable models predicting kHO and kSO4- were characterized with high accuracy and predictivity (R2 = 0.876 and Q2 = 0.847 and R2 = 0.832 and Q2 = 0.778, respectively). Although selected models at the first sight include descriptors derived through complicated calculation procedures, their weighting schemes indicate on their relevance and transparency toward established reaction theories and differences regarding radical type.",Taxonomic relatedness and environmental pressure synergistically drive the primary succession of biofilm microbial communities in reclaimed wastewater distribution systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639905,Environment international,2019 05 02,"Compared to drinking water, the higher bacterial abundance, diversity, and organic matter concentration in reclaimed wastewater suggest that it is more likely to form biofilms. Nevertheless, little is known regarding many important aspects of the biofilm ecology in reclaimed wastewater distribution systems (RWDS), such as the long-term microbial community succession and the underlying driving factors. In the present study, by sampling and analysing microbial compositions of pipe wall biofilms from six frequently used pipe materials under NaClOdisinfection (sodium hypochlorite-treated), NONdisinfection (without disinfection), and UVdisinfection (UV-treated) treatments over one year, it was found that the succession of microbial community structure followed a primary succession pattern. This primary succession pattern was reflected as increases in live cell number and α-diversity, along with metagenic succession in taxonomic composition. Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia comprised the dominant phyla in biofilm samples. Compared to biofilms in the NaClOdisinfection reactor, the bacterial communities of biofilms in NONdisinfection and UVdisinfection reactors were distributed more evenly among different bacterial phyla. Principal component analysis revealed a clear temporal pattern of microbial community structures in six kinds of pipe wall biofilms albeit a difference in microbial community structures among the three reactors. Adonis testing indicated that the microbial community composition variation caused by disinfection methods (R2 = 0.283, P < 0.01) was more pronounced than that from the time variable (R2 = 0.070, P < 0.01) and pipe material (R2 = 0.057, P < 0.01). Significantly positive correlation between average local abundance and occupancy was observed in biofilm communities of the three reactors, suggesting that the 'core-satellite' model could be applied to identify biofilm-preferential species under specific disinfection conditions in RWDS. The prevalence of family Sphingomonadaceae, known to show chlorine tolerance and powerful biofilm-forming ability in NaClOdisinfection reactors, evidenced the habitat filtering consequent to environment pressure. Correlation-based network analysis revealed that taxonomic relatedness such as similar niches, cooperation, taxa overdispersion, and competition all functioned toward driving the bacterial assembly succession in RWDS.",Exposure to traffic and mortality risk in the 1991-2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639904,Environment international,2019 05 02,"There is evidence that local traffic density and living near major roads can adversely affect health outcomes. We aimed to assess the relationship between local road length, proximity to primary highways, and cause-specific mortality in the 1991 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC). In this long-term study of 2.6 million people, based on completion of the long-form census in 1991 and followed until 2011, we used annual residential addresses to determine the total length of local roads within 200 m of postal code representative points and the postal code's distance to primary highways. The association between exposure to traffic and cause-specific non-accidental mortality was estimated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for individual covariates and contextual factors, including census division-level proportion in high school, the percentage of recent immigrants, and neighborhood income. We performed sensitivity analyses, including adjustment for exposure to PM2.5, NO2, or O3, restricting to subjects in core urban areas, and spatial variation by climatic zone. The hazard ratio (HR) for all non-accidental mortality associated with an interquartile increase in length of local roads was 1.05 (95% CI 1.04, 1.05), while for an interquartile range increase in proximity to primary highways, the HR was 1.03 (95% CI 1.02, 1.04). HRs by traffic quartile increased with increasing lengths of local roads, as well as with closer proximity to primary highways, for all mortality causes. The associations were stronger within subjects' resident in urban core areas, attenuated by adjustment for PM2.5, and HRs showed limited spatial variation by climatic zone. In the CanCHEC cohort, exposure to higher road density and proximity to major traffic roads was associated with increased mortality risk from cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, COPD, respiratory disease, and lung cancer, with unclear results for diabetes.",Long-term NO2 exposures and cause-specific mortality in American older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639903,Environment international,2019 05 02,The impact of long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on cause-specific mortality is poorly understood.,Short-term exposure to carbamazepine causes oxidative stress on common carp (Cyprinus carpio).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639901,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,2019 03 11,"The aim of this research was to determine the bioconcentration factor and if subacute exposure to carbamazepine (2 mg L-1) modifies the oxidative state of liver, gills and brain of Cyprinus carpio. This was measured through the following biomarkers: hydroperoxide and protein carbonyl content, lipid peroxidation degree, as well as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity. Carbamazepine concentration in carp's tissue was also determined by liquid chromatography with a diode arrangement detector. An increase in lipid peroxidation degree, hydroperoxide and protein carbonyl content, and a decrease in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes (P < 0.05) with respect to control was observed. Also, there is an increase in the concentration of carbamazepina present in the organs with respect to the water in the system, which denotes bioconcentration of the drug. In conclusion, carbamazepine is bioconcentrated and produces oxidative stress on the common carp (C. carpio)."

In this study, an improved and simplified fluorescence method based on the multiwavelength luminescence in the visible region and the avoidance of the self-quenching property of N, S-doped carbon dots (NSC-Dots) was developed for the first time to determine Fe3+ concentration under varied environmental conditions. This method can simultaneously save time and provide accurate information. The as-prepared NSC-Dots exhibit two stable excitation peaks from 200 nm to 450 nm at a fixed emission wavelength (λem = 450 nm). A standard equation (R2 = 0.995) can be derived by measuring the quenching degree of the two peaks and referring to Stern-Volmer theory. Thus, Fe3+ concentration was accurately determined. The interference of the environmentally relevant concentrations of other metal ions, humic acid, and pH on Fe3+ measurement was tested. Results showed that the standard equation can be used to accurately determine Fe3+ concentration within the range of the 95% prediction band.

Herein, we hypothesised that autophagy acts as a protective response to hypoxia, and Beclin 1, ATG7 and ATG8 in oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) were chosen as potential biomarkers under hypoxia exposure; thus, their full-length cDNA sequences were cloned and characterised. Open reading frames (ORFs) of 1281, 2076 and 360 bp, encoding proteins of 427, 692 and 120 amino acid residues, respectively, were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the three M. nipponense proteins do not form a clade with vertebrate homologs. Protein and mRNA levels were investigated in different tissues and developmental stages, and all three were significantly upregulated in a time-dependent manner in the hepatopancreas following hypoxia stress. Biochemical and morphological analysis of hepatocytes revealed that hypoxia increased the abundance of hepatic autophagic vacuoles and stimulated anaerobic metabolism. RNA interference-mediated silencing of ATG8 significantly increased the death rate of M. nipponense juveniles under hypoxia stress conditions. Together, these results suggest that Beclin 1, ATG7 and ATG8 contribute to autophagy-based responses against hypoxia in M. nipponense. The findings also expand our understanding of the potential role of autophagy as an adaptive response against hypoxia toxicity in crustaceans. The results showed that hepatic ATG8 levels may be directly indicative of acute hypoxia in prawns, and provide insight into the time at which hypoxia exposure occurs. Autophagy-related genes expression pattern seems to be sensitive and good biomarkers of acute hypoxia exposure.",Adverse effects of bisphenol A on Sertoli cell blood-testis barrier in rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639874,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 26,"Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental contaminant, has been shown to disturb the dynamics of Sertoli cell blood-testis barrier (BTB) in mammal testis. However, the effects of BPA on Sertoli cell barrier (SC barrier) were little known in fish to date. To evaluate the potential mechanism of reproductive toxicity of BPA, we studied the damage of SC barrier using in vivo models. In this study, male adult rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus were exposed to 15 μg/L BPA for 7-35 days. Gonadal histology and the integrity of SC barrier were analyzed. Meanwhile, the expressions of SC barrier -associated proteins, tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) content, and the mRNA expressions of genes in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway were detected. Histological analysis demonstrated 15 μg/L BPA promoted the infiltration of inflammatory cells in fish testes after 7-days exposure. The biotin tracer assay showed that 7-days BPA exposure increased permeability for spermatid cysts. In addition, the BPA treatment caused increased TNFα in testis, which was reportedly related to SC barrier impairment. The expressions of Occludin and β-Catenin protein were significantly decreased in the testes after 7- and 21-days exposure. BPA also altered the mRNA expressions of occludin, β-catenin, p38 MAPK and JNK. Therefore, the detrimental effects of BPA on reproduction of male fish may attribute to the disturbed expressions of SC junction proteins.",Osteopontin potentiates PM-induced IL-1α and IL-1β production via the ERK/JNK signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639873,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 26,"Ambient particulate matter (PM) poses a great threat to global health and contributes to pulmonary inflammation. However, the potential mechanism of PM-induced inflammation of the lung remains unclear. Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein that reportedly regulates inflammatory responses in different diseases. Here, we explored the expression of OPN with PM exposure in vivo and in vitro and attempted to elucidate the regulatory role of OPN in PM-induced airway inflammation. Our results showed that PM exposure increased the expression of OPN in the bronchial epithelium, serum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice. Moreover, PM induced OPN expression in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in a dose and time-dependent manner. In vitro, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α and IL-1β were increased in HBECs with PM exposure via the ERK and JNK signaling pathways. Recombinant human OPN could potentiate PM-induced expression of IL-1α and IL-1β, while OPN siRNA could alleviate PM-induced inflammatory responses in HBECs. Furthermore, we showed that OPN regulated PM-induced inflammatory cytokines via the ERK and JNK pathways in HBECs. This study shows for the first time the positive effect of OPN on PM-induced airway inflammation and contributes to a better understanding of its potential mechanism of action.",Toxicokinetics and toxic effects of a Chinese PFOS alternative F-53B in adult zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639872,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 26,"6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), a Chinese PFOS alternative, has recently been identified in river water, sewage sludge, wildlife and humans, causing great concerns about its potential toxic effects. Here, we report the first investigation of the toxicokinetics and oxidative stress of F-53B in adult zebrafish. Adult male and female zebrafish were exposed to 10 and 100 μg/L of F-53B for 7 days followed by a 5-d depuration period to examine bioaccumulation, distribution, and depuration of F-53B in fish. The results showed that F-53B was readily accumulated in fish tissues with log BCF values of 2.36-3.65, but was eliminated slowly (t1/2 = 152.4-358.5 h). F-53B accumulation was greater in males than in females and the concentration in tissues decreased in the following order: gonad ≈ liver ≫ gill ≫ brain in females and liver ≈ gill ≫ gonad ≫ brain in males, showing sex- and tissue- specific accumulation of F-53B in fish. After chronic exposure to F-53B for 28 days, a significant dose-dependent increase in histopathological changes in the liver were mainly manifested by vacuolation. Furthermore, F-53B also significantly reduced the enzyme activity (or content) of most of the measured oxidative stress-related markers (e.g., SOD, CAT and MDA) except for an increase in GSH-Px activity, indicating that oxidative stress was induced in zebrafish after treatment with F-53B. The results of this study provide important information on the toxicokinetics and toxic effects of F-53B, which will contribute to the ecological risk assessments of F-53B released into surface waters."

Manufacturing companies may decide to integrate a product-service system into their activities. However, there is no clear evidence of the effects of servitization on performance or sustainability, particularly in a circular economy. The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of servitization on sustainability in a sample of 208 European listed manufacturing companies by investigating corporate sustainability disclosure, environmental performance, and policies. Using the business descriptions in the Bloomberg database, we identified two groups of companies: ""pure manufacturers"" and ""non-pure manufacturers."" We examined potential differences in sustainability between the two groups resulting from servitization. Data were collected for the fiscal year 2016. Our findings suggest that servitization leads to improved energy consumption and therefore enhances environmental performance. However, servitization had no effect on corporate sustainability disclosure and other environmental policies such as environmental assurance, emissions reduction policies, and environmental supply chain management.","Landscape characteristics driving spatial variation in total phosphorus and sediment loading from sub-watersheds of the Nottawasaga River, Ontario.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639859,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Eutrophication from agricultural runoff is a global problem, often resulting in formation of anoxic zones in receiving water bodies. The Nottawasaga River Watershed (NRW) is dominated by agricultural land-use, and drains into Nottawasaga Bay, Georgian Bay (Lake Huron). A fundamental feature of the NRW is the Minesing Wetlands, a Ramsar site and the largest inland wetland in southern Ontario. We used total phosphorus (TP) concentration-discharge relationships to estimate annual loading from six sub-watersheds and compared these against published models, which did not offer a way to account for the unique properties of the Minesing Wetlands. We developed predictive loading models specifically for the NRW to account for these characteristics, which accurately predict daily summer base-flow TP (r2 = 0.76, p = <0.0001) and total suspended solids (TSS; r2 = 0.65, p = <0.0001) loads for 11 subwatersheds using geomorphic and land-cover variables. Drainage area and % pasture land were the most significant predictive variables driving spatial variability in TP and TSS loading rates among subwatersheds. The positive relationship between TP and % wetland (r2 = 0.22, p = 0.0063) also suggested that the Minesing Wetlands are a source of nutrients to the Nottawasaga River. Watershed geomorphology (e.g. slope) was a good predictor of land cover, and produced accurate loading estimates. This study is the first to offer a new approach to predict TP and TSS loading rates during the growing season using readily available geospatial data.",One-pot green synthesis of polymeric nanocomposite: Biodegradation studies and application in sorption-degradation of organic pollutants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639858,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"The research work proposes the synthesis of a nanocomposite hydrogel which is a dual combination of binary interpenetrating network (BIPN) and bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. BIPN synthesized from binary graft copolymer (BGC) used as starting material. The cross-linked network of BGC is interpenetrating the newly synthesized cross-linked network of poly(acrylic acid) and the product is named as BIPN. Binary graft copolymer had been synthesized from grafting of guggul aqueous extract with copolymeric chains of acrylamide (primary monomer) and acrylic acid (secondary monomer) crosslinked by N,N'-methylene bisacrylamide (MBA). The maximum percentage swelling was evaluated for BGC through optimization of various reaction parameters: amount of water, binary ratio of acrylamide to acrylic acid, concentrations of MBA, ammonium persulphate, pH, temperature and time. Considering pre-optimized parameters for BGC synthesis, BIPN formation required optimization of only acrylic acid. Maximum percentage swelling obtained was 1497.79% and 308.15% for BGC and BIPN, respectively. Maximum percentage biodegradation of 90.64% and 82.38% were calculated for BGC and BIPN, respectively using composting method. Degradation efficiency of brilliant blue (BB) and fuchsin basic (FB) dyes was in the order: Nanocomposite ≫ BIPN > BGC. Maximum percentage degradation observed in case of nanocomposite was 94.1% and 99.3% in sunlight for BB and FB, respectively. The interaction of dyes with the nanocomposite involved mainly ionic interactions. The adsorption models Freundlich and Langmuir were applicable to overall adsorption and degradation process of BB and FB, respectively. Maximum adsorption capacities corresponding to minimum concentration i.e. 10 mg L-1 for BB and FB were calculated as 0.409 mg g-1 and 0.439 mg g-1, respectively. Second order and first order kinetics were found to be suitable for BB and FB adsorption-degradation pathways, respectively. Intraparticle diffusion mechanism was favorable to both dyes and adsorption followed three steps. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric analysis could give the degraded products which was helpful in drawing degradation pathway. The degradation process involved active radical species (O2-., OH.) and they carry out oxidation-reduction reactions on dyes to give decolorized solution containing mineral ions.",Effects of atmospheric-plasma system on energy efficiency improvement and emissions reduction from a diesel engine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639857,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"Efficient energy usage and energy saving is one of the nowadays necessity for all scientists of IC engine. This is because of the current environmental challenges that have tremendously increased concerning air pollution, particularly pollutant emissions from vehicles. Yet, industries and governments alike have disregarded this phenomenon which has been considerably contributing to climate change. It is against this background that, the research works carried out in this present study is predominantly focusing on improving energy efficiency and reducing emission levels from diesel engines. This can be achieved with the help of atmospheric-plasma system which can offer a noble solution to the above-mentioned challenges due to its potential to improve combustion efficiency which leads to energy efficiency, while reducing emission levels from diesel engines. In this study, the performance and emissions of a diesel generator supplemented with an atmospheric-plasma system was examined. The diesel engine was used to examine the effects of fuel composition, or brake specific fuel consumption, thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at different plasma system voltages. To this end, we equally examined the effects of atmospheric-plasma system on energy efficiency improvement and emissions reduction from diesel engine as the main purpose of this study. We do so by testing the diesel-fueled engine generator under the atmospheric-plasma system. The tests were carried out at a constant state condition with the engine running at 2200 rpm with torque and power outputs of 10.4 Nm (75% of the max load) and 2.1 kW, separately, for the tested fuels and this was used to increase the output voltage of the plasma system during this study. The plasma system ionized the intake air and improved the formation of free radicals upon combustion. During this study, the output voltage of the plasma was set within the range of 0-7 kV. The experimental results have indicated that formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein account for more than 75% of total carbonyl compounds emissions. Simultaneously, it was also observed from the results that higher plasma system voltage reduces pollutants emissions levels. Hence, such reduction is predominantly evident for nitrogen oxides, particulate matters and carbon monoxide. However, the marginal improvements of engine performance and emissions reduction become insignificant when the plasma system voltage reaches 6 kV. On the other hand, increasing the amount of plasma system voltages in diesel engine continues to significantly reduce pollutant emissions.",Organic management increases soil nitrogen but not carbon content in a tropical citrus orchard with pronounced N2O emissions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639856,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 06,"The use of organic amendments is important for the sustainability of organic farming, with implications for soil organic matter turnover, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions to the atmosphere. Here, we investigated how long-term citrus organic farming influenced carbon sequestration and GHG emissions under organic and conventional management. We assessed the effects of management systems on soil organic matter dynamics and GHG emissions, focusing on N2O direct emissions from fertilizers. Soil stable isotope C and N compositions (0-100 cm) were used as parameters to assess changes in soil organic matter dynamics, with native forest as the reference. After the conversion from forest to orange orchard, stocks of soil C increased approximately 40 Mg ha-1, whereas stocks were similar in the organic and conventional treatments. Enrichment of 13C through the entire soil profile showed that organic matter from fertilizer replaced the original soil C by at least 20%, considering that poultry was fed only with C4 plants. By contrast, organic farming increased soil N stocks and inorganic N. Nitrogen emission factors for inorganic and organic fertilizers were 1.47 and 3.14, respectively. Organic management increased soil GHG emissions, primarily N2O emissions. Carbon emissions either as CO2 or CH4 were greater at the mid-rows than those under the crop canopy. We conclude that organic management did not promote C sequestration after six years of management. Moreover, organic management increased N2O emissions, and the GHG balance was more negative for organic than that for conventional farming when the ratio between crop harvest and emissions was determined.",Contemporary understanding of zoophilia - A multinational survey study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639855,Journal of forensic and legal medicine,2019 03 14,"People with paraphilias have sexual interests that are unusual, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children, corpses).

Artificial intelligence methods require no significant expertise to implement once trained, are rapid to use, and have the potential to eliminate human bias from sex estimation of skeletal remains.",Srv2 Is a Pro-fission Factor that Modulates Yeast Mitochondrial Morphology and Respiration by Regulating Actin Assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639852,iScience,2019 01 26,"Dynamic processes such as fusion, fission, and trafficking are important in the regulation of cellular organelles, with an abundant literature focused on mitochondria. Mitochondrial dynamics not only help shape its network within cells but also are involved in the modulation of respiration and integrity. Disruptions of mitochondrial dynamics are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Although proteins that directly bind mitochondria to promote membrane fusion/fission have been studied intensively, machineries that regulate dynamic mitochondrial processes remain to be explored. We have identified an interaction between the mitochondrial fission GTPase Dnm1/DRP1 and the actin-regulatory protein Srv2/CAP at mitochondria. Deletion of Srv2 causes elongated-hyperfused mitochondria and reduces the reserved respiration capacity in yeast cells. Our results further demonstrate that the irregular network morphology in Δsrv2 cells derives from disrupted actin assembly at mitochondria. We suggest that Srv2 functions as a pro-fission factor in shaping mitochondrial dynamics and regulating activity through its actin-regulatory effects.",ALS-Linked SOD1 Mutants Enhance Neurite Outgrowth and Branching in Adult Motor Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639851,iScience,2019 02 02,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron cell death. However, not all motor neurons are equally susceptible. Most of what we know about the surviving motor neurons comes from gene expression profiling; less is known about their functional traits. We found that resistant motor neurons cultured from SOD1 ALS mouse models have enhanced axonal outgrowth and dendritic branching. They also have an increase in the number and size of actin-based structures like growth cones and filopodia. These phenotypes occur in cells cultured from presymptomatic mice and mutant SOD1 models that do not develop ALS but not in embryonic motor neurons. Enhanced outgrowth and upregulation of filopodia can be induced in wild-type adult cells by expressing mutant SOD1. These results demonstrate that mutant SOD1 can enhance the regenerative capability of ALS-resistant motor neurons. Capitalizing on this mechanism could lead to new therapeutic strategies.",Surfactant-Assisted Cooperative Self-Assembly of Nanoparticles into Active Nanostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639850,iScience,2019 02 02,"Nanoparticles (NPs) of controlled size, shape, and composition are important building blocks for the next generation of devices. There are numerous recent examples of organizing uniformly sized NPs into ordered arrays or superstructures in processes such as solvent evaporation, heterogeneous solution assembly, Langmuir-Blodgett receptor-ligand interactions, and layer-by-layer assembly. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly method using amphiphilic surfactants and NPs to synthesize new classes of highly ordered active nanostructures. Driven by cooperative interparticle interactions, surfactant-assisted NP nucleation and growth results in optically and electrically active nanomaterials with hierarchical structure and function. How the approach works with nanoscale materials of different dimensions into active nanostructures is discussed in details. Some applications of these self-assembled nanostructures in the areas of nanoelectronics, photocatalysis, and biomedicine are highlighted. Finally, we conclude with the current research progress and perspectives on the challenges and some future directions."

One of the important goals in longitudinal imaging analysis is to study changes in brain functional networks across time and how the changes are modulated by subjects' clinical or demographic variables. In current neuroscience literature, one of the most commonly used tools to extract and characterize brain functional networks is independent component analysis (ICA), which separates multivariate signals into linear mixture of independent components. However, existing ICA methods are only applicable to cross-sectional studies and not suited for modeling repeatedly measured imaging data. In this paper, we propose a novel longitudinal independent component model (L-ICA) which provides a formal modeling framework for extending ICA to longitudinal studies. By incorporating subject-specific random effects and visit-specific covariate effects, L-ICA is able to provide more accurate estimates of changes in brain functional networks on both the population- and individual-level, borrow information across repeated scans within the same subject to increase statistical power in detecting covariate effects on the networks, and allow for model-based prediction for brain networks changes caused by disease progression, treatment or neurodevelopment. We develop a fully traceable exact EM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of L-ICA. We further develop a subspace-based approximate EM algorithm which greatly reduce the computation time while still retaining high accuracy. Moreover, we present a statistical testing procedure for examining covariate effects on brain network changes. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of our proposed methods. We apply L-ICA to ADNI2 study to investigate changes in brain functional networks in Alzheimer disease. Results from the L-ICA provide biologically insightful findings which are not revealed using existing methods.",The role of intolerance of uncertainty in current and remitted internalizing and externalizing psychopathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639836,Journal of anxiety disorders,2019 02 05,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a putative key, transdiagnostic factor in internalizing psychopathologies. However, it is unclear if elevated levels of IU, as measured by the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, short form (IUS-12) and its subscales (prospective and inhibitory IU), persist into remission of internalizing psychopathologies (or particular types of internalizing psychopathologies; e.g., fear vs. distress-misery disorders). It is also unknown if IU is specifically characteristic of internalizing (vs. externalizing) psychopathology and whether this relationship is independent of neuroticism/negative affectivity (N/NA). A large community sample (n = 517) completed a diagnostic interview and self-report measures of IU and N/NA. Results indicated that, independent of N/NA, IU was elevated in current fear and distress/misery disorders, but not externalizing disorders. Individuals with remitted fear disorders also displayed significantly elevated levels of IU in comparison to healthy controls after adjusting for levels of N/NA. In terms of subscales, elevated levels of inhibitory IU, and not prospective IU, demonstrated more reliable relationships with internalizing psychopathologies. In summary, IU was more consistently related to fear disorders, demonstrated incremental validity over and above the effects of N/NA, and may be a key, transdiagnostic mechanism in fear disorders.",Examining interpersonal self-transcendence as a potential mechanism linking meditation and social outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639834,Current opinion in psychology,2019 06 14,"Distinct types of meditation practice addressed in this review can help cultivate skills people may bring to later social interactions. We examine self-transcendence, or the drive to benefit others beyond the self, as a key mechanism through which meditation may promote positive social outcomes. Self-transcendence cultivated through various styles of meditation can impact social outcomes through two main pathways: First, self-transcendence can turn rigid, defensive self-focus into flexible and receptive self-construals. Second, it can increase positive other-focus by integrating reward and social signals in the brain. These accounts offer one practical solution of positively transforming social relations and highlight potential usefulness of considering self-transcendence in researching social effects of meditation.",Explorations into the nature and function of compassion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639833,Current opinion in psychology,2019 05 23,"Compassion has become a major focus for international research in prosocial behaviour.

The natural history of SCD predicts progressive loss of 1 IQ point per year attributable to disease-related pathology. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is curative by reverting to donor-derived erythropoiesis, but evidence that HCT can positively influence disease-induced cognitive decline is lacking. The Sickle Cell Unrelated Transplant Trial prospectively evaluated cognition and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at 2 years after reduced-intensity conditioning followed by unrelated donor HCT. Thirteen study participants completed pre-HCT and post-HCT assessments of intelligence. The mean age of participants was 12.5 ± 3.3 years (range, 6.7 to 17.4 years). Eleven of the 13 recipients completed imaging studies at baseline and post-HCT. Seven had overt stroke pre-HCT, and 1 had an elevated transcranial Doppler velocity with abnormal MRI. The mean Full-Scale IQ was stable: 90.9 ± 13 at baseline and 91.2 ± 13 post-HCT. The mean Performance IQ was 89.9 ± 13 at baseline versus 90.9 ± 13 post-HCT, and mean Verbal IQ was 93.4 ± 13 at baseline versus 93.2 ± 13 post-HCT, respectively. Six recipients had stable MRI; 2 showed resolution of all areas of infarction. Three had additional infarcts post-HCT noted at the 2-year time point. This is the first report describing stabilization of IQ and central nervous system outcomes after unrelated donor HCT despite previous central nervous system morbidity and post-HCT posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. These preliminary results post-HCT suggest that HCT may stabilize the cognitive decline of SCD and should continue to be followed over the long term."

This study firstly evaluated the distribution of pyrolysis products including SAC, oils and gases during sludge pyrolysis at different temperatures (400 °C-800 °C) and corncob addition proportions (0-50%, w/w). The results demonstrated that with the increase of pyrolysis temperature, yield of SAC declined dramatically, while yields of pyrolysis oils and gases increased. With increasing addition of corncob, the yields of SAC and pyrolysis oils declined slightly, while the yield of gases generally increased. Then, the potential energy recovery during sludge pyrolysis was calculated, and the highest energy recovery value was 10.21 kJ/g achieved at 800 °C and 50% corncob addition. However, higher pyrolysis temperature over 600 °C resulted in lower yield and iodine adsorption capacity of SAC. Therefore, the suitable conditions were suggested to be at 600 °C with 50% corncob addition considering both adsorption performance of SAC and potential energy recovery efficiency.",Insight into the mechanisms for hexavalent chromium reduction and sulfisoxazole degradation catalyzed by graphitic carbon nitride: The Yin and Yang in the photo-assisted processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639812,Chemosphere,2019 03 15,"As robust polymeric catalysts, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been known to have great application potential in environmental remediation. However, the mechanisms in the photo-assisted catalytic processes during the reduction or oxidation of pollutants are still difficult to discern and therefore not well studied. In this work, visible-assisted catalytic reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) or oxidation of sulfisoxazole (SIZ) by g-C3N4 with the addition of formic acid (FA) or potassium peroxydisulfate (PS) were systematically investigated. Effects of operation parameters such as g-C3N4 dosage, FA concentration, Cr(VI) concentration, solution pH, PS concentration were studied. The results showed g-C3N4 can be effective and robust catalyst for both the reduction (Yin) and oxidation (Yang) reactions in the environmental remediation. Mechanisms were studied by using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The results revealed the CO 2- is the predominant radical for Cr(VI) reduction in the g-C3N4/FA/Vis system and the SO4- and OH are all the main radicals for the oxidation of SIZ in the g-C3N4/PS/Vis system. The photo-generated carriers by g-C3N4, act as radical initiator, were responsible for the production of the reactive radical species in aqueous solution. This work not only shed a new light on the application of semiconductor polymers for the removal of micropollutants and also will expand the applicability of the polymeric photocatalysts for environmental remediation.","Characterization, source identification and risk associated with polyaromatic and chlorinated organic contaminants (PAHs, PCBs, PCBzs and OCPs) in the surface sediments of Hooghly estuary, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639811,Chemosphere,2019 03 15,"The spatial distribution, source identification and ecotoxicological impact of a group of persistent organic pollutants (POPs: dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorobenzenes (PCBzs)), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in surface sediment samples (0-5 cm, <63 μm grain size) along the ecologically stressed Hooghly River estuary, East India. The results demonstrated a wide range of concentrations (ng/g dry weight) with the following decreasing order: ∑16PAHs (3.3-630) > ∑6DDTs (0.14-18.6) > ∑7PCBs (0.28-7.7) > ∑2PCBzs (0.01-1.3) > ∑5HCH (0.10-0.6), with a dominance of p,p'-DDT and higher molecular weight PAHs. Selected diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of both pyrolytic and petrogenic sources of PAHs, inputs of weathered DDT and their degradation in oxidizing environment, and a predominance of industrial input over the agricultural wastes. The cumulative impact of the pollutants (effective range medium quotient (ERMq): 0.01-0.16) reflected minimal to low ecotoxicological risk, with highest probability of toxic effects towards surrounding biota at Barrackpore (21%). ∑6DDTs exceeded the effect range low value resulting occasional adverse impact to the sediment dwelling organisms.

Feasibility of utilizing Fe(II)/S2O82- oxidation integrated with microwave irradiation (MW) in improving gel-like floc destruction, water seepage and WAS dewaterability was investigated. Comprehensive characterization of the treated WAS was conducted to explore the effects of MW on the catalyzing kinetics of Fe(II)/S2O82- oxidation and reveal the underlying dewatering principle. The results demonstrated that MW-Fe(II)/S2O82-process was more cost-efficient, reagent-saving than single Fe(II)/S2O82- oxidation or MW irradiation in stimulating WAS dewaterability and the optimal conditions were 0.4/0.5 mmol-Fe(II)/S2O82- g-1-TS (total solids) and 500 W with 94.6% capillary suction time (CST) reduction within 120 s of conditioning. Thermal effect of MW reduced the activation energy of S2O82- decomposition and stimulated the generation of more SO4-· while athermal effect could create additional gel-network destruction and cell lysis, which reduced the water-binding energy and induced the seepage of more extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)-bound and cell water. Further analysis via fluorescence excitation-emission matrix combined with parallel factor analysis demonstrated that protein-like, humic- and fulvic-like substances in slime EPS (S-EPS) and loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS) together affected sludge dewaterability.

However, conventional disinfection strategies in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) require further optimization in combating the antibiotic resistome. Here, we show that antimicrobial resins with quaternary ammonium salts (AMRs-QAS) exhibit great potentials in diminishing specific potential pathogens that relatively resist chlorine or UV disinfection in DWTPs, and comprehensive analyses using microscopy and fluorescence techniques revealed that the antimicrobial capacity of AMRs-QAS mainly proceed via the bacterial adsorption and cell membrane dissociation. Moreover, a total of 15 among 30 selected ARGs, as well as 4 selected potential pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were all detected in the source water. Coupling the AMRs-QAS with 0.2 mg/L chlorine resulted in higher removal efficiencies than chlorination (2 mg/L) or UV disinfection (400 mJ cm-2) for all the detected pathogens and ARGs in drinking water and significantly decreased the relative abundances of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, as well as all the detected ARGs (p < 0.05). Co-occurrences of pathogens and ARGs were revealed by a correlation network and possibly accounts for the ARGs removal. This coupled disinfection strategy overcomes the limitations of individual disinfection methods, i.e. the enrichment of specific pathogens and ARGs among bacterial populations, and provides an alternative for minimizing health risks induced by the antibiotic resistome in DWTPs.",Ecological risk assessment of cerium for tropical agroecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639808,Chemosphere,2019 03 15,"Cerium (Ce) is present in high technology materials and in mineral P fertilizers and the use and discharge of such resources may change the natural status of Ce in the soil environment. Brazilian soils in farming areas are significantly exposed to increased levels of unintentionally-added Ce through intensive input of phosphate fertilizers. The aims of this study were to evaluate the ecotoxicological risk to plants growing in tropical soils contaminated with Ce, as well as to create a database to support future legislation regulating the limits of this element in Brazilian and conceivably other tropical soils. Eight crop species (corn, sorghum, rice, wheat, soybeans, sunflower, radish, and beans) were exposed to a Ce concentration gradient in two typical tropical soils (Oxisol and Inceptsol), and an artificial soil. Our findings showed that among the endpoints measured, Ce phytotoxicity was more pronounced on shoot dry matter than on percent germination and germination speed index. Sensitivity of plants is species specific and our data showed that sunflower and radish exposed to Ce were the most sensitive crop species. Soil properties such as pH, cation exchange capacity, and organic carbon may have influenced the severity of Ce phytotoxicity. Because of that, the Oxisol contaminated with this element caused higher phytotoxicity than the other soils tested. Our risk assessment results (hazardous concentration, HC5 = 281.6 mg Ce kg-1) support the idea that unintentional Ce input through P fertilizers does not pose a risk to soils of Brazilian agroecosystems.","Comparison of thyroid hormone disruption potentials by bisphenols A, S, F, and Z in embryo-larval zebrafish.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639807,Chemosphere,2019 03 15,"Several structural analogues of bisphenol A (BPA), e.g., bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol Z (BPZ), have been used as its substitutes in many applications and consequently detected in the environment, and human specimen such as urine and serum. While BPA has been frequently reported for thyroid hormone disruption in both experimental and epidemiological studies, less is known for the BPA analogues. In the present study, thyroid hormone disrupting effects of BPF, BPS and BPZ, were investigated, and compared with those of BPA, using embryo-larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). At 120 hpf, significant increases in T3 and/or T4 were observed in the larval fish following exposure to BPA, BPF, or BPS. Moreover, transcriptional changes of the genes related to thyroid development (hhex and tg), thyroid hormone transport (ttr) and metabolism (ugt1ab) were observed as well. Thyroid hormone (T4) disruption by BPF was observed even at the concentration (2.0 mg/L) lower than the effective concentration determined for BPA (>2.0 mg/L). Delayed hatching was observed by all tested bisphenols. Our results clearly show that these BPA analogues can disrupt thyroid function of the larval fish, and their thyroid hormone disruption potencies could be even greater than that of BPA. The concentrations which disrupt thyroid function of the larval fish were orders of magnitude higher than those occurring in the ambient environment. However, thyroid hormone disruption by longer term exposure and its consequences in the fish population, deserve further investigation.",Inadequacies of micronutrient intake in normal weight and overweight young adults aged 18-25 years: a cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639806,Public health,2019 05 01,This study aims to assess adequacy in micronutrient intake in comparison with reference nutrient intakes (RNI) and to identify differences in intakes between normal weight and overweight individuals.,Building capacity to use and undertake applied health research: establishing a training programme for the health workforce in the West of England.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639805,Public health,2019 05 01,"Increasing research capacity is important for health services as part of improving the conduct of high-quality research, which addresses the needs of patients and the public.

The mRNA results showed that IDO1 expression was inversely correlated with tumor thickness (9.93 ± 3.33 mm in IDO1-high group vs. 11.56 ± 2.38 mm in IDO1-low group) (p = 0.016) and metastatic rate (30.4% in IDO1-high group vs. 69.6% in IDO1-low group, p < 0.001). The IDO1-high group showed higher immune cell gene expression: CD3D (6.56 ± 1.0 vs. 5.46 ± 0.53, p < 0.0001), CD4 (4.72 ± 0.4 vs. 4.2 ± 0.42, p < 0.0001), and CD68 (6.17 ± 1.23 vs. 5.53 ± 0.77, p = 0.015). Further analysis showed that immune-suppressive T regulatory cell genes (CD3D, CD4, IL2RA and FOXP3) were expressed in 67.4% (31/46) cases in the IDO1-high group and 23.91% (11/46) cases in the IDO1-low group. In addition, IDO1 and interferon gamma (IFNG) mRNA expression were strongly correlated (r = 0.70, p < 0.0001). The correlation analysis of different immune checkpoints showed that IDO1 was positively correlated with CD274(PDL1), but not CTLA4 or PDCD1.The disease-free survival (DFS) in the IDO1-high/IFNG-high group was better than that of the IDO1-low/IFNG-low group. The IDO1 immunostaining result showed that 2 cases in 18 UMs with Bruch's membrane (BM) rupture and 7 out of 9 cases without BM rupture were scored high (Grade 2-3) (p = 0.001). Comparing the immune cells staining results between IDO1-high group and IDO1-low group, higher percentage of patients in the former group had high levels of T cells and macrophages infiltration, but only the difference in macrophage was statistically significant (CD68, 77.78% vs. 27.78%, p = 0.04). The analysis based on GEO data and the result from immunostaining study are consistent with each other. In conclusion, the expression of IDO1 is probably induced by IFNγ from infiltrated immune cells in UM. BM rupture is an important indicator of IDO1 expression level and distribution pattern. The complex role of IDO1 may limit its therapeutic effect in UM.",Rhythm characteristics and patterns of change during cardiopulmonary resuscitation for in-hospital paediatric cardiac arrest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639791,Resuscitation,2019 02 25,"During paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), patients may transition between pulseless electrical activity (PEA), asystole, ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT), and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

High Cd availability showed no significant decline in growth, chlorophyll synthesis, soluble protein, cell and membrane stability in Sonarbangla (Cd-tolerant), while these were severely affected in BRRI 72 (Cd-sensitive). Atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrated a huge increment of Cd and Fe in root and shoot of BRRI 72; however, Sonarbangla only exhibited a significant increase of Cd in roots. It suggests that excess Cd in Sonarbangla possibly retained in roots through vacuolar sequestration without interfering cell functions. This was further confirmed by the increased accumulation of cysteine, glutathione, and phytochelatin along with OsPCS1 and OsHMA3 upregulation, possibly facilitated by nitric oxide in roots of Sonarbangla. Further, Fe chelate reductase activity in conjunction with the genes (OsFRO1, OsNRAMP1, OsIRT1, and OsYSL15) associated with Fe availability significantly upregulated in BRRI 72 but not in Sonarbangla in response to Cd. It advises that Fe acquisition and transport were tightly regulated in Cd-tolerant Sonarbangla. Furthermore, elevated CAT, APX, GR, NO in root along with shoot sugar helps rice plants to withstand Cd-induced oxidative damage. Finally, reciprocal grafting combining Sonarbangla rootstock with either BRRI 72 or Sonarbangla scion showed Sonarbangla type tolerance along with no changes of H2O2 and Fe reductase activity in roots under high Cd. It indicates that the signal inducing the responses to adjust Cd stress is originated in the root system.

The analysis of the chlorophyll fluorescence transient, pulse-modulated fluorescence, 820-nm reflection, and expression of core proteins for photosystems demonstrated that photosystem II (PSII) activity developed more rapidly than did photosystem I (PSI) activity. The slower development of the PSI activity restricted linear and cyclic electron transport and thus inhibited the production of ATP and NADPH, which inhibits the activation of Rubisco, resulting in low activity of carboxylation efficiency. The application of exogenous NADPH (50 μM) and ATP (100 μM) to leaves remarkably increased the Pn and CE in the youngest leaf but not in the fully expanded leaf, which indicated that an inadequate supply of the assimilatory power significantly inhibited CE and Pn.

In general, it is considered that numerous nucleotide variations (e.g., whole chloroplast genomes) can identify species with higher resolution than a few loci, e.g., partial chloroplast or nuclear gene fragments. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by sampling population genetics samples of the endangered herb genus Notopterygium. We sequenced the complete plastomes, five nuclear gene regions, three chloroplast DNA fragments, and a nuclear internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) region for 18 populations sampled throughout most of the geographic ranges of all six Notopterygium species. Species identification analysis showed that four DNA barcodes (matK, rbcL, trnS-trnG, and nrITS) and/or combinations of these markers achieved Notopterygium species discrimination at higher resolution than the general plastomes and nuclear gene sequences. In particular, nrITS had the highest discriminatory power among all of the individual markers. Molecular data sets and morphological evidence indicated that all six Notopterygium species could be reclassified unambiguously to four putative species clades. N. oviforme and N. franchetii had the closest relationship. Molecular dating showed that the origin and divergence of Notopterygium species was significantly associated with geological and climatic fluctuations during the middle of the Pliocene. In conclusion, our results suggest that a few nucleotide variations can achieve species discrimination with higher resolution than numerous plastomes and general nuclear gene fragments when discerning related Notopterygium species.","Tempo and mode in coevolution of Agave sensu lato (Agavoideae, Asparagaceae) and its bat pollinators, Glossophaginae (Phyllostomidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639765,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2019 05 31,"The genus Agave sensu lato contains ca. 211 described species, many of which are considered keystone species because of their ecological dominance and the quantity of resources they provide with their massive, nectar-rich inflorescences. The large diversity of Agave species has been hypothesized as being related to their reproductive strategy (predominantly monocarpic) and diverse pollinators (e.g., bats, hummingbirds, hawkmoths). In particular, Agave species provide resources that a few genera of nectar feeding bats from the subfamily Glosophaginae are dependent upon. To explore a possible coevolutionary relationship between Agave and the bat species that pollinate them, we calibrated molecular phylogenies of both groups and looked for a correlation in their dates of divergence. One coding and two non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome were sequenced from 49 species of the Agavoideae (Asparagaceae), and the mitochondrial gene Cyt-b and nuclear coding gene RAG2 were either sequenced or obtained from gene bank for 120 Phyllostomid bats. Results from the analyses indicate that Agave sensu lato is a young genus (estimated crown age 2.7-8.5/stem age 4.6-12.3 Ma), with an increasing diversification rate, and the highest speciation rate among Agavoideae's clades. The origin of the Glossophaginae bats (stem age 20.3-23.5 Ma) occurred prior to the stem age of Agave sensu lato, while the origin of the current pollinators of Agave species, members of the genera Glossophaga, Leptonycteris, Anoura, Choeronyscus, Musonycteris and Choeronycteris, was estimated to be around 6.3-16.2 Ma, overlapping with the stem age of Agave sensu lato, supporting the hypothesis of diffuse coevolution.",Food for Thought: A Randomized Trial of Food Insecurity Screening in the Emergency Department.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639763,Academic pediatrics,2019 02 23,"Despite the growing interest in screening for food insecurity in the clinical setting, little evidence exists regarding screening formats that maximize disclosure and caregiver comfort.",Impact of a Resident Research Grant on Scholarly Output During Pediatric Residency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639762,Academic pediatrics,2019 05 06,Lack of research funding is a known barrier to performing research during residency.

Also, these methods do not allow objective and quantitative investigation of the role of formulation and process variables, which is essential for quality-by-design drug product development. In this study, an X-ray microcomputed tomography (XμCT) method to analyze internal tablet defects is developed using tablets from a quality-by-design design-of-experiment study. The design of experiment investigated the effect of roller compaction roll force, filler composition, and the amount of magnesium stearate on tablet quality attributes. Average contiguous void volume by optical image processing and fracture size distribution and direction by artificial intelligence-based image processing quantified the internal tablet fracture severity. XμCT increased formulation and process knowledge in support of scale-up manufacturing. We demonstrated how XμCT can be incorporated as a part of a holistic approach to quantitatively identify and mechanistically assess the risks of internal tablet defects.

These complex components present challenges for the bioequivalence assessment of the drug products. The objective of the study was to develop a method that can probe the underlying mechanism and process of drug distribution. The concept of drug partitioning into biphasic systems was used to simplify the complex transfer phenomenon. A kinetic method was developed taking into account the biphasic diffusion. Using this approach, both the rate (kinetics) and the extent (equilibrium) of distribution can be determined. For method development purpose, 3 model compounds (triamcinolone acetonide, difluprednate, and cyclosporine), with expected partition coefficient values ranging from 2 to 6, were tested using the kinetic method and the traditional shake-flask method. The values obtained by the 2 methods for all compounds correlated well (r2 = 0.825).

The effects of a series of production parameters on mean particle size, particle size distribution and drug loading of Npb-PTXS were systematically evaluated. The characteristics of Npb-PTXS, such as surface morphology, physical status of paclitaxel (PTX) in Npb-PTXS, redispersibility of Npb-PTXS in purified water and bioavailability in vivo were also investigated. It is revealed that the optimal preparation conditions included an aqueous phase pH value of about 6.5, protein mass concentration of 0.33%, with mass ratio of PTX to protein of 30%, high pressure of 1200 bar, high-pressure passes of 25 times and low-pressure emulsifying passes of 20 times.

We describe here a number of new findings through a comprehensive characterization of 6 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) following selective oxidation of Trp residues by 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride. Fluorescence spectroscopy, in combination with second derivative analysis, demonstrates that the loss of Trp fluorescence intensity is a sensitive indicator of Trp oxidation in mAbs. Size-exclusion chromatography with UV and intrinsic Trp fluorescence detection was demonstrated to be a useful method to monitor Trp oxidation levels in mAbs. Furthermore, the Trp oxidation levels measured by size-exclusion chromatography with UV and intrinsic Trp fluorescence detection were found to be in agreement with the values obtained from tryptic peptide mapping by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection and correlate with the total solvent accessible surface area of the exposed Trp residues from in silico modeling. Finally, near-UV circular dichroism and Raman spectroscopy were used to evaluate the impact of Trp oxidation on HOS and identify specific oxidation products, respectively.

Prior experimental work suggests that an increase in internal air pressure on powder compression can directly contribute to the formation of cracks within a tablet. The present study examines the air pressure increase on compression in a fully two-dimensional axisymmetric tablet geometry while being coupled to a plasticity model describing the evolution of tablet relative density on consolidation. It is shown numerically that increasing compression speed results in a large air pressure increase on the order of 1-1.5 MPa which approaches the diametrical tensile strength of tablets. In addition, it is shown experimentally through X-ray microcomputed tomography scans of tablets made at various dwell times that increasing dwell times equivalent to that on a tablet press has no effect on the degree of cracking within the tablet. Only when dwell times reach a time scale of 10 to 100 s does the air pressure diminish to a point at which cracking is eliminated. The reduction in air pressure during these extended dwells is captured by the current model. The experimental and numerical work presented here couples for the first time an air pressure model and plasticity model on compression. In addition, it provides a foundation for understanding how realistic tableting aspects such as precompression and tablet size impact the air pressure increase on consolidation.",Factors Influencing Polysorbate's Sensitivity Against Enzymatic Hydrolysis and Oxidative Degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639738,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 05 24,"The aim was to compare the sensitivity of different grades of polysorbate 20 (PS20) and polysorbate 80 (PS80) against enzymatic hydrolysis and oxidative degradation in pharmaceutically relevant buffer systems. For this purpose, a fast liquid chromatography charged aerosol detection method was developed which allows to (1) differentiate between hydrolytic and oxidative PS degradation and (2) to monitor the PS decay over time. Systematic enzymatic and oxidative forced degradation studies were conducted with multicompendial PS20 and PS80, as well as all-laurate PS20 and all-oleate PS80 (with >98% oleic acid, as required by the Chinese Pharmacopoiea since 2015). No differences in the sensitivity toward enzymatic degradation were observed between multicompendial PS and high purity grade PS. However, all-laurate PS20 and all-oleate PS80 have a higher predisposition for oxidative degradation as compared to multicompendial PS20 and PS80. The buffer system used within the study played thereby a key role: histidine showed a protective effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidation, whereas hydrogen peroxide oxidation of PS in acetate buffer was severe under the experimental conditions. Furthermore, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid protected PS20 and PS80 against oxidative degradation in histidine buffer.",In Vitro Oral Cavity Model for Screening the Disintegration Behavior of Orodispersible Films: A Bespoke Design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639737,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 04 26,"The availability of biorelevant methods for the disintegration study of pharmaceutical orodispersible dosage forms is required.

This study proposes an adaptation of a mechanical oral cavity model for the disintegration study of orodispersible films. A periodic compression is applied to the sample in the presence of a biorelevant volume of artificial salivary fluid. Four orodispersible film samples (P1, C1, P2, and C2), differing in polymer type and molecular weight, and Listerine® were tested and filmed during disintegration.

In this study, we investigated the tolerability of a model freebase compound, GDC-0152, solubilized by pH adjustment with succinic acid and complexation with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) to enable intravenous use. Solubility, critical micelle concentration, and association constant with HP-β-CD were determined. Blood compatibility and potential for hemolysis were assessed in vitro. Local tolerability was assessed after intravenous and subcutaneous injections in rats. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in rats after intravenous bolus administration. GDC-0152 exhibited pH-dependent solubility that was influenced by self-association. The presence of succinic acid increased solubility in a concentration-dependent manner. HP-β-CD alone also increased solubility, but the extent of solubility enhancement was significantly lower than succinic acid alone. Inclusion of HP-β-CD in the solution of GDC-0152 improved blood compatibility, reduced hemolytic potential by ∼20-fold in vitro, and increased the maximum tolerated dose to 80 mg/kg.","Tafazzin-dependent cardiolipin composition in C6 glioma cells correlates with changes in mitochondrial and cellular functions, and cellular proliferation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639735,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular and cell biology of lipids,2019 02 10,"The mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) has been implicated with mitochondrial morphology, function and, more recently, with cellular proliferation. Tafazzin, an acyltransferase with key functions in CL remodeling determining actual CL composition, affects mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we show that the CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-out of tafazzin (Taz) is associated with substantial alterations of various mitochondrial and cellular characteristics in C6 glioma cells. The knock-out of tafazzin substantially changed the profile of fatty acids incorporated in CL and the distribution of molecular CL species. Taz knock-out was further associated with decreased capacity of oxidative phosphorylation that mainly originates from impaired complex I associated energy metabolism in C6 glioma cells. The lack of tafazzin switched energy metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis indicated by lower respiration rates, membrane potential and higher levels of mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species but keeping the cellular ATP content unchanged. The impact of tafazzin on mitochondria was also indicated by altered morphology and arrangement in tafazzin deficient C6 glioma cells. In the cells we observed tafazzin-dependent changes in the distribution of cellular fatty acids as an indication of altered lipid metabolism as well as in stability/morphology. Most impressive is the dramatic reduction in cell proliferation in tafazzin deficient C6 glioma cells that is not mediated by reactive oxygen species. Our data clearly indicate that defects in CL phospholipid remodeling trigger a cascade of events including modifications in CL linked to subsequent alterations in mitochondrial and cellular functions.",Olfactory receptor 43 reduces hepatic lipid accumulation and adiposity in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639733,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Olfr43 was expressed in mouse hepatocytes, and Olfr43 activation by a known ligand, (-)-carvone, stimulated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity. In ligand-receptor binding studies using site-directed mutagenesis, (-)-carvone binding required two residues, M257 and Y258, in Olfr43. In the mouse study, oral administration of (-)-carvone for 5 weeks in high-fat diet-fed mice improved energy metabolism, including reductions in hepatic steatosis and adiposity, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance. In mouse livers and cultured mouse hepatocytes, Olfr43 activation simulated the CREB-hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ signaling axis, leading to a reduction in hepatic triglyceride accumulation in the mouse liver. Thus, long-term administration of (-)-carvone reduces hepatic steatosis. The knockdown of Olfr43 gene expression in cultured hepatocytes negated these effects of (-)-carvone. In conclusion, an ectopic olfactory receptor, hepatic Olfr43, regulates energy metabolism via the CREB-HES1-PPARγ signaling axis."

It is a highly toxic metal with serious consequences on human and animal health. Different natural and anthropogenic sources are responsible for Cd release in the soil which ultimately leads to the food chain. Cd persists in soil for long durations due to its minimal microbial or chemical loss. There are various physical, chemical or biological techniques which are helpful to minimize Cd risk in food chain. Among them, in-situ immobilization with organic, inorganic or clay amendments is a cost-effective and an environment friendly strategy to remediate Cd polluted sites. Lime, biochar, organic wastes, phosphorus fertilizers, sepiolite, zeolite, hydroxyapatite and bentonite are commonly used amendments for amelioration of Cd contaminated soils. These amendments reduce Cd uptake and enhance immobilization by adsorption, complexation, and precipitation processes. This review is aimed to provide a comprehensive note on Cd toxicity in humans and environment, its immobilization by different agents through variety of processes, and comparison of technologies for Cd removal from contaminated sites.",Effect of biochar origin and soil type on the greenhouse gas emission and the bacterial community structure in N fertilised acidic sandy and alkaline clay soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639720,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"Soil amendment with biochar has received increased attention because of its potential to i) sequester carbon and ii) reduce N2O emission when applied to N fertilised soils. To study the effect of biochar origin on greenhouse gas emission in two contrasting soil types, we used a robotized continuous flow incubation system and δ13C stable isotope approach to compare four biochar types (feed stock: olive mill, corn cob, pistachio shell, cotton stalk) in an alkaline clay soil and two selected biochar types (feed stock: olive mill and corn cob) in an acidic sandy soil. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes was performed at the end of the incubation to investigate the effect of different biochars on bacterial community structure in the two different soils. In the alkaline clay soil, all biochar types in conjunction with N fertiliser decreased CO2 emissions up to 12% compared to the N added control treatment causing negative priming, whereas no significant effect of biochar addition on N2O emissions was observed. In contrast, application of olive mill biochar to the acidic sandy soil significantly increased soil pH, CO2, and N2O fluxes, whereas no significant effect of corn cob biochar addition was observed. There was a significant linear relationship between the biochar induced increase in soil pH and the biochar induced increase in soil born N2O emission. Additionally, we detected a clear variation in bacterial community structure in the acidic sandy soil (phyla Acidobacteria, Nitrospirare, and Arthrobacter) with the olive mill biochar addition. Overall, the amendment of different biochars failed to mitigate N2O emissions in both soil types when mineral fertiliser was added. Furthermore, amendment of olive mill biochar stimulated both N2O and CO2 emissions in the low pH sandy soil and altered the bacterial community structure, which was possibly related to its liming effect.",Environmental and cost life cycle assessment of different alternatives for improvement of wastewater treatment plants in developing countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639719,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Most of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in developing countries comprised primary and secondary treatment without including any tertiary treatment or sludge processing. Decision makers think that additional treatment is costly and the gained environmental benefits are limited. This study aims to investigate the environmental and economic benefits of improving current conventional WWTPs in developing countries by adding tertiary treatment and/or anaerobic digestion of sludge. For this purpose, life cycle assessment (LCA) for four different scenarios was studied for a wastewater plant located in Gamasa, Egypt. The 1st scenario is the plant in its current state. The 2nd scenario is the addition of anaerobic digestion of sludge. The 3rd scenario is the addition of a tertiary treatment stage. The 4th scenario is the addition of anaerobic digestion of sludge and tertiary treatment stage. CML 2000 method was used for assessing the environmental impacts of the four scenarios. The 4th scenario attained maximum environmental benefits for all categories due to the energy saving and the prospect of water reuse. The application of the 4th scenario achieved environmental benefits in some important categories such as ozone layer depletion. According to the economic evaluation, the addition of tertiary treatment leads to gain financial profits due to the value of the reusable produced water. This study underlines the importance of considering LCA in development of WWTPs in developing countries.","Insight into the formation of secondary inorganic aerosol based on high-time-resolution data during haze episodes and snowfall periods in Zhengzhou, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639718,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Episodic haze is frequently observed in Zhengzhou, China. Such haze typically contains secondary inorganic aerosols. In this paper, we explore the formation mechanisms of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA) in Zhengzhou from January 3 to 25, 2018 based on the results of a series of online instruments and a size-segregated filter sampler. Our results document the remarkable contributions of SNA to winter haze episodes in Zhengzhou, where they account for about 50% of PM2.5 mass concentration. SNA were mainly concentrated in droplet-mode particles, which increased remarkably with the aggravation of the haze episode. In addition, KNO3 and NaNO3 were formed in droplet-mode particles and coarse-mode particles respectively with increasing PM2.5 concentration. The atmosphere during the observation period was ammonia-rich, and the aerosol was acidic under high PM2.5 concentration. Homogeneous reactions dominated the formation of nitrate. HONO photolysis played a more important role in the origin of OH radicals when O3 decreased during haze episode. Under high relative humidity (RH), nitrate formation was influenced by heterogeneous hydrolysis reactions of N2O5. Sulfates were mainly formed through aqueous-phase reactions, especially when the RH was higher than 60%. Under these conditions, there were amounts of liquid water content existed in aerosols. Finally, we observed enhanced conversion of SO2 and NO2 during snowfall periods. This effect may be attributable to the higher RH and O3 levels despite the unfavorable effects of wet deposition and low concentrations of gaseous precursors.",Taxonomic changes and non-native species: An overview of constraints and new challenges for macroinvertebrate-based indices calculation in river ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639717,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"Freshwater ecosystems face many threats in the form of reduced water quantity, poor water quality and the loss of biodiversity. As a result, aquatic biomonitoring tools are required to enable the evaluation of these critical changes. Currently, macroinvertebrate-based indices are globally the most widely used biomonitoring tools in fluvial ecosystems. However, very little is known about the potential effects of changes in taxonomic understanding (updating of classification and nomenclature) or the presence of new non-native species for biotic indices calculation. This is especially relevant given that errors, incorrect classification or exclusion of new/updated nomenclature may affect ecological status evaluations and have direct consequences for the management and conservation of freshwater systems. In this discussion paper the main constraints, challenges and implications of these issues are outlined and case studies from a range of European countries are discussed. However, similar challenges affect rivers and managers globally and will potentially be amplified further in the future. Bioassessment science needs to be open to improvements, and current tools and protocols need to be flexible so that they can be updated and revised rapidly to allow new scientific developments to be integrated. This discussion highlights specific examples and new ideas that may contribute to the future development of aquatic biomonitoring using macroinvertebrates and other faunal and floral groups in riverine ecosystems.",A proposed delineation method for lake buffer zones in watersheds dominated by non-point source pollution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639716,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"Although buffer zones around aquatic areas are a useful method for controlling non-point source pollution and restoring natural ecosystem services, proper delineation methods for lakes remain poorly defined, restricting their protection and the rational utilization of resources. As the width of lake buffer zones should be set to meet the area's functional targets and requirements, this study proposes a methodology for delineating these zones that includes critical source areas for non-point source pollution and ecologically sensitive areas. The proposed method was tested on Zhushan Bay, Lake Tai, China given its poor environmental condition and a renewed focus on mitigation by the local government. Data sources and relative processing methods include vector data on land use and hydrographic networks processed by ArcGIS, digital elevation model (DEM) data with 30 m resolution, soil and socioeconomic data from local governmental statistical yearbooks, NPS pollution load into lake obtained by literatures and field survey. The results showed that a minimum buffer range could be practically determined while meeting the requirements of both environmental protection and economic needs, providing a theoretical and practical basis for the improved delineation and management of lake buffer zones in watersheds dominated by non-point source pollution.",Influence of growth phase on the harvesting of Scenedesmus acuminatus using ultrafiltration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639715,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"Cellular characteristics and algogenic organic matter (AOM) properties change with culture time. This study aims to understand the changes throughout the growth phase, and their effect on Scenedesmus acuminatus harvesting using ultrafiltration. The variations in cellular particle size distribution, cellular EPS content, and the biochemical composition and molecular weight of AOM were analyzed, followed by the membrane harvesting of the original S. acuminatus suspension, AOM-free cells and cell-free AOM. The results showed that the average flux for the original suspension increased with growth phase and reached an increase of 36.3% in the declining phase. AOM played a greater role than S. acuminatus cells in flux decline for all growth phases. Exponential-phase AOM contained a greater high-MW fraction and more carbohydrates, and the exponential cells were smaller cells and had a higher EPS content; these characteristics resulted in a reduced average flux.",Metal tolerance of arsenic-resistant bacteria and their ability to promote plant growth of Pteris vittata in Pb-contaminated soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639714,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"Soils contaminated with Pb and As are difficult to remediate. In this study, the utility of coupling As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata with metal-resistant rhizobacteria was explored. Siderophore-producing and P-solubilizing As-resistant bacteria from the P. vittata rhizosphere were screened for resistance to multiple metals. Results indicated Pseudomonas spp. strain PG-12 was most efficient in resisting multiple metals, i.e., up to 0.6 mM Cd and 10 mM Pb. Amplification of gene fragments encoding various metal efflux transporters (PbrA and CadA2) from genomic DNA of PG-12 suggested that metal efflux might play a role in its metal resistance and detoxification. In addition, PG-12 produced significant levels of plant growth hormones including 17.4 μg mL-1 indole acetic acid and 3.54 μg mL-1 gibberellin. P. vittata sporophytes inoculated with PG-12 were grown in Pb-contaminated medium and exhibited improved growth, increased P uptake, and reduced Pb uptake into plant tissue compared to the control. Results demonstrated that viable PG-12 cells were responsible for Pb immobilization and plant growth enhancement in P. vittata. The ability of PG-12 cells to solubilize P and display resistance to multiple metals combined with the production of plant hormones indole acetic acid and gibberellin make PG-12 a suitable candidate for plant growth promotion in metal-contaminated soil.",Affordable and efficient adsorbent for arsenic removal from rural water supply systems in Newfoundland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639713,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 07,"The fly ash from the Corner Brook Pulp and Paper (CBPP) mill was used in this study as the raw material for the preparation of a low-cost adsorbent for arsenic removal from the well water of Bell Island. The CBPP fly ash was physically activated in two different ways: (a) activation with pure CO2 (CAC) with the iodine number and methylene value of 704.53 mg/g and 292.32 mg/g, respectively; and (b) activation with a mixture of CO2 and steam (CSAC) with the iodine number and methylene value of 1119.98 mg/g and 358.95 mg/g, respectively, at the optimized temperature of 850 °C and the time of 2 h for both activations. The BET surface areas of the CAC and CSAC at the optimized conditions were 847.26 m2/g and 1146.25 m2/g, respectively. The optimized CSAC was used for impregnation with iron (III) chloride (FeCl3) with different concentrations (0.01 M to 1 M). The study shows that the adsorbent impregnated with 0.1 M FeCl3 is the most efficient adsorbent for arsenic removal. Isotherm analysis shows that the Langmuir model better describes the equilibrium behavior of the arsenic adsorption from both local well water and synthesized water compared to the other models. The maximum arsenic adsorption capacity was 35.6 μg/g of carbon for local well water and 1428.6 μg/g of carbon for synthesized water. Furthermore, the kinetic behavior of arsenic adsorption from synthesized and local well water was well depicted by the pseudo-second order kinetic model.",A mixed-methods approach to determine how conservation management programs and techniques have affected herbicide use and distribution in the environment over time.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639712,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 15,"No-till agriculture has the ability to reduce fuel consumption, increase soil moisture, reduce soil erosion and increase organic matter. However, it remains unclear whether it increases herbicide use overall in the long term for communities that use no-till as their primary source of conservation agriculture. The preponderance of literature suggests that no-till has increased herbicide use, but it is difficult to quantify how much herbicide has increased in a given location and to directly correlate changes in herbicide use to changes in soil and water quality. This paper provides several methods to determine how herbicide use has changed over time in an agricultural community in Oregon that switched over to no-till in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These methods include: spatial analysis of remote sensing satellite imagery of vegetation health along streams; use of a drone fitted with an agricultural camera to detect vegetation health; and soil, sediment, and water sampling for the most commonly used herbicides in the study area. By using these methods, this study shows where stream vegetation health continues to be an issue in the agricultural community, and where concentrations of a commonly used herbicide in the community may be impacting human and ecological health. This study has important implications for impacts to soil and water quality over time in agricultural communities, as many researchers have noted the need to determine the long term effects of conversion to no-till and other forms of conservation agriculture. By providing these methods, communities heavily engaged in multiple forms of conservation agriculture may be able to track herbicide use changes in real time and on shorter decadal time spans in places where conservation agriculture is practiced."

Extremes of sleep duration also associate with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system and the peripheral release of cortisol, a glucocorticoid (GC) important in downregulating transcription of pro-inflammatory molecules. Polymorphic variation in the gene encoding the GC receptor (GR; NR3C1) modulates cellular sensitivity to GC-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling, thereby affecting levels of pro-inflammatory molecules. Thus, we hypothesized that extremes of self-reported sleep duration may covary with circulating levels of inflammatory markers as a function of allelic variation in NR3C1. Specifically, we examine the possibility that a single nucleotide polymorphism of the GR gene-(rs6198), the minor (G) allele of which confers reduced GR sensitivity-moderates an association of sleep duration with interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) among a large sample (IL-6: N = 857; CRP: N = 929) of midlife community volunteers of European ancestry. Findings showed that sleep duration varied inversely with IL-6 (β = -0.087, p = .012), and this association was stronger among individuals homozygous for the rs6198 G-allele compared to alternate genotypes (β = -0.071, p = .039). We also found that sleep duration showed a U-shaped association with CRP (polynomial term: β = 0.093, p = .006), which was not moderated by rs6198 genotype. In conclusion, we show that a common genetic variant in the GR moderates an inverse association of self-reported sleep duration with circulating IL-6, possibly contributing to the increased disease risk observed among some short sleepers.",Mir363-3p attenuates post-stroke depressive-like behaviors in middle-aged female rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639697,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 05 02,"Women are more likely to develop Post Stroke Depression (PSD) than men and generally do not respond well to anti-depressants with age. This study investigated the effect of microRNA mir363-3p treatment on PSD using a physiologically-relevant animal model. Our previous work showed that mir363-3p treatment, delivered post-stroke, effectively reduces infarct volume in the acute phase of stroke in middle-aged females but not males. Middle-aged female Sprague Dawley rats were tested for baseline sensory motor function and depressive-like behaviors, and then subjected to ischemic stroke via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) or sham surgery. Animals received either control oligos (MCAo+scrambled, Sham+scrambled) or mir363-3p (MCAo+mir363-3p, Sham+mir363-3p) treatment 4 h later. Sensory motor function and depressive-like behaviors were reassessed up to 100 d after stroke, and circulating levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were quantified at regular intervals. Prior to termination, Fluorogold was injected into the striatum to assess meso-striatal projections. MCAo+scrambled animals had impaired sensorimotor performance in the acute phase (5 days) of stroke and developed anhedonia, decreased sociability and increased helplessness in the chronic phase. MCAo+mir363-3p animals showed significantly less sensory motor impairment and fewer depressive-like behaviors. IL-6 and TNF-alpha were elevated transiently at 4 weeks after MCAo in both groups. BDNF levels decreased progressively after stroke in the MCAo+scrambled group, and this was attenuated in the mir363-3p group. The number of retrogradely-labeled SNc and VTA cells was reduced in the ischemic hemisphere of the MCAo+scrambled group. In contrast, there was no interhemispheric difference in the number of retrogradely-labeled SNc and VTA cells of MCAo+mir363-3p treated animals. Our results support a therapeutic role for mir363-3p for long-term stroke disability.",Integration of A Deep Learning Classifier with A Random Forest Approach for Predicting Malonylation Sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639696,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",2019 05 01,"As a newly-identified protein post-translational modification, malonylation is involved in a variety of biological functions. Recognizing malonylation sites in substrates represents an initial but crucial step in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying protein malonylation. In this study, we constructed a deep learning (DL) network classifier based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with word embedding (LSTMWE) for the prediction of mammalian malonylation sites. LSTMWE performs better than traditional classifiers developed with common pre-defined feature encodings or a DL classifier based on LSTM with a one-hot vector. The performance of LSTMWE is sensitive to the size of the training set, but this limitation can be overcome by integration with a traditional machine learning (ML) classifier. Accordingly, an integrated approach called LEMP was developed, which includes LSTMWE and the random forest classifier with a novel encoding of enhanced amino acid content. LEMP performs not only better than the individual classifiers but also superior to the currently-available malonylation predictors. Additionally, it demonstrates a promising performance with a low false positive rate, which is highly useful in the prediction application. Overall, LEMP is a useful tool for easily identifying malonylation sites with high confidence. LEMP is available at http://www.bioinfogo.org/lemp.",Bovine eggs release zinc in response to parthenogenetic and sperm-induced egg activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639695,Theriogenology,2019 06 10,"Upon fertilization or parthenogenesis, zinc is released into the extracellular space through a series of exocytic events termed zinc sparks, which are tightly coordinated with intracellular calcium transients. The zinc spark reduces the total amount of intracellular zinc, and this reduction is necessary and sufficient to induce egg activation even in the absence of calcium transients. In addition, this zinc release contributes to the block to polyspermy through modification of the zona pellucida. The zinc spark has been documented in all organisms examined to date including the mouse, two species of nonhuman primates, and human. Here we determined whether zinc sparks occur in the bovine, an important model of gamete development in mono-ovulatory mammalian species. We obtained metaphase II-arrested (MII) bovine eggs following in vitro maturation. Total zinc, assessed in single cells using X-Ray Fluorescence Microscopy, was significantly more abundant in the bovine egg compared to iron and copper. Studies with intracellular fluorescent probes revealed that labile zinc pools are localized to discrete cytoplasmic punctae enriched at the cortex. To determine whether zinc undergoes dynamic fluxes during egg activation, we parthenogenetically activated bovine eggs using two approaches: ionomycin or bovine phospholipase C zeta (bPlcζ). Both these methods induced zinc sparks coordinately with intracellular calcium transients. The zinc spark was also observed in bovine eggs following intracytoplasmic sperm injection. These results establish that zinc is the most abundant transition metal in the bovine egg, and zinc flux during egg activation - induced by chemical activation or sperm - is a highly conserved event across mammalian species.",Generation of porcine induced-pluripotent stem cells from Sertoli cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639694,Theriogenology,2019 02 21,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are generated by reprogramming of somatic cells using four transcription factors: OCT4, SOX2, KLF-4, and c-MYC (OSKM). However, reprogramming efficiency of iPSCs is currently poor. In this study, we used the Sertoli line as a novel cell source for somatic cell reprogramming. Neonatal testes were collected from 1-week-old piglets. The testes were digested by a two-step enzymatic method to isolate Sertoli cells. The latter were transfected with retroviral vectors expressing OSKM. The Sertoli iPSC-like colonies were subjected to morphological analysis, alkaline phosphatase staining, RT-PCR, G-banding karyotyping, in vitro differentiation, and in vivo differentiation. Primary Sertoli cells had polygon-shaped morphology and manifested phagocytic activity as determined by a fluorescent bead assay. Sertoli cells also expressed the anti-Müllerian hormone protein in the cytoplasm. According to RT-PCR results, these cells expressed Sertoli cell markers (FSHR, KRT18, and GATA6) and endogenous transcription factors genes (KLF4 and c-MYC). A total of 240 colonies (0.3% efficiency) were detected by day 7 after viral transduction of 72500 cells. The Sertoli iPSC-like colonies contained small cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio. These colonies tested positive for alkaline phosphatase staining, expressed endogenous pluripotency genes, and had a normal karyotype. All these cell lines could form in vitro three-dimensional aggregates that represented three germ layers of embryonic-like cells. A total of two cell lines used for in vivo differentiation produced high-efficiency teratoma. In conclusion, Sertoli cells can efficiently serve as a novel cell source for iPSC reprogramming.",Flaxseed improves embryo production in Boer goats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639693,Theriogenology,2019 02 21,"Flaxseed is a source of polyunsaturated fatty acids and could be used as a dietary ingredient to enhance reproductive performance of ruminants. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of feeding diets with different levels of flaxseed on the nutrient intake, and quantity and quality of embryos in Boer goats. A total of 24 multiparous Boer goats were fed with a diet containing either 0, 4, 8 or 12% of flaxseed (n = 6 per group) and subjected to superovulation to determine the quantity and quality of embryos collected on 7 d after natural service. The nutrient intake was linearly associated with levels of flaxseed in the diet and, whereas while the fat (measured as ether extract) intake was positively associated, the non-fiber carbohydrate intake had a negative association with increasing levels of flaxseed in the diet. The quantity, quality and stage of embryonic development on 7 d after natural service were significantly different between levels of flaxseed in the diet. The number of viable embryos was greater in goats fed with a diet containing 4, 8, and 12% flaxseed (94, 84, and 87%, respectively) than those fed with a diet containing 0% flaxseed (65%). On the other hand, the number of degenerated embryos was greater for goats fed with a diet containing 0% flaxseed (35%) than those fed with a diet containing 4, 8, and 12% flaxseed (6, 16, and 13%, respectively). The proportion of grade 1 embryo collected was greater for goats fed with a diet containing 4 and 8% flaxseed (74 and 83%, respectively) than those fed with a diet containing 0 and 12% flaxseed (40 and 46%, respectively). In summary, our study demonstrated that feeding a diet with moderate levels of flaxseed could produce a greater number of better-quality embryos in Boer goats.",Novel auristatin E-based albumin-binding prodrugs with superior anticancer efficacy in vivo compared to the parent compound.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639692,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 18,"Auristatins are a class of highly cytotoxic tubulin-disrupting peptides, which have shown limited therapeutic effect as free agents in clinical trials. In our continuing effort to develop acid-sensitive albumin-binding anticancer drugs exploiting circulating serum albumin as the drug carrier, we investigated the highly toxic drug payload auristatin E to assess whether the corresponding albumin-binding prodrugs were a viable option for achieving significant and concomitant tolerable antitumor activity. To achieve our goal, we developed a new aromatic maleimide-bearing linker (Sulf07) which enhanced both water solubility and stability of the prodrugs. In this study, we describe two auristatin E-based albumin-binding drugs, AE-Keto-Sulf07 and AE-Ester-Sulf07, which were designed to release the active compound at the tumor site in a pH-dependent manner. These prodrugs incorporate an acid-sensitive hydrazone bond, formed by the reaction of a carbonyl-containing auristatin E derivative with the hydrazide group of the water-solubilizing maleimide-bearing linker Sulf07. A panel of patient- and cell-derived human tumor xenograft models (melanoma A375, ovarian carcinoma A2780, non-small-cell lung cancer LXFA737 and LXFE937, and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas) were screened with starting tumor volumes in the range of either 130-150 mm3 (small tumors) or 270-380 mm3 (large tumors). Both albumin-binding prodrugs showed compelling anticancer efficacy compared to the parent drug auristatin E, inducing statistically significant long-term partial and/or complete tumor regressions. AE-Keto-Sulf07 displayed very good antitumor response over a wide dose range, 3.0-6.5 mg/kg (5-8 injections, biweekly). AE-Ester-Sulf07 was highly efficacious between 1.9 and 2.4 mg/kg (8 injections, biweekly) or at 3.8 mg/kg (4 injections, weekly), but caused cumulative skin irritation due to scratching and biting. In contrast at its MTD, auristatin E (0.3 mg/kg, 8 injections, biweekly) was only marginally active. In summary, AE-Keto-Sulf07 and AE-Ester-Sulf07 are novel acid-sensitive albumin-binding prodrugs demonstrating tumor regressions in all of the evaluated human tumor xenograft models thus supporting the stratagem that albumin can be used as an effective drug carrier for the highly potent class of auristatins.",New insights into designing hybrid nanoparticles for lung cancer: Diagnosis and treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639691,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 01,"Lung cancer is the foremost reason of death from cancers with broad genetic and epigenetic diversity. Various strategies are clinically available for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. However, in many cases, the disease is diagnosed after malignancy that reduce the survival rate of lung cancer patients due to unsuccessful response to therapy. With the help of nanotechnology, various nanoparticulate systems including organic, inorganic, metallic, and polymeric nanoparticles have been developed for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Each of these nanocarriers possess their own advantages and disadvantages. Combining the organic and inorganic components in a single hybrid nanosystem prepares a new generation of multifunctional nanoparticles with enhanced structural and biological properties. Such nanoparticles not only have beneficial features of all the bulk materials, but also can be tuned in terms of structural and functional moieties to provide carriers with improved diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes. Indeed, hybrid nanoparticles with the ability to incorporate multiple drugs, targeting agents, and photosensitive reagents opened new insights into developing more sensitive and specified systems for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer compared with conventional nanocarriers. In this review, recent developments in designing different hybrid nanoparticles with diagnostic, therapeutic, and theranostic properties for lung cancer are explained in detail.",A methodology to estimate the number of unsafe vehicle-cyclist passing events on urban arterials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639690,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 04 03,"In this study interactions between motorized vehicles and bicycles were studied by analyzing the overtaking behavior of motorized vehicles when passing bicycles on urban arterials. A methodology is presented to estimate the number of 'unsafe' passing events on 4-lane urban arterials with no on-street bike lanes. A 'critical passing distance' is defined to classify expected passing maneuvers i.e. when a motorized vehicle overtakes a bicycle, into 'safe' and 'unsafe' passing events. The proposed method enables calculation of the expected number of 'unsafe passing' events based on the expected bicycle demand, road segment's length, AADT, speed limit, and traffic signal timing parameters. The 'critical passing distance' is an input parameter and can be set by the planner. Given the number of expected 'unsafe passing' events, and institutional safety objectives and standards in terms of acceptable risk levels for cyclists, transportation planning departments can use the proposed methodology to decide whether provision of a specific cycling facility is necessary for a given road segment."

The Challenge Hypothesis provides a framework for understanding these life-history trade-offs via the disparate roles of testosterone (T) in aggression, sexual behavior, and parenting. It predicts that males pursuing mating opportunities have higher T than males pursuing paternal strategies, and in humans, many studies indeed report that men who are fathers and/or pair-bonded have lower T than childless and/or unpaired men. However, the magnitude of these effects, and the influence of methodological variation on effect sizes, have not been quantitatively assessed. We meta-analyzed 114 effects from 66 published and unpublished studies covering four predictions inspired by the Challenge Hypothesis. We confirm that pair-bonded men have lower T than single men, and fathers have lower T than childless men. Furthermore, men more oriented toward pair-bonding or offspring investment had lower T. We discuss the practical meaningfulness of the effect sizes we estimate in relation to known factors (e.g., aging, geographic population) that influence men's T concentrations.",Disturbed redox homeostasis and oxidative stress: Potential players in the developmental regression in Rett syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639673,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 05 25,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mostly girls. A seemingly normal initial development is followed by developmental stagnation and regression, leading to severe mental impairment with autistic features, motor dysfunction, irregular breathing and epilepsy. Currently, a cure does not exist. Due to the close association of RTT with mitochondrial alterations, cellular redox-impairment and oxidative stress, compounds stabilizing mitochondrial function, cellular redox-homeostasis, and oxidant detoxification are increasingly considered as treatment concepts. Indeed, antioxidants and free-radical scavengers ameliorate certain aspects of the complex and severe clinical presentation of RTT. To further evaluate these strategies, reliable biosensors are needed to quantify redox-conditions in brain and peripheral organs of mouse models or in patient-derived cells. Genetically-encoded redox-sensors meet these requirements. Expressed in transgenic mouse-models such as our unique Rett-redox indicator mice, they will report for any cell type desired the severity of oxidant stress throughout the various disease stages of RTT. Furthermore, these sensors will be crucial to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the outcome of mitochondria- and redox-balance targeted treatments.",Functional imaging studies of Impulse Control Disorders in Parkinson's disease need a stronger neurocognitive footing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639672,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 05 25,"Impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with dopaminergic dysfunction and treatment, but have no satisfactory therapeutic solution. While studies assessing the neurofunctional bases of ICDs are important for advancing our understanding and management of ICDs, they remain sparse and inconsistent. Based on a systematic analysis of the neuroimaging literature, the present review pinpoints various abnormalities beyond the mesocorticolimbic circuit that supports reward processing, suggesting possible dysfunction at the sensorimotor, executive and affective levels. We advocate that: 1) Future studies should use more sophisticated psychological models and behavioral designs that take into account the potentially multifaceted aspect of ICDs; this would allow a more accurate assessment of the underlying neurocognitive processes, which are not all dependent on the dopaminergic system. 2) Future neuroimaging studies should rely more strongly on task-based, event-related analyses to disentangle the various mechanisms that can be dysfunctional in ICDs.

Despite societal interest in SPS, scientific knowledge is lagging behind. Here, we critically discuss how SPS relates to other theories, how to measure SPS, whether SPS is a continuous vs categorical trait, its relation to other temperament and personality traits, the underlying aetiology and neurobiological mechanisms, and relations to both typical and atypical development, including mental and sensory disorders. Drawing on the diverse expertise of the authors, we set an agenda for future research to stimulate the field. We conclude that SPS increases risk for stress-related problems in response to negative environments, but also provides greater benefit from positive and supportive experiences. The field requires more reliable and objective assessment of SPS, and deeper understanding of its mechanisms to differentiate it from other traits. Future research needs to target prevention of adverse effects associated with SPS, and exploitation of its positive potential to improve well-being and mental health.",Drug-free macromolecular therapeutics induce apoptosis in cells isolated from patients with B cell malignancies with enhanced apoptosis induction by pretreatment with gemcitabine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639670,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2019 04 29,"Drug-free macromolecular therapeutics (DFMT) is a new paradigm for the treatment of B cell malignancies.

We evaluated this concept in 44 samples isolated from patients diagnosed with various subtypes of B cell malignancies. Apoptosis was observed in 65.9% of the samples tested. Pretreatment of cells with gemcitabine (GEM) or polymer-gemcitabine conjugate (2P-GEM) enhanced CD20 expression levels thus increasing apoptosis induced by DFMT. These positive results demonstrated that DFMT has remarkable therapeutic potential in various subtypes of B cell malignancies.","Health behaviors and related disparities of insured adults with a health care provider in the United States, 2015-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639668,Preventive medicine,2019 02 10,"Health care providers are in a unique position to address patients' health behaviors and social determinants of health, factors like income and social support that can significantly impact health. There is a need to better understand the risk behaviors of a population that providers may counsel (i.e., those who are insured and have a provider.) Using the 2015 and 2016 CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we examine the prevalence of health behaviors and the existence of disparities in health behaviors based on social determinants among American adults. Our sample included noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 to 64 years, in the U.S. (N > 300,000). We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the independent effects of income, education, sex, race, and metropolitan status on nine key health behaviors. Among adults with insurance and a provider (n > 200,000): 1) rates of engaging in poor health behaviors ranged from 6.4% (heavy drinking) to 68.1% (being overweight or obese), 2) rural residence, lower income, and lower education were associated with decreased clinical preventive services, 3) lower income and lower education were associated with lifestyle-related risks, and 4) being black was associated with receiving more cancer screenings, no influenza vaccination, inadequate physical activity, and being overweight or obese. Insured adults, with a provider, are not meeting recommended guidelines for health behaviors. Significant disparities in health behaviors related to social factors exist among this group.

The AgBiO3/GO/NCDs composite exhibits significantly enhanced degradation activities towards organic pollutants of rhodamine B, phenol and tetracycline. Especially, the refractory tetracycline (20 mg L-1) can be completely removed within 6.0 min with a dosage of 30 mg of AgBiO3/GO/NCDs under the assistance of peroxymonosulfate (PMS, 0.2 mM). It is revealed that GO in the composite can facilitate the quick and efficient electron transfer and improve the generation of reactive oxygen species during the degradation process, while the NCDs may play double roles as both the electron-acceptor and the reactive site. Besides, the electrons can be captured by PMS to produce plenty of sulfate radicals (SO4-) with very strong oxidation ability. All these factors collaboratively promote the degradation efficiency of AgBiO3/GO/NCDs towards organic pollutants.

The TL microfibers (TLMFs) were used as reinforcement (1 wt. to 5 wt%) in cellulose matrix to prepare cellulose /TLMFs composite films. These composite films were characterized by polarized optical microscopy (POM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile tests. The POM and SEM images indicated the uniform distribution of TLMFs but in random orientation in the composites. FTIR spectral analysis indicated the presence of minor quantity of lignin in the microfibers in spite of chemical treatment of fibers. The XRD analysis indicated higher crystallinity index for the composites than the matrix. Thermal stability of the composite films was slightly higher than the matrix. Tensile modulus and tensile strength were lower while the elongation at break of the composite films was higher than those of the cellulose matrix due to random orientation of the TLMFs in the composites. However the tensile properties and thermal stability of the cellulose/TLMFs composites were found to be higher than those of the cellulose/alkali treated TL fiber composites and hence can be considered for packaging applications.",A review of the evidence for a natalizumab exit strategy for patients with multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639651,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 04 08,"Natalizumab is an effective treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), but treatment for >2 years is associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infection and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). For this reason, patients and physicians may consider discontinuing natalizumab therapy. This article reviews the evidence for the various therapeutic approaches that may be taken in such patients. Stopping therapy altogether is unlikely to be appropriate for most patients, as it is associated with a high rate of relapse or rebound. Continuing natalizumab therapy with increased monitoring and vigilance for PML may be an acceptable option for some patients, while the data on extending the dosing interval of natalizumab look promising. In some patients whose pre-natalizumab disease activity was not very high and who did not relapse while on natalizumab, switching to a first-line treatment may be an option. In this case, dimethyl fumarate may carry a lower risk of relapse than interferon beta or glatiramer acetate. Fingolimod is the most studied post-natalizumab therapy, and the relapse rate appears to be higher than on natalizumab but lower than was seen before initiation of natalizumab. The evidence suggests that the washout period between natalizumab and fingolimod should not exceed 12 weeks. Finally, the limited evidence available for rituximab and alemtuzumab is promising, and further data on these and other newer therapies for RRMS are awaited.",Complex regional pain syndrome - False hopes and miscommunications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639650,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 04 08,"Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) has been considered to be an autoimmune disease and there have been clinical trials with intravenous immunoglobulin. Often the etiology of the so-called CRPS diagnosis cannot be discerned and there are no validated instruments that provide functional metrics. The term complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), coined in 1994 to describe patients in whom the pain is out of proportion to the injury, was actually a diagnosis proposed during the American Civil War, but was originally known as causalgia. Physicians have long observed similar sensitivity and inflammatory symptoms following periods of immobilization and disuse, which generally resolve within a few months of remobilization. Following the original description, persistent disproportionate pain would come to be known under many other names until researchers theorized that it was related to dysfunction in the sympathetic nervous system, after which it acquired the moniker, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (""RSD""). In the latter quarter of the twentieth century, after researchers failed to prove the connection between the pain and the sympathetic nervous system, a small cadre of physicians-without rigorous science-invented CRPS. This new descriptor, CRPS, has become not only a diagnosis without objective data but with proposed criteria involving ambiguous signs and symptoms with low specificity. It has led to patients being treated erroneously with sympatholytic drugs, with or without pharmaceutical or surgical blockade of the sympathetic nervous system, unwarranted use of ketamine infusions, inappropriate use of narcotics and nerve stimulation. Intravenous immunoglobulin infusions have not been effective in the treatment of chronic pain. The indiscriminate use of pain medications to treat subjective symptoms of unclear diagnoses can be a risk factor for opioid and analgesic misuse or abuse.","Myositis-specific autoantibodies, a cornerstone in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639649,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 04 08,"Over the past few years, myositis-specific autoantibodies played an increasing role in the inflammatory idiopathic myositis definition. They became the critical immunological marker for immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy diagnosis (IMNM) since the paradigm switch from histological to serological criteria. This review is focused on the key role of the anti-signal recognition particle (anti-SRP) and the anti-3-Hydroxy-3-MethylGlutaryl-Coenzyme A Reductase (anti-HMGCR) antibodies in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy. Anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies are robust diagnostic tools in case of both the classical subacute form and the slowly progressive form of IMNM that may mimic muscular dystrophy. Anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR patients share clinical, biological and histological features with some antibody-associated specificity. Anti-SRP patients harbour more severe muscle weakness and atrophy with severe muscle damage on magnetic resonance imaging study. Approximately 10-20% of anti-SRP patients develop extramuscular symptoms, especially lung interstitial disease. Conversely, anti-HMGCR patients are often associated with statin exposure. In both cases, patients have a poor outcome with frequent relapse and the use of combined immunotherapy. Of note, various data suggest a direct pathogenic role of these antibodies reinforcing the interest in targeted therapeutic strategy.",Mechanisms of action and historical facts on the use of intravenous immunoglobulins in systemic lupus erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639648,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 04 08,"The current existing therapies for severe cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are still limited.

GD, and AT, can be associated with other organ specific, or systemic autoimmune diseases in the same patient. However discordant results have been reported in the literature about the possible associations. Here, we review the association of GD and other autoimmune syndromes. Furthermore, we report the results of our prospective study that investigated the prevalence of other autoimmune disorders in 3209 GD patients (984 with Graves' ophthalmopathy), with respect to 1069 healthy controls, or 1069 patients with AT, or 1069 with multinodular goiter (matched by age, gender, coming from the same area, with a similar iodine intake). On the whole, 16.7% of GD patients had another associated autoimmune disease; and the most frequently observed were: vitiligo (2.6%), chronic autoimmune gastritis (2.4%), rheumatoid arthritis (1.9%), polymyalgia rheumatica (1.3%), multiple sclerosis (0.3%), celiac disease (1.1%), diabetes (type 1) (0.9%), systemic lupus erythematosus and sarcoidosis (<0.1%), Sjogren disease (0.8%). Moreover, 1.5% patients with GD had three associated autoimmune disorders. Interestingly, patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) had another autoimmmune disorder more frequently (18.9%), with respect to GD patients without GO (15.6%). However the pattern of the associated autoimmune disorders in GD was not significantly different from that observed in AT patients. In conclusion, we suggest GD patients who are still sick, or who develop new unspecific symptoms (even if during an appropriate treatment of hyperthyroidism) should be appropriately screened for the presence of other autoimmune disorders.","The impact of self-replicating proteins on inflammation, autoimmunity and neurodegeneration-An untraveled path.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639644,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 04 08,"The central nervous system (CNS) in neurodegenerative diseases is a battlefield in which microglia fight a highly atypical battle. During the inflammatory process microglia themselves become dysfunctional and even with all the available immune arsenal including cytokine or/and antibody production, the battle is eventually lost. A closer look into the picture will reveal the fact that this is mainly due to the atypical characteristics of the infectious agent. The supramolecular assemblies of misfolded proteins carry unique features not encountered in any of the common pathogens. Through misfolding, proteins undergo conformational changes which make them become immunogenic, neurotoxic and highly infective. The immunogenicity appears to be triggered by the exposure of previously hidden hydrophobic portions in proteins which act as damage-associated molecular patters (DAMPs) for the immune system. The neurotoxicity and infectivity are promoted by the small oligomeric forms of misfolded proteins/peptides. Oligomers adopt conformations such as tubular-like, beta-barrel-like, etc., that penetrate cell membranes through their hydrophobic surfaces, thus destabilizing ionic homeostasis. At the same time, oligomers act as a seed for protein misfolding through a prion/prion-like mechanism. Here, we propose the hypothesis that oligomers have catalytic surfaces and exercise their capacity to infect native proteins through specific characteristics such as hydrophobic, electrostatic and π-π stacking interactions as well as the specific surface area (SSA), surface curvature and surface chemistry of their nanoscale supramolecular assemblies. All these are the key elements for prion/prion-like mechanism of self-replication and disease spreading within the CNS. Thus, understanding the mechanism of prion's templating activity may help us in the prevention and development of novel therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases.",Autoantibodies in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: Clinical associations and laboratory evaluation by mono- and multispecific immunoassays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639643,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 04 08,"Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a group of diseases characterized by immune-mediated muscular lesions that may be associated with extra-muscular manifestations involving skin, lungs, heart or joints. Four main groups of IIM can be distinguished: dermatomyositis (DM), overlap myositis including mainly anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS), immune mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), and inclusion body myositis (IBM). Myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA) are increasingly recognized as valuable tools for diagnosis, classification and prognosis of IIM. For example, ASS is associated with anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase antibodies (anti-Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, …), IMNM with anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR; IBM with anti-cytosolic 5'nucleotidase 1A (cN1A), and DM with anti-Mi-2, anti-MDA-5, anti-TIF-1γ, anti-NXP-2 and anti-SAE. Moreover, anti-MDA-5 is associated with amyopathic myositis and interstitial lung disease and anti-TIF-1γ and anti-NXP-2 with juvenile DM as well as malignancy in patients >40 years. Most MSA have initially been discovered by immunoprecipitation. In routine laboratories, however, MSA are screened for by indirect immunofluorescence and identified by (automated) monospecific immunoassays or by multispecific immunoassays (mainly line/dot immunoassays). Validation of these (multispecific) assays is a challenge as the antibodies are rare and the assays diverse. In this review, we give an overview of the (clinical) performance characteristics of monospecific assays as well as of multispecific assays for detection of MSA. Although most assays are clinically useful, there are differences between techniques and between manufacturers. We discuss that efforts are needed to harmonize and standardize detection of MSA.",Autoimmunity in celiac disease: Extra-intestinal manifestations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639642,Autoimmunity reviews,2019 04 08,"Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition of the small intestine caused by prolamins in genetically susceptible individuals evoked by multiple environmental factors.

Recent studies showed short-term antibiotic use to be non-inferior to long-term use, but the results of these studies have been inconsistent. In this review, the PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception through to June 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies or case-control studies comparing two different durations of antibiotic use. Short antibiotic courses were defined as antibiotics administered for a shorter period than the recommended 4-6 weeks. A random-effects model was used to calculate summary odds ratios (ORs) of treatment failure in patients treated with short-course antibiotics compared with long-course antibiotics. A total of 15 articles (5 RCTs and 10 observational studies) and 3598 patients were included. The overall OR of treatment failure in patients receiving short-course antibiotics was 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-2.34]. Subgroup analysis revealed that a short course of antibiotic treatment was associated with an increased treatment failure rate in vertebral osteomyelitis (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.18-3.57) while having a similar rate to a long antibiotic course in acute osteomyelitis of childhood (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 0.75-4.64). Meta-regression found a higher proportion of Staphylococcus aureus infection was related to a higher risk of treatment failure in patients with vertebral osteomyelitis (Coef. = 4.996; P = 0.032). Short-course antibiotics are safe and effective in children with acute osteomyelitis. Long-course antibiotics may still be preferred in vertebral osteomyelitis, especially in patients with S. aureus infection.",Association between Interleukin-21 and Interleukin-21 receptor gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B virus infection and HBV spontaneous clearance in Iranian population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639626,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 03 19,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health concern due to the infection often leads to chronic infection, liver cirrhosis and also liver cancer. The host immune response to HBV infection and also genetic background play significant role in outcome of infection. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most important kind of variation in genetic sequences that caused by point mutations. As cytokines have major roles in viral infections, it seems that cytokine gene polymorphisms are independently associated with response to viral infections. Interleukin 21 (IL-21) plays an influential role in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Its specific receptor, IL-21R, produced and located on the surface of T, B and natural killer (NK) cells and is critical for the proliferation and differentiation of these immune effector cells. Many studies confirmed that the IL-21 involved in response to viral infections.

The proposed mechanisms involved are varied, but recently have been suggested to include induction of cellular senescence, a cellular growth arrest state characterized by the secretion of pre-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors. The post-mitotic status of neurons has been traditionally considered to prohibit cellular senescence, however recent studies have provided compelling evidence that neurons may be capable of undergoing senescence in response to oxidative stress and other factors. Development of senolytics, small molecules that selectively induce senescent cell death, could represent a paradigm change for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (AD, PD). However, their use depends on unequivocal validation that neurons can senesce and that they do not have detrimental off-target effects in other cell types in the brain and elsewhere."

The goal of this study is to identify the non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which may affect the expression levels of ABCA3; the previously identified prognostic biomarker for multidrug resistance (MDR) in childhood ALL (cALL). Bone marrow samples from 64 cALLs, including 46 de novo and 18 relapsed patients, in addition to 30 non-cancer controls were collected, and ncRNAs were nominated using in silico studies. Quantitative RT-PCR showed low expression profiles of miR-335-3p in cALLs compared with the control group (P = 0.018). Inverse correlation was determined between the miR-335-3p and ABCA3 mRNA expression profiles in cALL patients (r = 0.5019, P = 0.002). Moreover, it was shown that the expression levels of miR-335-3p was downregulated in the drug-resistant samples (MDR group) compared with the drug-sensitive patients (mrd- group), (P = 0.0005, AUC = 0.801). On the other hand, negative correlations were identified between the expression levels of miR-335-3p and the selected LncRNAs, NEAT1 and MALAT1, in the MDR group compared with the mrd- patients (P = 0.009), suggesting a sponge effect for these LncRNAs. The current study showed a potential regulatory role for miR-335-3p in ABCA3 expression targeted by NEAT1 and MALAT1 long non-coding RNAs. This negative impact may possibly contribute to the development of chemoresistance in childhood ALL, and provide an exceptional insight to new therapeutic approaches.",Green fluorescent carbon quantum dots as a label-free probe for rapid and sensitive detection of hematin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639601,"Spectrochimica acta.

The synthesized CQDs exhibit some fascinating characters including excellent water solubility, high fluorescence quantum yield, and good stability in a broad pH range of 7.0-11.0 and high ionic strength solution. Excitingly, the fluorescence of CQDs can be rapidly and selectively quenched by hematin via the inner filter effect. Moreover, the detection of hematin by the CQDs fluorescent probe shows a good linearity in the concentration range of 0.5-30 μM with a minimum detection limit of 0.1 μM.

Firstly, a visualized analysis was carried out by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to reduce each data point in a two-dimensional map and make a knowledge of the sample distribution tendency. Secondly, the single spectra data sets of Paridis rhizome and leaf tissues, and the combination of these two data sets with variable selection (mid-level data fusion strategy), were used to establish PLS-DA and random forest models, and parallelly compared the model performance. Results demonstrated that the discrimination ability of PLS-DA preceded the random forest model, and the classification performance was remarkably improved after mid-level data fusion. These results verified each other by 5-, 6- and 7-year old Paridis samples and indicated that the model performance established in the present study was reliable. Besides, five agronomic characters, including the plant height, dry weight of rhizome and leaf tissues, and the allocation of rhizome and leaf were determined and analyzed, results of which indicated that the dry weight and their allocation was significantly different among various origins and fluctuated with the cultivation years. This study was using a comprehensive and green analytical method to discriminate the cultivated Paridis according to their provenances, which was simultaneously benefited for the appropriate cultivation areas selection based on the dry weight of rhizome tissues.",The E-helix is a central core in a conserved helical bundle involved in nucleotide binding and transmembrane domain intercalation in the ABC transporter superfamily.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639597,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"ABC transporter proteins are involved in active transport, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Sequence analysis of nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of ABC proteins from all taxa revealed a well-conserved new motif having the signature: xT/ShxE/DNhxF, located between Q-loop and ABC signature sequence. A recent structure of an ABC transporter, ABCG5/G8 highlighted the motif as an essential structural determinant of inter-domain crosstalk and termed it as E-helix. We carried out an extensive computational analysis to unravel important structural entities alongside E-helix which plausibly play role in the interlocking mechanism of NBD with TMD. We identified E-helix to be a central structural moiety which interacts with three helices and an intracellular loop that leads to the transmembrane domain. Considering its wide occurrence, we examined the importance of this motif in one representative multidrug ABC transporter of Candida albicans, Cdr1p. The motif residues were replaced by alanines both individually as well as in combinations. The GFP-tagged versions of mutant proteins were overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Overall, our mutational data suggested that this motif plays a role in the maintenance of proper structural fold and/or inter-domain contacts in Cdr1p. We, thus, unveil an essential structural motif in ABC superfamily transporters.",Magnetic cellulose nanocrystal stabilized Pickering emulsions for enhanced bioactive release and human colon cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639596,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"Stimuli-responsive drug release and controlled delivery play crucial roles in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy and lowering over-dosage induced side effects.

The loading efficiency of CUR in the micron-sized (≈7 μm) MCNC-stabilized Pickering emulsions (MCNC-PE) template was found to be 99.35%. The drug release profiles showed that the exposure of MCNC-PE to external magnetic field (EMF) (0.7 T) stimulated the release of bioactive from MCNC-PE achieving 53.30 ± 5.08% of the initial loading over a 4-day period. The MTT assay demonstrated that the CUR-loaded MCNC-PE can effectively inhibits the human colon cancer cells growth down to 18% in the presence of EMF. The formulation also resulted in 2-fold reduction on the volume of the 3-D multicellular spheroids of HCT116 as compared to the control sample. The MCNC particle was found to be non-toxic to brine shrimp up to a concentration of 100 μg/mL.

The aim of this work is to make quick hemostats by incorporating mesoporous silica nanoparticles into chitosan. Porous chitosan-silica composite microspheres (CSMS-S) with high hemostatic efficacy were fabricated through a combination of the microemulsion, thermally induced phase separation, and surfactant templating method. A large number of mesoporous silica nanoparticles were formed on and within the CSMS-S microspheres, which had abundant surface and inner macropores. The synergetic two hemostatic mechanisms from chitosan and mesoporous silica nanoparticles let CSMS-S composite microspheres with proper amount of silica displayed better hemostatic potential than the single component porous chitosan microspheres (CSMS).

The hemostatic time of CSMS-S was down to 97 s from 114 s of CSMS in the rat liver laceration model. The cytotoxicity and histological analysis proved that CSMS-S was a safe hemostatic agent without noticeable adverse effects on tissues around the wound.

We therefore set out to explore the role of USP44 in hematopoietic and immune systems through characterization of a Usp44-deficient mouse model. We report that USP44 is dispensable for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cell numbers and function under homeostatic conditions, and also after irradiation or serial transplantation. USP44 is also not required for normal lymphocyte development. Usp44-deficient B cells show normal activation, proliferation, and immunoglobulin class switching in response to in vitro stimulation, and Usp44-deficient mice mount normal antibody response to immunization. We also tested the effects of USP44 deficiency on disease progression and survival in the Emu-myc model of mouse B-cell lymphoma and observed a trend toward earlier lethality of Usp44-/- Emu-myc mice; however, this did not reach statistical significance. Overall, we conclude that USP44 is dispensable for the normal physiology of hematopoietic and immune systems, and its functions in these systems are likely redundant with other USP family proteins.",Prolonged cell persistence with enhanced multipotency and rapid angiogenesis of hypoxia pre-conditioned stem cells encapsulated in marine-inspired adhesive and immiscible liquid micro-droplets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639576,Acta biomaterialia,2019 02 10,"Stem cell therapies are emerging regenerative treatments for ischemic and chronic diseases. Although high cell retention and prompt angiogenesis are prerequisites to improving efficacy, advancements have not yet been developed. Here, we proposed long-term surviving and angiogenesis-inducing stem cell with high cell retention thanks to fluid immiscible liquid micro-droplets bio-inspired by a glue modality 'complex coacervate' found in the sandcastle worm. Formed by the Coulombic force between polycationic MAP and polyanionic hyaluronic acid, the exploited coacervate micro-droplets enabled the encapsulation of stem cells. The underwater adhesiveness facilitated integrating the encapsulated stem cells onto various surfaces with impressive cell retention after facile injection. Stem cells encapsulated in the coacervate platform formed cell clusters capable of pre-adjusting to hypoxia by expressing hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), increasing viability and reducing apoptosis under hypoxia and ischemia as well as normoxia. Interestingly, multipotent and angiogenic factors were significantly enhanced by HIF-1α expression. In the in vivo evaluation, the coacervate platform showed impressive angiogenesis with biocompatibility and long-term cell retention capacity with sustainable release as protein factories. Therefore, the proposed MAP-based water-immiscible, injectable, sticky, and bioactive 3D coacervate micro-droplets offers a promising tool for chronic diseases in body fluid-rich environments. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: High cell retention, long-term survival, and rapid angiogenesis are prerequisites of successful stem cell therapy. However, no previous advancements have simultaneously satisfied all of these requirements. In this work, we clearly developed a novel, revolutionary stem cell carrier platform with underwater adhesiveness from a mussel-derived glue protein and water immiscibility from a sandcastle-worm-inspired glue modality via 'complex coacervation'. To the best of our knowledge, no report has emerged employing coacervate as a stem cell therapeutic platform. This fluid-immiscible, injectable, sticky, and bioactive 3-dimensional stem cell micro-droplets demonstrated the excellent stem cell retention and viability under hypoxia environments and enhanced multipotent and angiogenic effects with minimal immune response.",Preventive intramuscular phenylephrine in elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia: A randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639574,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",2019 04 22,"Phenylephrine is the first-line vasoactive drug in the cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. The rate of hypotension remains high after intravenous preventive use of phenylephrine. However, few studies have investigated the effect of preventive intramuscular phenylephrine via a longer period of usage on fetal and maternal outcomes.",Presenting a Neuroid model of wind-up based on dynamic synapse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639573,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 02 04,"The treatment of chronic pain depends mainly on our understanding of the mechanisms such as central sensitization which is involved in it. Wind-up of spinal cord is one of the most important phenomena in the study of central sensitization which has received considerable attention in recent years. Wind-up is a form of short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) that can lead to central sensitivity. Although several models have been proposed for wind-up, none of them are based on the experimental evidence. In this study, a new network model is introduced according to the gate control theory of pain. Neuroids are used as neuron models in which their parameters are captured from available experimental data. Adjusting the weights of the network is based on the short-term synaptic plasticity. The results of the time and frequency domain show that the model can well simulate wind-up behavior. This model can be used for analyzing, predicting and controlling chronic pain in the future.",Superinfection and cell regeneration can lead to chronic viral coinfections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639572,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 02 16,"Molecular diagnostic techniques have revealed that approximately 43% of the patients hospitalized with influenza-like illness are infected by more than one viral pathogen, sometimes leading to long-lasting infections. It is not clear how the heterologous viruses interact within the respiratory tract of the infected host to lengthen the duration of what are usually short, self-limiting infections. We develop a mathematical model which allows for single cells to be infected simultaneously with two different respiratory viruses (superinfection) to investigate the possibility of chronic coinfections. We find that a model with superinfection and cell regeneration has a stable chronic coinfection fixed point, while superinfection without cell regeneration produces only acute infections. This analysis suggests that both superinfection and cell regeneration are required to sustain chronic coinfection via this mechanism since coinfection is maintained by superinfected cells that allow slow-growing infections a chance to infect cells and continue replicating. This model provides a possible mechanism for chronic coinfection independent of any viral interactions via the immune response.",Facial Features Underlying the Decoding of Pain Expressions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639571,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 06 11,"Previous research has revealed that the face is a finely tuned medium for pain communication. Studies assessing the decoding of facial expressions of pain have revealed an interesting discrepancy, namely that, despite eyes narrowing being the most frequent facial expression accompanying pain, individuals mostly rely on brow lowering and nose wrinkling/upper lip raising to evaluate pain. The present study verifies if this discrepancy may reflect an interaction between the features coding pain expressions and the features used by observers and stored in their mental representations. Experiment 1 shows that more weight is allocated to the brow lowering and nose wrinkling/upper lip raising, supporting the idea that these features are allocated more importance when mental representations of pain expressions are stored in memory. These 2 features have been associated with negative valence and with the affective dimension of pain, whereas the eyes narrowing feature has been associated more closely with the sensory dimension of pain. However, experiment 2 shows that these 2 features remain more salient than eyes narrowing, even when attention is specifically directed toward the sensory dimension of pain. Together, these results suggest that the features most saliently coded in the mental representation of facial expressions of pain may reflect a bias toward allocating more weight to the affective information encoded in the face. PERSPECTIVE: This work reveals the relative importance of 3 facial features representing the core of pain expressions during pain decoding. The results show that 2 features are over-represented; this finding may potentially be linked with the estimation biases occurring when clinicians and lay persons evaluate pain based on facial appearance.","Enrichment of Genomic Pathways Based on Differential DNA Methylation Associated With Chronic Postsurgical Pain and Anxiety in Children: A Prospective, Pilot Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639570,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 06 10,"We have reported child anxiety sensitivity (Child Anxiety Sensitivity Index [CASI]) predicts chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP). Herein, we evaluated DNA methylation profiles to understand the gene-environment interactions underlying CPSP and CASI, to identify shared, enriched, genomic pathways. In 73 prospectively recruited adolescents undergoing spine fusion, preoperative CASI and pain data over 12 months after surgery were collected. DNA from the peripheral blood of evaluable subjects with (n = 16) and without CPSP (n = 40) were analyzed using MethylationEPIC arrays. We identified 637 and 2,445 differentially DNA methylated positions (DMPs) associated with CPSP and CASI, respectively (P ≤ .05). Ingenuity pathway analysis of 39 genes with DMPs for both CPSP and CASI revealed enrichment of several canonical pathways, including GABA receptor (P = .00016 for CPSP; P =.0008 for CASI) and dopamine-DARPP32 feedback in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (P = .004 for CPSP and P =.00003 for CASI) signaling. Gene-gene interaction network enrichment analysis revealed participation of pathways in cell signaling, molecular transport, metabolism, and neurologic diseases (P < 10-8). Bioinformatic approaches to identify histone marks and transcription factor (TF) binding events underlying DMPs, showed their location in active regulatory regions in pain pathway relevant brain cells. Using Enrichr/Pinet enrichment and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures knockdown signatures, we identified TFs regulating genes with DMPs in association with CPSP and CASI. In conclusion, we identified epigenetically enriched pathways associated with CPSP and anxiety sensitivity in children undergoing surgery. Our findings support GABA hypofunction and the roles of the dopamine-DARPP32 pathway in emotion/reward and pain. This pilot study provides new epigenetic insights into the pathophysiology of CPSP and a basis for future studies in biomarker development and targetable interventions. PERSPECTIVE: Differential DNA methylation in regulatory genomic regions enriching shared neural pathways were associated with CPSP and CASI in adolescents undergoing spine surgery. Our findings support GABA hypofunction and the roles of the dopamine-DARPP32 pathway in emotion/reward contributing to behavioral maintenance of pain 10 to 12 months after surgery.",Pro- and anti-oxidant properties of near-infrared (NIR) light responsive carbon nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639569,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Elemental carbon nanomaterials (ECNMs) are redox active agents that can be exploited to purposely modify the redox balance of cells. Both pro- or antioxidant properties have been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are not comprehensive studies exploring both properties on the same material in view of a potential application in medicine. At the same time, the effect of the bulk structure on the pro/antioxidant properties is poorly known. Here, carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) derived by glucose with definite size and shape have been prepared, and their redox properties evaluated in cell free systems in the dark or following activation with a Near Infrared (NIR) laser beam (945 nm, 1.3 W/cm2). We found that, when irradiated with NIR, CNPs efficiently generate heat and singlet oxygen (1O2), a property that can be exploited for dual photo-thermal (PT)/photodynamic (PD) therapy in cancer. On the other hand, in the absence of photo-activation, CNPs react with both oxidant (hydroxyl radicals) and antioxidant (glutathione) species. When tested on a murine macrophages cell line (RAW 264.7) CNPs were clearly antioxidant. Furthermore, albeit efficiently internalized, CNPs do not exert cytotoxic effect up to 80 µg/ml and do not exacerbate TNF-α-mediated inflammation. Overall, the results reported herein suggest that CNPs may represent a new class of safe nanomaterials with potential applications in medicine.",Hypercapnic tumor microenvironment confers chemoresistance to lung cancer cells by reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639568,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"The tumor microenvironment has previously been reported to be hypercapnic (as high as ~84 mmHg), although its effect on tumor cell behaviors is unknown. In this study, high CO2 levels, ranging from 5% to 15%, protected lung cancer cells from anticancer agents, such as cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, by suppressing apoptosis. The cytoprotective effect of a high CO2 level was independent of acidosis and was due to mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming that reduced mitochondrial respiration, as assessed by oxygen consumption, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial membrane and oxidative potentials, eventually leading to reduced reactive oxidant species production. In contrast, high CO2 levels did not affect cisplatin-mediated DNA damage responses or the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins. Although high CO2 levels inhibited glycolysis, this inhibition was not mechanistically involved in high CO2-mediated reductions in mitochondrial respiration, because a high CO2 concentration inhibited isolated mitochondria. A cytoprotective effect of high CO2 levels on mitochondria DNA-depleted cells was not noted, lending support to our conclusion that high CO2 levels act on mitochondria to reduce the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents. High CO2-mediated cytoprotection was also noted in a 3D culture system. In conclusion, the hypercapnic tumor microenvironment reprograms mitochondrial respiratory metabolism causing chemoresistance in lung cancer cells. Thus, tumor hypercapnia may represent a novel target to improve chemosensitivity.",Pharmacological levels of hydrogen sulfide inhibit oxidative cell injury through regulating the redox state of thioredoxin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639567,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous mediator with multifaceted biological activities. It has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Currently, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Given that Trx/ASK1/P38 signaling pathway mediates many oxidative cell responses, we tested whether and how H2S affected this pathway. Exposure of podocytes to Adriamycin (ADR), an antitumor drug, led to a P38-mediated oxidative cell injury, as evidenced by the increased protein carbonylation, oxidative activation of P38, and prevention of the cell death by antioxidants, NADPH oxidase inhibitor and P38 inhibitor. In the presence of H2S donor NaHS, however, the podocyte injury was largely prevented. NaHS also significantly prevented cell death elicited by H2O2, menadione, and thioredoxin (Trx) inhibitors. These effects of H2S were also associated with a potent inhibition of P38. Further analysis revealed that H2S did not affect the protein level of TXNIP and Trx, two pivotal regulators of ASK1/P38 activation, but it promoted the dissociation of Trx from TXNIP. Moreover, it disrupted the H2O2-initiated polymerization of Trx and converted Trx from the oxidized to the reduced form. In HepG2 cells, inhibition of H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) increased Trx oxidation, promoted Trx binding to TXNIP and exaggerated cell injury caused by Trx inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that H2S exerted its antioxidative effects through the regulation of the redox state of Trx and interference with Trx/ASK1/P38 signaling pathway. Given the importance of the pathway in the mediation of multiple oxidative cell responses, our study thus provides novel mechanistic insight into the action of H2S."

We build a model of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry, and show how 2298 alliances, announced over a 15-year period, impact the alliance portfolios of 324 pharmaceutical firms, and how that, in turn, impacts the breakthrough innovations that these firms produce. In doing so, we show the stengths and benifits of strategic alliances, but we also show the dangers of adopting a more the merrier approach to strategic alliance making.",Young Adults and Adverse Childhood Events: A Potent Measure of Cardiovascular Risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639555,The American journal of medicine,2019 05 11,"While cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, its determinants include unhealthy behaviors and clinical risk factors and are recognized as the ""actual causes"" of death.

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with MPM who received surgery at Hyogo College of Medicine between July 2004 and April 2016. Patients underwent multimodal treatment comprising chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) and surgery with or without 54 Gy hemithoracic radiotherapy. Patients were grouped into 3 groups according to the surgery intended: Conventional extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 1 (until August 2009); less invasive extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 2 (after September 2009); pleurectomy/decortication was intended in Group 3 (after September 2012). We included 152 patients (median age 64 [37-71] years; 131 men, 21 women), mostly with epithelioid subtypes (91.4%). Of them, 149 (98.0%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 117 (77.0%) underwent surgery (60 had extrapleural pneumonectomy and 57 had pleurectomy/decortication). Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 94.9% (111/117), and the mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were 1.7% (2/117) and 3.4% (4/117), respectively.

In the past decade, many simple and combinatorial therapeutic treatments have been tested in improving locomotor function in animals with this extraordinarily challenging SCI. The potential mechanism for promotion of locomotor function relies either on direct motor axon regeneration through the lesion gap or indirect neuronal relay bridging to functionally reconnect transected spinal stumps. In this review, we first compare the advantages and problems of complete transection SCI animal models with other prevailing SCI models used in motor axon regeneration research. Next, we enumerate some of the popular bio-scaffolds utilized in complete SCI repair in the last decade. Then, the current state of motor axon regeneration as well as its role on locomotor improvement of animals after complete SCI is discussed. Last, the current approach of directing endogenous neuronal relays formation to achieve motor function recovery by well-designed functional bio-scaffolds implantation in complete transected SCI animals is reviewed. Although facilitating neuronal relays formation by bio-scaffolds implantation appears to be more practical and feasible than directing motor axon regeneration in promoting locomotor outcome in animals after complete SCI, there are still challenges in neuronal relays formation, maintaining and debugging for spinal cord regenerative repair.",Astrovirus evolution and emergence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639546,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 02 26,"Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Astroviridae family. Astroviruses infect diverse hosts and are typically associated with gastrointestinal illness; although disease can range from asymptomatic to encephalitis depending on the host and viral genotype. Astroviruses have high genetic variability due to an error prone polymerase and frequent recombination events between strains. Once thought to be species specific, recent evidence suggests astroviruses can spread between different host species, although the frequency with which this occurs and the restrictions that regulate the process are unknown. Recombination events can lead to drastic evolutionary changes and contribute to cross-species transmission events. This work reviews the current state of research on astrovirus evolution and emergence, especially as it relates to cross-species transmission and recombination of astroviruses.",Genetic diversity of trypanosomes pathogenic to livestock in tsetse flies from the Nech Sar National Park in Ethiopia: A concern for tsetse suppressed area in Southern Rift Valley?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639545,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 02 26,"In Ethiopia, home to the largest African herd of cattle, animal trypanosomiasis is a major constraint to the efforts made for food self-sufficiency. We searched for trypanosomes in tsetse flies caught in the Nech Sar National Park (NSNP), Southern Rifty Valley, Ethiopia, at the district of Arba Minch where intensive tsetse control is successfully improving cattle productivity. Despite narrow geographical and temporal scales of our survey, we found a remarkable diversity of trypanosomes using the sensitive and discriminative method of fluorescent fragment length barcoding. We also found a high density of Glossina pallidipes (47.8 flies/trap/day) showing relevant cytochrome oxidase I gene variability. The identification of blood meal sources through cytochrome b gene sequences revealed cattle and warthog as preferential ungulate hosts of tsetse flies in the study area. Our survey identified trypanosomes in 38% of the 287 flies examined (42% of proboscises and 32% of guts), and the following infection rates for each species: Trypanosoma vivax 23%, T. simiae 23%, T. congolense 22%, T. theileri 19.9%, T. (Trypanozoon) spp. 10.5%, T. godfreyi 9.4%, T. simiae Tsavo 6.3%, and mixed infections in proboscises (30%) and guts (61%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed T. vivax of the ""West African-South American"" genotype, T. congolense of Savannah (16.7%), Kilifi (3.5%) and Forest (2.1%) lineages, and new genotypes of T. simiae. To our knowledge, this is the first survey of trypanosomes in the NSNP, and the most comprehensive molecular characterisation of trypanosomes in tsetse flies of Ethiopia, including the comparison with samples from West and other East African countries. Our results support the diversification of T. vivax in East Africa, and the dispersion of the genotype herein identified in Ethiopia across West Africa and then in South America. Altogether, tsetse density and infection rate, repertoire of trypanosomes and feeding behavior indicate a high risk of transmission of trypanosomes pathogenic to ungulates by tsetse flies from the NSNP, a hotspot of tsetse infestation and trypanosome diversity. Our findings reinforce the need for constant surveillance, and the reliance on community efforts to prevent reinvasion of tsetse and animal trypanosomiasis in suppressed areas of Southern Rift Valley."

In this study, the gastrointestinal behavior of acid-resistant hard capsule formulations as well as the influence of their density on the gastric residence time were characterized using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As labeling material for a reliable identification of the capsules in the MR images, small pieces of dried pineapple were used as they provide a high T1 signal. Tested products were DRcaps™ as capsule in capsule (Cap-in-Cap) system (outer capsule size 00). For the investigation of the influence of the capsule density on the gastric residence time, a floating low-density Cap-in-Cap capsule formulation and a sinking high-density Cap-in-Cap capsule formulation were investigated. The study was performed in eight healthy human subjects under fasting conditions. Besides the transit data of the capsule systems, the intraluminal fluid volume kinetics were determined using T2 weighted sequences. The gastric emptying times of the systems did not differ, with mean values of 45 ± 35 min for floating DRcaps™ and 36 ± 18 min for the sinking DRcaps™. The difference in density had no remarkable influence on gastric emptying. Thus, the concept of floating capabilities for gastroretentive dosage forms seems rather implausible. Furthermore, this assures transferability of common knowledge about dosage form transit for estimation of the performance of acid-resistant capsule shells, which most typically float. The mean disintegration times amounted to 139 ± 35 min for the floating DRcaps™ Cap-in-Cap and 163 ± 55 min for the sinking DRcaps™ Cap-in-Cap. In only one case, a sinking DRcaps™ Cap-in-Cap system disintegrated during gastric emptying, but all other capsules disintegrated in the small intestine, irrespective of their gastric residence time. The use of dried pineapple as labeling material could be successfully demonstrated as a reliable and easy method for the tracking of the transit and disintegration behavior of orally administered drug delivery systems, leading to a thorough understanding of their in vivo performance.",Catalysing the way towards antimicrobial effectiveness: A systematic analysis and a new online resource for antimicrobial-enzyme combinations against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639529,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 04 28,"Growing antimicrobial resistance and the resilience of biofilm infections have led researchers to study the potential of antimicrobial combinations, including those incorporating enzymes with biofilm-disrupting abilities. This work aimed to evaluate the journey of antimicrobial-enzyme combination research and to gain insights into its current status and most promising leads. Expert curators annotated and analysed all published experimental data on enzyme-containing combinations for two major biofilm-forming pathogens, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. This entailed the construction of the first publicly accessible online database on antimicrobial-enzyme combinations, the Antimicrobial Enzyme Combinations Database (https://www.ceb.uminho.pt/aecd). Gathered data were also reconstructed as knowledge networks to help analyse and visualise annotated entities (e.g. enzymes, methods, strains, combination outputs). The database currently holds 122 and 206 annotated combinations for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, respectively, and their analysis allowed a systematic review of the available evidence on enzyme combinations, reliably illustrating the studies being performed. The most tested enzymes (e.g. lysozyme, DNase, lysostaphin) were scrutinised and the rationale behind each combination was explained. This research area is still growing although current research gaps/opportunities were identified, such as lack of biofilm testing and studies on polymicrobial scenarios. Hopefully, this work will shed light on the synergistic potential of enzyme combinations and alleviate some of the time- and resource-consuming tasks related to enzyme combination research by helping the selection and design of new enzyme-related therapeutic options for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus infections.",Burkholderia pseudomallei acquired ceftazidime resistance due to gene duplication and amplification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639528,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 04 28,"Ceftazidime (CAZ) is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of Burkholderia pseudomallei infection (melioidosis). The chromosomally-encoded PenA β-lactamase possesses weak cephalosporinase activity. The wild-type penA gene confers clinically significant CAZ resistance only when overexpressed due to a promoter mutation, transcriptional antitermination or by gene duplication and amplification (GDA). Here we characterise a reversible 33-kb GDA event involving wild-type penA in a CAZ-resistant B. pseudomallei clinical isolate from Thailand. We show that duplication arises from exchanges between short (<10 bp) chromosomal sequences, which in this example consist of 4-bp repeats flanked by 3-bp inverted repeats. GDA involving β-lactamases may be a common CAZ resistance mechanism in B. pseudomallei.","Risk factors for treatment failure in patients receiving β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations for Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infection: A retrospective, single-centre, cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639527,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 04 28,"The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors for treatment failure in patients receiving in vitro-active therapy with β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (BL/BLI) for Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infection (E-BSI).

Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, clinical data unavailable, polymicrobial BSI, failure to receive in vitro-active therapy and death within 72 h from drawing the index blood culture. Patients who received BL/BLI as appropriate empirical and/or definitive therapy for ≥50% of the total treatment duration were selected. The primary endpoint was all-cause 30-day mortality. The secondary endpoint was 90-day relapse. Of 1319 eligible patients, 835 were selected. A total of 714 received BL/BLI as appropriate empirical therapy, of whom 522 remained on BL/BLI as definitive therapy and 192 shifted to another antibiotic for <50% of the treatment duration; 121 received BL/BLI as definitive therapy only. Non-susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (NS-ESCs) was detected in 207 episodes (24.8%). All-cause 30-day mortality was 6.8%. In multivariate analysis adjusted for NS-ESC, independent predictors of mortality were Charlson comorbidity index, septic shock, Proteus spp. and CVC-related BSI, whilst urinary source was a protective factor. The 90-day relapse rate was 4.2%. Immunosuppression was the main independent predictor for relapse. BL/BLI was the most common antibiotic administered to patients with E-BSI in this cohort. Among patients appropriately treated with BL/BLI, failure rates were low and were primarily associated with underlying diseases, clinical severity at BSI onset and infection source.",Contemporary management and clinical outcomes of mucormycosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of case reports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639526,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 04 28,"With the advent of newer antifungals, optimum treatment of mucormycosis remains to be fully elucidated. This study systematically evaluated the contemporary management and outcomes of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis cases in patients aged ≥18 years published between January 2000 and January 2017 were identified through Ovid MEDLINE and Embase. Of the 3619 articles identified, 600 (851 individual patient cases) were included in the review. Of the 851 patient cases, antifungal treatment details were available for 785. Intravenous (i.v.) amphotericin B formulations remained the most commonly prescribed first-line antifungals (760/785; 96.8%): 88.2% (670/760) were initiated as monotherapy and 11.8% (90/760) as combination antifungal therapy. Posaconazole oral suspension monotherapy was prescribed as an initial antifungal in 11 cases. It was also administered as maintenance or salvage therapy in 39 and 25 cases, respectively. Itraconazole capsule monotherapy (n = 10) was prescribed primarily for cutaneous disease in patients not receiving any immunosuppressive therapy. All-cause 90-day mortality was 41.0% (349/851). Initial treatment with combination antifungals did not reduce 90-day mortality compared with i.v. conventional amphotericin B or i.v. liposomal amphotericin B monotherapy [35/90 (38.9%) vs. 146/369 (39.6%) vs. 91/258 (35.3%), respectively; P = 0.541]. Concomitant surgical and antifungal therapy was associated with significantly lower 90-day mortality compared with treatment with antifungals alone (OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.13-0.41; P < 0.001). The findings suggest that first-line antifungals with good efficacy remain an urgent unmet need. Whilst surgery is fundamental to improving survival, the clinical utility of combination antifungal therapy or posaconazole monotherapy requires further investigation.",Preliminary investigation of mammographic density among women in Riyadh: association with breast cancer risk factors and implications for screening practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639525,Clinical imaging,2019 05 01,Improved mammographic sensitivity is associated with reduced mammographic density.

There is a paucity of animal models to assess the role of astrocytes in depression pathogenesis. Refinement of an existing model is described here. Administration of the astrocytic toxin L-alpha aminoadipic acid (L-AAA) to the pre-limbic cortex (PLC) was assessed in rats and mice in tests of anxiety and depression related behaviours. Delivery of L-AAA to the PLC of Wistar rats produced an increase in immobility in the forced swimming test (FST) and reduced exploration in the open field. Delivery to the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus produced a deficit in the novel object relocation task. Delivery of single or two successive doses of L-AAA to the PLC of C57Bl6/J mice was sufficient to induce an increase in immobility in the mouse tail suspension (TST) and FST independently of administration of anaesthetic agent or the surgical procedure. In both mice and rats, L-AAA produced a reduction in immunoreactivity of the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for up to 72 h. L-AAA provoked an increase in the density of apical and basal dendritic spines in mice exposed to the FST when compared to non-FST controls. In summary, L-AAA provokes a region-dependent change in behaviour, a reduction in GFAP immunoreactivity and FST-provoked increased in dendritic spine density in the PLC. This model may be further employed to assess the impact of astroglial integrity on the structural plasticity of neurons and the effect of antidepressant agents on L-AAA-related changes.",Sigma-1 receptor antagonist PD144418 suppresses food reinforced operant responding in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639509,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 19,"Sigma-1 (σ1) receptors have been investigated for their involvement in learning, rewarding and motivational processes, particularly as it relates to substances of abuse. Few studies have examined the effects of σ1 receptor agonists and antagonists on the rewarding and motivational properties of natural reinforcers, such as food. Studies that have investigated σ1 receptor agonists and antagonists has produced conflicting results. σ1 receptor antagonist PD144418 has been found to produce a dose-dependent attenuation of locomotor activity induced by cocaine, and by itself, does not suppress basal locomotor activity in mice. However, its effects on reward and motivation as it relates to food are unknown. The present study examined the involvement of σ1 receptors in mediating the rewarding and motivational properties of food using an operant task. The results indicated that at the highest dose (10 μmol/kg), PD144418 significantly attenuated the number of active lever responses for chow pellets but did not decrease the number of active lever responses for sucrose pellets under a fixed ratio (FR2) schedule of reinforcement. However, under a progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedule, 10 μmol/kg of PD14418 significantly reduced the breakpoint, a measure indicative of effort or motivation, for both chow and sucrose pellets. When ad libitum chow or sucrose pellets were made freely available (i.e. no lever press required) inside the operant chamber, 10 μmol/kg, PD144418 did not have an effect on number of pellets consumed. These findings indicate that PD144418 reduces the motivational effort of a food reinforced behavior.","Aerobic fitness, but not physical activity, is associated with grey matter volume in adolescents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639508,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 19,"Higher levels of aerobic fitness and physical activity are linked to beneficial effects on brain health, especially in older adults. The generalizability of these earlier results to young individuals is not straightforward, because physiological responses (such as cardiovascular responses) to exercise may depend on age. Earlier studies have mostly focused on the effects of either physical activity or aerobic fitness on the brain. Yet, while physical activity indicates the amount of activity, aerobic fitness is an adaptive state or attribute that an individual has or achieves. Here, by measuring both physical activity and aerobic fitness in the same study, we aimed to differentiate the association between these two measures and grey matter volume specifically. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were used to study volumes of 30 regions of interest located in the frontal, motor and subcortical areas of 60 adolescents (12.7-16.2 years old). Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) was measured with hip-worn accelerometers and aerobic fitness was assessed with a 20-m shuttle run. Multiple regression analyses revealed a negative association between aerobic fitness and left superior frontal cortex volume and a positive association between aerobic fitness and the left pallidum volume. No associations were found between MVPA and any brain region of interest. These results demonstrate unequal contribution of physical activity and aerobic fitness on grey matter volumes, with inherent or achieved capacity (aerobic fitness) showing clearer associations than physical activity.",Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells and umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells improve neonatal rat memory after hypoxia-ischemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639506,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 19,"Current treatment options for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) are limited. Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) and cord blood mononuclear cells (CB-MNCs) offer great potential for the treatment of many neurological diseases. The aim of the present study was to identify which cell type is more effective for the treatment of HIE. PKH26-labeled UC-MSCs and CB-MNCs were transplanted into rats with hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced brain damage. Apoptotic cell numbers in the brain, as labeled by TUNEL, were assessed. Myelination and gliosis were investigated using myelin basic protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunohistochemistry, respectively. The Morris water maze was used to assess animal learning abilities. Our data show that transplantation of UC-MSCs or CB-MNCs after HI reduced astrogliosis, prevented neuronal loss in the striatum, and markedly improved functional brain outcomes after a 28-day recovery period. Moreover, treatment with CB-MNCs increased the proportion of mature oligodendrocytes and improved myelination in cortical areas. Both UC-MSCs and CB-MNCs may result in the recovery of neurological function in HI rats. Based on our data, UC-MSCs and UCB-MNCs may be particularly effective stem cell subsets for treatment of neonatal HIE.",Survival advantage for patients accepting the offer of a circulatory death liver transplant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639505,Journal of hepatology,2019 04 13,"Donation after circulatory death (DCD) in the UK has tripled in the last decade.

With moderate AIH (mAIH), hypoxemia activates the carotid body chemoreceptors and (subsequently) brainstem neural networks associated with the peripheral chemoreflex, including medullary raphe serotonergic neurons. Serotonin release and receptor activation in the phrenic motor nucleus then elicits phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF). This mechanism is independent of tissue hypoxia, since electrical carotid sinus nerve stimulation elicits similar serotonin-dependent pLTF. In striking contrast, severe AIH (sAIH) evokes a spinal adenosine-dependent, serotonin-independent mechanism of pLTF. Spinal tissue hypoxia per se is the likely cause of sAIH-induced pLTF, since local tissue hypoxia elicits extracellular adenosine accumulation. Thus, any physiological condition exacerbating spinal tissue hypoxia is expected to shift the balance towards adenosinergic pLTF. However, since these mechanisms compete for dominance due to mutual cross-talk inhibition, the transition from serotonin to adenosine dominant pLTF is rather abrupt. Any factor that compromises spinal cord circulation will limit oxygen availability in spinal cord tissue, favoring a shift in the balance towards adenosinergic mechanisms. Such shifts may arise experimentally from treatments such as carotid denervation, or spontaneous hypotension or anemia. Many neurological disorders, such as spinal cord injury or stroke compromise local circulatory control, potentially modulating tissue oxygen, adenosine levels and, thus, phrenic motor plasticity. In this brief review, we discuss the concept that local (spinal) circulatory control and/or oxygen delivery regulates the relative contributions of distinct pathways to phrenic motor plasticity.",Desmoid Tumor Presenting as a Typical Cervical Dumbbell Tumor:A Case Report and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639503,World neurosurgery,2019 01 14,"Dumbbell-shaped tumor is a type of the inner and outer cervical spinal canal tumor, and most of them are neurogenic tumors.

Yet, it is unclear whether this is also true for school age. Neither do we know the role of parental subfertility in offspring's neurological development. The present study examined neurological condition at 9 years of 57 singletons born after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation IVF (COH-IVF), 46 singletons born after modified natural cycle IVF (MNC-IVF) and 66 singletons born to subfertile parents after natural conception (Sub-NC). To assess the effect of subfertility, the groups were pooled to form a subfertile group, and compared with a prospectively followed fertile reference group (n = 282). The sensitive Minor Neurological Dysfunction (MND) examination was used, resulting in the detailed Neurological Optimality Score (NOS) and the prevalence of the clinically relevant complex MND. Neurological condition of the three subfertile groups did not differ significantly: median NOS was 53 in each subfertile group and the prevalence of complex MND in the three subfertile groups was 30%, 37% and 36%, respectively. However, the NOS was lower and the prevalence of complex MND higher in children born to subfertile couples than in children of fertile couples (adjusted mean difference [95% CI]: -4.48 [-5.53 to -3.42]) and adjusted OR [95% CI]: 5.13 [2.60-10.16], respectively).

In 2017, cases increased due to an outbreak among male adults in São Paulo. Decrease in incidence continued to occur for females and for those under 15 years of age. Data show that there was a significant decrease in HAV cases number in Brazil from 2015 after the introduction of single-dose HAV vaccine program.",Demonstrating vaccine effectiveness during a waning epidemic: A WHO/NIH meeting report on approaches to development and licensure of Zika vaccine candidates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639461,Vaccine,2019 02 10,"Since its peak in early 2016, the incidence of Zika virus (ZIKV) cases has declined to such low levels that Phase 3 field efficacy trials may be infeasible. While great progress was made to rapidly advance several vaccine candidates into Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, in the absence of sustained viral transmission it may be difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of ZIKV vaccine candidates by conducting traditional clinical disease endpoint efficacy studies. However, ZIKV is still circulating at low levels in some areas and is likely to re-emerge in naïve populations or in sites of prior epidemics once population immunity wanes. Therefore, the public health need for a ZIKV vaccine remains. To facilitate continued ZIKV vaccine development efforts, the World Health Organization's Initiative for Vaccine Research and the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases co-hosted a meeting of experts in March 2018 to identify strategies to demonstrate vaccine effectiveness in view of waning ZIKV disease incidence. This paper outlines points for consideration for developers, regulators, and other stakeholders working towards a licensed ZIKV vaccine. These deliberations may also be applicable to development of vaccines for other emerging infections where the size, unpredictability, and ephemeral nature of outbreaks makes clinical disease endpoint efficacy trials to demonstrate vaccine effectiveness infeasible.",Provider time and costs to vaccinate adult patients: Impact of time counseling without vaccination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639460,Vaccine,2019 01 28,"Amid provider reports of financial barriers as an impediment to adult immunization, this study explores the time and costs of vaccination in adult provider practices. Both a Vaccination Time-Motion Study and Vaccine Practice Management Survey were conducted (March - October 2017) in a convenience sample of 19 family medicine (FM), internal medicine (IM), and obstetrician-gynecology (OBGYN) practices, in nine states. Practices were directly observed during a one week period; estimates were collected of time spent on activities that could not be directly observed. Cost estimates were calculated by converting staff time for performed activities. In the time-motion study, FM and IM practices spent similar time conducting vaccination activities (median = 5 min per vaccination), while OBGYN practices spent more time (median = 29 min per vaccination). Combining results from the time-motion study and the practice management survey, the median costs of vaccination remained similar for FM practices and IM practices at $7 and $8 per vaccination, respectively, but was substantially higher for OBGYN practices at $43 per vaccination. Factors that contributed to higher costs among OBGYN practices were the increased time to counsel patients, administer vaccines, and to plan and manage vaccine supplies. In addition, 68% of OBGYN patients who were offered and counseled to receive vaccines declined to receive them. Counseling patients who ultimately do not go on to receive a vaccine may be an important cost factor. Lower costs of vaccination services may be achieved by increasing efficiencies in workflow or the volume of vaccinations.","Oral cholera vaccination strategy: Self-administration of the second dose in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639459,Vaccine,2019 01 28,"Cholera remains a major public health problem in many developing countries including Bangladesh. The oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is now considered a key component of the public health response to cholera. Although maintaining cold chain and organizing human resource are the major challenges of vaccine delivery to the community. Here we applied an innovative approach to second dose OCV delivery to minimize financial and logistic burdens. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and compliance of second dose self-administration when the second dose was provided in a plastic bag to first dose vaccine recipients as OCV is stable for up to 42 days at ambient temperatures. We aimed to deploy vaccines (N = 112,000) left over from other studies to 56,000 people aged ≥ one year living in Mirpur, Dhaka to see the feasibility of self-administration strategy. During vaccination, the first OCV dose (OCV1) was given from fixed sites and the second dose (OCV2) was provided in a plastic zip-lock bag for the participant to take the vaccine two weeks later at home. Participants were instructed to keep the vaccine away from light and in a dry cool place. Empty vials were collected following the end date of the scheduled second vaccination. Of the targeted population, 41,694 (74%) received the first OCV dose whereas an estimated 38,852 (93% of those receiving the first dose) received the second dose which represents a 7% drop out rate from OCV1 to OCV2. However the average two dose coverage was 69%. A survey of a subsample 2990 (from 8551) randomly selected households revealed that almost all respondents (98.75%) appreciated this new self-administration strategy and considered the strategy to be more practical and convenient than the usual method. This simplified, self-administered delivery strategy provides an ideal alternative for second-dose OCV delivery in hard-to-reach populations and resource-poor settings.","Projected impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget implications of rotavirus vaccination in Mongolia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639458,Vaccine,2019 02 10,"Rotavirus disease in Mongolia is estimated to cause more than 50 deaths yearly and many more cases and hospitalizations. Mongolia must self-finance new vaccines and does not automatically access Gavi prices for vaccines. Given the country's limited resources for health, it is critical to assess potential new vaccine programs. This evaluation estimates the impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget implications associated with a nationwide rotavirus vaccine introduction targeting infants as part of the national immunization program in Mongolia, in order to inform decision-making around introduction.",miR-142-5p enhances cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells by targeting multiple anti-apoptotic genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639456,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 02 09,"Chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, but the 5-year survival rate remains low partly because of the development of drug resistance. Although it has been reported that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) causes more severe chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells and is highly expressed in chemoresistant ovarian cancer, the molecular mechanism underlying this dysregulation is unknown. The purpose of this study was to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that bind to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of XIAP and have a role in chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. Using in silico analysis and literature review, a panel of miRNAs dysregulated in chemoresistant ovarian cancer was generated from hundreds of miRNAs that were predicted to target the XIAP 3'UTR. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay and cellular co-transfection of a miRNA expression vector and a luciferase reporter fused to the XIAP 3'UTR cognate miRNA binding site, we identified three miRNAs of which miR-142-5p had the greatest inhibitory effect. We found that overexpression of miR-142-5p suppressed XIAP expression by binding to its 3'UTR in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells. Using a chemosensitivity assay, we found that in OVCAR3, SKOV3, and primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, overexpression or inhibition of miR-142-5p increased or suppressed their sensitivities to cisplatin respectively. In contrast, introducing XIAP without a 3'UTR counteracted the effect of overexpressed miR-142-5p on cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between miR-142-5p expression and XIAP protein levels in clinical samples from patients with EOC. Using clinical and miRNA expression data of more than 200 ovarian cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found ovarian cancer patients with higher expression levels of miR-142-5p had longer median progression-free survival as compared to patients with lower miR-142-5p levels. We demonstrated that miR-142-5p also targeted four other anti-apoptotic genes, baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 (BIRC3), B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), BCL2 like 2 (BCL2L2), and myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) specifically. Transcriptome sequencing shed light on the essential apoptosis-related pathway in which miR-142-5p may be involved. To conclude, our findings illustrate that miR-142-5p sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis by targeting multiple anti-apoptotic genes including XIAP, and may also suggest the therapeutic potential of miR-142-5p in ovarian cancer treatment.",The nuclear receptor Rev-erbα participates in circadian regulation of Ugt2b enzymes in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639455,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 02 09,"Circadian clock is known to modulate phase I metabolism, however whether and how the phase II enzymes UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are regulated by circadian clock are largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate a potential role of the clock gene Rev-erbα in regulation of Ugt2b enzymes. Ugt2b mRNA and protein expression in mouse livers were determined at a 4-h interval around the clock. Ugt2b activity was probed using morphine as a specific substrate. Regulation of Ugt2b by Rev-erbα was investigated using mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 cells and Rev-erbα knock-out (Rev-erbα-/-) mice. Luciferase reporter, mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to identify the Rev-erbα binding site in Ugt2b36 promoter. Circadian variations in hepatic mRNA expression were observed for six Ugt2b genes (Ugt2b1, Ugt2b5, Ugt2b35, Ugt2b36, Ugt2b37, and Ugt2b38) in mice. Likewise, the total Ugt2b protein showed a circadian fluctuation. Glucuronidation of morphine (an Ugt2b substrate) both in vitro and in vivo was dosing-time dependent. Morphine glucuronidation was more extensive at the dosing time of ZT2 than at ZT14 consistent with the Ugt2b protein levels. Furthermore, Rev-erbα knockdown significantly increased Ugt2b mRNA and protein in Hepa-1c1c7 cells, whereas Rev-erbα overexpression or activation down-regulated Ugt2b expression. Moreover, Rev-erbα ablation in mice up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of Ugt2b and blunted Ugt2b rhythmicity in the liver. In addition, Rev-erbα repressed the transcription of Ugt2b36 through specific binding to the -30 to -18 bp of promoter region based on a combination of luciferase reporter, mobility shift and ChIP assays. In summary, the clock gene Rev-erbα negatively regulates the expressions of Ugt2b genes, contributing to their circadian variations.",Different trajectories in the development of visual acuity with different levels of crowding: The Milan Eye Chart (MEC).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639454,Vision research,2019 05 31,"Eye charts are typically optimized to assess visual acuity (VA) with constant and controlled spacing, while close-to-acuity crowding limits letter identification in the normal fovea when adjacent letters are closely spaced. Here we developed a clinical tool that enables the assessment of acuity with different levels of crowding. In a cross-sectional study, we examined the developmental trajectories with our newly devised Milan Eye Chart (MEC). A total of 252 children of 1st, 3rd and 5th grade were assessed with the MEC using SLOAN letter optotypes with 100%, 50%, 25% and 12.5% inter-optotype spacing. Results show an interaction between spacing and grade. The performance to the 100% standard VA was not significantly different among grades, while the narrow spaced acuity (12.5% spacing) strongly improved with the grade. The different trajectories of acuity measured with high spaced and low spaced eye-charts suggest that the mechanisms able to reduce the crowding effects develops later than VA, and it is, at least in part, dissociated by the psychophysiological development of lower level visual mechanisms. The MEC charts are feasible and useful in assessing visual acuity with different level of crowding during the whole lifespan. The opportunity to assess crowding-limited acuity in early age is particularly relevant since it plays a significant role in amblyopia screening."

However, little is known about the role of miR-532-5p in bladder cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression, biological function, and regulatory mechanism of miR-532-5p in bladder cancer. Herein, we found that miR-532-5p expression was frequently downregulated in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared with normal controls. Functional experiments showed that overexpression of miR-532-5p inhibited the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells, whereas inhibition of miR-532-5p showed opposite effects. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis predicted high-mobility group protein B3 (HMGB3) as a potential target gene of miR-532-5p. Further experiments showed that miR-532-5p directly targeted the 3'-UTR of HMGB3 and negatively regulated its expression in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, HMGB3 expression was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and showed inverse correlation with miR-532-5p expression. Notably, miR-532-5p regulated the nuclear expression of β-catenin and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in bladder cancer cells. However, restoration of HMGB3 expression partially reversed the antitumor effect of miR-532-5p overexpression, while knockdown of HMGB3 partially abrogated the oncogenic effect of miR-532-5p inhibition. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-532-5p inhibited the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells by targeting HMGB3 and downregulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting a tumor suppressive role of miR-532-5p in bladder cancer. Our study highlights an importance of the miR-532-5p/HMGB3 axis in bladder cancer and suggests that targeting miR-532-5p/HMGB3 may have potential applications for development of bladder cancer therapy.",Combined treatment with vitamin K2 and PTH enhanced bone formation in ovariectomized rats and increased differentiation of osteoblast in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639440,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 02 15,"Osteoporosis is accompanied by insufficient osteogenic capacity. Several lines of evidence suggested that solutions to enhance osteoblastogenesis were important strategies for osteoporotic bone defect repair. This study investigated the effect of combined treatment with vitamin K2 and PTH on bone formation in calvarial bone defect in osteoporotic rats and its influence on osteoblast in vitro. Bilateral ovariectomy was used in SPF Sprague Dawley rats to generate an osteoporosis model. Subsequently, a calvarial defect model was established and all osteoporotic rats were randomly assigned to the following groups: control, VK (vitamin K2, 30 mg/kg everyday), PTH (recombinant human PTH (1-34), 60 μg/kg, three times a week) or VK + PTH (vitamin K2, 30 mg/kg everyday plus PTH, 60 μg/kg three times a week) for 8 weeks. In vitro, bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) were cultured and treated with vitamin K2, PTH or vitamin K2+PTH. ALP staining and western blot were performed to observe the influence of combined treatment on BMSCs. Bone formation within calvarial defect were assessed by serum γ-carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC), micro-CT, histological and immunofluorescent labeling. In this study, combined treatment of PTH and vitamin K2 showed positive effects on preventing bone loss in femurs in OVX rats. Combined treatment increased serum Gla-OC and promoted bone formation in osteoporotic calvarial bone defects. Immunohistochemistry showed that OCN and RUNX2 were more highly expressed in the VK + PTH group than in the control groups. In vitro studies results suggested that combined treatment with PTH and vitamin K2 increased expression of ALP, BMP2 and RUNX2 in BMSCs. Our data suggested that the combination of vitamin K2 and PTH increased differentiation of osteoblast and had a synergistic effect on bone formation in osteoporotic calvarial bone defect.",Biomarkers mapping of neuropathic pain in a nerve chronic constriction injury mice model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639439,Biochimie,2019 02 27,"Neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system and has a considerable impact on the quality of life. Neuropathic pain has a dynamic and complex aetiology and gives heterogeneous symptoms across patients; therefore, it represents an important clinical challenge. Current pharmacological treatment includes tricyclic antidepressant serotonin-noradrenaline uptake inhibitors such as duloxetine, pregabalin, and gabapentin. However, these drugs do not show efficacy in all patients suffering from neuropathic pain. In this work we used a nerve chronic constriction injury mice model based on the ligation of sciatic nerve to analyse, by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, blood proteins significantly altered by neuropathic pain one-week after surgery. A sham-ligated group of mice acting as control and a group of ligated mice treated with gabapentin were also analysed. The results indicated that four haptoglobin isoforms were significantly more expressed, while transthyretin and alpha-2-macroglobulin expression decreased in the serum of the murine neuropathic pain model with respect to the control mice. Interestingly, the treatment with the gabapentin reversed these conditions. The outcomes of this study can provide a further understanding of the pathophysiological meaning of the biomarkers involved in neuropathic pain.",Approved drugs screening against the nsP1 capping enzyme of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus using an immuno-based assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639438,Antiviral research,2019 02 12,"Alphaviruses such as the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are important human emerging pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes. They possess a unique viral mRNA capping mechanism catalyzed by the viral non-structural protein nsP1, which is essential for virus replication. The alphaviruses capping starts by the methylation of a GTP molecule by the N7-guanine methyltransferase (MTase) activity; nsP1 then forms a covalent link with m7GMP releasing pyrophosphate (GT reaction) and the m7GMP is next transferred onto the 5'-diphosphate end of the viral mRNA to form a cap-0 structure. The cap-0 structure decreases the detection of foreign viral RNAs, prevents RNA degradation by cellular exonucleases, and promotes viral RNA translation into proteins. Additionally, reverse-genetic studies have demonstrated that viruses mutated in nsP1 catalytic residues are both impaired towards replication and attenuated. The nsP1 protein is thus considered an attractive antiviral target for drug discovery. We have previously demonstrated that the guanylylation of VEEV nsP1 can be monitored by Western blot analysis using an antibody recognizing the cap structure. In this study, we developed a high throughput ELISA screening assay to monitor the GT reaction through m7GMP-nsP1 adduct quantitation. This assay was validated using known nsP1 inhibitors before screening 1220 approved compounds. 18 compounds inhibiting the nsP1 guanylylation were identified, and their IC50 determined. Compounds from two series were further characterized and shown to inhibit the nsP1 MTase activity. Conversely, these compounds barely inhibited a cellular MTase demonstrating their specificity towards nsP1. Analogues search and SAR were also initiated to identify the active pharmacophore features. Altogether the results show that this HT enzyme-based assay is a convenient way to select potent and specific hit compounds targeting the viral mRNA capping of Alphaviruses.",Characterization of the molecular events of covalently closed circular DNA synthesis in de novo Hepatitis B virus infection of human hepatoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639437,Antiviral research,2019 02 12,"Despite the utmost importance of cccDNA in HBV biology, the mechanism by which cccDNA synthesis is regulated is not completely understood. Here we explored HepG2-NTCP cell line and performed a time-course HBV infection experiment (up to 30 days) to follow the conversion of the input viral DNA into cccDNA. We found that a protein-free RC DNA (PF-RC DNA) become detectable as early as 12 h post infection (hpi) prior to the detection of cccDNA, which become evident only at 2-3 dpi. Intriguingly, the PF-RC DNA detected at 12 hpi was abundantly located in the cytoplasm, implicating that the protein-removal from the input viral DNA takes place in the cytoplasm, perhaps inside the nucleocapsid. Notably, during the early time points of HBV infection, the PF-RC DNA accumulated at significantly higher levels and appeared in a peak followed by a plateau at late time points with dramatically lower levels, implicating the presence of two distinct populations of the PF-RC DNA. Importantly, the PF-RC DNA at earlier peak is entecavir (ETV)-resistant, whereas the PF-RC DNA at posterior days is ETV-sensitive. An interpretation is that the PF-RC DNA at earlier peak represents ""input viral DNA"" derived from HBV inoculum, whereas the PF-RC DNA at late time points represents the de novo product of the viral reverse transcription. The existence of two populations of the PF-RC DNA having a distinct kinetic profile and ETV-sensitivity implicated that intracellular amplification via the viral reverse transcription greatly contributes to the maintenance of cccDNA pool during HBV infection. As such, we concluded that the cccDNA level is stably maintained by continuing replenishment of cccDNA primarily through intracellular amplification in the HepG2-NTCP cell line.",IgE testing can predict food allergy status in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639434,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2019 05 03,"Diagnosing food allergy in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is complicated by their high rate of asymptomatic sensitization to foods, which can lead to misdiagnosis and unnecessary food avoidance.",Sympathetic nervous system in age-related cardiovascular dysfunction: Pathophysiology and therapeutic perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639431,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2019 05 08,"Cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and metabolic syndrome have high prevalence in the elderly population and are leading causes of death, disability, hospitalization, driving high healthcare costs worldwide. To reduce this social and economic burden there is urgency to find effective therapeutic targets. Several studies have linked the dysfunction of the Sympathetic Nervous System and β-adrenergic receptor signaling with the pathogenesis of age-related cardiovascular diseases. Therapeutic treatments that restore their functions have been shown to be effective in subjects with cardiovascular comorbidities. In fact, lifestyle interventions (such as exercise training and diet) as well as pharmacologic treatments (e.g. β-blockers or moxonidine) and mini-invasive interventions (renal sympathetic denervation) have beneficial effects on age-related cardiovascular diseases. In the current ""Medicine in focus"" article we will discuss the pathogenic role of the Sympathetic Nervous System in age-related cardiovascular diseases as well as current and new therapeutic approaches.","Small molecule inhibitor of c-Myc 10058-F4 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in acute leukemia cells, irrespective of PTEN status.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639430,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2019 02 08,"Based on the frequent over-expression of c-Myc in hematologic malignancies and its crucial role in the regulation of diverse oncogenic pathways involved in leukomogenesis, intense interest has recently focused on this factor as an appealing therapeutically target in leukemia. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the anti-leukemic property of small molecule inhibitor of c-Myc 10058-F4 in two distinct acute leukemia cell lines consist of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)-derived NB4 cells (with wild-type PTEN) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-derived Nalm-6 cells (with down-regulated PTEN). 10058-F4 effectively reduced survival of leukemic cells; however, we found a different cell sensitivity pattern in the tested cell lines. To the best of our knowledge, no study has addressed the underlying mechanisms responsible for leukemic cell resistance to 10058-F4, and we propose for the first time that the effectiveness of c-Myc inhibition might be attenuated through over-activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in less sensitive Nalm-6 cells. Notably, we failed to find an obvious correlation between PTEN status and cell sensitivity to the inhibitor in a panel of hematologic malignant cells. Beyond 10058-F4 cytotoxicity as a single agent, synergistic experiments also delineated that pharmaceutical targeting of c-Myc could potentiate the anti-cancer effect of both vincristine and Arsenic trioxide in ALL and APL cells, respectively. In conclusion, this study sheds light on the potent anti-leukemic characteristics of 10058-F4 and provide an interesting evidence to the application of this agent in combination with PI3K inhibitors especially in acute leukemia with over-activated PI3K, irrespective of PTEN status.",Adenovirus-Mediated ABCC6 Gene Therapy for Heritable Ectopic Mineralization Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639429,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 06 10,"Loss-of-function mutations in the ABCC6 gene cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum and type 2 generalized arterial calcification of infancy, heritable ectopic mineralization disorders without effective treatment. ABCC6 encodes the putative efflux transporter ABCC6, which is predominantly expressed in the liver. Although the substrate of ABCC6 remains unknown, recent studies showed that pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a metabolic disorder caused by reduced circulating levels of pyrophosphate, a potent mineralization inhibitor. We hypothesized that reconstitution of ABCC6 might counteract ectopic mineralization in an Abcc6-/- mouse model of pseudoxanthoma elasticum. Intravenous administration of a recombinant adenovirus expressing wild-type human ABCC6 in Abcc6-/- mice showed sustained high-level expression of human ABCC6 in the liver for up to 4 weeks, increasing pyrophosphate levels in plasma. In addition, adenovirus injection every 4 weeks restored plasma pyrophosphate levels and, consequently, significantly reduced ectopic mineralization in the skin of young mice. By contrast, the same treatment in old mice with already established mineral deposits failed to reduce mineralization. These results suggest that adenovirus-mediated ABCC6 gene delivery, when initiated early, is a promising prevention therapy for pseudoxanthoma elasticum and generalized arterial calcification of infancy, diseases that currently lack preventive or therapeutic options.",Modification by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate prevents amyloid transformation of alpha-synuclein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639428,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Proteins and proteomics,2019 02 24,"Numerous investigations point to the relation between diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. Alpha-synuclein is a protein involved in the development of synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease. In the present work, alpha-synuclein was for the first time modified by the intermediate product of glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA-3-P). The resulting product was compared with the alpha-synuclein modified by methylglyoxal (MGO). The efficiency of the modification by the aldehydes was evaluated by decrease in free amino group content. The modification products were detected using fluorescence spectroscopy. The effect of modification by two glycating agents on the amyloid transformation of alpha-synuclein was investigated. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the aggregates produced by the native alpha-synuclein under fibrillation conditions revealed the presence of 355-441-nm fibrils. In the aggregates produced by the modified alpha-synuclein, short fibrils of 65-230 nm or 85-260 nm were detected in the case of the protein treated with MGO and GA-3-P, respectively. Investigation of the aggregates by the fluorescence assay with Thioflavin T and CD spectroscopy showed that, in contrast to native alpha-synuclein, alpha-synuclein treated with GA-3-P does not produce real amyloid structures. Consequently, modification of alpha-synuclein by GA-3-P, the metabolite whose concentration is determined by the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, prevents its amyloid transformation."

Here, the effects of SMV on fetal lipids and T Prod in Crl:CD(SD) rats were correlated with postnatal alterations in F1 males. The current study was conducted in two parts: 1) a prenatal assessment to confirm and further characterize the dose response relationship among previously reported alterations of SMV on fetal T Prod and the fetal lipid profile and 2) a postnatal assessment to determine the effects of SMV exposure during the periods of major organogenesis and/or sexual differentiation on F1 offspring growth and development. We hypothesized that SMV would have adverse effects on postnatal development and sexual differentiation as a consequence of the disruptions of fetal lipid levels and testicular T Prod since fetal cholesterol is essential for normal intrauterine growth and development and steroid synthesis. In the prenatal assessment, SMV was administered orally at 0, 15.6, 31.25, 62.5, 80, 90, 100, and 110 mg SMV/kg/d from GD 14-18, the period that cover the critical window of sex differentiation in the male rat fetus. T Prod was maximally reduced by ~40% at 62.5 mg/kg/d, and higher doses induced overt maternal and toxicity. In the postnatal assessment, SMV was administered at 0, 15.6, 31.25, and 62.5 mg/kg/d from GD 8-18 to determine if it altered postnatal development. We found that exposure during this time frame to 62.5 mg SMV/kg/d reduced pup viability by 92%, decreased neonatal anogenital distance, and altered testis histology and morphology in 17% of the F1 males. In another group, SMV was administered only during the masculinizing window (GD14-18) at 62.5 mg/kg/d to determine if male rat sexual differentiation and postnatal reproductive development were altered. SMV-exposed F1 males displayed female-like areolae/nipples, delayed puberty, and reduced seminal vesicle and levator ani-bulbocavernosus weights. Together, these results demonstrate that in utero exposure to SMV reduces offspring viability and permanently disrupts reproductive tract development in the male offspring. While the effects of high dose, short term in utero exposure to SMV in the adult male are likely androgen-dependent and consistent with the 40% reduction in T Prod in the fetal testes, long-term, lower dose administration induced some effects that were likely not mediated by decreased T Prod.",Validation of a site-specific recombination cloning technique for the rapid development of a full-length cDNA clone of a virulent field strain of vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639413,Journal of virological methods,2019 04 15,"This study reports the use of a site-specific recombination cloning technique for rapid development of a full-length cDNA clone that can produce infectious vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV). The full-length genome of the epidemic VSNJV NJ0612NME6 strain was amplified in four overlapping cDNA fragments which were linked together and cloned into a vector plasmid by site-specific recombination. Furthermore, to derive infectious virus, three supporting plasmid vectors containing either the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) or polymerase (L) genes were constructed using the same cloning methodology. Recovery of recombinant VSNJV was achieved after transfecting all four vectors on into BSR-T7/5 cells, a BHK-derived cell line stably expressing T7 RNA polymerase (PMID: 9847328). In vitro characterization of recombinant and parental viruses revealed similar growth kinetics and plaque morphologies. Furthermore, experimental infection of pigs with the recombinant virus resulted in severe vesicular stomatitis with clinical signs similar to those previously reported for the parental field strain. These results validate the use of site-directed specific recombination cloning as a useful alternative method for rapid construction of stable full-length cDNA clones from vesicular stomatitis field strains. The approach reported herein contributes to the improvement of previously published methodologies for the development of full-length cDNA clones of this relevant virus.",Macrophage fatty acid oxidation inhibits atherosclerosis progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639412,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 02 02,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic disorder of the vessel wall. One key regulator of disease progression is lipid handling in macrophages. However, the role of macrophage mitochondrial-dependent fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in atherosclerosis is not well defined. To address this, we focused on carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) 1 and 2, which play an essential role in the transport of long chain fatty acids (FAs) into the mitochondria. Using conditional alleles of these mitochondrial enzymes, we have generated myeloid-specific Cpt1a and Cpt2 knockout mutants (CPT1a M-KO and CPT2 M-KO). In culture, macrophages derived from CPT1a and CPT2 M-KO mice have impaired FAO, enhanced expression of the CD36 scavenger receptor, increased uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and augmented transformation into cholesterol-rich foam cells. In line with these in vitro observations, in the atherosclerosis-susceptible apolipoprotein E (ApoE) KO background, CPT2 M-KO mice demonstrated augmented atherosclerosis, accompanied by increased accumulation of aortic macrophages with elevated CD36 expression. These data suggest that macrophage FAO is athero-protective and that augmenting FAO may potentially slow atherosclerotic progression.",Aspiration thrombectomy for acute iliofemoral or central deep venous thrombosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639411,Journal of vascular surgery.

RecQ C-terminal (RQC) domain is the main DNA binding module of BLM and specifically recognizes G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures. Because G4 processing by BLM is essential for regulating replication and transcription, both G4 and BLM are considered as potential targets for anticancer therapy. Although several studies have revealed the detailed mechanism of G4 unwinding by BLM, the initial recognition of the G4 structure by the RQC domain is unclear. Here, we investigated the interaction between BLM RQC and the G4 DNA from the c-Myc promoter by NMR spectroscopy. While the signals broadened upon reciprocal titrations, the β-wing of RQC had significant chemical shift perturbations and experienced millisecond timescale dynamics upon G4 binding. A point mutation in the β-wing (N1164A) reduced G4 binding affinity. Our hydrogen-deuterium exchange data indicate that imino protons of G4 were exchanged with deuterium much faster in the presence of RQC. We suggest that RQC binds to G4 by using the β-wing as a separating pin to destabilize the G4. By providing information about the RQC-G4 interaction, our study yields insight into potential strategies for preventing G4 processing by BLM.",The Role of Connexins in Gastrointestinal Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639409,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 15,"Gap junctions are hexagonal arrays of protein molecules in the plasma membrane and were first described in Mauthner cell synapses of goldfish. They form pathways for coupling between cells, allowing passive, electrotonic spread of ions and also passage of larger molecules such as amino acids and nucleotides. They are expressed in both excitable and non-excitable tissues. Each gap junction is made of two connexons, which are hexameric proteins of the connexin subunit. In this review, the roles that connexins play in gastrointestinal motility, the mechanisms of altered connexin expression leading to inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal infections, and gastrointestinal symptoms in autistic spectrum disorder are discussed in detail.",Crystal Structures of Csm2 and Csm3 in the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas Effector Complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639408,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 15,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci and CRISPR-associated (Cas) genes encode CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) and Cas proteins, respectively, which play important roles in the adaptive immunity system (CRISPR-Cas system) in prokaryotes. The crRNA and Cas proteins form ribonucleoprotein effector complexes to capture and degrade invading genetic materials with base complementarity to the crRNA guide sequences. The Csm complex, a type III-A effector complex, comprises five Cas proteins (Csm1-Csm5) and a crRNA, which co-transcriptionally degrades invading DNA and RNA. Here we report the crystal structures of the Staphylococcus epidermidis Csm2 (SeCsm2) and Thermoplasma volcanium Csm3 (TvCsm3) at 2.4- and 2.7-Å resolutions, respectively. SeCsm2 adopts a monomeric globular fold by itself, in striking contrast to the previously reported Thermotoga maritima Csm2, which adopted an extended conformation and formed a dimeric structure. We propose that the globular monomeric form is the bona fide structure of Csm2. TvCsm3 forms a filamentous structure in the crystals. The molecular arrangement of TvCsm3 is similar to that of the stacked Cmr4 proteins in the Cmr complex, suggesting the functionally relevant architecture of the present Csm3 structure. We constructed model structures of the Csm complex, which revealed that Csm3 binds the crRNA and periodically deforms the crRNA-target duplex by a similar mechanism to that of Cmr4 in the Cmr complex. The model and mutational analysis suggest that the conserved lysine residue of Csm2 is important for target RNA binding, and Csm2 stabilizes the active structure of the Csm complex to facilitate the reaction.","Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus seropositivity is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A case-control study in Xinjiang, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639407,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 05 03,"To assess the potential relationship between Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2) in Xinjiang, China.","Molecular characterization of human enteric viruses in food, water samples, and surface swabs in Sicily.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639406,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 05 03,"Enteric viruses are responsible for foodborne and waterborne infections affecting a large number of people.

Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial energy supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty acid supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty acid distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in lipid metabolism during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of palmitic and oleic acid promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing palmitic and oleic acid implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin metabolism. We further demonstrated the impact of cellular lipid metabolism, and particularly cardiolipin metabolism, during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis. Thus, cardiolipin may represent a new therapeutic target for axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injuries or when axon sprouting is required to compensate for motor neuron loss in response to aging and/or disease.",Exosomes populate the cerebrospinal fluid of preterm infants with post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639393,International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,2019 06 04,"Preterm infants are at risk of germinal matrix haemorrhage-intraventricular haemorrhage (GMH-IVH) which leads to post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) in 30% of infants; this is associated with moderate-severe neurodevelopmental impairment and confers significant risk of cerebral palsy.

FOXG1-related disorders, caused by deletions, intragenic mutations or duplications, are usually associated with severe intellectual disability, autistic features, and, in 87% of subjects, epileptiform manifestations. In a subset of patients with FoxG1 mutations, seizures remain intractable, prompting the need for novel therapeutic options. To address this issue, we took advantage of a haploinsufficient animal model, the FoxG1+/- mouse. In vivo electrophysiological analyses of FoxG1+/- mice detected hippocampal hyperexcitability, which turned into overt seizures upon delivery of the proconvulsant kainic acid, as confirmed by behavioral observations. These alterations were associated with decreased expression of the chloride transporter KCC2. Next, we tested whether a triheptanoin-based anaplerotic diet could have an impact on the pathological phenotype of FoxG1+/- mice. This manipulation abated altered neural activity and normalized enhanced susceptibility to proconvulsant-induced seizures, in addition to rescuing altered expression of KCC2 and increasing the levels of the GABA transporter vGAT. In conclusion, our data show that FoxG1 haploinsufficiency causes dysfunction of hippocampal circuits and increases the susceptibility to a proconvulsant insult, and that these alterations are rescued by triheptanoin dietary treatment.",Regulation of microRNA-29c in the nucleus accumbens modulates methamphetamine -induced locomotor sensitization in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639389,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 19,"Changes in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) may play important roles in regulating drug addiction. MiR-29c is a highly expressed miRNA in the human and rodent nervous systems where it plays a broad regulatory role. As the first step towards investigating potential functions of miR-29c in methamphetamine (METH) addiction, we used C57BL/6 mice in a model of METH-induced locomotor sensitization. We measured miR-29c expression changes in the NAc of the mice after repeated-intermittent METH exposure and acute METH administration respectively by using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We found that miR-29c expression was significantly down-regulated in the NAc of METH-sensitized mice but not in the acute METH-treated mice. Then, we tested the respective effects of miR-29c over-expression and inhibition in the NAc on METH-induced locomotor sensitization. To reach this goal, we constructed adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing miR-29c (AAV-miR-29c) and its corresponding inhibitor - tough decoy (AAV-anti-miR-29c TuD) to over-express and inhibit miR-29c, respectively. We found that AAV-miR-29c over-expression in the NAc enhanced METH-induced locomotor sensitization, whereas AAV inhibition of miR-29c expression in the NAc attenuated the effects of METH. Moreover, we observed the participation of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Meg3 in the effects of miR-29c on METH sensitization. Our results suggest that miR-29c is an important epigenetic regulator of METH-induced behavioural sensitization and changes in gene expression. These data further suggest a potential role of miR-29c in regulating long-term METH-induced adaptation in the brain.",Prenatal valproate in rodents as a tool to understand the neural underpinnings of social dysfunctions in autism spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639388,Neuropharmacology,2019 01 28,"Impairments in social interaction and verbal and non verbal communication are among the main features of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The causes of ASD are still unknown but the research efforts of the last decade have identified a number of factors (rare gene mutations, gene variations and adverse environmental events) that, interacting in complex ways, affect early brain development. The clinical evidence that prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproate (VPA) is associated with increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay, cognitive deficits and autism in children, has drawn the attention of scientists on VPA as a tool to unravel the environment contribution to ASD risk in children. In agreement with the clinical evidence, rodents prenatally exposed to VPA display behavioral anomalies resembling ASD symptoms. The mechanisms by which administration of VPA in pregnancy increases the risk of autism are still far to be clear as are still undetermined the specific targets of VPA in the developing brain both in humans and rodents. However, the robustness of the behavioral alterations, mainly in the social domain, and the neural/molecular changes revealed so far support the VPA model as a reliable instrument to investigate the neural underpinnings of social impairment. Here we provide an update of preclinical studies on prenatal exposure to VPA in rodents with a focus on the social and communication deficits induced by VPA, discussing potential pitfalls and future directions in this research field and corroborating the potential of the VPA model to identify new pharmacological targets for ASD.",Reassembly of native components with donepezil to execute dual-missions in Alzheimer's disease therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639387,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 18,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted and progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and deficits of acetylcholine. Accordingly, the intra-/extra-cerebral level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) is crucial on the pathogenesis of AD; and most of all, various HDL-protein subtypes play a double-edged role in AD pathology, of which apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) gives protective outcomes. Inspired from ""HDL bionics"", we proposed biologically reassembled nanodrugs, donepezil-loaded apolipoprotein A-I-reconstituted HDL (rHDL/Do) that concurrently executed dual-missions of Aβ-targeting clearance and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition in AD therapy. Once prepared, rHDL/Do nanodrug achieved high drug encapsulation efficiency of 90.47%, and mimicked the configurations and properties of natural lipoproteins aiming to significantly enhance BBB penetration and modulate Aβ-induced neuronal damage both in vitro and in vivo. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis confirmed that rHDL/Do facilitated microglial-mediated Aβ intake and degradation, demonstrating low KD value with Aβ affinity (2.45 × 10-8 of Aβ monomer and 2.78 × 10-8 of Aβ oligomer). In AD animal models, daily treatment of rHDL/Do efficiently inhibited AChE activity, ameliorated neurologic variation, promoted Aβ clearance, and rescued memory loss at a safe level. The collective findings indicated that the biological nanodrug was provided with the capacities of BBB penetration, Aβ capture and degradation via microglial cells, and cholinergic dysfunction amelioration after controlled donepezil release. In summary, rHDL/Do nanodrugs could offer a promising strategy to synergize both symptom control and disease modification in AD therapy.",Glucose-linked sub-50-nm unimer polyion complex-assembled gold nanoparticles for targeted siRNA delivery to glucose transporter 1-overexpressing breast cancer stem-like cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639386,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 02 01,"Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) treatment is a plausible strategy for enhanced cancer therapy. Here we report a glucose-installed sub-50-nm nanocarrier for the targeted delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to CSCs through selective recognition of the glucose ligand to the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) overexpressed on the CSC surface. The siRNA nanocarrier was constructed via a two-step assembling process. First, a glucose-installed poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(l-lysine) modified with lipoic acid (LA) at the ω-end (Glu-PEG-PLL-LA) was associated with a single siRNA to form a unimer polyion complex (uPIC). Second, a 20 nm gold nanoparticle (AuNP) was decorated with ~65 uPICs through AuS bonding. The glucose-installed targeted nanoparticles (Glu-NPs) exhibited higher cellular uptake of siRNA payloads in a spheroid breast cancer (MBA-MB-231) cell culture compared with glucose-unconjugated control nanoparticles (MeO-NPs). Notably, the Glu-NPs became more efficiently internalized into the CSC fraction, which was defined by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity assay, than the other fractions, probably due to the higher GLUT1 expression level on the CSCs. The Glu-NPs elicited significantly enhanced gene silencing in a CSC-rich orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumor tissue following systemic administration to tumor-bearing mice. Ultimately, the repeated administrations of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNA-loaded Glu-NPs significantly suppressed the growth of orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumors. These results demonstrate that Glu-NP is a promising nanocarrier design for CSC-targeted cancer treatment.","Debating the ""bidirectional link"" between diabetes and depression through the Ca2+/cAMP signalling: Off-label effects of Ca2+ channel blockers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639385,Pharmacological research,2019 04 26,"Many reports have been demonstrating off-label effects for calcium (Ca2+) channel blockers (CCBs), for example: patients medicated with CCBs have had an improvement of their diabetes status (control of glycemia), along with an improvement of both depression symptoms and cognitive function.

Both neutral and acid mucins presented in the stomach of the tilapia, whereas the stomach of the catfish contained only the neutral mucin although it is contained more collagen in the submucosa. The tilapia intestine revealed that neutral and acid mucins were presented throughout the tissue, and small amounts of sulfated acid mucin were observed in the anterior intestine. However, sulfated acid mucin was very obviously located in posterior intestine of the catfish. Moreover, all parts of the catfish intestine showed both neutral and acid mucins with a thick collagen layer in the submucosa. This research will be useful for understanding the physiology of the relevant digestive systems and making a diagnosis of some gastrointestinal diseases in these two fish.",Tetraspanin CD151 impairs heterodimerization of ErbB2/ErbB3 in breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639369,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,2019 05 17,"CD151/Tspan24 (SFS-1, PETA3) is one of the best characterized members of the tetraspanin family, whose involvement in breast cancer (BCa) progression was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. We have recently reported that in ErbB2-overexpressing BCa cells grown in 3D laminin-rich extracellular matrix, CD151 regulated basal phosphorylation and homodimerization of ErbB2 and sensitized the cells to Herceptin (trastuzumab). Following from these data, we have here analyzed an involvement of CD151 in regulation of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimerization and its impact on cell response to Herceptin. CD151 was found to: (1) impair ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimerization, (2) inhibit heregulin-dependent cell growth in 3D and signaling, and (3) counteract the protective effect of heregulin on Herceptin-mediated growth inhibition. Analysis of tissue samples demonstrated for the first time clinical significance of CD151 in patients with ErbB2-overexpressing BCa undergone trastuzumab-based therapy. Consistent with in vitro results, CD151 impact on disease outcome was ErbB3-dependent. In patients with ErbB3-negative tumors, CD151 significantly improved both overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.19, P = 0.034) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.36, P = 0.043), while in ErbB3-positive cases it had no significant effect on patient survival (OS: HR = 3.33, P = 0.283; PFS: HR = 2.40, P = 0.208). These results support previous findings and show that CD151 acts as an important component of ErbB2 signaling axis in BCa cells, affecting their sensitivity to ErbB2-targeting therapy.",Müller cells in pathological retinal angiogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639368,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,2019 05 17,"Müller cells are the major glial cells spanning the entire layer of the retina and maintaining retinal structure. Under pathological conditions, Müller cells are involved in retinal angiogenesis, a process of growing new blood vessels from pre-existing capillaries. In response to hypoxia, high glucose, and inflammation conditions, multiple signaling pathways are activated in Müller cells, followed by the increased production of proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases, Netrin-4, and angiopoietin-like 4. Expression of antiangiogenic factors is also downregulated in Müller cells. Besides, proliferation and dedifferentiation of Müller cells facilitates retinal angiogenesis. In this review, we summarized molecular mechanisms of Müller cells-related retinal angiogenesis. The potential of Müller cells as a therapeutic target for retinal angiogenesis was also discussed.",Age-dependent Changes in the Macular Choriocapillaris of Normal Eyes Imaged With Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639367,American journal of ophthalmology,2019 05 15,Swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) was used to measure the age-dependent changes in macular choriocapillaris (CC) flow deficits (FDs) in normal eyes.,Predictors of Falls per Step and Falls per Year At and Away From Home in Glaucoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639366,American journal of ophthalmology,2019 04 04,To determine where glaucoma patients most often fall and how integrated visual field (IVF) damage affects falls rates per year (falls/year) and per step (falls/step) at and away from home.,Functional Visual Ability and Quality of Life in Children With Glaucoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639365,American journal of ophthalmology,2019 04 02,To evaluate the effect of glaucoma and its management on the functional visual ability (FVA) and the vision-related quality of life (VR QoL) in children 8-18 years of age.,Autologous tissue reconstruction of Interrupted aortic arch using aberrant subclavian artery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639364,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2019 01 14,Reconstruction of the aortic arch in type B interruption requires extensive mobilisation of the descending aorta and the proximal branches of the arch to perform a tension free anastomosis.

However, its antifouling properties prevent in vivo endothelialization. This work examined the endothelialization and thrombogenicity of modified PVA with different concentrations of proteins and adhesion peptides: collagen, laminin, fibronectin, GFPGER, YIGSR, and cRGD. Material surface properties were quantified, and the endothelialization potential was determined with human endothelial colony forming cells. Additionally, platelet attachment was assessed in vitro with human platelet rich plasma, and promising samples were tested in an ex vivo shunt model. This well-established arteriovenous shunt model was used with and without clinically-relevant antiplatelet therapies, specifically acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) with and without clopidogrel to examine the minimum necessary treatment to prevent thrombosis. Collagen, laminin, and GFPGER biomolecules increased endothelialization, with GFPGER showing the greatest effect at the lowest concentrations. GFPGER-PVA tubes tested under whole blood did exhibit an increase in platelet (but not fibrin) attachment compared to plain PVA and clinical controls. However, application of ASA monotherapy reduced the thrombogenicity of GFPGER-PVA below the clinical control with the ASA. This work is significant in developing cardiovascular biomaterials-increasing endothelialization potential while reducing bleeding side effects by using an antiplatelet monotherapy, typical of clinical patients. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We modified the endothelialization potential of synthetic, hydrogel vascular grafts with proteins and peptides of the vascular tissue matrix. Cell attachment was dramatically increased with the GFPGER peptide, and while some additional platelet attachment was seen under flow with whole blood, this was completely knocked down using clinical antiplatelet monotherapy. This indicates that long-term patency of this biomaterial could be improved without the associated bleeding risk of multiple platelet therapies.","Report from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases workshop on ""Atopic dermatitis and the atopic march: Mechanisms and interventions"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639346,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2019 06 14,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects up to 20% of children worldwide and is an increasing public health problem, particularly in developed countries. Although AD in infants and young children can resolve, there is a well-recognized increased risk of sequential progression from AD to other atopic diseases, including food allergy (FA), allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, a process referred to as the atopic march. The mechanisms underlying the development of AD and subsequent progression to other atopic comorbidities, particularly FA, are incompletely understood and the subject of intense investigation. Other major research objectives are the development of effective strategies to prevent AD and FA, as well as therapeutic interventions to inhibit the atopic march. In 2017, the Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sponsored a workshop to discuss current understanding and important advances in these research areas and to identify gaps in knowledge and future research directions. International and national experts in the field were joined by representatives from several National Institutes of Health institutes.

By acting on similar brain circuits, they might interactively influence human behavior. The current study investigates the causal role of testosterone on aggression-related brain activity and the potential interaction with the MAOA polymorphism. In a double-blind process, 93 healthy males received a testosterone or placebo gel. In an fMRI session, participants performed a Taylor aggression paradigm in which they received provoking feedback and could afterwards decide how aggressively they would react. Testosterone and cortisol levels as well as subjective anger were assessed prior and after the task. Circulating testosterone levels were higher in carriers of the long compared to the short MAOA allele. An interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and testosterone administration was identified in the cuneus, where short allele carriers in the placebo group showed diminished activity in the decision period. Task-related anger was significantly higher in this group. Overall, a mesocorticolimbic network was implicated in processing of high versus low provoking feedback, and core hubs of the default mode network were implicated in the subsequent decision after high versus low provocation. Testosterone administration increased activation in this network. The data provides evidence for an interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and exogenous testosterone on anger and suggests that interactive effects on the brain signal could underlie differential emotional reactivity. The increased default mode activation in the testosterone group suggests an enhanced engagement of social cognition related regions possibly supporting responsivity towards social provocation. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Current status of the neurobiology of aggression and impulsivity'.",Does senescence promote fitness in Caenorhabditis elegans by causing death?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639341,Ageing research reviews,2019 06 10,"A widely appreciated conclusion from evolutionary theory is that senescence (aging) is of no adaptive value to the individual that it afflicts. Yet studies of Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are increasingly revealing the presence of processes which actively cause senescence and death, leading some biogerontologists to wonder about the established theory. Here we argue that programmed death that increases fitness could occur in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae, and that this is consistent with the classic evolutionary theory of aging. This is because of the special conditions under which these organisms have evolved, particularly the existence of clonal populations with limited dispersal and, in the case of C. elegans, the brevity of the reproductive period caused by protandrous hermaphroditism. Under these conditions, death-promoting mechanisms could promote worm fitness by enhancing inclusive fitness, or worm colony fitness through group selection. Such altruistic, adaptive death is not expected to evolve in organisms with outbred, dispersed populations (e.g. most vertebrate species). The plausibility of adaptive death in C. elegans is supported by computer modelling studies, and new knowledge about the ecology of this species. To support these arguments we also review the biology of adaptive death, and distinguish three forms: consumer sacrifice, biomass sacrifice and defensive sacrifice.","Effect of soluble cleavage products of important receptors/ligands on efferocytosis: Their role in inflammatory, autoimmune and cardiovascular disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639340,Ageing research reviews,2019 02 24,"Efferocytosis, the clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs), is a physiologic, multifaceted and dynamic process and a fundamental mechanism for the preservation of tissue homeostasis by avoiding unwanted inﬂammation and autoimmune responses through special phagocytic receptors. Defective efferocytosis is associated with several disease states, including cardiovascular disease and impaired immune surveillance, as occurs in cancer and autoimmune disease. A major cause of defective efferocytosis is non-functionality of surface receptors on either the phagocytic cells or the ACs, such as TAM family tyrosine kinase, which turns to a soluble form by cleavage/shedding or alternative splicing. Recently, soluble forms have featured prominently as potential biomarkers, indicative of prognosis and enabling targeted therapy using several commonly employed drugs and inhibitors, such as bleomycin, dexamethasone, statins and some matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors such as TAPI-1 and BB3103. Importantly, to design drug carriers with enhanced circulatory durability, the adaptation of soluble forms of physiological receptors/ligands has been purported. Research has shown that soluble forms are more effective than antibody forms in enabling targeted treatment of certain conditions, such as autoimmune diseases. In this review, we sought to summarize the current knowledge of these soluble products, how they are generated, their interactions, roles, and their potential use as biomarkers in prognosis and treatment related to inflammatory, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases.",Differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to dopaminergic neurons: A comparison between Wharton's Jelly and olfactory mucosa as sources of MSCs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639339,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,2019 02 17,"The generation of dopaminergic neurons from stem cells is a potential therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. The current study aims to investigate the potential of two different types of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human Wharton's jelly and nasal cavity for differentiation into dopaminergic neurons. The differentiation capacities of both cell types were evaluated using real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and HPLC. Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) are noted for their capability to differentiate into mesodermal and non-mesodermal cells, including neurons. However, it was demonstrated that having the same neuroectodermal origin as the nervous system, the olfactory ectomesenchymal stem cells (OE-MSCs) expressed the neural marker MAP2 as well as dopaminergic markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT) and PITX3 to a greater extent than the WJ-MSCs both at the level of mRNA and protein. Furthermore, quantitative flow cytometric evaluation of these markers at 12 days post-induction supported the above-mentioned results. Finally, the assessment of the functionality of differentiated cells and their ability to synthesize dopamine measured by HPLC revealed that the OE-MSC-derived dopaminergic cells released almost the same amount of dopamine as that secreted by WJ-MSC-derived cells. Thus it showed the difference in their functionality to be negligible. Overall, it may be concluded that higher proliferation and differentiation capacity of OE-MSCs, along with their easier harvestability and autologous transplantability compared with WJ-MSCs, makes them a better cell source for stem cell therapy of neurodegenerative disorders which are caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",Fitness for purpose and stability assessment of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in chicken tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639338,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 05 20,"The global popularity of chicken in human diets make it an obvious choice for enrichment with DHA and LC-PUFA.

The transition to short-chain fluorotelomer-based products as a cornerstone in replacement fluorochemistry has raised questions regarding potential human health risks associated with exposure to fluorotelomer-based substances and therefore, PFHxA. Here, we present a critical review of data relevant to such a risk assessment, including epidemiological studies and in vivo and in vitro toxicity studies that examined PFHxA acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity. Key findings from toxicokinetic and mode-of-action studies are also evaluated. Sufficient data exist to conclude that PFHxA is not carcinogenic, is not a selective reproductive or developmental toxicant, and does not disrupt endocrine activity. Collectively, effects caused by PFHxA exposure are largely limited to potential kidney effects, are mild and/or reversible, and occur at much higher doses than observed for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). A chronic human-health-based oral reference dose (RfD) for PFHxA of 0.25 mg/kg-day was calculated using benchmark dose modeling of renal papillary necrosis from a chronic rat bioassay. This RfD is four orders of magnitude greater than the chronic oral RfD calculated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for PFOA. The PFHxA RfD can be used to inform public health decisions related to PFHxA and fluorotelomer precursors for which PFHxA is a terminal degradant. These findings clearly demonstrate that PFHxA is less hazardous to human health than PFOA. The analyses presented support site-specific risk assessments as well as product stewardship initiatives for current and future short-chain fluorotelomer-based products.",Hip hemiarthroplasty for fractured neck of femur; a freedom of information study to assess national variation in implant selection and procurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639336,The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland,2019 01 14,"During 2016, according to the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD), over 65,000 patients suffered a hip fracture of which approximately half underwent hemiarthroplasty.

Of these 19, 14 unrelated subjects carried de novo heterozygous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or single-base insertions/deletions, 3 siblings harbored a heterozygous single-base insertion, and 2 subjects had a balanced translocation disrupting ZMIZ1 or involving a regulatory region of ZMIZ1.

Here, we investigated neuroprotective effects of EPPS in a mouse model of TBI. Mice subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) were treated with EPPS (120 mg/kg, orally) immediately after CCI and thereafter once daily for 3 or 7 days. We found that EPPS treatment profoundly reduced the accumulation of beta-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and Aβ over a widespread area detected in the pericontusional cortex, external capsule (EC), and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 at 3 days after TBI, accompanied by significant reduction in the TBI-induced diffuse axonal injury identified by increased immunoreactivity of SMI-32 (an indicator for axonal damage). We also found that EPPS treatment ameliorated the TBI-induced synaptic damage (as reflected by enhanced postsynaptic density 95, PSD-95), and impairment of autophagy flux in the neurons as reflected by reduced autophagy markers (LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and p62/SQSTM1) and increased lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D (CTSD) in neurons detected in the cortex and hippocampal CA1. As a result, EPPS treatment significantly reduced the TBI-induced early neuronal apoptosis (assessed by active caspase-3), and eventually prevented cortical tissue loss and hippocampal neuronal loss at 28 days after TBI. Additionally, we found that inhibition of autophagic flux with chloroquine by decreasing autophagosome-lysosome fusion significantly reversed the decreased expressions of neuronal p62/SQSTM1 and apoptosis by EPPS treatment. These data suggest that the neuroprotection by EPPS is, at least in part, related to improved autophagy flux. Finally, we found that EPPS treatment significantly improved the cortex-dependent motor and hippocampal-dependent cognitive deficits associated with TBI. Taken together, these findings support the further investigation of EPPS as a treatment for TBI.",Use of Historic Surgical Times to Predict Duration of Hysterectomy: Stratifying by Uterine Weight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639320,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 02 19,To describe the accuracy of historic averages for estimating operating room (OR) time for hysterectomy among women with small and large uteri.,Laparoscopic Removal of an Abdominal Pregnancy in the Pelvic Sidewall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639318,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 02 15,"To describe the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a patient with abdominal pregnancy and to illustrate the laparoscopic technique used to manage this patient.",Estimating uncertainty of target values for DEQAS serum materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639316,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 05 21,"The External Quality Assessment (EQA) scheme for vitamin D metabolites (DEQAS) distributes human serum samples to laboratories across the world to assess their performance in measuring serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], i.e. the sum of the concentrations of serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3. In 2013 DEQAS, in collaboration with the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP), became an accuracy-based EQAS when the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) began assigning 25(OH)D target values to DEQAS serum samples using their Joint Committee for Traceability in Laboratory Medicine (JCTLM) approved reference measurement procedure (RMP). Historically, NIST has performed 4 determinations of 25-OHD2 and 25-OHD3 on each sample and used the mean values to calculate a single 'target value' for Total 25-OHD against which performance was judged. By definition the target values cannot be exact and each is associated with a level of uncertainty. The total uncertainty (UNIST) has two components, one from the 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 measurements and the other associated with the calibration procedure. The total combined uncertainty is calculated by adding up these uncertainties. In future, uncertainties will be attached to the target value in each DEQAS serum sample, starting with the next distribution cycle in 2019. Confidence intervals obtained using these uncertainties will allow DEQAS participants to determine if their result agrees with the NIST assigned target value. Furthermore, if the value falls within the confidence interval the laboratory's assay would be regarded as traceable, i.e. standardized, to the NIST RMP.",MapMan4: A Refined Protein Classification and Annotation Framework Applicable to Multi-Omics Data Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639314,Molecular plant,2019 06 04,"Genome sequences from over 200 plant species have already been published, with this number expected to increase rapidly due to advances in sequencing technologies. Once a new genome has been assembled and the genes identified, the functional annotation of their putative translational products, proteins, using ontologies is of key importance as it places the sequencing data in a biological context. Furthermore, to keep pace with rapid production of genome sequences, this functional annotation process must be fully automated. Here we present a redesigned and significantly enhanced MapMan4 framework, together with a revised version of the associated online Mercator annotation tool. Compared with the original MapMan, the new ontology has been expanded almost threefold and enforces stricter assignment rules. This framework was then incorporated into Mercator4, which has been upgraded to reflect current knowledge across the land plant group, providing protein annotations for all embryophytes with a comparably high quality. The annotation process has been optimized to allow a plant genome to be annotated in a matter of minutes.

Ectopic expression of ABF3 or ABF4 in the vasculature, but not in the shoot apex, induced early flowering, whereas expression of ABF3 fused with the SRDX transcriptional repressor domain delayed flowering. We identified SOC1 as a direct downstream target of ABF3/4, and found that SOC1 mRNA levels were lower in abf3 abf4 than in wild-type plants. Moreover, induction of SOC1 by ABA was hampered in abf3 abf4 mutants. ABF3 and ABF4 were enriched at the -1028- to -657-bp region of the SOC1 promoter, which does not contain canonical ABF-ABRE-binding motifs but has the NF-Y binding element. We found that ABF3 and ABF4 interact with nuclear factor Y subunit C (NF-YC) 3/4/9 in vitro and in planta, and induction of SOC1 by ABA was hampered in nf-yc3 yc4 yc9 mutants. Interestingly, the abf3 abf4, nf-yc3 yc4 yc9, and soc1 mutants displayed a reduced drought-escape response. Taken together, these results suggest that ABF3 and ABF4 act with NF-YCs to promote flowering by inducing SOC1 transcription under drought conditions. This mechanism might contribute to adaptation by enabling plants to complete their life cycles under drought stress.",The DPP-4 inhibitor saxagliptin ameliorates ox-LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction by regulating AP-1 and NF-κB.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639312,European journal of pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of death for diabetic patients. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitor agents, known as gliptins, are a class of potent anti-glycemic agents developed to treat diabetes. Recently, gliptins have been shown to have independent cardiovascular benefits. In this study, we revealed the protective role of saxagliptin in vascular endothelial cells. Our data show that saxagliptin suppresses oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ox-LDL)-induced expression of its receptor lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1). Saxagliptin treatment reduces ox-LDL-induced production of cytokines and vascular adhesion molecules including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The presence of saxagliptin suppressed ox-LDL-induced adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells in co-culture adhesion experiments. Moreover, saxagliptin mitigated ox-LDL-induced production of reactive oxygen species and suppressed elevated expression of endothelial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunit (NOX-4) induced by ox-LDL. Mechanistically, saxagliptin exerted inhibitory effects against ox-LDL-induced phosphorylation of JNK kinase, expression of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) subunits c-Jun/c-fos, and AP-1 promoter activity. Saxagliptin also suppressed nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 accumulation and inhibited its promoter activity. Our data elaborate the molecular mechanism of saxagliptin-mediated endothelial protection and indicate that saxagliptin could have vascular benefits independent on its anti-glycemic function.","Quercetin inhibits cell viability, migration and invasion by regulating miR-16/HOXA10 axis in oral cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639311,European journal of pharmacology,2019 06 04,"Oral cancer is a common tumor malignancy with high mortality and poor prognosis worldwide. Quercetin is one of the major flavonoids present in our daily diet, which is reported to have anti-proliferation and apoptotic effects in varying cancers, including oral cancer. The aim of the present study is to find the mechanism that underlies the role of quercetin in oral cancer. In this study, cell viability, migration and invasion were measured by MTT, trans-well or western blot assays in oral cancer cells. The levels of microRNA-16 (miR-16) and homeobox A10 (HOXA10) were measured in oral cancer tissues and cells by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The interaction between miR-16 and HOXA10 was probed by luciferase activity, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and western blot. Results showed that quercetin suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion and abundances of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2 in oral cancer cells. miR-16 was down-regulated and reversed by addition of quercetin. Moreover, overexpression of miR-16 also impaired cell viability, migration, invasion and abundances of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in oral cancer cells. Besides, HOXA10 was targeted by miR-16 and its restoration abated miR-16-mediated role in oral cancer. In addition, knockdown of miR-16 reversed the effect of quercetin on progression of oral cancer. Collectively, quercetin inhibited cell viability, migration and invasion by regulating miR-16 and HOXA10 in oral cancer cells. This finding indicated that quercetin might be promising for treatment of oral cancer.",Increase in P-glycoprotein levels in the blood-brain barrier of partial portal vein ligation /chronic hyperammonemia rats is medicated by ammonia/reactive oxygen species/ERK1/2 activation: In vitro and in vivo studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639310,European journal of pharmacology,2019 02 05,"Liver failure altered P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function and expression at blood-brain barrier (BBB), partly owing to hyperammonemia. We aimed to examine the effects of partial portal vein ligation (PVL) plus chronic hyperammonemia (CHA) on P-gp function and expression at rat BBB. Experimental rats included sham-operation (SH), PVL, CHA and PVL+CHA. The PVL+CHA rats were developed by ammonia-containing diet for 2 weeks after operation. The brain-to-plasma concentration ratios (Kp) and apparent unidirectional influx constants (Kin) of rhodamine123 and sodium fluorescein were measured to assess function of P-gp and BBB integrity, respectively. Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3) were used to assess effects of ammonia on P-gp expression and function. It was found that PVL+CHA significantly decreased Kp and Kin of rhodamine123 without affecting brain distribution of fluorescein. The P-gp expressions in membrane protein in cortex and hippocampus were significantly increased in CHA and PVL +CHA rats, especially in PVL + CHA rats, while remarkably increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 was only found in PVL +CHA rats. Expressions of tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occluding in rat brain remained unchanged. In vitro data showed that NH4Cl increased reactive oxygen species, membrane expression and function of P-gp as well as phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in HCMEC/D3. The NH4Cl-induced alterations were reversed by reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine and ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. In conclusion, PVL+CHA increased function and membrane translocation of P-gp at rat BBB partly via ammonia. Reactive oxygen species/ERK1/2 pathway activation may be one of the reasons that ammonia upregulated P-gp expression and function at BBB."

As a specific form of mutualism, cross-feeding, where each of two mutualists produces a resource the other one needs, has been broadly studied. However, few theoretical studies have examined competition between cross-feeding mutualists and cheaters, who do not synthesize resources themselves. In this paper we study a model with two mutualists, a cheater, two micronutrients that are synthesized and exchanged by the mutualists, and one macronutrient that is only from external supply. We investigate the coexistence of the species in the framework of resource competition theory. In particular, we examine the effect of the mutualists' synthesis rates on their coexistence. In the absence of cheaters, multiple stable states occur if the synthesis rates are high, and higher synthesis rates increase the possibility that mutualists coexist. However, when the cheater is present, higher synthesis rates promote invasion by the cheater: If the cheater is superior on all three resources, it will either persist with at most one mutualist or even trigger extinction of all three species; if the cheater is only superior on the macronutrient, both mutualists may still coexist with the cheater. Our results provide a framework for further study on more complex mutualistic networks and real microbial communities.",Computational analysis in designing T cell epitopes enriched peptides of Ebola glycoprotein exhibiting strong binding interaction with HLA molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639295,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 02 04,"Computational approach has shown remarkable progress in epitope mapping, paving the way to finding vaccine candidates against different viruses. In the current study, prediction algorithms and molecular docking were applied to select peptides containing multiple Ebola glycoprotein epitopes showing interaction with different HLA molecules. Six peptides containing overlapping multiple HLA I (CD8+) and II (CD4+) restricted T cell epitopes were generated via consensus approach applying six different prediction tools. Four (P1, P2, P5 and P6) out of six peptides were selected after screening for absence of undesirable responses and presence of B cell epitopes. Peptide-HLA interaction analysis based on Autodock Vina and CABS-dock showed strong binding of these four peptides with eighteen HLA molecules. HLA coverage analysis from each prediction tool showed that these peptides were able to bind to diverse HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ and HLA-DR alleles. Population coverage analysis of peptides for expected immune response in four different continents (Africa, America, Asia and Europe) have shown average population coverage viz, P1 (95%), P2 (96%), P5 (91%) and P6 (94%). Further, these peptides were found to be nearly 100% conserved in Zaire Ebola virus while LANETTQALQLF (P5) was found to be 100% conserved in Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Tai Forest species. Therefore, these peptides capable of inducing T and B cell response and being presented by a wide range of HLA molecules have a strong potential to be part of diagnostic and preventive tools against Ebola virus disease.",Diet quality on days without breakfast or lunch - Identifying targets to improve adolescents' diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639294,Appetite,2019 03 17,"Dietary intake in adolescents does often not align with the recommended dietary guidelines. Excess intakes of added sugar and saturated fat, and insufficient vegetable intake are among the identified challenges, which can affect future health negatively. Identifying targets to improve dietary practices is therefore essential. The current study aimed to examine the prevalence of meal skipping and if meal skipping days had a different diet quality than other days, using data from a recent Norwegian dietary survey in adolescents (n = 689, age 12-14 years). Their dietary intake was recorded for four days, using a web-based record system. Differences between days with, and without, breakfast or lunch were explored using mixed effect models, adjusting for correlated data and covariates, including weekday-weekend effect. In total, 8% and 11% were days without breakfast and lunch, respectively. Days with breakfast or lunch were associated with higher intake of fibre, and higher odds of consuming fruits and berries, juice and smoothie, than days without breakfast or lunch. Weekdays with lunch were also associated with lower intakes of added sugar and total fat (in % of energy), and discretionary foods, compared to weekdays without lunch. Skipping breakfast and lunch was associated with reduced diet quality in adolescents. Targeting these meals, and in particular school lunch, is a potential way forward to improve adolescents' dietary intake.","The relationship between food parenting practices, parental diet and their adolescents' diet.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639293,Appetite,2019 03 17,"To determine whether parents' and adolescents' dietary behaviors for fruits and vegetables [FV], junk foods, and sugar sweetened beverages [SSBs] align with parents' food parenting practices for these behaviors.",Local cortical circuit correlates of altered EEG in the mouse model of Fragile X syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639292,Neurobiology of disease,2019 05 16,"Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in Fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients have revealed enhanced sensory responses, enhanced resting ""gamma frequency"" (30-100 Hz) activity, and a decreased ability for sensory stimuli to modulate cortical activity at gamma frequencies. Similar changes are observed in the FXS model mouse - the Fmr1 knockout. These alterations may become effective biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of FXS. Therefore, it is critical to better understand what circuit properties underlie these changes. We employed Channelrhodopsin2 to optically activate local circuits in the auditory cortical region in brain slices to examine how changes in local circuit function may be related to EEG changes. We focused on layers 2/3 and 5 (L2/3 and L5). In Fmr1 knockout mice, light-driven excitation of L2/3 revealed hyperexcitability and increased gamma frequency power in both local L2/3 and L5 circuits. Moreover, there is increased synchrony in the gamma frequency band between L2/3 and L5. Hyperexcitability and increased gamma power were not observed in L5 with L5 light-driven excitation, indicating that these changes were layer-specific. A component of L2/3 network hyperexcitability is independent of ionotropic receptor mediated synaptic transmission and may be mediated by increased intrinsic excitability of L2/3 neurons. Finally, lovastatin, a candidate therapeutic compound for FXS that targets ERK signaling did not normalize changes in gamma activity. In conclusion, hyperactivity and increased gamma activity in local neocortical circuits, together with increased gamma synchrony between circuits, provide a putative substrate for EEG alterations observed in both FXS patients and the FXS mouse model.",Integrative analysis of blood metabolomics and PET brain neuroimaging data for Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639291,Neurobiology of disease,2019 05 16,The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) often remains a clinical challenge.

Although mouse models are of particular importance, neither the basic mechanism of KYNA production and release nor the relevance of KAT-2 in the mouse brain has yet been clarified. Using acute mouse brain slice preparations, we investigated the basal and L-kynurenine (L-KYN) induced KYNA production and distribution between the extracellular and intracellular compartments. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of specific KAT-2 inhibition with the irreversible inhibitor PF-04859989. To ascertain that the observed KYNA release is not a simple consequence of general cell degradation, we examined the structural and functional integrity of the brain tissue with biochemical, histological and electrophysiological tools. We did not find relevant change in the viability of the brain tissue after several hours incubation time. HPLC measurements proved that mouse brain slices intensively produce and liberate KYNA to the extracellular compartment, while only a small proportion retained in the tissue both in the basal and L-KYN supplemented state. Finally, specific KAT-2 inhibition significantly reduced the extracellular KYNA content. Taken together, these results provide important data about KYNA production and release, and in vitro evidence for the first time of the function of KAT-2 in the adult mouse brain. Our study extends investigations of KAT-2 manipulation to mice in a bid to fully understand the function; the final, future aim is to assign therapeutical kynurenergic manipulation strategies to humans.",Maternal Factors and Sexual Orientation-Related Disparities in Cervical Cancer Prevention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639277,Women's health issues : official publication of the Jacobs Institute of Women's Health,2019 05 24,Our objective was to explore how mothers' attitudes and relationships with their daughters may impact the cervical cancer prevention behaviors of daughters with diverse sexual orientations.,"Pulmonary exposure to silver nanoparticles impairs cardiovascular homeostasis: Effects of coating, dose and time.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639276,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 02 24,"Pulmonary exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) revealed the potential of nanoparticles to cause pulmonary toxicity, cross the alveolar-capillary barrier, and distribute to remote organs. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of AgNPs on the cardiovascular system remains unclear. Hence, we investigated the cardiovascular mechanisms of pulmonary exposure to AgNPs (10 nm) with varying coatings [polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citrate (CT)], concentrations (0.05, 0.5 and 5 mg/kg body weight), and time points (1 and 7 days) in BALB/C mice. Silver ions (Ag+) were used as ionic control. Exposure to AgNPs induced lung inflammation. In heart, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6, total antioxidants, reduced glutathione and 8-isoprostane significantly increased for both AgNPs. Moreover, AgNPs caused oxidative DNA damage and apoptosis in the heart. The plasma concentration of fibrinogen, plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly increased for both coating AgNPs. Likewise, the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time were significantly decreased. Additionally, the PVP- and CT- AgNPs induced a significant dose-dependent increase in thrombotic occlusion time in cerebral microvessels at both time points. In vitro study on mice whole blood exhibited significant platelet aggregation for both particle types. Compared with AgNPs, Ag+ increased thrombogenicity and markers of oxidative stress, but did not induce either DNA damage or apoptosis in the heart. In conclusion, pulmonary exposure to AgNPs caused cardiac oxidative stress, DNA damage and apoptosis, alteration of coagulation markers and thrombosis. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the cardiovascular pathophysiological effects of lung exposure to AgNPs.",Characterization of the modes of action and dose-response relationship for thiocyanate on the thyroid hormone levels in rats using a computational approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639275,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 01 28,"Current practices for evaluating the cumulative risk of thyroid-active chemical mixtures (perchlorate, thiocyanate, nitrate) focus on the inhibition of thyroidal iodide uptake via the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) as the mode of action for potency equivalence calculations. However, unlike perchlorate, thiocyanate presents additional modes of action within the thyroid that could contribute to the overall thyroid perturbation. We tested the hypothesis of whether assuming a single mode of action of thyroidal iodide uptake inhibition is sufficient for describing the observed dose-response relationship for thiocyanate and its effects on serum thyroxine levels. An interaction model was developed by linking a biologically based dose-response model for iodide and thyroid hormones to a thiocyanate physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. Each model, adapted from the literature, was restructured and recalibrated in a Bayesian framework for the current mode of actions study. For a chronic exposure scenario, NIS inhibition alone was found not to be sufficient to describe the dose-response relationship for thiocyanate. Inclusion of additional modes of action involving iodide flux across the thyroid membrane and inhibition of iodide organification via thyroid peroxidase showed only moderate improvements in capturing the dose-response at environmental thiocyanate doses of exposure and failed to capture trends at very high doses. Our findings emphasize the need for more mechanistic data for chronic exposure scenarios to characterize better the overall dose-response relationship for thiocyanate. Risk assessment approaches for thyroid-active chemical mixtures that rely on NIS inhibition as the single mode of action may over-predict the contribution of thiocyanate to thyroid disruption.",Does Unilateral Lower Limb Amputation Influence Ankle Joint Torque in the Intact Leg?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639274,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2019 03 10,To investigate ankle torque and steadiness in the intact leg of transtibial and transfemoral unilateral amputees.,The Active Ingredient of Cognitive Restoration: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial of Sequential Combination of Aerobic Exercise and Computer-Based Cognitive Training in Stroke Survivors With Cognitive Decline.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639273,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2019 04 28,To investigate the efficacy of a sequential combination of aerobic exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function and other health-related outcomes in stroke survivors with cognitive decline.,Reproducibility of the Kids-BESTest and the Kids-Mini-BESTest for Children With Cerebral Palsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639271,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2019 03 26,"To evaluate the reproducibility, including reliability and agreement, of the Kids Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Kids-BESTest) and the short form of Kids-BESTest (Kids-Mini-BESTest) for measuring postural control in school-aged children with cerebral palsy.",Clinical Features of Disorders of Consciousness in Young Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639270,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,2019 03 26,"To investigate behavioral and demographic features of levels of consciousness in young children with brain injury, including the classifications of consciousness: conscious state (CS), minimally conscious state (MCS), and vegetative state (VS), and to investigate the course of recovery in children with disorders of consciousness (DOC).",miR-145-5p is associated with smoke-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease via targeting KLF5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639269,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 02 15,"Increasing evidence illustrate that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is mainly resulted from cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. However, the role of miR-145-5p in CS-mediated COPD remains largely unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the expression level of miR-145-5p in 31 human lung tissues samples, and to explore its regulatory role in the apoptosis and inflammation of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) following CS extract (CSE) exposure. We found that miR-145-5p was significantly down-regulated in lung tissues from smokers without or with COPD compared to non-smokers. Functional assays showed that miR-145-5p overexpression remarkably alleviated CSE-induced apoptosis and inflammation response by regulating p53-mediated apoptotic signaling and pre-inflammatory factors such as necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL)-6, IL-8 in HBECs, whereas, down-regulation of miR-145-5p showed opposite effects. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays verified that Kruppel-like 5 (KLF5) was a direct target of miR-145-5p. Western blot assay also confirmed that KLF5 was up-regulated in COPD tissues and was negatively associated with miR-145-5p expression. Restoration of miR-145-5p expression significantly abrogated the suppressive effect of miR-145-5p on CSE-stimulated apoptosis and inflammation. In addition, the CSE-induced NF-κB signaling activation was suppressed by miR-145-5p overexpression. Therefore, our data suggested that miR-145-5p conferred protection against CSE-induced airway epithelial cell apoptosis and inflammation partially via targeting KLF5, which might be a potential therapeutic biomarker in COPD treatment.",Chronic intake of moderate fat-enriched diet induces fatty liver and low-grade inflammation without obesity in rabbits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639268,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 02 15,"Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the cause of chronic liver disease. Even though NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, there is a proportion of patients who develop this condition in the absence of obesity and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated early events in the pathogenesis of non-obese NAFLD, analyzing the impact of the chronic intake of a moderate fat-enriched diet on hepatic lipid accumulation and their relationship with inflammation. Rabbits fed with a moderate Fatty-Acid- Enriched Diet 3% palmitic acid (FAED), were evaluated for body weight, biochemical parameters, and liver function. Liver samples were analyzed by histology and RT-qPCR to measure lipid accumulation, the expression of inflammation-related genes IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, COX-2, TNF-α, and TLR-4. Chronic consumption by 6-months of FAED did not generate metabolic changes, but it induced fatty liver. We also observed the development of low-grade inflammation characterized by the up regulation of TNF-α, IL-13 and IL-18. The consumption by 12-months of FAED caused the overexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, COX-2, and TLR-4. We show that hepatic steatosis is an early consequence of fat-enriched diets, and that it is accompanied by an immune response that exerts protective effects that prevent the development of metabolic disorders, such as overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome. However, the excessive intake of fatty acids renders these mechanisms less efficient for delaying the start of metabolic alterations. Rabbits fed with FAED can be used as a model of NAFLD in non-obese and obese groups, especially at early stages of the disease."

Further, complexities associated with developing effective drug nanocarriers have led to conflicting views of its safety, permeation of biological barriers and cellular uptake. Here, in this review, we emphasize the effect of physicochemical properties of nanocarriers on their interactions with the biological milieu. The review will discuss in depth, how modulating the physicochemical properties would influence a drug nanocarrier's behavior in vivo and the mechanisms underlying these effects. The goal of this review is to summarize the design considerations based on these properties and to provide a conceptual template for achieving improved therapeutic efficacy with enhanced patient compliance.","Iron oxide nanoparticles: Diagnostic, therapeutic and theranostic applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639256,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2019 04 04,"Many different iron oxide nanoparticles have been evaluated over the years, for a wide variety of biomedical applications. We here summarize the synthesis, surface functionalization and characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles, as well as their (pre-) clinical use in diagnostic, therapeutic and theranostic settings. Diagnostic applications include liver, lymph node, inflammation and vascular imaging, employing mostly magnetic resonance imaging but recently also magnetic particle imaging. Therapeutic applications encompass iron supplementation in anemia and advanced cancer treatments, such as modulation of macrophage polarization, magnetic fluid hyperthermia and magnetic drug targeting. Because of their properties, iron oxide nanoparticles are particularly useful for theranostic purposes. Examples of such setups, in which diagnosis and therapy are intimately combined and in which iron oxide nanoparticles are used, are image-guided drug delivery, image-guided and microbubble-mediated opening of the blood-brain barrier, and theranostic tissue engineering. Together, these directions highlight the versatility and the broad applicability of iron oxide nanoparticles, and indicate the integration in future medical practice of multiple iron oxide nanoparticle-based materials.",Evolving Radiotherapy Techniques in Paediatric Oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639254,Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),2019 02 09,"Childhood cancer is rare and survival of childhood cancer has increased up to 80% at 5 years after diagnosis. Radiotherapy is an important element of the multimodal treatment concept. However, due to growing tissue, children are particularly sensitive to radiation-related side-effects and the induction of secondary malignancies. However, radiotherapy techniques have continuously progressed. In addition, modern treatment concepts have been improved in order to minimise long-term effects. Today, radiotherapy is used for various tumour types in childhood, such as sarcomas and tumours of the central nervous system.","Effects of pre- or post-exercise whey protein supplementation on body fat and metabolic and inflammatory profile in pre-conditioned older women: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639252,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2019 02 24,"Protein supplementation and resistance training (RT) are interventions that may counteract decline in muscle mass and increase in fat mass, thus reducing the risk of developing chronic diseases during the aging process.

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 04 01,"This study evaluated the potential toxic effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver nanowires (AgNWs) on saltwater microcrustacean Artemia salina nauplii under ISO TS 20787 guideline. To investigate the acute toxicity of these nanomaterials, the nauplii were exposed to different concentrations of 0 (control), 0.39, 1.56, 6.25, 25 and 100 mg/L AgNPs and concentrations of 0 (control), 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50 and 100 mg/L AgNWs for 72 h. Immobilization rate of A. salina exposed to both AgNPs and AgNWs for 72 h increased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.05). The 72 h EC10 and EC50 were found to be 1.48 ± 0.6 and 10.70 ± 1.3 mg/L for AgNPs, respectively, and 0.03 ± 0.02 and 0.43 ± 0.04 mg/L for AgNWs, respectively. Based on the EC10 and EC50 values, the toxicity of AgNWs was significantly higher than AgNPs (P < 0.05). Oxidative stress resulted from 48 h exposure to both AgNPs and AgNWs in A. salina was assessed by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The results revealed that both AgNPs and AgNWs could induce ROS production. The SOD activity decreased significantly with the increase of exposure concentration (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the present results show that both nanomaterials have toxic effects on A. salina nauplii and thus, more effort should be made to prevent their release into saltwater ecosystems and trophic transfer in the aquatic food chain.",A low resting metabolic rate in late childhood is associated with weight gain in adolescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639247,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2019 03 10,Lower total energy expenditure (TEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) are associated with greater weight gain in Native American adults.

Termination involves RNA polymerase II CTD phosphorylation, but a systematic analysis of the contribution of individual residues would improve our understanding of the role of the CTD in this process. Here we investigated the effect of mutating phosphorylation sites in the CTD on termination. We observed widespread termination defects at protein-coding genes in mutants for Ser2 or Thr4 but rare defects in Tyr1 mutants for this genes class. Instead, mutating Tyr1 led to widespread termination defects at non-coding genes terminating via NNS. Finally, we showed that Tyr1 is important for pausing in the 5' end of genes and that slowing down transcription suppresses termination defects. Our work highlights the importance of Tyr1-mediated pausing in NNS-dependent termination."

Mediation analysis is a statistical method commonly used to examine the interrelations among independent, mediating, and dependent variables to obtain the direct and indirect effects of an independent variable on a continuous dependent variable. However, mediation analysis may also be used with binary outcomes, such as a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Study 1 demonstrated methods of mediation analysis with binary outcomes by examining the direct and indirect effects of pro-alcohol social influences on an AUD, as a function of: (a) the distribution of the independent variable (binary vs. continuous), (b) the frequency of the outcome (non-rare vs. rare), and (c) the effect metric (probability vs. odds ratio). Study 2 was a Monte Carlo (simulation) study of bias in the indirect effects based on estimates from the first study.

As part of the Polycomb repression machinery, BAP1 is activated by the deubiquitinase adaptor domain of ASXL1 mediating gene repression by cleaving ubiquitin (Ub) from histone H2A in nucleosomes. The molecular mechanism of BAP1 activation by ASXL1 remains elusive, as no structures are available for either BAP1 or ASXL1. Here, we present the crystal structure of the BAP1 ortholog from Drosophila melanogaster, named Calypso, bound to its activator, ASX, homolog of ASXL1. Based on comparative structural and functional analysis, we propose a model for Ub binding by Calypso/ASX, uncover decisive structural elements responsible for ASX-mediated Calypso activation, and characterize the interaction with ubiquitinated nucleosomes. Our results give molecular insight into Calypso function and its regulation by ASX and provide the opportunity for the rational design of mechanism-based therapeutics to treat human BAP1/ASXL1-related tumors.","Structure of the UHRF1 Tandem Tudor Domain Bound to a Methylated Non-histone Protein, LIG1, Reveals Rules for Binding and Regulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639225,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 03 06,"The protein UHRF1 is crucial for DNA methylation maintenance. The tandem Tudor domain (TTD) of UHRF1 binds histone H3K9me2/3 with micromolar affinity, as well as unmethylated linker regions within UHRF1 itself, causing auto-inhibition. Recently, we showed that a methylated histone-like region of DNA ligase 1 (LIG1K126me2/me3) binds the UHRF1 TTD with nanomolar affinity, permitting UHRF1 recruitment to chromatin. Here we report the crystal structure of the UHRF1 TTD bound to a LIG1K126me3 peptide. The data explain the basis for the high TTD-binding affinity of LIG1K126me3 and reveal that the interaction may be regulated by phosphorylation. Binding of LIG1K126me3 switches the overall structure of UHRF1 from a closed to a flexible conformation, suggesting that auto-inhibition is relieved.

Subsequently, the plate was positioned on a white illuminating screen of an iPad placed in a dark box in order to capture a top-view image using an iPhone 5s back camera. The intensity of yellow colour was converted to Red-Green-Blue pixels using a free mobile application. Under the optimal conditions for the reaction and photography, the intensity of blue colour, which was logarithmically transformed, showed an excellent linearity over the drug concentration range of 5-40 µg/mL. The assay was validated and successfully applied to the assay of drug content and the determination of drug amount released in the dissolution test in the capsule dosage forms. Apart from that, a smartphone was employed for the colour measurement as an alternative to a spectrophotometer in the currently used method for the quantitation of free sulfhydryl groups in polymers. Using cysteine-conjugated chitosan as a sample and l-cysteine as a standard, the smartphone method gave the results in agreement with those obtained from the absorbance measurement on a microplate reader. In conclusion, smartphone-based colourimetry has been proved to be a reliable, fast, simple and affordable alternative means for the analysis of d-penicillamine and cysteine-conjugated polymer and can be potentially applied to other thiol-containing drugs and excipients.",Preparation of pH-responsive DOX-loaded chitosan nanoparticles using supercritical assisted atomization with an enhanced mixer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639222,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 13,"Chemotherapeutics are used extensively in cancer and encapsulating the drug in nanoparticles is an effective method to enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce side effect. In this work, DOX-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using supercritical fluid assisted atomization introduced by a hydrodynamic cavitation mixer (SAA-HCM) from aqueous solution. The influences of solution concentration, CO2/solution ratio, mixer pressure, chitosan/DOX ratio and chitosan molecular weight on particle morphologies and sizes were investigated in detail. Well defined spherical nanoparticles with average diameter ranging from 120 nm to 250 nm were obtained, and the loading efficiency was up to 90%. FT-IR result showed that the structure of DOX was not changed after the SAA-HCM process. Zeta potential of the nanoparticles was about +50 mV. The in vitro drug release behavior conducted in the media with pH of 4.5, 6.5 and 7.4 respectively showed strongly pH responsive. In vitro cytotoxicity profiles revealed that the activity of DOX was well maintained after loaded into chitosan nanoparticles.

Frequently, the failure of wound healing is due to ischemic conditions prevailing at the site of damaged tissue. Restoration of lost vasculature at the ischemic site can be achieved by supplementing proangiogenic stimuli through an engineered scaffold mimicking dermal extracellular matrix. Towards this objective, we have developed an electrospun scaffold loaded with the pro-angiogenic molecule resveratrol. The physical and chemical changes in the polymeric scaffold before and after loading of resveratrol were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A sustained release of resveratrol from the scaffold was elucidated by UV-spectrophotometer analysis. The enhancement in cell-matrix interaction was studied using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) seeded on the scaffolds. The biocompatibility analysis of resveratrol loaded scaffolds was evaluated through a subcutaneous implantation study in mice. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol loaded scaffolds to accelerate tissue repair was analyzed in a full-thickness ischemic wound model in mice. Wound closure and H&E staining analysis showed rapid closure of ischemic wound area and re-epithelialization in resveratrol loaded scaffold treated groups compared to collagen and negative control groups. The immunostaining analysis further revealed the activation of thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mediated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in resveratrol loaded scaffold treated group. The expression of Bcl-2 in healing wound edges post-treatment with resveratrol loaded scaffold confirmed the anti-apoptotic effect mediated by resveratrol. From this study, we explored a synergistic effect mediated by resveratrol and fibrous scaffolds to aid the ischemic wound healing process through effective vascularization."

Although there is much evidence supporting the prion-like propagation and amplification of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in vitro and in rodent models, whether this scenario occurs in the human brain remains to be substantiated. Here we reconstructed in microfluidic devices corticocortical neuronal networks using human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a healthy donor. We provide unique experimental evidence that different strains of human α-Syn disseminate in ""wild-type"" human neuronal networks in a prion-like manner. We show that two distinct α-Syn strains we named fibrils and ribbons are transported, traffic between neurons, and trigger to different extents, in a dose- and structure-dependent manner, the progressive accumulation of PD-like pathological hallmarks.

Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes and neurons from familial mutant LRRK2 G2019S PD patients and healthy individuals. Upon co-culture on top of PD astrocytes, control vmDAns displayed morphological signs of neurodegeneration and abnormal, astrocyte-derived α-synuclein accumulation. Conversely, control astrocytes partially prevented the appearance of disease-related phenotypes in PD vmDAns. We additionally identified dysfunctional chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), impaired macroautophagy, and progressive α-synuclein accumulation in PD astrocytes. Finally, chemical enhancement of CMA protected PD astrocytes and vmDAns via the clearance of α-synuclein accumulation.

Samples of four beef m. Longissimus dorsi muscle were stored in vacuum at 4 °C for 0, 7 or 14 days and then ultrasonicated (40 kHz, 11 W/cm2) for 60 min. Beef stored for 7 d prior to ultrasonication displayed increased pH and luminosity, reduced redness and saturation value, higher hue angle, and variable changes in water holding capacity. Shear force of sonicated meat was lower than that of control samples at all storage times. HIU also increased the tenderness and fragmentation of meat (P < 0.05) measured by texture profile analysis. The microstructure of sonicated meat showed a visible reduction in the size of fascicles, greater interfibrillary spaces, and thinner endomysium. These effects were enhanced with the storage of meat previous to HIU treatment. Meat stored for 14 d and then treated with ultrasound was perceived to have a more intense fresh meat smell and oily flavor (P < 0.05). However, it was also perceived to be a paler grayish brown color compared to control samples stored for the same duration. Ultrasonicated meat also presented a greater intensity of metallic taste (P < 0.05) and a more tender and moist texture (P < 0.05). Overall, application of HIU of meat after meat was stored affects textural and microstructural properties and accelerates aging without negative impacts on other technological and sensory attributes.

All but four schools had at least one food- or beverage-related advertisement within 400 m (median: 18, range: 0-96) and approximately 90% of food or beverage advertisements were for items not recommended for frequent consumption by provincial school food guidelines. After controlling for commercial density, secondary schools were associated with more outdoor food and beverage advertisements overall in comparison with elementary schools. The presence of an additional limited-service food outlet within 400 m was associated with a 7% increase in the number of overall advertisements (p < 0.001) while an additional grocery store was associated with fewer advertisements (IRR: 0.69, p < 0.001), controlling for commercial density. Findings suggest the need to consider the informational food environment as part of broader assessments of the school and retail food environments.",Impacts of migration on health and well-being in later life in China: Evidence from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639200,Health & place,2019 01 14,"Unprecedented internal migration to urban areas has happened in China over the last few decades. While, we know that migration has a bidirectional relationship with health, this relationship has only been studied to a limited extent in China. In particular, the exiting literature has neglected the effects of migration on health and well-being in later life, instead focusing on the relationship between these outcomes over the short term, and also have only focused on temporary rural-to-urban migrants with a rural hukou rather than the broader range of internal migration flows. The hukou system, also known as the Chinese household system, an institutional feature with the power to restrict population mobility and access to local welfare resources. Using an inter-disciplinary approach, drawing on literature from economics, epidemiology and sociology, this paper conceptualises and examines the association between different forms of internal migration and their relationship with later-life health and well-being in China. It then attempts to draw conclusions on likely mechanisms through which migration affects health and well-being, including taking account of the selective nature of migration. To do this, we use the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative and multi-disciplinary dataset that examines the circumstances of the Chinese population aged over 45 years old. The results show that there are strong associations between migration status and later life health and well-being in China, with migrants to or within urban areas report the greatest health. Even after controlling for the selective nature of migration and other post-migration factors, there is still an unexplained, positive and statistically significant association between temporary rural-to-urban migration and depression scores. In addition, there are no differences between rural-to-rural migrants and rural non-migrants across all models. In terms of relevant mechanisms, selection of migrants seems to be particularly important in explaining the health and mental health differences between non-migrants and migrants to or within urban areas. Current socioeconomic circumstances and post-migration adaptation also explain some health differences between migrant groups and non-migrants."

Effects of miniaturization and the phylogenetic and functional background are discussed. Apomorphies shared with Hydraenidae are the large metascutal shield, the fringe of setae along the posterior edge of the wings, and the fusion of the mesoventrite with the mesanepisternum. Autapomorphies of Ptiliidae are the highly modified feather-like wings, the strongly elongated alacristae, the loss of the mesotrochantin, the enlarged metathoracic pleural wing joint, and the simplification of the direct flight musculature. Most phylogenetically relevant features are linked with miniaturization, especially the modifications of the wings and skeleton, for instance the reduced wing membrane or the simplified metanotum without distinct notal wing processes. Ptiliids show flight characteristics that distinctly differ from what is known in other insects, such as an unusually high amplitude of beats of the elytra, and a unique trajectory of wing return movements, as well as the presence of upper and lower claps. A comparison of cross-sections of ptiliid principal flight muscles with those of larger staphyliniform beetles suggests that muscles of the tiniest beetles are relatively smaller. This may reflect the higher aerodynamic efficiency of ptiliid feather wings compared to the common membranous wings found in other groups.",Eternal sunshine of the neuromodulated mind: Altering fear memories through neuromodulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639183,Experimental neurology,2019 02 17,"Anxiety disorders pose one of the greatest threats to mental health. Modern treatment methods exist but are hindered by relapse, toxicity, and low efficacy. The use of neuromodulation to treat anxiety disorders has shown promising results, yet its underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this review, we make the case for further development of neuromodulation techniques to alter fear memories, with particular regard to future clinical applications in treating anxiety disorders. We start by briefly summarizing the neural circuitry of fear while identifying the pros and cons of possible neuromodulation targets. We then highlight recent advances in neuromodulation techniques that have been used to alter fear memories. Next, we apply a novel network-based approach to elucidate possible mechanisms of neuromodulation which may disrupt the consolidation of fear memory. Finally, we emphasize the need for more systematic neuromodulation studies on animal models and the developing brain. Overall, we aim to provide an integrated framework for future action, identifying key research priorities that must be addressed before effective neuromodulation-based treatments can be developed for practical use.",Neomycin-dependent hammerhead ribozymes for the direct control of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639182,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2019 01 15,Hammerhead ribozyme-based RNA switches have been proven to be powerful tools for conditional gene regulation in various organisms. We present neomycin-dependent hammerhead ribozymes (HHR) that influence gene expression in a ligand- and dose-dependent manner in S. cerevisiae. We utilized a novel design of fusing the aptamer domain to the HHR enabling for the first time the identification of genetic ON- and OFF-switches within the same library. For this purpose a neomycin aptamer was fused to stem 1 of a type 3 hammerhead ribozyme via an addressable three-way junction that shows high flexibility at the connection site. An in vivo screening approach identified sequences that allow to induce or repress gene expression 2- to 3-fold in response to neomycin addition. The ribozyme switches operate at neomycin concentrations that show no toxic effect on cell growth and pose powerful genetic tools to study and modulate cellular function in yeast.,Longitudinal changes in cocaine intake and cognition are linked to cortical thickness adaptations in cocaine users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639181,NeuroImage.

Because neuroimmune signaling is altered by alcohol, immune cells are a logical, accessible choice to study and may provide biomarkers. RNAseq was used to study the effects of 48-h exposure to ethanol on lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 20 alcoholic subjects and 20 control subjects. Ethanol exposure resulted in differential expression of 4456 of the 12,503 genes detectably expressed in the LCLs (FDR [false discovery rate] ≤ 0.05); 52% of these showed increased expression. Cells from alcoholic subjects and control subjects responded similarly. The genes whose expression changed fell into many pathways: NFκB, neuroinflammation, IL6, IL2, IL8, and dendritic cell maturation pathways were activated, consistent with increased signaling by NFκB, TNF, IL1, IL4, IL18, TLR4, and LPS. Signaling by Interferons A and B decreased, as did EIF2 signaling, phospholipase C signaling, and glycolysis. Baseline gene expression patterns were similar in LCLs from alcoholic subjects and control subjects. At relaxed stringency (p < 0.05), 465 genes differed, 230 of which were also affected by ethanol. There was a suggestion of compensation because baseline differences (no ethanol) were in the opposite direction of differences due to ethanol exposure in 78% of these genes. Pathways with IL8, phospholipase C, and α-adrenergic signaling were significant. The pattern of expression was consistent with increased signaling by several cytokines, including interferons, TLR2, and TLR3 in alcoholics. Expression of genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, including the rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR, was lower in alcoholic subjects. LCLs show many effects of ethanol exposure, some of which might provide biomarkers for alcohol use disorders. Identifying genes and pathways altered by ethanol can aid in interpreting which genes within loci identified by GWAS might play functional roles.","""They were the ones that saw me and listened.""

Activation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) signaling has also been demonstrated to inhibit cerebral I/R injury. We hypothesize that MaR1 may protect against cerebral I/R injury by activating SIRT1 signaling. The present study investigated the protective effect of MaR1 treatment on cerebral I/R injury and elucidated the potential mechanisms. Mice were exposed to the treatment in the presence or absence of MaR1 or the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 and then subjected to the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) operation. MaR1 conferred a brain-protective effect by up-regulating SIRT1 and Bcl2 expression, down-regulating acetylated neuclear factor kappaB (AC-NF-κB) and Bax expression, reducing pro-inflammatory factor levels (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α), increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, and diminishing neuronal degeneration, the infarct size and the neurological defects of cerebral I/R. These protective effects were partially blocked by the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527, indicating that SIRT1 signaling might be specifically involved in the protection provided by MaR1 against cerebral I/R injury. In summary, our results demonstrate that MaR1 treatment attenuates cerebral I/R injury by reducing inflammatory responses and mitochondrial damage via activation of SIRT1 signaling.",Discovery of Novel Androgen Receptor Ligands by Structure-based Virtual Screening and Bioassays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639122,"Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",2019 05 01,"Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of many severe diseases such as prostate cancer, muscle atrophy, and osteoporosis. Binding of ligands to AR triggers the conformational changes in AR that may affect the recruitment of coactivators and downstream response of AR signaling pathway. Therefore, AR ligands have great potential to treat these diseases. In this study, we searched for novel AR ligands by performing a docking-based virtual screening (VS) on the basis of the crystal structure of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) in complex with its agonist. A total of 58 structurally diverse compounds were selected and subjected to LBD affinity assay, with five of them (HBP1-3, HBP1-17, HBP1-38, HBP1-51, and HBP1-58) exhibiting strong binding to AR-LBD. The IC50 values of HBP1-51 and HBP1-58 are 3.96 µM and 4.92 µM, respectively, which are even lower than that of enzalutamide (Enz, IC50 = 13.87 µM), a marketed second-generation AR antagonist. Further bioactivity assays suggest that HBP1-51 is an AR agonist, whereas HBP1-58 is an AR antagonist. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and principal components analysis (PCA) were carried out to reveal the binding principle of the newly-identified AR ligands toward AR. Our modeling results indicate that the conformational changes of helix 12 induced by the bindings of antagonist and agonist are visibly different. In summary, the current study provides a highly efficient way to discover novel AR ligands, which could serve as the starting point for development of new therapeutics for AR-related diseases.",Engineering a New Chloroplastic Photorespiratory Bypass to Increase Photosynthetic Efficiency and Productivity in Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639120,Molecular plant,2019 06 10,"Over the past few years, three photorespiratory bypasses have been introduced into plants, two of which led to observable increases in photosynthesis and biomass yield. However, most of the experiments were carried out using Arabidopsis under controlled environmental conditions, and the increases were only observed under low-light and short-day conditions. In this study, we designed a new photorespiratory bypass (called GOC bypass), characterized by no reducing equivalents being produced during a complete oxidation of glycolate into CO2 catalyzed by three rice-self-originating enzymes, i.e., glycolate oxidase, oxalate oxidase, and catalase. We successfully established this bypass in rice chloroplasts using a multi-gene assembly and transformation system. Transgenic rice plants carrying GOC bypass (GOC plants) showed significant increases in photosynthesis efficiency, biomass yield, and nitrogen content, as well as several other CO2-enriched phenotypes under both greenhouse and field conditions. Grain yield of GOC plants varied depending on seeding season and was increased significantly in the spring. We further demonstrated that GOC plants had significant advantages under high-light conditions and that the improvements in GOC plants resulted primarily from a photosynthetic CO2-concentrating effect rather than from improved energy balance. Taken together, our results reveal that engineering a newly designed chloroplastic photorespiratory bypass could increase photosynthetic efficiency and yield of rice plants grown in field conditions, particularly under high light."

In proliferating cells, cell size is regulated by coordinating growth and division through sizer, adder, or timer mechanisms or through some combination [1, 2]. Currently, the best-characterized example of sizer behavior is in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which enters mitosis at a minimal cell size threshold. The peripheral membrane kinase Cdr2 localizes in clusters (nodes) on the medial plasma membrane and promotes mitotic entry [3]. Here, we show that the Cdr2 nodal density, which scales with cell size, is used by the cell to sense and control its size. By analyzing cells of different widths, we first show that cdr2+ cells divide at a fixed cell surface area. However, division in the cdr2Δ mutant is more closely specified by cell volume, suggesting that Cdr2 is essential for area sensing and supporting the existence of a Cdr2-independent secondary sizer mechanism more closely based on volume. To investigate how Cdr2 nodes may sense area, we derive a minimal mathematical model that incorporates the cytoplasmic kinase Ssp1 as a Cdr2 activator. The model predicts that a cdr2 mutant in an Ssp1 phosphorylation site (cdr2-T166A) [4] should form nodes whose density registers cell length. We confirm this prediction experimentally and find that thin cells now follow this new scaling by dividing at constant length instead of area. This work supports the role of Cdr2 as a sizer factor and highlights the importance of studying geometrical aspects of size control.",A New Spiralian Phylogeny Places the Enigmatic Arrow Worms among Gnathiferans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639106,Current biology : CB,2019 01 22,"Chaetognaths (arrow worms) are an enigmatic group of marine animals whose phylogenetic position remains elusive, in part because they display a mix of developmental and morphological characters associated with other groups [1, 2]. In particular, it remains unclear whether they are a sister group to protostomes [1, 2], one of the principal animal superclades, or whether they bear a closer relationship with some spiralian phyla [3, 4]. Addressing the phylogenetic position of chaetognaths and refining our understanding of relationships among spiralians are essential to fully comprehend character changes during bilaterian evolution [5]. To tackle these questions, we generated new transcriptomes for ten chaetognath species, compiling an extensive phylogenomic dataset that maximizes data occupancy and taxonomic representation. We employed inference methods that consider rate and compositional heterogeneity across taxa to avoid limitations of earlier analyses [6]. In this way, we greatly improved the resolution of the protostome tree of life. We find that chaetognaths cluster together with rotifers, gnathostomulids, and micrognathozoans within an expanded Gnathifera clade and that this clade is the sister group to other spiralians [7, 8]. Our analysis shows that several previously proposed groupings are likely due to systematic error, and we propose a revised organization of Lophotrochozoa with three main clades: Tetraneuralia (mollusks and entoprocts), Lophophorata (brachiopods, phoronids, and ectoprocts), and a third unnamed clade gathering annelids, nemerteans, and platyhelminthes. Consideration of classical morphological, developmental, and genomic characters in light of this topology indicates secondary loss as a fundamental trend in spiralian evolution.",Dynamics of Free and Chromatin-Bound Histone H3 during Early Embryogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639105,Current biology : CB,2019 01 22,"During zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the chromatin environment undergoes profound changes, including the formation of topologically associated domains, refinements in nucleosome positioning on promoters, and the emergence of heterochromatin [1-4]. In many organisms, including Drosophila, ZGA is associated with the end of a period of extremely rapid, exponential cleavage divisions that are facilitated by large maternally provided pools of nuclear components. It is therefore imperative that we understand how the supply of chromatin components relative to the exponentially increasing demand affects nuclear and chromatin composition during early embryogenesis. Here, we examine the nuclear trafficking and chromatin dynamics of histones during the cleavage divisions in Drosophila using a photo-switchable H3-Dendra2 reporter. We observe that total H3-Dendra2 in the nucleus decreases with each cleavage cycle. This change in nuclear composition is due to depletion of large pools (>50%) of free protein that are present in the early cycles. We find that the per nucleus import rate halves with each cycle and construct a mathematical model in which increasing histone demand determines the dynamics of nuclear H3 supply. Finally, we show that these changes in H3 availability correspond to a large (∼40%) reduction in global H3 occupancy on the chromatin, which is compensated by the increased incorporation of H3.3. The observed changes in free nuclear H3 and chromatin composition may contribute to the cell-cycle slowing, changes in chromatin structure, and the onset of transcription associated with this developmental stage.",The Genomic Footprints of the Fall and Recovery of the Crested Ibis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639104,Current biology : CB,2019 01 30,"Human-induced environmental change and habitat fragmentation pose major threats to biodiversity and require active conservation efforts to mitigate their consequences. Genetic rescue through translocation and the introduction of variation into imperiled populations has been argued as a powerful means to preserve, or even increase, the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of endangered species [1-4]. However, factors such as outbreeding depression [5, 6] and a reduction in available genetic diversity render the success of such approaches uncertain. An improved evaluation of the consequence of genetic restoration requires knowledge of temporal changes to genetic diversity before and after the advent of management programs. To provide such information, a growing number of studies have included small numbers of genomic loci extracted from historic and even ancient specimens [7, 8]. We extend this approach to its natural conclusion, by characterizing the complete genomic sequences of modern and historic population samples of the crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), an endangered bird that is perhaps the most successful example of how conservation effort has brought a species back from the brink of extinction. Though its once tiny population has today recovered to >2,000 individuals [9], this process was accompanied by almost half of ancestral loss of genetic variation and high deleterious mutation load. We furthermore show how genetic drift coupled to inbreeding following the population bottleneck has largely purged the ancient polymorphisms from the current population. In conclusion, we demonstrate the unique promise of exploiting genomic information held within museum samples for conservation and ecological research.",Crystal Structure of the Human Cannabinoid Receptor CB2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639103,Cell,2019 01 25,"The cannabinoid receptor CB2 is predominately expressed in the immune system, and selective modulation of CB2 without the psychoactivity of CB1 has therapeutic potential in inflammatory, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report the crystal structure of human CB2 in complex with a rationally designed antagonist, AM10257, at 2.8 Å resolution. The CB2-AM10257 structure reveals a distinctly different binding pose compared with CB1. However, the extracellular portion of the antagonist-bound CB2 shares a high degree of conformational similarity with the agonist-bound CB1, which led to the discovery of AM10257's unexpected opposing functional profile of CB2 antagonism versus CB1 agonism. Further structural analysis using mutagenesis studies and molecular docking revealed the molecular basis of their function and selectivity for CB2 and CB1. Additional analyses of our designed antagonist and agonist pairs provide important insight into the activation mechanism of CB2. The present findings should facilitate rational drug design toward precise modulation of the endocannabinoid system.",Importin α Partitioning to the Plasma Membrane Regulates Intracellular Scaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639102,Cell,2019 02 12,"Early embryogenesis is accompanied by reductive cell divisions requiring that subcellular structures adapt to a range of cell sizes. The interphase nucleus and mitotic spindle scale with cell size through both physical and biochemical mechanisms, but control systems that coordinately scale intracellular structures are unknown. We show that the nuclear transport receptor importin α is modified by palmitoylation, which targets it to the plasma membrane and modulates its binding to nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins that regulate nuclear and spindle size in Xenopus egg extracts. Reconstitution of importin α targeting to the outer boundary of extract droplets mimicking cell-like compartments recapitulated scaling relationships observed during embryogenesis, which were altered by inhibitors that shift levels of importin α palmitoylation. Modulation of importin α palmitoylation in human cells similarly affected nuclear and spindle size. These experiments identify importin α as a conserved surface area-to-volume sensor that scales intracellular structures to cell size.",Distinctive Activation Mechanism for Angiotensin Receptor Revealed by a Synthetic Nanobody.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639100,Cell,2019 02 10,"The angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R) is a critical regulator of cardiovascular and renal function and is an important model for studies of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. By stabilizing the receptor with a single-domain antibody fragment (""nanobody"") discovered using a synthetic yeast-displayed library, we determined the crystal structure of active-state human AT1R bound to an AngII analog with partial agonist activity. The nanobody binds to the receptor's intracellular transducer pocket, stabilizing the large conformational changes characteristic of activated GPCRs. The peptide engages the AT1R through an extensive interface spanning from the receptor core to its extracellular face and N terminus, remodeling the ligand-binding cavity. Remarkably, the mechanism used to propagate conformational changes through the receptor diverges from other GPCRs at several key sites, highlighting the diversity of allosteric mechanisms among GPCRs. Our structure provides insight into how AngII and its analogs stimulate full or biased signaling, respectively.",Angiotensin Analogs with Divergent Bias Stabilize Distinct Receptor Conformations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639099,Cell,2019 04 21,"""Biased"" G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists preferentially activate pathways mediated by G proteins or β-arrestins. Here, we use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy to probe the changes that ligands induce in the conformational distribution of the angiotensin II type I receptor. Monitoring distances between 10 pairs of nitroxide labels distributed across the intracellular regions enabled mapping of four underlying sets of conformations. Ligands from different functional classes have distinct, characteristic effects on the conformational heterogeneity of the receptor. Compared to angiotensin II, the endogenous agonist, agonists with enhanced Gq coupling more strongly stabilize an ""open"" conformation with an accessible transducer-binding site. β-arrestin-biased agonists deficient in Gq coupling do not stabilize this open conformation but instead favor two more occluded conformations. These data suggest a structural mechanism for biased ligand action at the angiotensin receptor that can be exploited to rationally design GPCR-targeting drugs with greater specificity of action.",Genome-wide CRISPR Screens in T Helper Cells Reveal Pervasive Crosstalk between Activation and Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639098,Cell,2019 02 22,"T helper type 2 (Th2) cells are important regulators of mammalian adaptive immunity and have relevance for infection, autoimmunity, and tumor immunology.

Our experiments distinguish cell activation versus differentiation in a quantitative framework. We demonstrate that these two processes are tightly coupled and are jointly controlled by many transcription factors, metabolic genes, and cytokine/receptor pairs. There are only a small number of genes regulating differentiation without any role in activation.

Yet, the condition is transiently reversible and sequelae preventable, prompting the use of prediction algorithms to quickly assess dysglycemia status through self-reported data. However, as current algorithms have largely been developed in older populations, their application to younger adults is uncertain considering associations between risk factors and dysglycemia vary by age. We sought to identify sex-specific predictors of current dysglycemia among young adults and evaluate their ability to screen for prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes. We analyzed 2005-2014 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for 3251 participants aged 20-39, who completed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), had not been diagnosed with diabetes, and, for females, were not pregnant. Sex-specific stepwise logistic models were fit with predictors identified from univariate analyses. Risk scores were developed using adjusted odds ratios and model performance was assessed using area under the curve (AUC) measures. The OGTT identified 906 (27.9%) and 78 (2.4%) participants with prediabetes or undiagnosed diabetes, respectively. Predictors of dysglycemia status for males were BMI, age, race, and first-degree family history of diabetes, and, in addition to those, education, delivered baby weight, waist circumference, and vigorous physical activity for females. Our male- and female-specific models demonstrated improved validity to assess dysglycemia presence among young adults relative to the widely-used American Diabetes Association test (AUC = 0.69 vs. 0.61; 0.92 vs. 0.71, respectively). Thus, age-specific scoring algorithms employing questionnaire data show promise and are effective in identifying dysglycemia among young adults.",Weight perception and perceived attractiveness associated with self-rated health in young adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639078,Preventive medicine,2019 02 10,"Self-rated health (SRH) is a widely used and valid marker of overall health and wellbeing and demographic differences in SRH are well-established. To date, few studies have examined how multiple components of body image shape young adults' SRH. The purpose of this study was to investigate the contributions of weight perception and perceived attractiveness on SRH among young adults. Data were from Wave IV (2007-2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and young women and men ages 24-34 were analyzed (n = 7044 women, n = 6594 men) in April 2018.

For both genders, relative to Whites, Hispanic, Black, and Asian young adults reported poorer health; women and men with higher education and income reported better health. Independent of measured body mass index (BMI), young adults who thought they were underweight or overweight reported poorer health relative to those who thought their weight was normal. Both young women and young men who thought they were more attractive also reported better health. This study demonstrates that weight status, perceived weight status, and perceived attractiveness independently impact SRH for both young men and women controlling for race/ethnicity, nativity status, marital status, education, income, and number of health conditions.","Clinical manifestations, treatment outcomes, and prognostic factors of pediatric anti-NMDAR encephalitis in tertiary care hospitals: A multicenter retrospective/prospective cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639077,Brain & development,2019 04 03,"Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an acute autoimmune neurological disorder that is increasingly recognized in pediatric populations.

Patients treated between 1994 and 2010 were assessed retrospectively during an outpatient visit using a validated questionnaire (i.e. DASH, pain assessed through VAS), sensory testing, grip- and pinch-strength and radiographic analysis for post-traumatic arthritis. Fifty patients were included. Mean follow-up was 10 years. Mean age at trauma was 34 years. ORIF was used in 35 patients. CRPF was used in 15 patients. No differences in grip- and pinch-strength were found. Re-operations were needed in five ORIF-treated patients. Higher Pain Scores (VAS) were seen in the ORIF-treated patients. No correlation was found between surgical technique and functional outcomes. A persistent step-off or gap larger than 2 mm after surgical fixation was significantly correlated with post-traumatic arthritis at 10 years' follow-up. The need to perform ORIF for anatomical reduction seems to be less important in preventing post-traumatic arthritis as a persistent step-off or gap of more than 2 mm was found to be significantly correlated with the development of post-traumatic arthritis. Secondly, both techniques lead to good functional outcomes, although persistent pain was seen in the ORIF-treated patients. Bennett fractures can therefore be safely treated with CRPF when the persistent step-off and gap after fixation do not exceed 2 mm.

In recent years, evidence has accumulated showing that, in addition to its classical cell-surface distribution, IGF1R translocates to cell nucleus via an apparently SUMO-1-dependent mechanism. While the role of IGF1R in nucleus has not yet been settled, available information suggests that the nuclear receptor displays activities usually linked to transcription factors, including DNA binding and transcription regulation. To gain insight into the biological pathways associated with nuclear IGF1R action we conducted a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis aimed at identifying interactors of IGF1R in nucleus of both benign and malignant breast cells. The nucleolar NOM1 molecule belongs to a family of proteins that contain the middle domain of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (MIF4G) and/or interaction module (MA3), and functions in translation, cell growth and proliferation. Using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation and silencing assays we provide evidence of a complex, bi-directional interplay between nuclear IGF1R and nucleolar protein NOM1. Inhibition of nuclear IGF1R translocation by dansylcadaverine reduced NOM1 levels in nuclei of MCF7 cells. On the other hand, IGF1R overexpression enhanced NOM1 levels in the nuclear fraction. Of interest, NOM1 silencing led to a major increase in IGF1R biosynthesis. In summary, results are consistent with a physiologically-relevant interplay between the nuclear IGF1 signaling pathway and nucleolar protein NOM1.",Computational disease model of phenobarbital-induced acute attacks in an acute intermittent porphyria mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639045,Molecular genetics and metabolism,2019 01 14,Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is characterized by hepatic over-production of the heme precursors when aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-synthase 1 is induced by endogenous or environmental factors.

In these species, serotonin is important for the mammary gland function and lactation performance. The mammary gland expression of 5-HTR in small dairy ruminants has yet to be described. In the present study, primer sequences were developed to amplify 5-HTR (1A, 1D, 1E,1B, 1F, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3a, 4, 5a, 6, and 7) using real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of mRNA expression in mammary tissue of dairy sheep, goats, and cows. The distribution of commonly expressed 5-HTR between the 3 species (1B, 1E, 2A, 2B, 4, and 7) was analyzed in the mammary tissue of late-lactation and dried-off sheep, goats, and cows using immunohistochemical staining. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the 3 studied species expressed receptors 5-HTR1B, 1E, 2A, 2B, 4, and 7. Goats and sheep expressed 5-HTR1D and 5a; 5-HTR1A and 1F were expressed only in sheep. The mammary epithelial cells were positively stained for all the studied receptors by immunohistochemistry (5-HTR1B, 1E, 2A, 2B, 4, and 7). The endothelial cells of blood vessels were positively stained for 5-HTR1B, 2A, 2B, and 7 in all the species. Additionally, 5-HTR1E was present in cow endothelium. The myoepithelial cells stained positively for 5-HTR1E in all the species, and 5-HTR4 myoepithelial staining was present only in cows and sheep. Between the lactating and dried-off mammary glands, the location of 5-HTR in the epithelial cells changed from a cytoplasmic reaction in lactating udders to a reaction in the apical region in dry udders. These results showed that the distribution of 5-HTR subtypes in the mammary gland of dairy ruminants vary among species, tissue type, and stage of gland development. These findings warrant future studies aimed at understanding whether the differences in 5-HTR subtype expression and location accounts for the differences in milk secretion and lactocyte activity among cows, goats, and sheep.",Machine milking-induced changes in teat canal dimensions as assessed by ultrasonography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639026,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 11,"Changes in teat canal diameter as induced by machine milking are thought to be related to teat canal penetrability and susceptibility to new intramammary infections. The objective of this study was to describe the effects of machine milking on teat canal dimensions as assessed by ultrasonography and to evaluate postmilking changes of teat canal dimensions throughout an 8-h milking interval. Ultrasonographic images were taken of the left front and right hind teats of 80 Holstein cows milked 3 times per day. Imaging occurred before attachment of the milking unit after completion of premilking udder preparation (t-1), immediately after removal of the milking unit (t0), and then every hour after milking until 8 h had elapsed (t1 to t8). Teat canal length and teat canal diameter (at the proximal, middle, and distal regions) were measured. General linear mixed model analysis indicated differences in the relative change of teat canal length (compared with t-1) with least squares means (LSM) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 11.1% (8.7-13.4%) after machine milking (t0). Teat canal length decreased throughout the 8-h milking interval but remained elevated relative to t-1. Teat canal diameter at the proximal and middle regions increased near the end of the milking interval, whereas that at the distal region did not change meaningfully during the 8 h of observation. Our findings suggest that the teat canal and its surrounding tissue is in a state of near-constant remodeling in cows milked 3 times daily. Future work is warranted to study the association between ultrasonographically assessed changes of teat canal dimensions after machine milking and teat canal penetrability to mastitis-causing pathogens.",Modifying the physical properties of butter using high-intensity ultrasound.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639025,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 03,"The physical qualities of butter are affected by the physical properties of the cream used to make it. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of high-intensity ultrasound (HIU) on the physical properties of cream and butter. High-intensity ultrasound (frequency: 20 kHz, amplitude: 108 µm), often called sonication, was applied for 0, 10, 30, 60, and 90 s using a 1.27-cm-diameter tip to heavy cream (40% fat; 300 g) that was aged at 7.5°C with low agitation (40 rpm) for 90 min. Sonicated cream was churned at 7.5°C until butter grains were formed. The solid fat content (SFC), melting behavior, and average fat droplet size of cream were measured after HIU treatment. Butter was characterized by SFC and melting behavior immediately after production and was tested for SFC, melting behavior, and hardness after storage for 24 h at 5°C. High-intensity ultrasound did not affect the average fat droplet size of cream. Sonicating cream for 30, 60, and 90 s slightly decreased SFC due to the temperature increase (2-6°C) that occurred during HIU application. Two melting peaks were observed at approximately 17 and 33°C in all the cream samples. A significantly lower peak temperature was observed in cream sonicated for 10 s compared with creams sonicated for 30 and 60 s. A relatively shorter churning time of sonicated cream compared with nonsonicated cream was observed, possibly because HIU weakens the fat globule membrane. Two melting peaks were observed in all butter samples at approximately 16 and 33°C. Treatment with HIU for 10 to 60 s significantly increased the hardness of butter. When HIU was applied to cream for 10 s, the hardest butter was obtained, with the lowest onset temperatures and highest enthalpy values for both melting peaks. Treatment with HIU for 10 s promoted crystallization of low-melting-point triacylglycerols (TAG) during churning, which resulted in a harder material. Significantly lower enthalpy values for the high-melting-fraction TAG were observed in butters treated with HIU for 60 and 90 s compared with non-HIU-treated butter, which suggests that a longer duration of HIU promotes melting of high-melting-point TAG. The hardness of butter was correlated with the enthalpy values of the low-melting fraction and with total enthalpy values of fresh butter. However, further crystallization occurred in the butter during 24 h of storage at 5°C, and all differences in enthalpy values disappeared. In conclusion, exposure of cream to HIU can be used to modify the physical properties of butter, and the effects of HIU depend on the length of HIU treatment.",Modeling pedigree accuracy and uncertain parentage in single-step genomic evaluations of simulated and US Holstein datasets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639024,Journal of dairy science,2019 03 29,"The objective of this study was to model differences in pedigree accuracy caused by selective genotyping. As genotypes are used to correct pedigree errors, some pedigree relationships are more accurate than others. These accuracy differences can be modeled with uncertain parentage models that distribute the paternal (maternal) contribution across multiple sires (dams). In our case, the parents were the parent on record and an unknown parent group to account for pedigree relationships that were not confirmed through genotypes. Pedigree accuracy was addressed through simulation and through North American Holstein data. Data were simulated to be representative of the dairy industry with heterogeneous pedigree depth, pedigree accuracy, and genotyping. Holstein data were obtained from the official evaluation for milk, fat, and protein. Two models were compared: the traditional approach, assuming accurate pedigrees, and uncertain parentage, assuming variable pedigree accuracy. The uncertain parentage model was used to add pedigree relationships for alternative parents when pedigree relationships were not certain. The uncertain parentage model included 2 possible sires (dams) when the sire (dam) could not be confirmed with genotypes. The 2 sires (dams) were the sire (dam) on record with probability 0.90 (0.95) and the unknown parent group for the birth year of the sire (dam) with probability 0.10 (0.05). An additional set of assumptions was tested in simulation to mimic an extensive dairy production system by using a sire probability of 0.75, a dam probability of 0.85, and the remainder attributed to the unknown parent groups. In the simulation, small bias differences occurred between models based on pedigree accuracy and genotype status. Rank correlations were strong between traditional and uncertain parentage models in simulation (≥0.99) and in Holstein (≥0.99). For Holsteins, the estimated breeding value differences between models were small for most animals. Thus, traditional models can continue to be used for dairy genomic prediction despite using genotypes to improve pedigree accuracy. Those genotypes can also be used to discover maternal parentage, specifically maternal grandsires and great grandsires when the dam is not known. More research is needed to understand how to use discovered maternal pedigrees in genetic prediction.",Effects of Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection on the expression of estrogen receptor α and progesterone receptor in mammary glands of nonlactating cows administered estradiol and progesterone to stimulate mammary growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639023,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 11,"Intramammary infections (IMI) are prevalent in nonlactating dairy cattle and are known to alter mammary structure and negatively affect the amount of mammary epithelium in the gland. Mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in mammary growth during an IMI are poorly understood, yet the importance of the key mammogenic hormones driving mammary growth is well recognized. This study's objective was to characterize the expression of estrogen receptor α (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PGR) in mammary glands stimulated to grow and develop in the presence or absence of an IMI as well as preliminarily characterize myoepithelial cell response to IMI. Mammary growth was stimulated in 18 nonpregnant, nonlactating dairy cows using subcutaneous estradiol and progesterone injections, and 2 culture-negative quarters of each cow were subsequently infused with either saline (n = 18) or Staphylococcus aureus (n = 18). Mammary parenchyma tissues were collected 5 d (n = 9) or 10 d (n = 9) postchallenge and examined using immunofluorescence microscopy to quantify positive nuclei and characterize staining features. There tended to be a greater number of ESR1-positive nuclei observed across 8 random mammary parenchyma fields of view in saline quarters than in Staph. aureus quarters (201 vs. 163 ± 44 nuclei). Saline quarters also contained a greater number of PGR-positive nuclei (520 vs. 440 ± 45 nuclei) and myoepithelial cells (971 vs. 863 ± 48 nuclei) than Staph. aureus-challenged quarters. However, when ESR1, PGR, and myoepithelial nuclei counts were adjusted for Staph. aureus quarters containing less epithelium, differences between quarter treatments abated. The examined ESR1 and PGR staining characteristics were similar between saline and Staph. aureus quarters but were differentially affected by day of tissue collection. Additionally, nuclear staining area of myoepithelial cells was greater in Staph. aureus quarters than in saline quarters. These results indicate that IMI had little effect on the number or staining characteristics of ESR1- or PGR-positive nuclei relative to epithelial area, but myoepithelial cells appear to be affected by IMI and the associated inflammation in nonlactating mammary glands that were stimulated to grow rapidly using mammogenic hormones. Accordingly, reductions in mammary epithelium in affected glands are not suspected to be resultant of alterations in the number or staining characteristics of ESR1- or PGR-positive mammary epithelial cells.",Short communication: Replication of genome-wide association studies for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein by an efficient rotated linear mixed model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639022,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 04,"Milk is regarded as an important nutrient for humans, and Chinese Holstein cows provide high-quality milk for billions of Chinese people. Therefore, detecting quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) or candidate genes for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein is important. In this study, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in a Chinese Holstein population of 6,675 cows and 71,633 SNP using deregressed proofs (DRP) as phenotypes to replicate our previous study in a population of 1,815 cows and 39,163 SNP using estimated breeding values (EBV) as phenotypes. The associations between 3 milk production traits-milk yield (MY), fat percentage (FP), and protein percentage (PP)-and the SNP were determined by using an efficient rotated linear mixed model, which benefits from linear transformations of genomic estimated values and Eigen decomposition of the genomic relationship matrix algorithm. In total, we detected 94 SNP that were significantly associated with one or more milk production traits, including 7 SNP for MY, 76 for FP, and 36 for PP; 87% of these SNP were distributed across Bos taurus autosomes 14 and 20. In total, 83 SNP were found to be located within the reported quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions, and one novel segment (between 1.41 and 1.49 Mb) on chromosome 14 was significantly associated with FP, which could be an important candidate QTL region. In addition, the detected intervals were narrowed down from the reported regions harboring causal variants. The top significant SNP for the 3 traits was ARS-BFGL-NGS-4939, which is located within the DGAT1 gene. Five detected genes (CYHR1, FOXH1, OPLAH, PLEC, VPS28) have effects on all 3 traits. Our study provides a suite of QTN, candidate genes, and a novel QTL associated with milk production traits, and thus forms a solid basis for genomic selection and molecular breeding for milk production traits in Chinese Holstein.",Improving effect of a probiotic mixture on memory and learning abilities in d-galactose-treated aging mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639021,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 03,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiaging effect of a probiotic mixture using an in vivo mouse model in which aging was induced with d-galactose. Results of the Morris water maze test indicated that long-term administration of the probiotic mixture improved memory and learning abilities and ameliorated the apoptosis pattern in the hippocampus of aging mice treated with d-galactose. An antioxidation experiment indicated that administration of the probiotic mixture could restore activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase and inhibit the production of malondialdehyde. The antioxidant-related proteins nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were upregulated in liver after treatment of d-galactose-treated aging mice with probiotics. Finally, the probiotic treatment did affect the production of short-chain fatty acids in d-galactose-treated aging mice. Our results highlighted a possible antioxidative effect triggered by short-chain fatty acids that contributed to improving the memory and learning abilities following treatment with the probiotic mixture and suggested that probiotics could serve as a therapy to modulate physiological function."

In total, 500 udder pathogenic isolates were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS using bacterial or fungal colony material; 93.5% could be identified to the species level, and 6.5% were identified only to the genus level. Isolates identified to the genus level required further identification to the species level by conventional methods or 16S rDNA sequencing. Mass spectra from verified species were used to expand the MALDI-TOF MS database to improve future identification ability. A total of 24 genera and 61 species were identified in this study.

In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful, rapid, and reliable technique to identify the most common microorganisms causing bovine mastitis, and the database can be continuously expanded and improved with additional species.",Milk yield loss in response to feed restriction is associated with mammary epithelial cell exfoliation in dairy cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639009,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 11,"In dairy cows, feed restriction is known to decrease milk yield by reducing the number of mammary epithelial cells (MEC) in the udder through a shift in the MEC proliferation-apoptosis balance, by reducing the metabolic activity of MEC, or both. The exfoliation of MEC from the mammary epithelium into milk is another process that may participate in regulating the number of MEC during feed restriction. The aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanisms that underlie the milk yield loss induced by feed restriction. Nineteen Holstein dairy cows producing 40.0 ± 0.7 kg/d at 77 ± 5 d in milk were divided into a control group (n = 9) and a feed-restricted group (n = 10). Ad libitum dry matter intake (DMI) was recorded during a pre-experimental period of 2 wk. For 29 d (period 1), cows were fed either 100 (control) or 80% (feed-restricted) of their ad libitum DMI measured during the pre-experimental period. Then, all cows were fed ad libitum for 35 d (period 2). Milk production and DMI were recorded daily. Blood and milk samples were collected once during the pre-experimental period; on d 5, 9, and 27 of period 1; and on d 5, 9, and 30 of period 2. Mammary epithelial cells were purified from milk using an immunomagnetic method to determine the rate of MEC exfoliation. Mammary tissue samples were collected by biopsy at the end of each period to analyze the rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis and the expression of genes involved in synthesizing constituents of milk. Feed restriction decreased milk yield by 3 kg/d but had no effect on rates of proliferation and apoptosis in the mammary tissue or on the expression of genes involved in milk synthesis. The daily MEC exfoliation rate was 65% greater in feed-restricted cows than in control cows. These effects in feed-restricted cows were associated with reduced insulin-like growth factor-1 and cortisol plasma concentrations. When all cows returned to ad libitum feeding, no significant difference on milk yield or MEC exfoliation rate was observed between feed-restricted and control cows, but refeeding increased prolactin release during milking. These results show that the exfoliation process may play a role in regulating the number of MEC in the udders of dairy cows during feed restriction without any carryover effect on their milk production.",The effect of pasture quantity temporal variation on milking robot utilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639007,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 10,"In pasture-based automatic milking systems (AMS), a decrease in robot utilization (RU) often occurs in the early morning hours. Novel feeding strategies that encourage voluntary cow traffic throughout 24 h could help mitigate this problem. We determined the effect of 3 distinct pasture allocation methods on RU patterns throughout a 24-h period. The experiment was conducted at the University of Melbourne's Dookie research farm in northern Victoria, Australia. Three Lely Astronaut A3 robotic milking units (Lely, Maassluis, the Netherlands) milked 133 cows, grazing pasture, with concentrate offered at milking in the robots. The farm operated a system of 3-way grazing, with active access to each pasture allocation: 2030-0400 h (allocation A), 0400-1330 h (allocation B), and 1330-2030 h (allocation C). Treatments varied in the quantity of feed offered per hour of active access to each of the 3 pasture allocations. The control treatment offered the same proportion of feed (corrected for active access time) in all 3 pasture allocations (allocation A = 31.3%, B = 39.6%, and C = 29.2%). The day treatment offered the largest proportion of feed during the day (allocation A = 20%, B = 40%, and C = 40%), following the cows' diurnal pattern of feeding activity. The night treatment offered the largest proportion of feed at night (allocation A = 42%, B = 40%, and C = 18%). Due to the nature of pasture-based AMS, treatments could not be applied simultaneously. Therefore, treatments were applied to the entire herd and repeated twice over 42 d, lasting 7 d/treatment, with the first 3 d for habituation, followed by 4 d of data collection. Robot utilization (milkings/h) varied throughout 24 h between treatments, with the night treatment recording greater RU at 0800, 1800, and 1900 h and lower RU between 2100 to 0100 h, compared with the day treatment. The proportion of the herd milking between 0000 and 0600 h was greater for the control (43.3%) and day (45.3%) treatments compared with the night treatment (25.8%). Herd-average daily pasture intake was similar (10.5 kg of dry matter) for all treatments. This experiment is the first to demonstrate the manipulation of RU by varying the quantity of pasture offered. However, the use of variable allocation alone did not eliminate the decrease in RU between 0000 and 0600 h, with the timing of allocation also likely to play a role. We recommend a further research focus on combining both timing and quantity of pasture allocated to improve RU in pasture-based AMS.",Herd-level variables associated with premilking stimulation time in Michigan dairy herds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639006,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 10,"The objective of this study was to determine the herd-level variables that were associated with total stimulation time during the premilking routine in 64 Michigan dairy herds. The mean herd size was 452 cows (range = 59 to 2,771 cows). For each herd, surveys were administered to producers to gather mastitis management practices and attitudes. Additionally, milking protocols were observed and milk flow dynamics were measured by use of digital vacuum recorders. Backward multivariate regression analysis was used to determine which of 47 herd-level milking and management variables were associated with mean total stimulation time. Mean total stimulation time was 14.2 s (range = 2.4-40.8 s) and was positively associated with increasing latency period (time interval between first stimulation and cluster attachment). Total stimulation time was negatively associated with greater herd size and number of visits to each cow in the premilking routine. In summary, increased stimulation time is more likely in herds that foster a lower sense of urgency of cow throughput during milking, as evidenced by a positive association with longer latency periods and fewer preparation visits per cow. Tactile stimulation is critical for efficient milk ejection; if inadequate, cows are at greater risk of delayed milk ejection and bimodal milk flow, which in turn has been associated with teat congestion and reduced milk flow. This study offers insight as to some of the herd factors that may be limiting adequate tactile stimulation.","Production performance, nutrient digestibility, and milk fatty acid profile of lactating dairy cows fed corn silage- or sorghum silage-based diets with and without xylanase supplementation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639005,Journal of dairy science,2019 03 29,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of supplementing xylanase on production performance, nutrient digestibility, and milk fatty acid profile in high-producing dairy cows consuming corn silage- or sorghum silage-based diets. Conventional corn (80,000 seeds/ha) and brown midrib forage sorghum (250,000 seeds/ha) were planted, harvested [34 and 32% of dry matter (DM), respectively], and ensiled for more than 10 mo. Four primiparous and 20 multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and 19-d periods. Treatment diets consisted of (1) corn silage-based diet without xylanase, (2) corn silage-based diet with xylanase, (3) sorghum silage-based diet without xylanase, and (4) sorghum silage-based diet with xylanase. The xylanase product was supplemented at a rate of 1.5 g of product/kg of total DM. Corn silage had higher concentrations of starch (31.2 vs. 29.2%), slightly higher concentrations of crude protein (7.1 vs. 6.8%) and fat (3.7 vs. 3.2%), and lower concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (36.4 vs. 49.0%) and lignin (2.1 vs. 5.7%) than sorghum silage. Xylanase supplementation did not affect DM intake, milk yield, milk fat percentage and yield, milk protein percentage and yield, lactose percentage and yield, and 3.5% fat-corrected milk yield. Cows consuming corn silage-based diets consumed 13% more DM (28.8 vs. 25.5 kg/d) and produced 5% more milk (51.6 vs. 48.9 kg/d) than cows consuming sorghum silage-based diets. Milk from cows consuming sorghum silage-based diets had 16% greater fat concentrations (3.84 and 3.30%) than milk from cows consuming corn silage-based diets. This resulted in 8% greater fat yields (1.81 vs. 1.68 kg/d). Silage type did not affect milk protein and lactose concentrations. Xylanase supplementation did not affect nutrient digestibility. Cows consuming corn silage-based diets showed greater DM (77.3 vs. 73.5%), crude protein (78.0 vs. 72.4), and starch (99.2 vs. 96.5%) digestibilities than cows consuming sorghum silage-based diets. In conclusion, xylanase supplementation did not improve production performance when high-producing dairy cows were fed corn silage- or sorghum silage-based diets. In addition, production performance can be sustained by feeding sorghum silage in replacement of corn silage.",Short communication: Effect of carbon emission trading on European Union butter prices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639004,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 04,"Since its inception, the European Union (EU) carbon emission market has been vastly successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, the usage of environmentally friendly fuels (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel) has increased significantly over the last few years. Given that EU biodiesel is mainly produced from rapeseed oil and soybean oil, higher carbon taxes are likely to increase the demand of these important vegetable oils, which further affects the prices of its close substitute such as butter. Nevertheless, the association between the EU emission trading scheme and butter prices remains understudied. In this paper, we aim to fill this vacuum in the existing literature. Applying the autoregressive distributed lag bound testing procedure, we show that emission market seems to have a long-term effect on EU butter prices, implying that changes in the levels of carbon taxes will lead to changes in the price level of butter. These results are of vital importance to policymakers and investors.",Effects of milk replacer feeding rate and long-term antibiotic inclusion in milk replacer on performance and nutrient digestibility of Holstein dairy calves up to 4 months of age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639003,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 08,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate calf performance and diet digestibility when feeding a milk replacer (MR; 25% crude protein, 18% fat, dry matter basis) at a moderate (MOD) and high (HI) rate, along with MOD with neomycin-oxytetracycline inclusion (1.43 each g/kg; NTMOD). Male Holstein calves (n = 48; 45 ± 1.0 kg of body weight; 3 to 4 d of age) were housed in individual pens for 56 d. All calves were initially fed 0.66 kg of dry matter from MR for the first p.m. and following a.m. feeding, then randomly assigned to 1 of 2 feeding programs: (1) 0.66 kg of dry matter/d for first 39 d divided into 2 equal a.m. and p.m. meals and 0.33 kg for 3 d fed once daily in the a.m. feeding only (MOD, NTMOD); (2) 0.85 kg of dry matter/d for the first 4 d divided into 2 equal a.m. and p.m. meals, 1.07 kg of dry matter/d for the next 31 d divided into 2 equal a.m. and p.m. meals, and 0.48 kg for 7 d fed once daily in the a.m. feeding only (HI). Calves were fed a textured starter containing whole grains (20% crude protein, 43% starch, dry matter basis). Fecal samples were collected for 5 individual calves per treatment between d 47 to 51 to estimate digestibility. Calves were moved into groups by treatment (4 calves/pen) at 56 d and fed the same starter blended with 5% hay until d 112. Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with repeated measures when applicable using mixed models. Milk replacer dry matter intake averaged 27.4 kg for MOD and NTMOD and 40.3 kg for HI per calf. Preweaning starter intake was less for calves fed HI versus MOD. Preweaning calf BCS change was greater for calves fed HI versus MOD. Preweaning medical treatment days were fewer for calves fed NTMOD versus MOD. Postweaning starter intake was less for calves fed HI versus MOD. Postweaning average daily gain was less for calves fed NTMOD versus MOD. Over the 56-d nursery trial, calves fed HI had less starter intake than calves fed MOD. Digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fiber were greater for calves fed MOD versus NTMOD or HI during d 47 to 51 postweaning. Additionally, digestibility of fat was greater for calves fed MOD versus HI. During d 56 to 112, hip width change was greater for calves fed MOD versus NTMOD or HI. Over 0 to 112 d, body weight gain was 100, 98, and 102 kg, whereas hip width change was 10.2, 9.0, and 9.2 cm for calves fed MOD, NTMOD, and HI, respectively. Any preweaning improvements from feeding NTMOD or HI over MOD were lost during the postweaning period, which could be partially explained by reductions in diet digestibility.",Modeling of alternative testing strategies to demonstrate freedom from Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis infection in test-negative dairy herds in the Republic of Ireland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639002,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 04,"In light of the various adverse effects of Johne's disease on animal productivity and the debate on the role of its causative organism, Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, in the etiology of Crohn's disease, major dairy-producing countries around the world have implemented national control programs aimed at reducing the prevalence of this infection in cattle. A pilot control program was initiated in Ireland in 2013, with a key objective to provide farmers with test-negative dairy herds with tools and knowledge to increase their confidence of freedom over time. The aim of this study was to estimate the confidence of freedom obtained in test-negative Irish dairy herds over time with various sampling scenarios and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative scenarios for achieving an acceptable level of confidence of freedom in herds with no evidence of infection. A stochastic model was developed to simulate repeated annual testing of individual animals using ELISA and confirmatory assays over a period of 20 yr. Two scenarios modeled the current herd-screening options, whereas 14 alternative scenarios explored the effect of varying parameters from the current testing strategies, such as the frequency of testing, the eligibility criteria for selecting animals, the type of assay, the probability of introduction, and the assay sensitivity. Results showed that the current testing strategy with milk twice a year or serum once a year in all animals over 2 yr old provided the highest annual herd sensitivity, with a median value of 55%. Although the median confidence of freedom increased over time for all scenarios, the time required to reach 90 and 95% confidence of freedom was highly variable between scenarios. Under the testing scenario where serum tests were used once a year, the confidence of freedom reached 90% after 4 yr and 95% after 7 yr of testing. Some of the alternative scenarios achieved an acceptable level of confidence of freedom in a reasonable timeframe and at lesser cost than the current testing strategies. The results of this work are used to provide recommendations for the next phases of the program.",Study of bacterial and fungal community structures in traditional koumiss from Inner Mongolia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639001,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 03,"Koumiss is notable for its nutritional functions, and microorganisms in koumiss determine its versatility. In this study, the bacterial and fungal community structures in traditional koumiss from Inner Mongolia, China, were investigated. Our results demonstrated that 6 bacterial phyla represented by 126 genera and 49 species and 3 fungal phyla represented by 59 genera and 57 species were detected in 11 samples of artisanal koumiss. Among them, Lactobacillus was the predominant genus of bacterium, and Kluyveromyces and Saccharomyces dominated at the fungal genus level. In addition, there were no differences in the bacterial and fungal richness and diversity of koumiss from 3 neighboring administrative divisions in Inner Mongolia, and the bacterial and fungal community structures (the varieties and relative abundance of bacterial and fungal genera and species) were clearly distinct in individual samples. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the bacterial and fungal population profiles and the predominant genus and species, which would be beneficial for screening, isolation, and culture of potential probiotics to simulate traditional fermentation of koumiss for industrial and standardized production in the future.",Rumen microbial responses to supplemental nitrate. II. Potential interactions with live yeast culture on the prokaryotic community and methanogenesis in continuous culture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639000,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 08,"Nitrates have been fed to ruminants, including dairy cows, as an electron sink to mitigate CH4 emissions. In the NO3- reduction process, NO2- can accumulate, which could directly inhibit methanogens and possibly other microbes in the rumen. Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast was hypothesized to decrease NO2- through direct reduction or indirectly by stimulating the bacterium Selenomonas ruminantium, which is among the ruminal bacteria most well characterized to reduce both NO3- and NO2-. Ruminal fluid was incubated in continuous cultures fed diets without or with NaNO3 (1.5% of diet dry matter; i.e., 1.09% NO3-) and without or with live yeast culture (LYC) fed at a recommended 0.010 g/d (scaled from cattle to fermentor intakes) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments with LYC had increased NDF digestibility and acetate:propionate by increasing acetate molar proportion but tended to decrease total VFA production. The main effect of NO3- increased acetate:propionate by increasing acetate molar proportion; NO3- also decreased molar proportions of isobutyrate and butyrate. Both NO3- and LYC shifted bacterial community composition (based on relative sequence abundance of 16S rRNA genes). An interaction occurred such that NO3- decreased valerate molar proportion only when no LYC was added. Nitrate decreased daily CH4 emissions by 29%. However, treatment × time interactions were present for both CH4 and H2 emission from the headspace; CH4 was decreased by the main effect of NO3- until 6 h postfeeding, but NO3- and LYC decreased H2 emission up to 4 h postfeeding. As expected, NO3- decreased methane emissions in continuous cultures; however, contrary to expectations, LYC did not attenuate NO2- accumulation."

In contrast to ambient air and working environments, legally binding regulations are only partially established for indoor contaminants, and other available European guidelines are limited. To correct these deficits, the German Committee on Indoor Guide Values (AIR), formerly known as the Ad hoc Working Group (Ad hoc AG), performed health assessments of indoor air contaminants. The main tasks were to develop toxicologically based indoor air guide values, health-based guideline values, and reference values largely based on the 95th percentile of the concentrations found in a reference population. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the indoor air values set in Germany and discuss the basis of their derivation.

Sensitivity of these models to the errors in post-imaging evaluation of displacements (reported to be ∼0.4-0.9° and 0.2-0.3 mm in vertebral displacements) has not yet been investigated. A Monte Carlo analysis was therefore used to assess the sensitivity of results in both musculoskeletal (MS) and passive finite element (FE) spine models to errors in measured displacements. Six static activities in upright standing, flexed, and extended postures were initially simulated using a force-control hybrid MS-FE model. Computed vertebral displacements were subsequently used to drive two distinct fully displacement-control MS and FE models. Effects of alterations in the reference vertebral displacements (at 3 error levels with SD (standard deviation) = 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mm in input translations together with, respectively, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6° in input rotations) were investigated on the model predictions. Results indicated that outputs of both models had substantial task-dependent sensitivities to errors in the measured vertebral translations. For instance, L5-S1 intradiscal pressures (IDPs) were considerably affected (SD values reaching 1.05 MPa) and axial compression and shear forces even reversed directions as translation errors increased to 0.3 mm. Outputs were however generally much less sensitive to errors in measured vertebral rotations.
