Previous studies observed downregulation of T-cadherin expression in GC tissues, suggesting that this protein may act as an oncosuppressor. The current study investigated the activity of T-cadherin in GC tissues. In a follow-up study of 81 patients with GC, a Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival revealed a strong association of T-cadherin overexpression with increased overall survival (P<0.01). Furthermore, stable T-cadherin-overexpressing cell lines were established from HGC-27 cells via transfection of a pcDNA3.1-T-cadherin plasmid and in vitro growth and cell cycle of these cells were measured using MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. MTT assays revealed that proliferation of engineered T-cadherin-overexpressing cells was significantly inhibited and flow cytometry demonstrated that T-cadherin overexpression in HGC-27 cells induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Transwell assays demonstrated that T-cadherin-overexpressing HGC-27 cells exhibited reduced invasiveness and metastatic potential. Phosphorylated (p)-protein kinase B (AKT) and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein levels were reduced in T-cadherin overexpressing HGC-27 cells, suggesting that the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was involved in the gastric tumor inhibitory effect of T-cadherin. Administration of AKT-activator, insulin-like growth factor-1, to T-cadherin-overexpressing HGC-27 cells significantly affected the proliferation phenotype. In conclusion, the current study provided clinical evidence and revealed a potential mechanism supporting that T-cadherin inhibits gastric tumorigenesis through inhibition of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.",Penehyclidine hydrochloride exerts protective effects in rats with acute lung injury via the Fas/FasL signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988742,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a critical syndrome that is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The activation of the Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) signaling pathway may be an important pathophysiological mechanism during ALI development. Penehyclidine hydrochloride (PHC) has been revealed to exhibit anti-apoptotic properties and may attenuate the observed systemic inflammatory response. The present study was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of PHC in the regulation of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway in rats with ALI. An ALI rat model was constructed by inducing blunt chest trauma and hemorrhagic shock (T/HS), with PHC administration prior to or following T/HS. At 6 h following T/HS, blood samples and lung tissues were collected. Western blotting, arterial blood gas analysis, ELISA, hematoxylin and eosin staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining and biochemical indicator analysis were performed to determine the degree of lung injury and the key signaling pathways associated with lung damage. The results indicated that the administration of PHC following T/HS effectively attenuates lung injury by improving pulmonary oxygenation, decreasing histopathological damage, decreasing polymorphonuclear neutrophil count and decreasing Fas, FasL, caspase-8, caspase-3, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β expression. The results indicated that PHC exhibits anti-apoptotic functions and exerts protective effects in ALI rats induced by T/HS, which may be attributed to the inhibition of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway.",The inhibitory role of recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand immunoglobulin G on portal vein thrombosis based on a novel rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988741,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"The current study aimed to reveal a novel method for constructing a portal vein thrombosis (PVT) model in rats and to evaluate the inhibitory role of recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand immunoglobulin G (rPSGL-Ig) on the formation of PVT. The PVT model was constructed in rats through intermittent portal vein obstruction (IPVO) combined with endangium destruction. A total of 4 mg/kg rPSGL-Ig was intraperitoneally pre-injected into rats 1 h prior to model construction. Changes in the thrombus size and vessel diameter were observed by B-scan ultrasonography. Histopathological changes in the portal vein, central hepatic vein and vasa intestini tenuis were observed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Additionally, histopathological changes in the portal vein were observed by transmission electron microscopy. A total of 8 mg/kg rPSGL-Ig or 2×104 U/kg urokinase were used to compare the thrombolytic effects and thrombus sizes. The PVT model was successfully constructed in rats, and exhibited a significantly greater thrombus size and vessel diameter compared with the control group (P<0.05). Intervention with rPSGL-Ig significantly inhibited the formation of PVT, and resulted in a significantly lower thrombus size and vessel diameter compared with the model group (P<0.05). Additionally, histopathological changes in the portal vein, central hepatic vein and vasa intestini tenuis in PVT rats were considerably reversed following the intervention with rPSGL-Ig. rPSGL-Ig demonstrated a lower thrombolytic effect compared with that of URO. IPVO combined with endangium destruction effectively constructed a PVT model in rats. rPSGL-Ig effectively prevented PVT in rats. rPSGL-Ig may be used in future studies for the treatment of patients with PVT.",Vascular repair and anti-inflammatory effects of soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988740,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in pediatric patients in developed countries. Coronary artery aneurysms and myocardial infarction may occur if the disease remains untreated. An estimated 10-20% of KD patients do not respond to intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG), and thus, alternative treatments are currently being investigated. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are natural anti-inflammatory factors and angiogenic mediators degraded by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). sEH inhibitory factors have been demonstrated to stabilize EET levels, inhibit inflammation and promote vascular repair in vivo. The present study aimed to determine whether an increase in EET levels induced by treatment with the sEH inhibitor 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido)-dodecanoic acid (AUDA) promotes vascular repair in human coronary arterial endothelial cells (HCAECs) and reduces inflammation in a mouse model of KD induced by Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract. The effect of AUDA on vascular repair in HCAECs was assessed by using cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation assays, and the anti-inflammatory effect of AUDA in the mouse model of KD was determined by detecting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β at the protein level via ELISA. The results demonstrated that AUDA increased the proliferation, migration, adhesion and tube formation ability of HCAECs in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in the mouse model of KD, AUDA reduced the protein expression of MMP-9, IL-1β and TNF-α, indicating that AUDA may alleviate inflammatory reactions in the coronary arteries of KD model mice. The present results also indicate that these effects may be exerted through the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ signaling pathway. Taken together, the present study supports the potential utility of AUDA in the treatment of KD.",Glucagon-like peptide-1 modulates RAW264.7 macrophage polarization by interfering with the JNK/STAT3 signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988739,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Insulin resistance and metabolic disorders are closely associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. Aberrant macrophage activation to M1 or M2 is characterized by a deleterious state of chronic inflammation and loss of positive trophic signals. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is used to treat diabetes due to its beneficial role against insulin resistance. The present study examined the effect of GLP-1 on macrophage activation, which contributed to M2 polarization and secretion of anti-inflammatory factors. In addition, the present study demonstrated that GLP-1 was able to reduce M1 polarization and inflammatory response by using the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and detecting M1/M2-specific genes. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with GLP-1 in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide or interleukin-4, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and signal transduction and transcriptional activation factor 3 (STAT3) activity was assessed by quantification of phosphorylation expression and macrophage polarization was determined by detecting M1/M2-specific genes expression. The results demonstrated that GLP-1/GLP-1 receptor attenuated the phosphorylation of JNK and its signal transduction through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein kinase A signaling pathway, while the phosphorylation of STAT3 increased through following treatment with GLP-1. The present study observed that GLP-1 exerts its beneficial effects on macrophage polarization by modulating the JNK/STAT3 signaling pathway. The present results also suggested that the effects of GLP-1 on endocrine and metabolic diseases are possibly mediated by modulation of signaling pathways, and provide a basis for pharmacologic targeting of macrophage activation and an insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of metabolic diseases.",Effects of MDP-based primers on shear bond strength between resin cement and zirconia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988738,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) ceramics are widely used for fixed dental prostheses and dental implants. Various primers have been introduced to enhance the bonding strength of zirconia crowns. The aim of current study was to analyze the effects of 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) primers on the shear bond strength between zirconia crowns and resin cement were assessed. The total sample size included 90 samples of Y-TZP ceramic surfaces. Samples in group I were abraded with aluminum oxide. Samples in groups II and III were abraded and primed with the zirconia and Z-PrimePlus MDP primers, respectively. Group IV samples did not undergo any treatment or application. Group V and VI samples did not undergo any abrasion but were primed with zirconia and Z-PrimePlus MDP primers, respectively. Prior to bonding of the resin cement, the primers were applied for 1 min and air-dried. Then, Clearfil SA luting self-adhesive resin cement was coated onto the zirconia crowns. The highest bond strength was achieved in group III, followed by group II, and group IV exhibited the lowest bond strength between Y-TZP ceramic and adhesive resin cement. Therefore, the application of MDP primers yielded greater bond strength between Y-TZP ceramics and adhesive resin cement, compared with the group without the use of primers.",The combined effect of mesenchymal stem cells and resveratrol on type 1 diabetic neuropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988737,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is one of the most common diabetic complications that results in an increase in patient discomfort and pain. The present study demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or resveratrol (RSV) may improve diabetic hyperglycemia and neuropathy. The aim of the present study was to investigate the combined effect of MSCs and RSV on DN. A total of 100 non-obese diabetic mice were divided into the following six groups: Normal control, MSCs, RSV, MSCs + RSV, insulin and diabetic control groups. Following homologous therapy, the levels of blood glucose and C-peptide, islets, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, nerve growth factor (NGF) and myelin basic protein (MBP), and the sciatic nerve structure in each group were examined and evaluated. Following the administration of therapy, the levels of blood glucose and C-peptide in mice in the MSCs + RSV group were significantly improved when compared with the other diabetic groups, and the dosage of insulin therapy required was the lowest among the six experimental groups (P<0.05). The levels of NGF, MBP and NF-κB in the MSCs + RSV group were significantly improved compared with the MSCs and RSV groups (P<0.05). Furthermore, the diameter of the axon, number of myelinated nerve fibers and the depth of the myelin sheath in the MSCs + RSV group were greatest among the five examined groups (excluding the control). The combination of RSV and MSCs could relieve hyperglycemia and improve DN. This indicated that the combination of RSV and MSCs may be a novel therapeutic method for the treatment of DN.",Effects of demographic factors on adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988736,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Stem cells have the characteristics of long-term self-renewal and plasticity and the ability to differentiate into specialized cells. Stem cells are widely recognized as potential tools for use in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of demographic factors on adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation in bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC) spheroids. Age- and gender-associated alterations in the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs were examined. Human BMSCs were isolated from male and female participants in their 20s, 30s and 50s. Cell morphology and relative values of adipogenesis and chondrogenesis were examined by measuring the relative intensity of oil red O and Alcian blue staining, respectively. Cell morphology alterations in BMSCs isolated from male and female participants in their 20s, 30s and 50s and grown in adipogenic media were very similar. In addition, there were no significant differences in the relative values of adipogenesis in BMSCs for the 20s, 30s and 50s age groups on day 8 and 16. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the relative values of adipogenesis in BMSCs for the male and female groups on day 8 and 16. Cell morphology changes in BMSCs isolated from male and female participants in their 20s, 30s and 50s and grown in chondrogenic media were very similar. In addition, there were no significant differences in the relative values of chondrogenesis in BMSCs for the 20s, 30s and 50s age groups on day 8, however there was a significant difference observed in the relative values of chondrogenesis in BMSCs on day 16 for the 30s and 50s age groups, compared with the 20s age group. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in the relative values of adipogenesis in BMSCs for the male and female groups on day 8 and 16. The current study demonstrated that there were no significant differences in the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs isolated from healthy male donors vs. healthy female donors. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the adipogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs isolated from different age groups on day 8. However, there was a significant increase in the chondrogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs isolated from participants in their 30s and 50s, compared with BMSCs isolated from participants in their 20s on day 16.",LncRNA ZEB1-AS1 reduces liver cancer cell proliferation by targeting miR-365a-3p.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988735,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Liver carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial mediators that participate in a wide range of molecular processes associated with carcinogenesis. However, little is known about the specific mechanisms that underlie the majority of lncRNAs. Many studies have indicated that lncRNAs affect microRNA (miRNA or miR) activities via physical base-paired binding, therefore serving as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that indirectly regulate the expression of miRNA targets. In the current study, it was revealed that lncRNA zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 antisense 1 (ZEB1-AS1) serves as a ceRNA for miR-365a-3p, functioning to positively modulate E2F transcription factor 2 (E2F2) expression in liver cancer cells. Additionally, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that levels of ZEB1-AS1 were abnormally upregulated in liver cancer and this was positively correlated with E2F2 expression. Furthermore, high levels of ZEB1-AS1 exhibited a trend for poor survival in patients with liver cancer. Western blot analysis demonstrated that ZEB1-AS1 silencing could reduce E2F2 expression. EdU staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that downregulation of ZEB1-AS1 could suppress cell proliferation and decrease the S phase proportion of liver cancer cells, which was effectively reversed by the inhibition of miR-365a-3p. ZEB1-AS1 was also determined to be physically associated with miR-365a-3p, while miR-365a-3p was revealed to target the E2F2 3'UTR for degradation or translational repression. The results also demonstrated that ZEB1-AS1 positively regulates E2F2 expression by competitively binding to miR-365a-3p. It was further revealed to enhance liver cancer cell proliferation. Thus, these results indicate that ZEB1-AS1 is required for liver cancer progression in a ceRNA dependent manner. ZEB1-AS1 may therefore be a potential target for liver cancer intervention.",miRNA-214 suppresses oxidative stress in diabetic nephropathy via the ROS/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and uncoupling protein 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988734,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"In the present study, the function of microRNA (miR)-214 on diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetes of proximal tubular cells was investigated. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used measure the expression of miR-214 in rats with DN and ELISA was performed to measure oxidative stress and ROS levels. Results indicated that miR-214 expression in the peripheral blood was significantly decreased in rats with DN. The in vitro model of DN indicated that miR-214 upregulation significantly decreased oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, but significantly increased uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), phosphorylated (p)-Akt and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein expression levels. The administration of genipin, a UCP2 inhibitor, significantly attenuated the effects of miR-214 upregulation on oxidative stress in the in vitro DN model by regulating ROS, Akt and mTOR protein expression levels. Notably, Akt inhibitor suppressed p-Akt protein expression and attenuated the effects of miR-214 upregulation on oxidative stress in the in vitro DN model. Collectively, these data suggest that miR-214 regulates diabetes through a ROS/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by UCP2 in proximal tubular cells."

A lentivirus shRNA vector targeting Skp2 was constructed and transfected into HEC-1-A cells. HEC-1-A cells transfected with a scramble sequence were used as negative controls. The mRNA and protein expression of Skp2, p27, cyclin D1 and caspase-3 were detected via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The effects of Skp2 inhibition on the cell cycle, apoptosis and proliferation of HEC-1-A cells were detected using flow cytometry and a cell counting kit-8. Skp2 co-expression data was analyzed using Oncomine and TCGA databases. The positive recombinant viral clones were identified via PCR and confirmed via sequencing. The mRNA and protein expression of Skp2 were significantly decreased in HEC-1-A cells transfected with the lentiviral vectors compared with the negative control. In addition, there were no significant changes in the mRNA expression of p27 and cyclin D1; however, the protein levels of p27 and cyclin D1 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in HEC-1-A cells transfected with lentiviral vectors compared with negative controls. RNAi-induced Skp2 inhibition exerted an anti-proliferative effect by inducing cell cycle arrest, however cell apoptosis was not significantly affected. In the TCGA database, Skp2 expression positively associated with IGF2R, IGF2BP3, IGFBP1 and CCNF, while Skp2 expression negatively associated with IGF2, IGFBP6, IGFBP7 and IGFBP3. RNAi-induced Skp2 inhibition upregulated the protein expression of p27 and downregulated the protein expression of cyclin D1. The expression of Skp2 in endometrial cancer may therefore be regulated by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor signaling pathway.",Therapeutic effect of carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 on acute lung injury after hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988722,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (HSR) induces a pulmonary inflammatory response and frequently causes acute lung injury. Carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-3 (CORM-3) has been reported to liberate and deliver CO under physiological conditions, which exerts organ-protective effects during systemic insults. The present study aimed to determine whether the administration of CORM-3 following HSR exerts a therapeutic effect against HSR-induced lung injury without any detrimental effects on oxygenation and hemodynamics. To induce hemorrhagic shock, rats were bled to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30 mmHg for 45 min and then resuscitated with the shed blood. CORM-3 or a vehicle was intravenously administered immediately following the completion of resuscitation. The rats were divided into four groups, including sham, HSR, HSR/CORM-3 and HSR/inactive CORM-3 groups. Arterial blood gas parameters and vital signs were recorded during HSR. The histopathological changes to the lungs were evaluated using a lung injury score, while pulmonary edema was evaluated on the basis of the protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the lung wet/dry ratio. We also investigated the pulmonary expression levels of inflammatory mediators and apoptotic markers such as cleaved caspase-3 and transferase-mediated dUTP-fluorescein isothiocyanate nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Although HSR caused significant lung histopathological damage and pulmonary edema, CORM-3 significantly ameliorated this damage. CORM-3 also attenuated the HSR-induced upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-α, inducible nitric oxide synthase and interleukin-1β genes, and the expression of interleukin-1β and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. In addition, the expression of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was inversely enhanced by CORM-3, which also reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 following HSR. Although CORM-3 was administered during the acute phase of HSR, it did not exert any influence on arterial blood gas analysis data and vital signs during HSR. Therefore, treatment with CORM-3 ameliorated HSR-induced lung injury, at least partially, through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, without any detrimental effects on oxygenation and hemodynamics.",Immune regulation mechanism of vitamin D level and IL-17/IL-17R pathway in Crohn's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988721,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Immune regulation mechanism of vitamin D level and interleukin (IL)-17/IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) pathway in Crohn's disease was studied. Of 40 clean mature healthy rats, 10 rats were used as control group based on random number table, the remaining 30 rats to establish Crohn's disease rat models. After successful modeling, 30 rats were divided into model group, low-dose group and high-dose group with random number table. On the 1st day after modeling, rats in low-dose group were given a single dose of 1,750 IU of vitamin D, and rats in high-dose group a single dose of 7,500 IU of vitamin D. Changes in the condition of rats after modeling were observed and scored. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for detecting IL-12, IL-17 and CXCL11 levels, western blotting for detecting IL-17R level, and flow cytometry for detecting Th1 cell and Th17 cell levels in the lamina propria of colon mucosa. Disease activity index scores were significantly lower in low-dose group and high-dose group of rats than those in model group (P<0.05). Those were significantly lower in high-dose group of rats than those in low-dose group (P<0.05). IL-17 and IL-17R levels were significantly lower in high-dose group of rats than those in low-dose group (P<0.05). Th1 cell level was significantly higher in high-dose group of rats than that in low-dose group (P<0.05), but Th17 cell level was lower than that in low-dose group (P<0.05). IL-12 levels were significantly higher in model group, low-dose group and highdose group of rats than those in control group (P<0.05). CXCL11 levels were significantly lower in model group, low-dose group and high-dose group of rats than those in control group (P<0.05). Vitamin D can effectively treat Crohn's disease, which may improve the chemotaxis and differentiation of Th1 cells by inhibiting IL-17/IL-17R pathway, thereby improving immune function and reducing the severity of disease.",Clinical efficacy of octreotide acetate combined with thrombin in the treatment of liver cirrhosis complicated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988720,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Clinical efficacy of octreotide acetate combined with thrombin in the treatment of liver cirrhosis complicated with gastrointestinal hemorrhage was investigated. A retrospective analysis of 157 patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage admitted to Weifang People's Hospital from March 2012 to September 2014 was performed. Among them, 74 patients treated with octreotide acetate were enrolled into the octreotide group, and 83 patients treated with octreotide acetate combined with thrombin were enrolled into the combination group. Comparison between the two groups was made in terms of the average hemostasis time, the hospitalization time, the amount of blood transfusion during hospitalization, the efficacy of hemostasis and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. The mean hemostasis time of the octreotide group was higher than that of the combination group, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P<0.05); the hospitalization time of the octreotide group was significantly longer than that of the combination group (P<0.05); the blood transfusion volume of patients in the octreotide group was significantly higher than that of the combination group (P<0.05); the overall effective rate of the combination group after treatment was higher than the overall effective rate of the octreotide group (89.19%) (P<0.05). The VAS scores of the combination group at 24 and 72 h after treatment were lower than those of the octreotide group (P<0.05); the VAS scores of both the octreotide and the combination group at 24 and 72 h after treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment (P<0.05). In conclusion, the combination of octreotide acetate and thrombin is worthy of clinical promotion as it could reduce the average hemostasis time, the bleeding volume, and the hospitalization time of patients with liver cirrhosis combined with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, with better efficacy than the use of octreotide acetate alone.",An integrative module analysis of DNA methylation landscape in aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988719,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"To investigate the molecular mechanism of aging, the combination of module analysis and DNA methylation data was used to detect dynamically controlled modules for aging. Multiple differential expression networks (DENs) were constructed based on the microarray profiles across different aging groups (<70 years, 70-80 years, and >80 years). Next, a module-based approach was utilized to extract the common candidate modules across all age groups. We used Module Connectivity Dynamic Score (MCDS) to quantify the connectivity change of the common modules among the different age groups. Functional analyses were implemented for the genes in the common modules to further identify the significant biological processes. A total of two DENs were constructed. Overall 657 informative genes were screened out. When false discovery rate (FDR) was set as 0.05, we found that 148 modules were significant. Only 1 significant 2-differential modules (DMs) (module 493) with dynamic changes was discovered. Significantly, the genes in the module 493 participated in 7 significant pathways, including pentose phosphate pathway, carbon metabolism, and citrate cycle (TCA cycle). In conclusion, pathway functions [pentose phosphate pathway, carbon metabolism, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), chromosomal instability, ateroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and immune response] may serve as potential therapeutic targets in aging.",Clinical features and treatment of 140 cases of Marjolin's ulcer at a major burn center in southwest China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988718,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Marjolin's ulcer is a type of malignant tumor that occurs in scar tissue. The present study aimed to summarize and analyze the aetiology, clinical characteristics, treatment methods, metastasis and prognosis of this disease. A total of 140 cases of Marjolin's ulcer encountered at the Institute of Burn Research, Southwest Hospital (Chongqing, China) between January 2013 and December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, occurrence of bone invasion and lymph node metastasis, as well as treatment and prognosis were statistically analyzed. Among the 140 patients, the initial injury or primary disease occurred at 1-75 years of age, while Marjolin's ulcer occurred at 15-85 years of age (mean, 53.3±1.2 years). The mean latency period was 28.8±1.7 years. The most common initial injury of the patients was flame burns, followed by skin masses, trauma, skin ulcerations caused by repeated scratching/friction, and scalding. The age at onset of initial injury or disease in patients had a significantly negative correlation with the latency period (P<0.01). The most common lesion locations were the lower limbs (42.1%), followed by the head, face and neck (34.5%). Of the 140 patients, 46 cases (32.9%) had bone invasion, 33 cases (23.6%) had lymph node enlargement and only 5 cases (3.6%) had lymph node metastasis. The skull was the bone that was most susceptible to Marjolin's ulcer invasion. The prevalence of bone invasion in patients with head, face and neck lesions was significantly higher than that in patients with lesions in other locations (P<0.01). The surgical methods applied were skin grafting, local flap repair, amputation and island flap repair. In the 65 cases who underwent follow-up, recurrence mainly occurred within 1 year after surgery. In conclusion, Marjolin's ulcer mainly occurred in males and was a scar carcinoma after a flame burn in most cases. Autologous skin grafting and local skin flap repair were the major repair methods. The peak period of recurrence was within one year after surgery and patients should receive regular follow-ups.",Felodipine-associated gingival overgrowth in a type 2 diabetic patient: A case report and literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988717,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Gingival overgrowth (GO) includes gingival enlargement and hyperplasia and may be induced by certain drugs, including calcium channel blockers (CCBs), particularly first-generation CCBs. However, to date, only few cases of GO induced by second- or third-generation CCBs have been reported. The present study reports on a case of a 48-year-old diabetic male who was admitted to the First Hospital of Jilin University (Changchun, China) due to poor blood glucose control. This patient was diagnosed with GO. Review of the patient's medical history revealed diagnoses of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, as well as the use of felodipine, a second-generation CCB, to control hypertension. The hypertensive drugs were replaced and the new drugs helped the patient control his blood glucose levels. Additionally, the patient was instructed on methods he could use to improve his oral hygiene, including rinsing of the teeth following each meal and increasing the frequency of tooth brushing per day. After 3 months, the clinical symptoms of GO were relieved. The relevant literature was also reviewed to gain an improved understanding of the correlation between GO and CCBs, as well as diabetes and poor oral hygiene.",Identification of atherosclerosis-related prioritizing metabolites based on a multi-omics composite network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988716,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Metabolites are the final products of cellular regulation processes, their level is the ultimate response of biological systems to environmental and genetic changes. Therefore, the identification of key metabolites is required for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. In this study, atherosclerosis-related gene expression profile information was extracted from ArrayExpress database (GEOD-57691), and analyzed with limma package. Furthermore, we constructed an intricate multi-omics network involved in genes, phenotypes, metabolites and their associations. To identify the prioritization of atherosclerosis-related metabolites, the relation score of each metabolite in the composite network was computed with the random walk with restart (RWR) method. The top 50 metabolites and top 100 genes were chosen based on the score in the weighted composite network. Consequently, several key metabolites that were ranked in the top 5 of relation score or degree greater than 70 were confirmed. Particularly, metabolites Tretinoin and Estraderm not only have high relation scores, but also contain more degrees. Moreover, we obtained 24 co-expression genes that may be regarded as the targets of atherosclerosis therapy. Therefore, identification of metabolite prioritizations by the composite network integrated the information of genes, phenotypes and metabolites may be available to diagnose atherosclerosis, and can provide the potential therapeutic strategies for atherosclerosis.",Effect of transformer noise on the neurophysiology of SD rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988715,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Transformer noise is a type of environmental sound that causes discomfort to individuals. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of relatively long-term periods of transformer noise on the behavior and neurophysiology of SD rats. A total of 90 healthy SD rats with normal hearing were randomly divided into two experimental groups (65 and 60 dB group) and a control group. The experimental groups were exposed to recorded transformer noise for 8 weeks (sound level limits: 65 or 60 dB) and the control group was maintained under the same conditions without noise stimulation. Changes in physiological growth (weight tests), behavior (tail suspension and open field behavior tests) and neurophysiology (glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, the morphologies of hippocampi) following noise exposure were recorded and compared. The results revealed that rats exhibited normal physiological growth, with no significant difference between the experimental and control groups. Following noise exposure, no significant differences were observed in the results of behavioral experiments (tail suspension and open field behavior tests) between the experimental and control groups. In addition, there were no significant differences in glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels or in the morphologies of hippocampi between groups. In conclusion, exposure to transformer noise with a sound level limit of 65 dB sound pressure level (SPL) or 60 dB SPL (spectral range, 100-800 Hz) for 8 weeks (10 h/day) had no significant impact on the behavior and neurophysiology of SD rats.",TEG in the monitoring of coagulation changes in patients with sepsis and the clinical significance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988714,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Application values of thromboelastography (TEG) in dynamic monitoring of coagulation parameters of sepsis patients were investigated. Eighty-one patients with sepsis who were admitted to the ICU department of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from April 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 were collected. Clinical data of the patients were collected. Data were compared using 5 grouping methods: i) the 81 patients were divided into the sepsis group (n=45) and sepsis shock group (n=36); ii) patients were divided into two groups: group A (APACHE II score ≤13, n=51); group B (APACHE II score >13, n=30); iii) according to Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Diagnosis Integral System (CDSS), patients were divided into non-disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) group (CDSS <7 points) and DIC group (CDSS ≥7 points); TEG indexes were compared between the two groups; iv) correlation between TEG indexes and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores was analyzed; v) patients were divided into survival group and non-survival group and correlations between TEG indicators and prognosis were analyzed. At 6 h after ICU entry, compared with sepsis group, R value and K time were significantly increased, LY30 was also increased, while MA value, coagulation index (CI), and α angle were significantly decreased in the septic shock group (P<0.05). At 6 h after ICU entry, compared with sepsis group, R value and K time were significantly increased, while MA value, CI, and α angle were significantly decreased in the septic shock group (P<0.05). Compared with the non-DIC group, the DIC group had prolonged K time, decreased α angle, increased R value, and decreased CI and MA value (P<0.05). With increase of SOFA scores, R value and K value increased significantly, and α angle, MA value, and CI decreased significantly (P<0.05). According to TEG, platelet function and fibrinogen function of DIC patients were significantly reduced, and the body showed hypocoagulability."

This is due to the increased production of free radicals, excitatory amino acids and pro-inflammatory cytokines causing secondary damage to the brain. Simple thrombolytic therapy has not been the best approach for treating ischemia/reperfusion injury. Excessive perfusion leads to failure of the body's self-regulatory functions, which in turn increases the area of cerebral edema and aggravates cerebral ischemia. Previous studies have evaluated the satiety hormone leptin as a link between energy expenditure and obesity. Of note, leptin, which is involved in brain development, synaptic transmission and angiogenesis following ischemia/reperfusion injury, has been considered an important factor for treating ischemia/reperfusion injury. The present review outlines the discovery of leptin and discusses its association with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.",Defining the genetic profile of endometriosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988702,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 18,"Endometriosis is a pathological condition which has been extensively studied, since its pathophysiology stems from a broad spectrum of environmental influences and genetic factors. Familial studies aim at defining inheritance trends, while linkage analysis studies focus on the identification of genetic sites related to endometriosis susceptibility. Genetic association studies take into account candidate genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms, and hence target at unraveling the association between disease severity and genetic variation. The common goal of various types of studies is, through genetic mapping methods, the timely identification of therapeutic strategies for disease symptoms, including pelvic pain and infertility, as well as efficient counselling. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) play a primary role in depicting genetic contributions to disease development, they entail a certain bias as regards the case-control nature of their design and the reproducibility of the results. Nevertheless, genetic-oriented studies and the implementation of the results through clinical tests, hold a considerable advantage in proper disease management. In this review article, we present information about gene-gene and gene-environment interactions involved in endometriosis and discuss the effectiveness of GWAS in identitying novel potential therapeutic targets in an attempt to develop novel therapeutic strategies for a better management and treatment of patients with endometriosis.","Transcriptionally promiscuous ""blurry"" promoters in Tc1/mariner transposons allow transcription in distantly related genomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988701,Mobile DNA,2019 04 18,"We have recently described a peculiar feature of the promoters in two Drosophila Tc1-like elements, Bari1 and Bari3.

Growth and morphology have critical implications for product titres in both submerged and solid-state fermentations. Recent advances in systems-level understanding of the filamentous lifestyle and development of sophisticated synthetic biological tools for controlled manipulation of fungal genomes now allow rational strain development programs based on data-driven decision making. In this review, we focus on Aspergillus spp. and other industrially utilised fungi to summarise recent insights into the multifaceted and dynamic relationship between filamentous growth and product titres from genetic, metabolic, modelling, subcellular, macromorphological and process engineering perspectives. Current progress and knowledge gaps with regard to mechanistic understanding of product secretion and export from the fungal cell are discussed. We highlight possible strategies for unlocking lead genes for rational strain optimizations based on omics data, and discuss how targeted genetic manipulation of these candidates can be used to optimise fungal morphology for improved performance. Additionally, fungal signalling cascades are introduced as critical processes that can be genetically targeted to control growth and morphology during biotechnological applications. Finally, we review progress in the field of synthetic biology towards chassis cells and minimal genomes, which will eventually enable highly programmable filamentous growth and diversified production capabilities. Ultimately, these advances will not only expand the fungal biotechnology portfolio but will also significantly contribute to a sustainable bio-economy.",Systematic analysis of the effects of different nitrogen source and ICDH knockout on glycolate synthesis in Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988698,Journal of biological engineering,2019 04 18,"Glycolate is an important α-hydroxy carboxylic acid widely used in industrial and consumer applications.

The drug is a re-emerging bactericidal antibiotic with a wide range of actions against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the existing antibacterial agents, fosfomycin has the lowest molecular weight (138 Da), which is not structurally associated with other classes of antibiotics. In intensive care unit (ICU) patients, severe soft tissue infections (STIs) may lead to serious life-threatening problems, and therefore, appropriate antibiotic therapy and often intensive care management (ICM) coupled with surgical intervention are necessary. Fosfomycin is an antibiotic primarily utilized for the treatment of STIs in ICUs. Recently, fosfomycin has attracted renewed interest for the treatment of serious systemic infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. In some countries, intravenous fosfomycin has been prescribed for various serious systemic infections, such as acute osteomyelitis, nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections, complicated urinary tract infections, bacterial meningitis, and bacteremia.

We aimed to describe psychological disorders and assess quality of life in children with chronic ITP and compared their results with their healthy peers. A cross-sectional comparative study was carried out in a tertiary care university-affiliated hospital during a period from November, 2015 till April, 2018. We enrolled 119 children with chronic ITP and compared with 220 healthy peers. Relevant demographic and clinical data were collected and statistically analyzed. Quality of life for both patients and control groups was measured using pediatric quality of life inventory version 4 (Arabic one). Also psychiatric evaluation of both groups was done using Arabic version of Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children (Mini-KID). Majority of patients (90.7%) exhibited mucocutaneous bleeding. Most of patients (61.3%) did not need any definitive treatment for chronic ITP while 38.6% received second line therapy.

ACS patients were divided into 3 clinical subgroups (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and unstable angina), and 2 age subgroups (group A ≤ 55 years, and group B > 55 years). Plasma PZ levels were evaluated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Lower PZ levels were found in ACS patients' group and clinical subgroups compared with controls. PZ levels showed a decrease with increasing age and were lower in females versus males. Lower PZ levels were found in hypertensive ACS patients in both age subgroups. Smokers and patients with family history of ACS in group A had lower PZ levels, while group B revealed lower PZ among diabetic patients. In group A, increased number of ACS conventional risk factors was associated with lower PZ levels. PZ level 3.7 μg/mL was the best cut-off value for prediction of ACS. Logistic regression analyses approved PZ as an independent risk biomarker for ACS. PZ levels are reduced in stable ACS and are significantly and independently associated with increased susceptibility for ACS, denoting PZ deficiency as a reliable thrombophilic risk biomarker in Egyptian patients with ACS.","Prevalence of Low Platelet Count and Identification of Associating Determinants and Genetic Polymorphism in Healthy Individuals of Upper Assam, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988572,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,2019 04 18,"The purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence of low platelet count among the healthy population of upper Assam, India. The impact of socio-demographic features was moreover pointed to evaluate. Additionally, Mean platelet volume (MPV) and Interleukin-6 gene polymorphism (-174 G > C) were also determined to speculate their effect on the basal platelet count. For determination of hematological indices, CBC was done and genetic polymorphism was identified by ARMS-PCR technique. Out of 510 study subjects, 25.3% (n = 129) had low platelet count, and females were recorded with significantly higher mean platelet count as compared to their male counterpart (p < 0.001). A progressive decline in platelet count was observed with ageing and more significantly noticed in females across the various age groups (p < 0.001). The mean MPV was significantly higher in low platelet count group as compared to the normal group (p < 0.001). Both platelet count and MPV differed significantly among the individuals with varied ethnicity. An inverse correlation between platelet count and its volume was reported, and such observation was continued to persist in every age-group under the study. However, no significant differences were observed for other hematological indices between the studied groups except for platelet indices and RBC count. Moreover, the peripheral blood smear examined for cellular morphology and in vitro platelet clumping did not report any significant aberrancy. No significant penetrance of the risk allele was revealed in the studied groups. However, ARMS-PCR confirmed 6% (n = 8/129) of the low platelet count subjects with heterozygous for G allele. This happens to be the first description of low platelet count among the healthy population of upper Assam, where age, gender, ethnicity, and MPV are significantly associated with platelet count variation.

Fifty-eight patients were included [32(25-45) years; 97% male; GCS 6.3 ± 1.5]. 41% developed ATIC. Compared to no-ATIC, ATIC group had significantly prolonged κ-time (4.6 vs. 2.5 min; p = 0.01) and shortened α-angle (40.2° vs. 56.3°; p = 0.03).

The aim of this study was a mutational analysis in Iranians with this phenotype. Serological analyses including ABH and adsorption-elution tests were performed in five unrelated Bombay individuals. ABO genotyping was determined by direct sequencing. The coding regions of FUT1 and FUT2 genes were amplified and sequenced directly or after cloning into suitable vector. A novel missense FUT1 allele was detected (G1051T; G351C). Also four reported FUT1 alleles were revealed. Molecular analysis of FUT2 gene confirmed nonsecretor status in all individuals. This and our previous findings suggest the diversity and population specificity of FUT1 alleles.

Retrospectively reviewed medical records of 267 patients who were diagnosed and treated for ALL during study period at our centre. Fifty-one Ph + ALL patients (males = 31, females = 20) out of a total of 267 ALL patients were eligible for the study. Post induction 48 patients achieved complete remission while 1 died during induction. Forty-six patients received further treatment with TKI + CNS directed therapy and thereafter the consolidation therapy with Allo-SCT (n = 16) or chemotherapy + TKI (n = 30).Overall mortality was 7/51 (13.9%) (6/16 transplant related mortalities due to GVHD and infections and 1 induction death).

We have evaluated the characteristics of mesenchymal stromal cells in a cohort of patients with MDS with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-MLD). MSCs were cultured from bone marrow aspirates of MDS-MLD patients and controls with healthy bone marrow. Phenotypic characterization, cell cycle, and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Targeted gene expression analysis was done using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). MSCs derived from MDS patients (MDS-MSCs) showed normal morphology, phenotype, karyotype and differentiation potential towards adipogenic and osteogenic lineages. However, these MDS-MSCs showed significantly altered cell cycle status and displayed a shift towards increased apoptosis compared to control MSCs (C-MSCs). The gene expression profile of niche responsive/regulatory cytokines showed a trend towards lower expression VEGF, SCF, and ANGPT with no changes in expression of CXCL12A and LIF compared to C-MSCs. The expression levels of Notch signaling components like Notch ligands (JAGGED-1 and DELTA-LIKE-1), receptors (NOTCH1, NOTCH3) and downstream gene (HES1) showed an aberrant expression pattern in MDS-MSCs compared to C-MSCs. Similarly, Q-PCR analysis of Wnt signaling inhibitory ligands (DKK-1 and DKK-2) in MDS-MSCs showed a three-fold increase in mRNA expression of DKK1 and a two-fold increase in DKK2 compared to C-MSCs. These data suggested that MDS-MSCs have an altered proliferation characteristic as well as a dysregulated cytokine secretion and signaling profile.

Hence, CRISPR-Cas9 has found its way into most basic molecular laboratories and within reach of most low-middle income research groups. Despite these favourable advantages, there exists a cost barrier and lack of proper knowledge and awareness on the correct work flow desired, especially in molecular laboratories looking forward to develop and experiment with high end research. This mini review attempts to iron out these factors and project an algorithmic approach to tide over and establish a workable in vitro gene editing experiment in a resource constraint haematology oncology laboratory setting.

Fabricius remain enigmatic due to loss of the original type specimens, sketchy descriptions and lack of illustrations, but even some well-illustrated taxa remain unrecognized. This is the case for Hesperia busiris, a 'butterfly' illustrated by W.J. Jones, the identity of which has puzzled experts for 225 years. Here we argue that the description and illustrations of this species are a perfect fit to a colourful moth later described by F. Walker as Eusemia contigua. Furthermore, we present evidence that Walker unwittingly based his name on the same specimen as Fabricius, and that this is the only known example of this species. An extraordinary sequence of misconceptions led the geographic origin of this specimen to become thoroughly confused, so that it is currently unknown where on Earth this species may occur (although a substantial body of evidence points to West Africa) and if it is even still extant.",Unprecedented direct cupric-superoxo conversion to a bis-μ-oxo dicopper(III) complex and resulting oxidative activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988551,Inorganica chimica acta,2019 04 19,"Investigations of small molecule copper-dioxygen chemistry can and have provided fundamental insights into enzymatic processes (e.g., copper metalloenzyme dioxygen binding geometries and their associated spectroscopy and substrate reactivity). Strategically designing copper-binding ligands has allowed for insight into properties that favor specific (di)copper-dioxygen species. Herein, the tetradentate tripodal TMPA-based ligand (TMPA = tris((2-pyridyl)methyl)amine) possessing a methoxy moiety in the 6-pyridyl position on one arm (OCH3TMPA) was investigated. This system allows for a trigonal bipyramidal copper(II) geometry as shown by the UV-vis and EPR spectra of the cupric complex [(OCH3TMPA)CuII(OH2)](ClO4)2. Cyclic voltammetry experiments determined the reduction potential of this copper(II) species to be -0.35 V vs. Fc+/0 in acetonitrile, similar to other TMPA-derivatives bearing sterically bulky 6-pyridyl substituents. The copper-dioxygen reactivity is also analogous to these TMPA-derivatives, affording a bis-μ-oxo dicopper(III) complex, [{(OCH3TMPA)CuIII}2(O2-)2]2+, upon oxygenation of the copper(I) complex [(OCH3TMPA)CuI](B(C6F5)4) at cryogenic temperatures in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. This highly reactive intermediate is capable of oxidizing phenolic substrates through a net hydrogen atom abstraction. However, after bubbling of the precursor copper(I) complex with dioxygen at very low temperatures (-135 °C), a cupric superoxide species, [(OCH3TMPA)CuII(O2•-)]+, is initially formed before slowly converting to [{(OCH3TMPA)CuIII}2(O2-)2]2+.

The photodetector is based on the long-range dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton waveguide with a metal stripe deposited on top of a semiconductor rib and covered by another semiconductor. As the metal stripe is entirely surrounded by semiconductor, all hot electrons with appropriate k-vectors can participate in transitions that highly enhances the electron transfer, and consequently the internal quantum efficiency. In addition, a high coupling efficiency from the photonic waveguide to the photodetector is simulated exceeding 90 % which enhances the external quantum efficiency. Calculations show that a responsivity exceeding 0.5 A/W can be achieved at telecom wavelength of 1550 nm and the bandwidth can exceed 100 GHz. Furthermore, it is shown that titanium nitride is a perfect material for the photodetector as it provides a low Fermi energy and long electron mean free path that enhance the hot electron transfer to the semiconductor. In addition, it shows reasonable metallic behavior and CMOS compatibility. Measurements showed that the Schottky barrier height between titanium nitride and p-doped silicon reaches 0.69-0.70 eV that matches the optimum signal-to-noise ratio operation calculated at 0.697 eV.",Gastrointestinal diagnosis using non-white light imaging capsule endoscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988520,Nature reviews.

However, white light imaging (WLI) is the principal technology used in clinical CE at present, and therefore, CE is limited to mucosal inspection, with diagnosis remaining reliant on visible manifestations of disease. The introduction of WLI CE has motivated a wide range of research to improve its diagnostic capabilities through integration with other sensing modalities. These developments have the potential to overcome the limitations of WLI through enhanced detection of subtle mucosal microlesions and submucosal and/or transmural pathology, providing novel diagnostic avenues. Other research aims to utilize a range of sensors to measure physiological parameters or to discover new biomarkers to improve the sensitivity, specificity and thus the clinical utility of CE. This multidisciplinary Review summarizes research into non-WLI CE devices by organizing them into a taxonomic structure on the basis of their sensing modality.

The calculation of initial 234U/238U activity ratios in all samples younger than 500 ka shows high, reasonably constant values, with an average of 5.172 ± 0.520 (one standard deviation). Assuming that this value prevailed for periods older than 500 ka, we derived ages of up to approximately 1.2 Ma using the initial 234U excess decay. Our results indicate that the two older clusters have ages of 776 ± 14 ka for samples from between 8 and 10.1 m and 1173 ± 22 ka for deeper samples respectively. The palaeomagnetic record of the core shows normal polarity inclinations from the surface to around 9 m followed by reverse polarity inclination and antipodal declinations. The inversion is attributed to the Brunhes-Matuyama transition. 234U excess ages for the interval corresponding to the part of the core where the polarity inversion occurred are in the range of 735 ± 51 to 794 ± 54 ka, with an arithmetic mean value of 776 ± 14 ka for the B-M transition.

We examined complex state sequence data collected during a 30 min home pen play test, using the package TraMineR, where the states were defined as object play, locomotor/social play and no play. From behavioural observations, and based on the relative proportion of the different types of object play observed, each individual was later categorised as an initiator or joiner type of player. Initiators were found to be more solitary and to show more object play whereas joiners were more social and showed less object play. The majority of groups did not have an initiator type of player, yet on average they played more. Despite strong group and type of player effects, we identified three general individual play patterns. On a group level, our results demonstrate differences in how a period of playing develops, that playing with the object simultaneously occurs more often in groups than expected by chance and that the number of pigs playing together is stable over time.",A rare autism-associated MINT2/APBA2 mutation disrupts neurexin trafficking and synaptic function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988517,Scientific reports,2019 04 20,"MINT2/APBA2 is a synaptic adaptor protein involved in excitatory synaptic transmission. Several nonsynonymous coding variants in MINT2 have been identified in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, these rare variants have not been examined functionally and the pathogenic mechanisms are unknown. Here, we examined the synaptic effects of rat Mint2 N723S mutation (equivalent to autism-linked human MINT2 N722S mutation) which targets a conserved asparagine residue in the second PDZ domain of Mint2 that binds to neurexin-1α (Nrxn1α), a presynaptic cell-adhesion protein implicated in ASDs. We show the N723S mutation impairs Nrxn1α stabilization and trafficking to the membrane while binding to Nrxn1α remains unaffected. Using time-lapse imaging in primary mouse neurons, we found that the N723S mutant had more immobile puncta at neuronal processes compared to Mint2 wild type. We therefore, reasoned that the N723S mutant may alter the co-transport of Nrxn1α at axonal processes to presynaptic terminals. Indeed, we found the N723S mutation affected Nrxn1α localization at presynaptic terminals which correlated with a decrease in Nrxn-mediated synaptogenesis and miniature event frequency in excitatory synapses. Together, our data reveal Mint2 N723S leads to neuronal dysfunction, in part due to alterations in Nrxn1α surface trafficking and synaptic function of Mint2.",Detecting the mutational signature of homologous recombination deficiency in clinical samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988514,Nature genetics,2019 06 14,"Mutations in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) are the most common indication of deficiency in the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway. However, recent genome-wide analyses have shown that the same pattern of mutations found in BRCA1/2-mutant tumors is also present in several other tumors. Here, we present a new computational tool called Signature Multivariate Analysis (SigMA), which can be used to accurately detect the mutational signature associated with HR deficiency from targeted gene panels. Whereas previous methods require whole-genome or whole-exome data, our method detects the HR-deficiency signature even from low mutation counts, by using a likelihood-based measure combined with machine-learning techniques. Cell lines that we identify as HR deficient show a significant response to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors; patients with ovarian cancer whom we found to be HR deficient show a significantly longer overall survival with platinum regimens. By enabling panel-based identification of mutational signatures, our method substantially increases the number of patients that may be considered for treatments targeting HR deficiency.",A reinforcing HNF4-SMAD4 feed-forward module stabilizes enterocyte identity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988513,Nature genetics,2019 06 14,"BMP/SMAD signaling is a crucial regulator of intestinal differentiation1-4. However, the molecular underpinnings of the BMP pathway in this context are unknown. Here, we characterize the mechanism by which BMP/SMAD signaling drives enterocyte differentiation. We establish that the transcription factor HNF4A acts redundantly with an intestine-restricted HNF4 paralog, HNF4G, to activate enhancer chromatin and upregulate the majority of transcripts enriched in the differentiated epithelium; cells fail to differentiate on double knockout of both HNF4 paralogs. Furthermore, we show that SMAD4 and HNF4 function via a reinforcing feed-forward loop, activating each other's expression and co-binding to regulatory elements of differentiation genes. This feed-forward regulatory module promotes and stabilizes enterocyte cell identity; disruption of the HNF4-SMAD4 module results in loss of enterocyte fate in favor of progenitor and secretory cell lineages. This intersection of signaling and transcriptional control provides a framework to understand regenerative tissue homeostasis, particularly in tissues with inherent cellular plasticity5.",Evolution of buffering in a genetic circuit controlling plant stem cell proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988512,Nature genetics,2019 06 14,"Precise control of plant stem cell proliferation is necessary for the continuous and reproducible development of plant organs1,2. The peptide ligand CLAVATA3 (CLV3) and its receptor protein kinase CLAVATA1 (CLV1) maintain stem cell homeostasis within a deeply conserved negative feedback circuit1,2. In Arabidopsis, CLV1 paralogs also contribute to homeostasis, by compensating for the loss of CLV1 through transcriptional upregulation3. Here, we show that compensation4,5 operates in diverse lineages for both ligands and receptors, but while the core CLV signaling module is conserved, compensation mechanisms have diversified. Transcriptional compensation between ligand paralogs operates in tomato, facilitated by an ancient gene duplication that impacted the domestication of fruit size. In contrast, we found little evidence for transcriptional compensation between ligands in Arabidopsis and maize, and receptor compensation differs between tomato and Arabidopsis. Our findings show that compensation among ligand and receptor paralogs is critical for stem cell homeostasis, but that diverse genetic mechanisms buffer conserved developmental programs.","Type IV pili: dynamics, biophysics and functional consequences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988511,Nature reviews. Microbiology,2019 06 15,"The surfaces of many bacteria are decorated with long, exquisitely thin appendages called type IV pili (T4P), dynamic filaments that are rapidly polymerized and depolymerized from a pool of pilin subunits. Cycles of pilus extension, binding and retraction enable T4P to perform a phenomenally diverse array of functions, including twitching motility, DNA uptake and microcolony formation. On the basis of recent developments, a comprehensive understanding is emerging of the molecular architecture of the T4P machinery and the filament it builds, providing mechanistic insights into the assembly and retraction processes. Combined microbiological and biophysical approaches have revealed how T4P dynamics influence self-organization of bacteria, how bacteria respond to external stimuli to regulate T4P activity for directed movement, and the role of T4P retraction in surface sensing. In this Review, we discuss the T4P machine architecture and filament structure and present current molecular models for T4P dynamics, with a particular focus on recent insights into T4P retraction. We also discuss the functional consequences of T4P dynamics, which have important implications for bacterial lifestyle and pathogenesis.",Compartmentalized gut lymph node drainage dictates adaptive immune responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988509,Nature,2019 06 13,"The intestinal immune system has the challenging task of tolerating foreign nutrients and the commensal microbiome, while excluding or eliminating ingested pathogens. Failure of this balance leads to conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, food allergies and invasive gastrointestinal infections1. Multiple immune mechanisms are therefore in place to maintain tissue integrity, including balanced generation of effector T (TH) cells and FOXP3+ regulatory T (pTreg) cells, which mediate resistance to pathogens and regulate excessive immune activation, respectively1-4. The gut-draining lymph nodes (gLNs) are key sites for orchestrating adaptive immunity to luminal perturbations5-7. However, it is unclear how they simultaneously support tolerogenic and inflammatory reactions. Here we show that gLNs are immunologically specific to the functional gut segment that they drain. Stromal and dendritic cell gene signatures and polarization of T cells against the same luminal antigen differ between gLNs, with the proximal small intestine-draining gLNs preferentially giving rise to tolerogenic responses and the distal gLNs to pro-inflammatory T cell responses. This segregation permitted the targeting of distal gLNs for vaccination and the maintenance of duodenal pTreg cell induction during colonic infection. Conversely, the compartmentalized dichotomy was perturbed by surgical removal of select distal gLNs and duodenal infection, with effects on both lymphoid organ and tissue immune responses. Our findings reveal that the conflict between tolerogenic and inflammatory intestinal responses is in part resolved by discrete gLN drainage, and encourage antigen targeting to specific gut segments for therapeutic immune modulation."

Here, we sequence the genomes of Aurelia aurita (a scyphozoan) and Morbakka virulenta (a cubozoan) to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the origin of the jellyfish body plan. We show that the magnitude of genetic differences between the two jellyfish types is equivalent, on average, to the level of genetic differences between humans and sea urchins in the bilaterian lineage. About one-third of Aurelia genes with jellyfish-specific expression have no matches in the genomes of the coral and sea anemone, indicating that the polyp-to-jellyfish transition requires a combination of conserved and novel, medusozoa-specific genes. While no genomic region is specifically associated with the ability to produce a jellyfish stage, the arrangement of genes involved in the development of a nematocyte-a phylum-specific cell type-is highly structured and conserved in cnidarian genomes; thus, it represents a phylotypic gene cluster.",Morphology and genome of a snailfish from the Mariana Trench provide insights into deep-sea adaptation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988486,Nature ecology & evolution,2019 04 30,"It is largely unknown how living organisms-especially vertebrates-survive and thrive in the coldness, darkness and high pressures of the hadal zone.

Unlike closely related shallow sea species, P. swirei has transparent, unpigmented skin and scales, thin and incompletely ossified bones, an inflated stomach and a non-closed skull.

Genomic analyses reveal that: (1) the bone Gla protein (bglap) gene has a frameshift mutation that may cause early termination of cartilage calcification; (2) cell membrane fluidity and transport protein activity in P. swirei may have been enhanced by changes in protein sequences and gene expansion; and (3) the stability of its proteins may have been increased by critical mutations in the trimethylamine N-oxide-synthesizing enzyme and hsp90 chaperone protein. Our results provide insights into the morphological, physiological and molecular evolution of hadal vertebrates.",Release of eDNA by different life history stages and during spawning activities of laboratory-reared Japanese eels for interpretation of oceanic survey data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988485,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"To assist in detection of offshore spawning activities of the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica and facilitate interpretation of results of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis in their spawning area, we examined the eDNA concentration released by each life history stage of artificially reared Japanese eels in the laboratory using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). We also compared eDNA concentrations between before and after artificially induced spawning activities. eDNA was not detected from three 30 L seawater tanks containing each single fertilized egg, but eDNA was found from other tanks each containing single individuals of larval stages (preleptocephalus and leptocephalus), juvenile stages (glass eel, elver and yellow eel) or adult stage (silver eel). The eDNA concentrations increased in the life history stages, showed a significant difference among all stages, and were positively correlated with the total length and wet weight. Moreover, the eDNA concentration after spawning was 10-200 times higher than that before spawning, which indicated that the spawning events in the ocean would produce relatively high eDNA concentration. These results in the laboratory suggested that eDNA analysis appears to be an effective method for assisting oceanic surveys to estimate the presence and spawning events of the Japanese eel in the spawning area.",Complex affect dynamics add limited information to the prediction of psychological well-being.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988484,Nature human behaviour,2019 05 15,"Over the years, many studies have demonstrated a relation between emotion dynamics and psychological well-being1. Because our emotional life is inherently time-dynamic2-6, affective scientists argue that, next to how positive or negative we feel on average, patterns of emotional change are informative for mental health7-10. This growing interest initiated a surge in new affect dynamic measures, each claiming to capture a unique dynamical aspect of our emotional life, crucial for understanding well-being. Although this accumulation suggests scientific progress, researchers have not always evaluated (a) how different affect dynamic measures empirically interrelate and (b) what their added value is in the prediction of psychological well-being. Here, we address these questions by analysing affective time series data from 15 studies (n = 1,777). We show that (a) considerable interdependencies between measures exist, suggesting that single dynamics often do not convey unique information, and (b) dynamic measures have little added value over mean levels of positive and negative affect (and variance in these affective states) when predicting individual differences in three indicators of well-being (life satisfaction, depressive symptoms and borderline symptoms). Our findings indicate that conventional emotion research is currently unable to demonstrate independent relations between affect dynamics and psychological well-being.",A low-cost information nudge increases citizenship application rates among low-income immigrants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988483,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 16,"We show that an information nudge increased the rate of American citizenship applications among low-income immigrants eligible for a federal fee waiver. Approximately half of the 9 million naturalization-eligible immigrants qualify for a federal programme that waives the cost of the citizenship application for low-income individuals. However, take-up of this fee waiver programme remains low1-3. Here we use a randomized field experiment to test the effectiveness of a low-cost intervention (a 'nudge') that informed low-income immigrants about their eligibility for the fee waiver. We find that the information nudge increased the rate of citizenship applications by about 8.6 percentage points from 24.5% in the control group to 33.1% in the treatment group (ordinary least squares regression with robust standard errors (d.f. = 933); P = 0.015; 95% confidence interval ranged from 1.7 to 15.4 percentage points). We found no evidence that the nudge was less effective for poorer or less educated immigrants. These findings contribute to the literature that addresses the incomplete take-up of public benefits by low-income populations4-10 and suggest that lack of information is an important obstacle to citizenship among low-income immigrants who demonstrate an interest in naturalization.",Process-based framework for precise neuromodulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988481,Nature human behaviour,2019 05 15,"Functional MRI neurofeedback (NF) allows humans to self-modulate neural patterns in specific brain areas. This technique is regarded as a promising tool to translate neuroscientific knowledge into brain-guided psychiatric interventions. However, its clinical implementation is restricted by unstandardized methodological practices, by clinical definitions that are poorly grounded in neurobiology, and by lack of a unifying framework that dictates experimental choices. Here we put forward a new framework, termed 'process-based NF', which endorses a process-oriented characterization of mental dysfunctions to form precise and effective psychiatric treatments. This framework relies on targeting specific dysfunctional mental processes by modifying their underlying neural mechanisms and on applying process-specific contextual feedback interfaces. Finally, process-based NF offers designs and a control condition that address the methodological shortcomings of current approaches, thus paving the way for a precise and personalized neuromodulation.",Diverse motives for human curiosity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988479,Nature human behaviour,2019 06 13,"Curiosity-our desire to know-is a fundamental drive in human behaviour, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. A classical question concerns the curiosity motives. What drives individuals to become curious about some but not other sources of information?1 Here we show that curiosity about probabilistic events depends on multiple aspects of the distribution of these events. Participants (n = 257) performed a task in which they could demand advance information about only one of two randomly selected monetary prizes that contributed to their income. Individuals differed markedly in the extent to which they requested information as a function of the ex ante uncertainty or ex ante value of an individual prize. This heterogeneity was not captured by theoretical models describing curiosity as a desire to learn about the total rewards of a situation2,3. Instead, it could be explained by an extended model that allowed for attribute-specific anticipatory utility-the savouring of individual components of the eventual reward-and postulates that this utility increased nonlinearly with the certainty of receiving the reward. Parameter values fitting individual choices were consistent for information about gains or losses, suggesting that attribute-specific anticipatory utility captures fundamental heterogeneity in the determinants of curiosity.",A values-alignment intervention protects adolescents from the effects of food marketing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988478,Nature human behaviour,2019 06 13,"Adolescents are exposed to extensive marketing for junk food, which drives overconsumption by creating positive emotional associations with junk food1-6. Here we counter this influence with an intervention that frames manipulative food marketing as incompatible with important adolescent values, including social justice and autonomy from adult control. In a preregistered, longitudinal, randomized, controlled field experiment, we show that this framing intervention reduces boys' and girls' implicit positive associations with junk food marketing and substantially improves boys' daily dietary choices in the school cafeteria. Both of these effects were sustained for at least three months. These findings suggest that reframing unhealthy dietary choices as incompatible with important values could be a low-cost, scalable solution to producing lasting, internalized change in adolescents' dietary attitudes and choices.",Large-scale analysis of micro-level citation patterns reveals nuanced selection criteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988477,Nature human behaviour,2019 06 13,"The analysis of citations to scientific publications has become a tool that is used in the evaluation of a researcher's work; especially in the face of an ever-increasing production volume1-6. Despite the acknowledged shortcomings of citation analysis and the ongoing debate on the meaning of citations7,8, citations are still primarily viewed as endorsements and as indicators of the influence of the cited reference, regardless of the context of the citation. However, only recently has attention9,10 been given to the connection between contextual information and the success of citing and cited papers, primarily because of the lack of extensive databases that cover both types of metadata. Here we address this issue by studying the usage of citations throughout the full text of 156,558 articles published by the Public Library of Science (PLoS), and by tracing their bibliometric history from among 60 million records obtained from the Web of Science. We find universal patterns of variation in the usage of citations across paper sections11. Notably, we find differences in microlevel citation patterns that were dependent on the ultimate impact of the citing paper itself; publications from high-impact groups tend to cite younger references, as well as more very young and better-cited references. Our study provides a quantitative approach to addressing the long-standing issue that not all citations count the same.",Gaze bias differences capture individual choice behaviour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988476,Nature human behaviour,2019 06 13,"How do we make simple choices such as deciding between an apple and an orange? Recent empirical evidence suggests that choice behaviour and gaze allocation are closely linked at the group level, whereby items looked at longer during the decision-making process are more likely to be chosen. However, it is unclear how variable this gaze bias effect is between individuals. Here we investigate this question across four different simple choice experiments and using a computational model that can be easily applied to individuals. We show that an association between gaze and choice is present for most individuals, but differs considerably in strength. Generally, individuals with a strong association between gaze and choice behaviour are worse at choosing the best item from a choice set compared with individuals with a weak association. Accounting for individuals' variability in gaze bias in the model can explain and accurately predict individual differences in choice behaviour."

To gain insight on OPA1 neuronal specificity, we performed targeted metabolomics on rat cortical neurons with OPA1 expression inhibited by RNA interference. Of the 103 metabolites accurately measured, univariate analysis including the Benjamini-Hochberg correction revealed 6 significantly different metabolites in OPA1 down-regulated neurons, with aspartate being the most significant (p < 0.001). Supervised multivariate analysis by OPLS-DA yielded a model with good predictive capability (Q2cum = 0.65) and a low risk of over-fitting (permQ2 = -0.16, CV-ANOVA p-value 0.036). Amongst the 46 metabolites contributing the most to the metabolic signature were aspartate, glutamate and threonine, which all decreased in OPA1 down-regulated neurons, and lysine, 4 sphingomyelins, 4 lysophosphatidylcholines and 32 phosphatidylcholines which were increased. The phospholipid signature may reflect intracellular membrane remodeling due to loss of mitochondrial fusion and/or lipid droplet accumulation. Aspartate and glutamate deficiency, also found in the plasma of OPA1 patients, is likely the consequence of respiratory chain deficiency, whereas the glutamate decrease could contribute to the synaptic dysfunction that we previously identified in this model.",Systematic evaluation of 2'-Fluoro modified chimeric antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988454,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Antisense oligonucleotide (AO)-mediated splice modulation has been established as a therapeutic approach for tackling genetic diseases. Recently, Exondys51, a drug that aims to correct splicing defects in the dystrophin gene was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, Exondys51 has relied on phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry which poses challenges in the cost of production and compatibility with conventional oligonucleotide synthesis procedures. One approach to overcome this problem is to construct the AO with alternative nucleic acid chemistries using solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis via standard phosphoramidite chemistry. 2'-Fluoro (2'-F) is a potent RNA analogue that possesses high RNA binding affinity and resistance to nuclease degradation with good safety profile, and an approved drug Macugen containing 2'-F-modified pyrimidines was approved for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In the present study, we investigated the scope of 2'-F nucleotides to construct mixmer and gapmer exon skipping AOs with either 2'-O-methyl (2'-OMe) or locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides on a phosphorothioate (PS) backbone, and evaluated their efficacy in inducing exon-skipping in mdx mouse myotubes in vitro. Our results showed that all AOs containing 2'-F nucleotides induced efficient exon-23 skipping, with LNA/2'-F chimeras achieving better efficiency than the AOs without LNA modification. In addition, LNA/2'-F chimeric AOs demonstrated higher exonuclease stability and lower cytotoxicity than the 2'-OMe/2'-F chimeras. Overall, our findings certainly expand the scope of constructing 2'-F modified AOs in splice modulation by incorporating 2'-OMe and LNA modifications.",SWITCH 1/DYAD is a WINGS APART-LIKE antagonist that maintains sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988453,Nature communications,2019 05 16,"Mitosis and meiosis both rely on cohesin, which embraces the sister chromatids and plays a crucial role for the faithful distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. Prior to the cleavage by Separase at anaphase onset, cohesin is largely removed from chromosomes by the non-proteolytic action of WINGS APART-LIKE (WAPL), a mechanism referred to as the prophase pathway. To prevent the premature loss of sister chromatid cohesion, WAPL is inhibited in early mitosis by Sororin. However, Sororin homologs have only been found to function as WAPL inhibitors during mitosis in vertebrates and Drosophila. Here we show that SWITCH 1/DYAD defines a WAPL antagonist that acts in meiosis of Arabidopsis. Crucially, SWI1 becomes dispensable for sister chromatid cohesion in the absence of WAPL. Despite the lack of any sequence similarities, we found that SWI1 is regulated and functions in a similar manner as Sororin hence likely representing a case of convergent molecular evolution across the eukaryotic kingdom.",Rigid helical-like assemblies from a self-aggregating tripeptide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988450,Nature materials,2019 05 07,"The structural versatility, biocompatibility and dynamic range of the mechanical properties of protein materials have been explored in functional biomaterials for a wide array of biotechnology applications. Typically, such materials are made from self-assembled peptides with a predominant β-sheet structure, a common structural motif in silk and amyloid fibrils. However, collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, is based on a helical arrangement. Here we show that Pro-Phe-Phe, the most aggregation-prone tripeptide of natural amino acids, assembles into a helical-like sheet that is stabilized by the dry hydrophobic interfaces of Phe residues. This architecture resembles that of the functional PSMα3 amyloid, highlighting the role of dry helical interfaces as a core structural motif in amyloids. Proline replacement by hydroxyproline, a major constituent of collagen, generates minimal helical-like assemblies with enhanced mechanical rigidity. These results establish a framework for designing functional biomaterials based on ultrashort helical protein elements.",Site-selective CO disproportionation mediated by localized surface plasmon resonance excited by electron beam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988449,Nature materials,2019 05 22,"Recent reports of hot-electron-induced dissociation of small molecules, such as hydrogen, demonstrate the potential application of plasmonic nanostructures for harvesting light to initiate catalytic reactions. Theories have assumed that plasmonic catalysis is mediated by the energy transfer from nanoparticles to adsorbed molecules during the dephasing of localized surface plasmon (LSP) modes optically excited on plasmonic nanoparticles. However, LSP-induced chemical processes have not been resolved at a sub-nanoparticle scale to identify the active sites responsible for the energy transfer. Here, we exploit the LSP resonance excited by electron beam on gold nanoparticles to drive CO disproportionation at room temperature in an environmental scanning transmission electron microscope. Using in situ electron energy-loss spectroscopy with a combination of density functional theory and electromagnetic boundary element method calculations, we show at the subparticle level that the active sites on gold nanoparticles are where preferred gas adsorption sites and the locations of maximum LSP electric field amplitude (resonance antinodes) superimpose. Our findings provide insight into plasmonic catalysis and will be valuable in designing plasmonic antennas for low-temperature catalytic processes.","Tricuspid valve disease: diagnosis, prognosis and management of a rapidly evolving field.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988448,Nature reviews. Cardiology,2019 04 16,"Tricuspid valve disease, and particularly tricuspid regurgitation, is a highly prevalent condition with a complex pathophysiology and long-term adverse consequences. Although historically neglected, tricuspid valve disease has gained increasing recognition, with important advances in the assessment and management of this disorder over the past 2 decades. Surgical treatment remains the standard of care, but it continues to have one of the the highest death rates among all cardiac valve-related procedures, and a broad range of patients still do not receive effective therapy for tricuspid valve disease in contemporary clinical practice. Therefore, several alternative, less-invasive technologies for treating patients with severe, native tricuspid valve disease at high surgical risk have been developed in the past decade, with promising early results. This Review summarizes key findings and highlights the latest developments in the diagnosis and management framework that are transforming clinical practice in the complex field of tricuspid valve disease.",Imprint of assortative mating on the human genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988446,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 16,"Preference for mates with similar phenotypes; that is, assortative mating, is widely observed in humans1-5 and has evolutionary consequences6-8. Under Fisher's classical theory6, assortative mating is predicted to induce a signature in the genome at trait-associated loci that can be detected and quantified. Here, we develop and apply a method to quantify assortative mating on a specific trait by estimating the correlation (θ) between genetic predictors of the trait from single nucleotide polymorphisms on odd- versus even-numbered chromosomes. We show by theory and simulation that the effect of assortative mating can be quantified in the presence of population stratification. We applied this approach to 32 complex traits and diseases using single nucleotide polymorphism data from ~400,000 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We found significant evidence of assortative mating for height (θ = 3.2%) and educational attainment (θ = 2.7%), both of which were consistent with theoretical predictions. Overall, our results imply that assortative mating involves multiple traits and affects the genomic architecture of loci that are associated with these traits, and that the consequence of mate choice can be detected from a random sample of genomes.",Quasi-experimental causality in neuroscience and behavioural research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988445,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 16,"In many scientific domains, causality is the key question. For example, in neuroscience, we might ask whether a medication affects perception, cognition or action. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard to establish causality, but they are not always practical. The field of empirical economics has developed rigorous methods to establish causality even when randomized controlled trials are not available. Here we review these quasi-experimental methods and highlight how neuroscience and behavioural researchers can use them to do research that can credibly demonstrate causal effects.",Generalization guides human exploration in vast decision spaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988442,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 16,"From foraging for food to learning complex games, many aspects of human behaviour can be framed as a search problem with a vast space of possible actions. Under finite search horizons, optimal solutions are generally unobtainable. Yet, how do humans navigate vast problem spaces, which require intelligent exploration of unobserved actions? Using various bandit tasks with up to 121 arms, we study how humans search for rewards under limited search horizons, in which the spatial correlation of rewards (in both generated and natural environments) provides traction for generalization. Across various different probabilistic and heuristic models, we find evidence that Gaussian process function learning-combined with an optimistic upper confidence bound sampling strategy-provides a robust account of how people use generalization to guide search. Our modelling results and parameter estimates are recoverable and can be used to simulate human-like performance, providing insights about human behaviour in complex environments.",Reconciling age-related changes in behavioural and neural indices of human perceptual decision-making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988441,Nature human behaviour,2019 04 16,"Ageing impacts on decision-making behaviour across a range of cognitive tasks and scenarios. Computational modelling has proved valuable in providing mechanistic interpretations of these age-related differences; however, the extent to which model parameter differences accurately reflect changes to the underlying neural computations remains unclear. Here, we report that age-related effects on neural signatures of decision formation are inconsistent with behavioural fits derived from a prominent accumulation-to-bound model. Most notably, model-predicted bound differences were absent neurophysiologically. However, constraining the model to match the decision-predictive elements of the brain signals provided more parsimonious fits to behaviour and generated predictions regarding the neural data that were empirically validated. These included a task-dependent slowing of evidence accumulation among older adults and reduced between-trial accumulation rate variability, which was linked to enhanced attentional engagement. Our findings highlight how combining neurophysiological measurements with computational modelling can yield unique insights into group differences in neural decision mechanisms."

Expression of niche factors by Nestin-GFP+ mesenchymal-derived stromal cells (MSCs) is downregulated upon culture, suggesting that transcriptional rewiring may contribute to this reduced HSC maintenance potential. Using an RNA sequencing screen, we identified five genes encoding transcription factors (Klf7, Ostf1, Xbp1, Irf3 and Irf7) that restored HSC niche function in cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs. These revitalized MSCs (rMSCs) exhibited enhanced synthesis of HSC niche factors while retaining their mesenchymal differentiation capacity. In contrast to HSCs co-cultured with control MSCs, HSCs expanded with rMSCs showed higher repopulation capacity and protected lethally irradiated recipient mice. Competitive reconstitution assays revealed an approximately sevenfold expansion of functional HSCs by rMSCs. rMSCs prevented the accumulation of DNA damage in cultured HSCs, a hallmark of ageing and replication stress. Analysis of the reprogramming mechanisms uncovered a role for myocyte enhancer factor 2c (Mef2c) in the revitalization of MSCs. These results provide insight into the transcriptional regulation of the niche with implications for stem cell-based therapies.",Comparison between patient-reported outcomes after enucleation and proton beam radiotherapy for uveal melanomas: a 2-year cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988421,"Eye (London, England)",2019 04 16,"Uveal melanomas affect 2-8 per million Europeans each year.

Some AL patients will undergo ""repeat therapy"" (re-induction or salvage) due to persistent or relapsed disease. We hypothesized that prior injury to the microbiome during induction may influence dysbiosis patterns during repeat therapy. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the bacterial microbiome profiles of thrice-weekly stool samples from 20 intensively treated AL patients (first induction: 13, repeat therapy: 7) by 16S rRNA sequencing. In mixed-effects modeling, repeat therapy was a significant predictor of Enterococcus expansion (P = 0.006), independently of antibiotic exposure, disease type, feeding mode, and week of chemotherapy. Bayesian analysis of longitudinal data demonstrated larger departures of microbial communities from the pre-chemotherapy baseline during repeat therapy compared to induction. This increased ecosystem instability during repeat therapy possibly impairs colonization resistance and increases vulnerability to Enterococcus outgrowth. Microbiota restoration therapies at the end of induction or before starting subsequent therapy warrant investigation.",Estrogen receptor α in T cells suppresses follicular helper T cell responses and prevents autoimmunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988419,Experimental & molecular medicine,2019 04 21,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is a sex hormone nuclear receptor that regulates various physiological events, including the immune response. Although there have been some recent studies on ERα regarding subsets of T cells, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells, its role in follicular helper T (TFH) cells has not yet been elucidated. To determine whether ERα controls TFH response and antibody production, we generated T cell-specific ERα knockout (KO) mice by utilizing the CD4-Cre/ERα flox system (CD4-ERα KO) and then analyzed their phenotype. At approximately 1 year of age, CD4-ERα KO mice spontaneously showed mild autoimmunity with increased autoantibody production and CD4+CD44+CXCR5+Bcl-6+ TFH cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. We next immunized 6-8-week-old CD4-ERα KO mice with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), which resulted in an increased proportion of TFH cells and germinal center (GC) responses. In addition, 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment decreased TFH responses in wild-type mice and suppressed the mRNA expression of Bcl-6 and IL-21. Finally, we confirmed that the production of high-affinity antigen-specific antibodies and isotype class switching induced by NP-conjugated ovalbumin immunization were elevated in CD4-ERα KO mice under sufficient estrogen conditions. These results collectively demonstrate that the female sex hormone receptor ERα inhibits the TFH cell response and GC reaction to control autoantibody production, which was related to estrogen signaling and autoimmunity.",Reversing conventional site-selectivity in C(sp3)-H bond activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988418,Nature chemistry,2019 06 11,"One of the core barriers to developing C-H activation reactions is the ability to distinguish between multiple C-H bonds that are nearly identical in terms of electronic properties and bond strengths. Through recognition of distance and molecular geometry, remote C(sp2)-H bonds have been selectively activated in the presence of proximate ones. Yet achieving such unconventional site selectivity with C(sp3)-H bonds remains a paramount challenge. Here we report a combination of a simple pyruvic acid-derived directing group and a 2-pyridone ligand that enables the preferential activation of the distal γ-C(sp3)-H bond over the proximate β-C(sp3)-H bonds for a wide range of alcohol-derived substrates.

Colloidal aggregates are the prime source of false positive readouts, either through protein sequestration or protein-scaffold mimicry. Nevertheless, assessment of colloidal aggregation remains somewhat overlooked and under-appreciated. In this Review, we discuss the impact of aggregation in drug discovery by analysing select examples from the literature and publicly-available datasets. We also examine and comment on technologies used to experimentally identify these potentially problematic entities. We focus on evidence-based computational filters and machine learning algorithms that may be swiftly deployed to flag chemical matter and mitigate the impact of aggregates in discovery programmes.

Here, we report a previously unknown ligand for gold(0) nanoclusters-N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)-which feature a robust metal-carbon single bond and impart high stability to the corresponding gold cluster. The addition of a single NHC to gold nanoclusters results in significantly improved stability and catalytic properties in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2.

Clusters can also be obtained with up to five NHCs, as a mixture of species.","The photochemical ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene imaged by ultrafast electron diffraction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988415,Nature chemistry,2019 05 24,"The ultrafast photoinduced ring-opening of 1,3-cyclohexadiene constitutes a textbook example of electrocyclic reactions in organic chemistry and a model for photobiological reactions in vitamin D synthesis. Although the relaxation from the photoexcited electronic state during the ring-opening has been investigated in numerous studies, the accompanying changes in atomic distance have not been resolved. Here we present a direct and unambiguous observation of the ring-opening reaction path on the femtosecond timescale and subångström length scale using megaelectronvolt ultrafast electron diffraction. We followed the carbon-carbon bond dissociation and the structural opening of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring by the direct measurement of time-dependent changes in the distribution of interatomic distances. We observed a substantial acceleration of the ring-opening motion after internal conversion to the ground state due to a steepening of the electronic potential gradient towards the product minima. The ring-opening motion transforms into rotation of the terminal ethylene groups in the photoproduct 1,3,5-hexatriene on the subpicosecond timescale.",Radical polymerization inside living cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988414,Nature chemistry,2019 05 24,"Polymerization reactions conducted inside cells must be compatible with the complex intracellular environment, which contains numerous molecules and functional groups that could potentially prevent or quench polymerization reactions. Here we report a strategy for directly synthesizing unnatural polymers in cells through free radical photopolymerization using a number of biocompatible acrylic and methacrylic monomers. This offers a platform to manipulate, track and control cellular behaviour by the in cellulo generation of macromolecules that have the ability to alter cellular motility, label cells by the generation of fluorescent polymers for long-term tracking studies, as well as generate a variety of nanostructures within cells. It is remarkable that free radical polymerization chemistry can take place within such complex cellular environments. This demonstration opens up a multitude of new possibilities for how chemists can modulate cellular function and behaviour and for understanding cellular behaviour in response to the generation of free radicals.",Statistically downscaled climate dataset for East Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988412,Scientific data,2019 05 10,"For many regions of the world, current climate change projections are only available at coarser spatial resolution from Global Climate Models (GCMs) that cannot directly be used in impact assessment and adaptation studies at regional and local scale. Impact assessment studies require high-resolution climate data to drive impact assessment models. To overcome this data challenge, we produced a station based climate projection (precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature) for Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania using observed daily data from 211 stations obtained from the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia and international databases. Moreover, 26 large-scale climate variables derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data (1961-2005) and second generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2, 1961-2100) are used. Statistical Down-Scaling Model (SDSM) is used to produce the required high-resolution climate projection by developing a statistical relationship between the large- and local-scale climate variables. The predictors are analysed more than 16458 times and we provided 20 ensembles for the current (1961-2005) and future (2006-2100, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) climate."

Conversely, necroptosis of hepatocytes and other liver cell types and its relevance for liver disease is debated. Using liver parenchymal cell (LPC)-specific TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-deficient (TAK1LPC-KO) mice, which exhibit spontaneous hepatocellular and biliary damage, hepatitis, and early hepatocarcinogenesis, we have investigated the contribution of apoptosis and necroptosis in hepatocyte and cholangiocyte death and their impact on liver disease progression. Here, we provide in vivo evidence showing that TAK1-deficient cholangiocytes undergo spontaneous necroptosis induced primarily by TNFR1 and dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity, RIPK3, and NEMO. In contrast, TAK1-deficient hepatocytes die by FADD-dependent apoptosis, which is not significantly inhibited by LPC-specific RIPK1 deficiency, inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity, RIPK3 deficiency or combined LPC-specific deletion of TNFR1, TRAILR, and Fas. Accordingly, normal mouse cholangiocytes can undergo necroptosis, while primary hepatocytes are resistant to it and die exclusively by apoptosis upon treatment with cell death-inducing stimuli in vitro, likely due to the differential expression of RIPK3. Interestingly, the genetic modifications that conferred protection from biliary damage also prevented the spontaneous lethality that was often observed in TAK1LPC-KO mice. In the presence of chronic hepatocyte apoptosis, preventing biliary damage delayed but did not avert hepatocarcinogenesis. On the contrary, inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis fully prevented liver tumorigenesis even in mice with extensive biliary damage. Altogether, our results suggest that using RIPK1 kinase activity inhibitors could be therapeutically useful for cholestatic liver disease patients.","Reduction of cervical cancer incidence within a primary HPV screening pilot project (WOLPHSCREEN) in Wolfsburg, Germany.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988395,British journal of cancer,2019 05 15,Randomised controlled trials showed human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening leads to a significant reduction in cervical cancer incidence compared with cytology-based screening only.,Low tumour PPM1H indicates poor prognosis in colorectal cancer via activation of cancer-associated fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988394,British journal of cancer,2019 05 15,"Vimentin (VIM) is considered a prognostic marker in colorectal cancer (CRC).

Reduced PM-expression is primarily attributed to retention and degradation of misfolded channels by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein quality control (QC) systems. However, as the molecular pathogenesis of LQT2 was defined using severely-misfolded hERG variants with limited PM-expression, the potential contribution of post-ER (peripheral) QC pathways to the disease phenotype remains poorly established. Here, we investigate the cellular processing of mildly-misfolded Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS)-domain mutant hERGs, which display incomplete ER-retention and PM-expression defects at physiological temperature. We show that the attenuated PM-expression of hERG is dictated by mutation-specific contributions from both the ER and peripheral QC systems. At the ER, PAS-mutants experience inefficient conformational maturation coupled with rapid ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. In post-ER compartments, they are rapidly endocytosed from the PM via a ubiquitin-independent mechanism and rapidly targeted for lysosomal degradation. Conformational destabilization underlies aberrant cellular processing at both ER- and post-ER compartments, since conformational correction by a hERG-specific pharmacochaperone or low-temperatures can restore WT-like trafficking. Our results demonstrate that the post-ER QC alone or jointly with the ER QC determines the loss-of-PM-expression phenotype of a subset of LQT2 mutations.",Blockade of miR-142-3p promotes anti-apoptotic and suppressive function by inducing KDM6A-mediated H3K27me3 demethylation in induced regulatory T cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988391,Cell death & disease,2019 04 18,"In vitro induced human regulatory T cells (iTregs) have in vivo therapeutic utility. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of approximately 22-nucleotide non-coding RNAs that are processed from longer precursors by the RNases Drosha and Dicer. miRNAs regulate post-transcriptional protein expression through messenger RNA destabilization or translational silencing; miR-142-3p regulates natural Treg function through autophagy. We hypothesized that this miRNA may also have an iTreg regulation function. Antagomir-mediated knockdown of miR-142-3p improved Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) expression, regulatory function, cytokine expression, and apoptosis of iTregs in vitro, with or without inflammatory cytokine stimulation. miR-142-3p knockdown increased autophagy-related protein 16-1-mediated autophagy. Target prediction and luciferase assay results indicated that miR-142-3p binds directly to lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A), which resulted in demethylation of H3K27me3 and in turn upregulated expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Based on these results, we propose a novel strategy that uses knockdown of miR-142-3p to enhance anti-apoptotic ability and function of iTregs by increasing KDM6A and Bcl-2 expression. This approach might be used as a treatment to control established chronic immune-mediated autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",Development of a Phage Display Panning Strategy Utilizing Crude Antigens: Isolation of MERS-CoV Nucleoprotein human antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988390,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Antibody phage display has been pivotal in the quest to generate human monoclonal antibodies for biomedical and research applications. Target antigen preparation is a main bottleneck associated with the panning process. This includes production complexity, downstream purification, quality and yield. In many instances, purified antigens are preferred for panning but this may not be possible for certain difficult target antigens. Here, we describe an improved procedure of affinity selection against crude or non-purified antigen by saturation of non-binders with blocking agents to promote positive binder enrichment termed as Yin-Yang panning. A naïve human scFv library with kappa light chain repertoire with a library size of 109 was developed. The improved Yin-Yang biopanning process was able to enrich monoclonal antibodies specific to the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein. Three unique monoclonal antibodies were isolated in the process. The Yin-Yang biopanning method highlights the possibility of utilizing crude antigens for the isolation of monoclonal antibodies by phage display.",Characterising the impact of heatwaves on work-related injuries and illnesses in three Australian cities using a standard heatwave definition- Excess Heat Factor (EHF).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988389,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 04 16,"Heatwaves have potential health and safety implications for many workers, and heatwaves are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change.

We here further identified goa-1 encoding a Gαo and pkc-1 encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase as the targets of neuronal mir-247 in the regulation of GO toxicity. GO exposure increased the expressions of both GOA-1 and PKC-1. Mutation of goa-1 or pkc-1 induced a susceptibility to GO toxicity, and suppressed the resistance of mir-247 mutant to GO toxicity. GOA-1 and PKC-1 could also act in the neurons to regulate the GO toxicity, and neuronal overexpression of mir-247 could not affect the resistance of nematodes overexpressing neuronal goa-1 or pkc-1 lacking 3'-UTR to GO toxicity. In the neurons, GOA-1 acted upstream of diacylglycerol kinase/DGK-1 and PKC-1 to regulate the GO toxicity. Moreover, DGK-1 and GOA-1 functioned synergistically in the regulation of GO toxicity. Our results highlight the crucial role of neuronal Gαo signaling in response to GO in nematodes.",Differential Regulation of Gene Expression in Lung Cancer Cells by Diacyglycerol-Lactones and a Phorbol Ester Via Selective Activation of Protein Kinase C Isozymes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988374,Scientific reports,2019 04 20,"Despite our extensive knowledge on the biology of protein kinase C (PKC) and its involvement in disease, limited success has been attained in the generation of PKC isozyme-specific modulators acting via the C1 domain, the binding site for the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phorbol ester tumor promoters. Synthetic efforts had recently led to the identification of AJH-836, a DAG-lactone with preferential affinity for novel isozymes (nPKCs) relative to classical PKCs (cPKCs). Here, we compared the ability of AJH-836 and a prototypical phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, PMA) to induce changes in gene expression in a lung cancer model. Gene profiling analysis using RNA-Seq revealed that PMA caused major changes in gene expression, whereas AJH-836 only induced a small subset of genes, thus providing a strong indication for a major involvement of cPKCs in their control of gene expression. MMP1, MMP9, and MMP10 were among the genes most prominently induced by PMA, an effect impaired by RNAi silencing of PKCα, but not PKCδ or PKCε. Comprehensive gene signature analysis and bioinformatics efforts, including functional enrichment and transcription factor binding site analyses of dysregulated genes, identified major differences in pathway activation and transcriptional networks between PMA and DAG-lactones. In addition to providing solid evidence for the differential involvement of individual PKC isozymes in the control of gene expression, our studies emphasize the importance of generating targeted C1 domain ligands capable of differentially regulating PKC isozyme-specific function in cellular models.",Functional Evaluation of Two Corneal Endothelial Cell-Based Therapies: Tissue-Engineered Construct and Cell Injection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988373,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Restoration of vision due to corneal blindness from corneal endothelial dysfunction can be achieved via a corneal transplantation. However, global shortage of donor tissues has driven the development cell-based therapeutics. With the capacity to propagate regulatory compliant human corneal endothelial cells (CEnCs), this study evaluated the functionality of propagated CEnCs delivered via tissue-engineered endothelial keratoplasty (TE-EK) or corneal endothelial cell injection (CE-CI) within a rabbit model of bullous keratopathy. For animals with TE-EK grafts, central corneal thickness (CCT) increased to >1000 μm post-operatively. Gradual thinning with improvements in corneal clarity was observed from week 1. CCT at week 3 was 484.3 ± 73.7 μm. In rabbits with CE-CI, corneal clarity was maintained throughout, and CCT at week 3 was 582.5 ± 171.5 μm. Control corneas remained significantly edematous throughout the study period compared to their respective experimental groups (p < 0.05). Characterization of excised corneas showed a monolayer with heterogeneously shaped CEnCs in both TE-EK and CE-CI groups. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated reactivity to anti-human specific nuclei antibody attributing corneal recovery to the functional human CEnCs. This study showed that regulatory compliant cell-based therapy for corneal endothelial dysfunction can be delivered by both TE-EK and CE-CI, and holds great promise as an alternative to traditional corneal transplantation.",Theta oscillations in 4-year-olds are sensitive to task engagement and task demands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988372,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Top-down control processes are essential for guiding attention and working memory towards task-relevant information. Recently, theta oscillations were suggested as critical for these cognitive processes. Infant studies testing a mixture of bottom-up and top-down processes support adult theta findings. Yet, since infants cannot be instructed, it remains unclear to what extent theta oscillations are involved particularly in top-down control in early childhood. That is especially relevant towards school age when children need top-down control to solve the increasingly complex tasks. In this EEG study, we investigated whether theta-power in 4-year-olds is sensitive to task engagement and to different cognitive task demands. In a within-subjects design, children had three different instructions before watching videos including either no demands (No Task), language-related (Color-naming Task), or action-related (Imitation Task) demands. We analyzed children's theta-power (3-6 Hz) in two contrasts: (1) Task vs. No Task and (2) Color-naming vs. Imitation Task. The findings revealed more frontomedial theta-power when children were engaged in a task and their frontomedial theta-power increased during their cognitive engagement. Theta-power was stronger over left fronto-temporal sites for language- compared to action-related demands. These findings support recent theoretical work highlighting theta oscillations in top-down control and extend this neurocognitive framework to preschoolers.",Autophagy-related 7 modulates tumor progression in triple-negative breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988371,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 04 16,"The exact role of autophagy in breast cancers remains elusive. In this study, we explored the potential functions of autophagy-related 7 (Atg7) in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. Compared to normal breast tissue, a significantly lower expression of Atg7 was observed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but not other subtypes. A higher Atg7 expression was significantly associated with favorable clinicopathologic factors and better prognostic outcomes in patients with TNBC. Reflecting the clinical and pathologic observations, Atg7 was found to inhibit proliferation and migration, but promotes apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. Furthermore, Atg7 suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition through inhibiting aerobic glycolysis metabolism of TNBC cells. These findings provided novel molecular and clinical evidence of Atg7 in modulating the biological behavior of TNBC, thus warranting further investigation.",Synthesis of chemically edited derivatives of the endogenous regulator of inflammation 9-PAHSA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988370,The Journal of antibiotics,2019 04 26,"Fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) are a growing class of natural products found in organisms ranging from plants to humans. The roles these endogenous derivatives of fatty acids play in biology and their novel pathways for controlling inflammation have increased our understanding of basic human physiology. FAHFAs incorporate diverse fatty acids into their structures, however, given their recent discovery non-natural derivatives have not been a focus and as a result structure-activity relationships remain unknown. The importance of the long chain hydrocarbons extending from the ester linkage as they relate to anti-inflammatory activity is unknown. Herein the systematic removal of carbons from either the hydroxy fatty acid or fatty acid regions of the most studied FAHFA, palmitic acid ester of 9-hydroxystearic acid (9-PAHSA), was achieved and these synthetic, abridged analogs were tested for their ability to attenuate IL-6 production. Reduction of the carbon chain lengths of the 9-hydroxystearic acid portion or palmitic acid hydrocarbon chain resulted in lower molecular weight analogs that maintained anti-inflammatory activity or in one case enhanced activity.",Genetic risk factors identified in populations of European descent do not improve the prediction of osteoporotic fracture and bone mineral density in Chinese populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988369,Scientific reports,2019 04 20,"Aiming to investigate whether genetic risk factors (GRFs) for fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) identified from people of European descent can help improve the prediction of osteoporotic fracture (OF) risk and BMD in Chinese populations, we built assessment models for femoral neck (FN)-fracture prediction and BMD value prediction using 700 elderly Chinese Han subjects and 1,620 unrelated Chinese Han subjects, respectively. 17 fracture-associated genes and 82 FN-BMD associated genes identified in people of European descent were used to build a logistic regression model with clinical risk factors (CRFs) for FN-fracture prediction in Chinese. Meanwhile 107 BMD-associated genes from people of European descent were used to build a multiple linear regression model with CRFs for BMD prediction in Chinese. A Lasso algorithm was employed for informative SNP selection to construct the genetic risk score (GRS) with ten-fold cross-validation. The results showed that, adding fracture GRF and FN-BMD GRF to the model with CRFs, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) decrease from 0.653 to 0.587 and 0.588, respectively, for FN fracture prediction. 62.3% and 61.8% of the risk variation were explained by the Model with CRFs and fracture GRF and by the Model with CRFs and FN-BMD GRF, respectively, as compared to 65.5% in the Model with CRFs only. The net reclassification improvement (NRI) index in the reclassification analysis is 0.56% (P = 0.57) and 1.13% (P = 0.29), respectively. There is no significant difference either between the performance of the model with CRFs and that of the model with both CRFs and GRF for BMD prediction. We concluded that, in the current study, GRF of fracture identified in people of European descent does not contributes to improve the fracture prediction in Chinese; and GRF of BMD from people of European descent cannot help improve the accuracy of the fracture prediction in Chinese perhaps partially because GRF of BMD from people of European descent may not contribute to BMD prediction in Chinese. This study highlights the limited utility of the current genetics studies largely focused on people of European descent for disease or risk factor prediction in other ethnic groups, and calls for more and larger scale studies focused on other ethnic groups.",An overview of the oil-brine interfacial behavior and a new surface complexation model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988368,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"The few existing surface complexation models (SCM) for the brine-oil interface have important limitations: the chemistry of each crude oil is not considered, they cannot capture the water/non-polar hydrocarbons surface charge, the interactions between Na+ and the acid sites are not included, and the equilibrium constants for the adsorption reactions are not validated against experimental data. We address the aforementioned constraints by proposing an improved diffuse-layer SCM for the oil-brine interface. The new model accounts for the chemistry of crude oils by considering surface sites linearly dependent on the TAN (total acid number) and TBN (total base number). We define weak sites to account for the negative surface charge observed for non-polar hydrocarbons in water. We optimize the parameters of our model by fitting the model to reported zeta potential measurements of oil in aqueous solutions. When we validate the optimized model against different experimental data sets, it generally shows a good performance in predicting the surface charge of oil in different brines with different pHs. We show that the acid and base numbers are only useful as a qualitative estimation of the distribution of polar groups at the oil surface, and more sophisticated analysis is necessary to quantify the chemistry of the oil-brine interface.",Ectopic miR-975 induces CTP synthase directed cell proliferation and differentiation in Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988367,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"CTP synthase (CTPSyn) is an essential metabolic enzyme, synthesizing precursors required for nucleotides and phospholipids production. Previous studies have also shown that CTPSyn is elevated in various cancers. In many organisms, CTPSyn compartmentalizes into filaments called cytoophidia. In Drosophila melanogaster, only its isoform C (CTPSynIsoC) forms cytoophidia. In the fruit fly's testis, cytoophidia are normally seen in the transit amplification regions close to its apical tip, where the stem-cell niche is located, and development is at its most rapid. Here, we report that CTPSynIsoC overexpression causes the lengthening of cytoophidia throughout the entirety of the testicular body. A bulging apical tip is found in approximately 34% of males overexpressing CTPSynIsoC. Immunostaining shows that this bulged phenotype is most likely due to increased numbers of both germline cells and spermatocytes. Through a microRNA (miRNA) overexpression screen, we found that ectopic miR-975 concurrently increases both the expression levels of CTPSyn and the length of its cytoophidia. The bulging testes phenotype was also recovered at a penetration of approximately 20%. However, qPCR assays reveal that CTPSynIsoC and miR-975 overexpression each provokes a differential response in expression of a number of cancer-related genes, indicating that the shared CTPSyn upregulation seen in either case is likely the cause of observed testicular overgrowth. This study presents the first instance of consequences of miRNA-asserted regulation upon CTPSyn in D. melanogaster, and further reaffirms the enzyme's close ties to germline cells overgrowth.",Azithromycin resistance levels and mechanisms in Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988366,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Despite azithromycin being used in some countries to treat infections caused by Gram-negative pathogens, no resistance breakpoint for Escherichia coli exists. The aim of this study was to analyse the levels and mechanisms of azithromycin resistance in E. coli. The presence of chromosomal (rplD, rplV and 23S rRNA) mutations, 10 macrolide resistance genes (MRGs) and efflux pump overexpression was determined in 343 E. coli isolates. Overall, 89 (25.9%) isolates had MICs ≥ 32 mg/L to azithromycin, decreasing to 42 (12.2%) when assayed in the presence of Phe-Arg-β-Napthylamide, with 35 of these 42 possessing at least one MRG. Efflux pumps played a role in azithromycin resistance affecting the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) levels of 91.2% isolates whereas chromosomal alterations seem to have a minimal role. At least one MRG was found in 22.7% of the isolates with mph(A) being the most commonly found gene. The mph(A) gene plays the main role in the development of azithromycin resistance and 93% of the mph(A)-carrying isolates showed a MIC of 32 mg/L. In the absence of a specific resistance breakpoint our results suggest a MIC of 32 mg/L to be considered in order to detect isolates carrying mechanisms able to confer azithromycin resistance."

A total of 366 patients with available serum iron, ferritin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) values were ultimately included in the analysis. 89% of included patients had anemia. Patients were categorized into ruptured and non-ruptured groups. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between ruptured aneurysms and iron, ferritin, and TIBC. TIBC values (10-3 g/L) within 1 year of diagnosis (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.59) and between 1 and 3 years from diagnosis (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.93) were significantly and inversely associated with intracranial aneurysm rupture.

However, this association may not apply to the general population as there may be a selection bias as iron studies were done in a subset of patients only.",Visual short-term memory for coherent motion in video game players: evidence from a memory-masking paradigm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988353,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"In this study, we investigated visual short-term memory for coherent motion in action video game players (AVGPs), non-action video game players (NAVGPs), and non-gamers (control group: CONs). Participants performed a visual memory-masking paradigm previously used with macaque monkeys and humans. In particular, we tested whether video game players form a more robust visual short-term memory trace for coherent moving stimuli during the encoding phase, and whether such memory traces are less affected by an intervening masking stimulus presented 0.2 s after the offset of the to-be-remembered sample. The results showed that task performance of all groups was affected by the masking stimulus, but video game players were affected to a lesser extent than controls. Modelling of performance values and reaction times revealed that video game players have a lower guessing rate than CONs, and higher drift rates than CONs, indicative of more efficient perceptual decisions. These results suggest that video game players exhibit a more robust VSTM trace for moving objects and this trace is less prone to external interference.",Single cell RNA-sequencing identified Dec2 as a suppressive factor for spermatogonial differentiation by inhibiting Sohlh1 expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988352,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Gonocyte-to-spermatogonia transition is a critical fate determination process to initiate sperm production throughout the lifecycle. However, the molecular dynamics of this process has not been fully elucidated mainly due to the asynchronized differentiation stages of neonatal germ cells. In this study, we employed single cell RNA sequencing analyses of P1.5-5.5 germ cells to clarify the temporal dynamics of gene expression during gonocyte-to-spermatogonia transition. The analyses identified transcriptional modules, one of which regulates spermatogonial gene network in neonatal germ cells. Among them, we identified Dec2, a bHLH-type transcription factor, as a transcriptional repressor for a spermatogonial differentiation factor Sohlh1. Deficiency of Dec2 in mice induces significant reduction of undifferentiated spermatogonia, and transplantation assay using Dec2-depleted cells also demonstrated the impaired efficiency of engraftment, suggesting its role in maintaining spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Collectively, this study revealed the intrinsic role of a new SSC factor Dec2, which protects germ cells from inadequate differentiation during neonatal testis development.",Comprehensive analysis of Fc-mediated IgM binding to the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 family in three parasite clones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988351,Scientific reports,2019 04 20,"PfEMP1 is a family of adhesive proteins expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs), where they mediate adhesion of IEs to a range of host receptors. Efficient PfEMP1-dependent IE sequestration often depends on soluble serum proteins, including IgM. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of which of the about 60 var gene-encoded PfEMP1 variants per parasite genome can bind IgM via the Fc part of the antibody molecule, and which of the constituent domains of those PfEMP1 are involved. We erased the epigenetic memory of var gene expression in three distinct P. falciparum clones, 3D7, HB3, and IT4/FCR3 by promoter titration, and then isolated individual IEs binding IgM from malaria-unexposed individuals by fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting. The var gene transcription profiles of sub-clones measured by real-time qPCR were used to identify potential IgM-binding PfEMP1 variants. Recombinant DBL and CIDR domains corresponding to those variants were tested by ELISA and protein arrays to confirm their IgM-binding capacity. Selected DBL domains were used to raise specific rat anti-sera to select IEs with uniform expression of candidate PfEMP1 proteins. Our data document that IgM-binding PfEMP1 proteins are common in each of the three clones studied, and that the binding epitopes are mainly found in DBLε and DBLζ domains near the C-terminus.",Water walking as a new mode of free surface skipping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988350,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Deformable elastomeric spheres are evaluated experimentally as they skip multiple times over a lake surface. Some spheres are embedded with small inertial measurement units to measure the acceleration experienced during water surface impact. A model for multiple impact events shows good agreement between measured acceleration, number of skipping events and distanced traveled. The experiment reveals a new mode of skipping, ""water walking"", which is observed for relatively soft spheres impacting at low impact angles. The mode occurs when the sphere gains significant angular velocity over the first several impacts, causing the sphere to maintain a deformed, oblong shape. The behavior is characterized by the sphere moving nearly parallel to the water surface with the major axis tips dipping below the water surface with each rotation while the shorter sides pass just above, giving the impression that the sphere is walking across the water surface.",Platelet proteome reveals specific proteins associated with platelet activation and the hypercoagulable state in β-thalassmia/HbE patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988349,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"A hypercoagulable state leading to a high risk of a thrombotic event is one of the most common complications observed in β-thalassemia/HbE disease, particularly in patients who have undergone a splenectomy. However, the hypercoagulable state, as well as the molecular mechanism of this aspect of the pathogenesis of β-thalassemia/HbE, remains poorly understood. To address this issue, fifteen non-splenectomized β-thalassemia/HbE patients, 8 splenectomized β-thalassemia/HbE patients and 20 healthy volunteers were recruited to this study. Platelet activation and hypercoagulable parameters including levels of CD62P and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. A proteomic analysis was conducted to compare the platelet proteome between patients and normal subjects, and the results were validated by western blot analysis. The β-thalassemia/HbE patients showed significantly higher levels of CD62P and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 than normal subjects. The levels of platelet activation and hypercoagulation found in patients were strongly associated with splenectomy status. The platelet proteome analysis revealed 19 differential spots which were identified to be 19 platelet proteins, which included 10 cytoskeleton proteins, thrombin generation related proteins, and antioxidant enzymes. Our findings highlight markers of coagulation activation and molecular pathways known to be associated with the pathogenesis of platelet activation, the hypercoagulable state, and consequently with the thrombosis observed in β-thalassemia/HbE patients.",c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent internalization and Rab5-dependent endocytic sorting mediate long-distance retrograde neuronal death induced by axonal BDNF-p75 signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988348,Scientific reports,2019 04 20,"During the development of the sympathetic nervous system, signals from tropomyosin-related kinase receptors (Trks) and p75 neurotrophin receptors (p75) compete to regulate survival and connectivity. During this process, nerve growth factor (NGF)- TrkA signaling in axons communicates NGF-mediated trophic responses in signaling endosomes. Whether axonal p75 signaling contributes to neuronal death and how signaling endosomes contribute to p75 signaling has not been established. Using compartmentalized sympathetic neuronal cultures (CSCGs) as a model, we observed that the addition of BDNF to axons increased the transport of p75 and induced death of sympathetic neurons in a dynein-dependent manner. In cell bodies, internalization of p75 required the activity of JNK, a downstream kinase mediating p75 death signaling in neurons. Additionally, the activity of Rab5, the key GTPase regulating early endosomes, was required for p75 death signaling. In axons, JNK and Rab5 were required for retrograde transport and death signaling mediated by axonal BDNF-p75 in CSCGs. JNK was also required for the proper axonal transport of p75-positive endosomes. Thus, our findings provide evidence that the activation of JNK by p75 in cell bodies and axons is required for internalization to a Rab5-positive signaling endosome and the further propagation of p75-dependent neuronal death signals.",The horse Y chromosome as an informative marker for tracing sire lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988347,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Analysis of the Y chromosome is the best-established way to reconstruct paternal family history in humans. Here, we applied fine-scaled Y-chromosomal haplotyping in horses with biallelic markers and demonstrate the potential of our approach to address the ancestry of sire lines. We de novo assembled a draft reference of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome from Illumina short reads and then screened 5.8 million basepairs for variants in 130 specimens from intensively selected and rural breeds and nine Przewalski's horses. Among domestic horses we confirmed the predominance of a young'crown haplogroup' in Central European and North American breeds. Within the crown, we distinguished 58 haplotypes based on 211 variants, forming three major haplogroups. In addition to two previously characterised haplogroups, one observed in Arabian/Coldblooded and the other in Turkoman/Thoroughbred horses, we uncovered a third haplogroup containing Iberian lines and a North African Barb Horse. In a genealogical showcase, we distinguished the patrilines of the three English Thoroughbred founder stallions and resolved a historic controversy over the parentage of the horse 'Galopin', born in 1872. We observed two nearly instantaneous radiations in the history of Central and Northern European Y-chromosomal lineages that both occurred after domestication 5,500 years ago.",Gene co-expression networks contributing to the expression of compensatory growth in metabolically active tissues in cattle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988346,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Compensatory growth (CG) is an accelerated growth phenomenon which occurs in animals upon re-alimentation following a period of dietary restriction. The objective of this study was to perform gene co-expression analysis on metabolic tissues of animals undergoing CG, in order to elucidate the molecular control governing this phenomenon. Thirty Holstein Friesian bulls were fed a restricted diet for 125 days, after which they received feed ad libitum. Following 55 days of ad libitum feeding all animals were slaughtered. RNAseq and gene co-expression analyses were performed on tissue samples collected at slaughter including liver, rumen papillae and jejunum epithelium tissues. A period of CG resulted in 15 networks of co-expressed genes. One network of genes, involved in proteasome core complex, signal transduction and protein synthesis was found to be similar across liver and jejunum tissue datasets (r = 0.68, P = 0.04). Results from this study also showed that a large portion of co-expressed genes had not previously been implicated in the expression of CG, thus this study identifies novel genes involved in controlling CG across tissues, with hub genes holding potential for use as biomarkers for the selection of animals with a greater propensity to display CG.",Unveiling novel targets of paclitaxel resistance by single molecule long-read RNA sequencing in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988345,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"RNA sequencing has become one of the most common technology to study transcriptomes in cancer, whereas its length limits its application on alternative splicing (AS) events and novel isoforms. Firstly, we applied single molecule long-read RNA sequencing (Iso-seq) and de novo assembly with short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in both wild type (231-WT) and paclitaxel resistant type (231-PTX) of human breast cancer cell MDA-MBA-231. The two sequencing technology provide both the accurate transcript sequences and the deep transcript coverage. Then we combined shor-read and long-read RNA-seq to analyze alternative events and novel isoforms. Last but not the least, we selected BAK1 as our candidate target to verify our analysis. Our results implied that improved characterization of cancer genomic function may require the application of the single molecule long-read RNA sequencing to get the deeper and more precise view to transcriptional level.

Necropsies were performed in 22 cases and infectious diseases resulted the most common cause of death. Three striped dolphins, showed a severe coinfection involving the monophasic variant of Salmonella Typhimurium (Salmonella 1,4,[5],12:i:-). The isolates were characterized based on antimicrobial resistance, Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem-repeat Analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). All isolates demonstrated the same multidrug resistant genotype (ASSuT isolates), showed three different MLVA profiles, two of which closely related, and were identified as Sequence Type 34. Moreover, Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis confirmed strong correlations between two out of the three isolates. To our knowledge, S. 1,4,[5],12:i:-, one of the most common serovars in cases of human infection and food sources worldwide, has not previously been described in marine mammals, and reports of Salmonella-associated disease in free-ranging cetaceans are rare. These results highlight the role of cetaceans as sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment, suggest a potential risk for cetaceans and public health along the North Western Italian coastline and indicate cetaceans as a novel potential reservoir for one of the most widespread Salmonella serovars.","Effects of a phytogenic, alone and associated with potassium diformate, on tilapia growth, immunity, gut microbiome and resistance against francisellosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988331,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"This work evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation of A-Live (phytogenic) either individually or in combination with Aquaform (potassium diformate, acidifier) on juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) growth performance, innate immune parameters, gut microbiome, and resistance against Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis challenge. Each experimental group contained 140 fishes (34.3 ± 0.33) in two 150L tanks. The experimental design consisted of five groups: a negative control; treated groups (G1, G2, G3) supplemented with different concentrations of A-Live and Aquaform in the feed; and a positive control (PC) for pathogen infection. Groups G1, G2, G3, and PC were challenged with Francisella spp. after 15 days. After infection, the mortality was significantly lower in groups G1, G2, and G3 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, these groups showed significant increase (p < 0.05) in daily weight gain, feed conversion rate, and specific growth rate. The PC group presented increase (p < 0.05) in the leukocytes and neutrophils number. Innate immunity parameters showed no difference between treatments after infection. Microbiome analysis revealed an increased number of bacteria belonging to the Vibrionaceae family after pathogen infection suggesting a secondary pathogen function of these bacteria.

As much as 70% of men over 70 will develop BPH. Few studies have been conducted to discover the genetic determinants of BPH risk. Understanding the biological basis for this condition may provide necessary insight for development of novel pharmaceutical therapies or risk prediction. We have evaluated SNP-based heritability of BPH in two cohorts and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BPH risk using 2,656 cases and 7,763 controls identified from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. SNP-based heritability estimates suggest that roughly 60% of the phenotypic variation in BPH is accounted for by genetic factors. We used logistic regression to model BPH risk as a function of principal components of ancestry, age, and imputed genotype data, with meta-analysis performed using METAL. The top result was on chromosome 22 in SYN3 at rs2710383 (p-value = 4.6 × 10-7; Odds Ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval = 0.55-0.83). Other suggestive signals were near genes GLGC, UNCA13, SORCS1 and between BTBD3 and SPTLC3. We also evaluated genetically-predicted gene expression in prostate tissue. The most significant result was with increasing predicted expression of ETV4 (chr17; p-value = 0.0015). Overexpression of this gene has been associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer. In conclusion, although there were no genome-wide significant variants identified for BPH susceptibility, we present evidence supporting the heritability of this phenotype, have identified suggestive signals, and evaluated the association between BPH and genetically-predicted gene expression in prostate.",Physiological stress levels in wild koala sub-populations facing anthropogenic induced environmental trauma and disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988329,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Australian small mammals such as koalas must cope with immense pressure from anthropogenic induced stressors or trauma such as bushfires, vehicle collision impacts and habitat disturbance and land clearance. In addition, they must cope with diseases such as chlamydia. To date, there is no published literature on physiological stress levels in wild koala populations compared with identified environmental stressors. This study investigated physiological stress levels within sub-populations of wild koalas encountering environmental trauma and disease from New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA). Physiological stress was determined using a faecal glucocorticoid (or cortisol) metabolites (FGMs) enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) from 291 fresh faecal samples collected from wild koalas at the point of rescue. A healthy breeding sub-population from a forest reserve in QLD acted as a control group. Clearance of prime Eucalyptus habitat had the largest impact on FGMs, followed by bushfire related factors (e.g. flat demeanour, dehydration and burns injury). Koalas with other sources of physical injury (dog-attacks and vehicle collisions) and disease (chlamydia) also had higher FGMs compared to healthy wild koalas. Healthy wild koalas expressed the lowest median levels of FGMs. Overall, the results highlight that anthropogenic-induced stressors tend to increase physiological stress in wild koalas. Thus, the ultimate stressors such as habitat clearance and bush fire events could increase the incidences of proximate stressors such as dog attacks and vehicle collisions, and increase risks of foliage shortage, diseases and mortality. Therefore, there is need for ecological monitoring, conservation management actions and policy changes to curb the koala population crisis, especially within on-going and future land and road development programs.",Controlling frequency dispersion in electromagnetic invisibility cloaks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988328,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Electromagnetic cloaking, as challenging as it may be to the physicist and the engineer has become a topical subject over the past decade. Thanks to the transformations optics (TO) invisibility devices are in sight even though quite drastic limitations remain yet to be lifted. The extreme material properties which are deduced from TO can be achieved in practice using dispersive metamaterials. However, the bandwidth over which a metamaterial cloak is efficient is drastically limited. We design and simulate a spherical cloak which takes into account the dispersive nature of relative permittivity and permeability tensors realized by plasma-like metamaterials. This spherical cloak works over a broad frequency-band even though these materials are of a highly dispersive nature. We establish two equations of state that link the eigenvalues of the permittivity and permeability tensors in every spherical cloak regardless of the geometrical transformation. Frequency dispersive properties do not disrupt cloaking as long as the equations of states are satisfied in the metamaterial cloak.",Single platinum atoms embedded in nanoporous cobalt selenide as electrocatalyst for accelerating hydrogen evolution reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988327,Nature communications,2019 04 26,"Designing efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction is significant for renewable and sustainable energy conversion. Here, we report single-atom platinum decorated nanoporous Co0.85Se (Pt/np-Co0.85Se) as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. The achieved Pt/np-Co0.85Se shows high catalytic performance with a near-zero onset overpotential, a low Tafel slope of 35 mV dec-1, and a high turnover frequency of 3.93 s-1 at -100 mV in neutral media, outperforming commercial Pt/C catalyst and other reported transition-metal-based compounds. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined with density functional theory calculations indicate that single-atom platinum in Pt/np-Co0.85Se not only can optimize surface states of Co0.85Se active centers under realistic working conditions, but also can significantly reduce energy barriers of water dissociation and improve adsorption/desorption behavior of hydrogen, which synergistically promote thermodynamics and kinetics. This work opens up further opportunities for local electronic structures tuning of electrocatalysts to effectively manipulate its catalytic properties by an atomic-level engineering strategy.",Host population density and presence of predators as key factors influencing the number of gregarious parasitoid Anaphes flavipes offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988326,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"The number of parasitoids developed per host is one of the major factors that influences future adult body size and reproductive success. Here, we examined four external factors (host species, heritability, host population density, and presence of predators) that can affect the number of the gregarious parasitoid Anaphes flavipes (Förster, 1841) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) wasps developing in one host. The effect of host population density on the number of parasitoid offspring developed per host was confirmed, and for the first time, we also showed that the number of offspring per host is influenced by the presence of predators. Low host density and presence of predators increases the number of wasps developed in one host egg. However, a higher number of A. flavipes in one host reduces A. flavipes body size and hence its future individual fertility and fitness. Our results highlighted the importance of some external factors that distinctly affect the number of wasp offspring. Therefore, in this context, we suggest that in comparison to solitary parasitoids, the gregarious parasitoid A. flavipes can better respond to various external factors and can more flexibly change its population density.",Intra- and interobserver reproducibility of pancreatic perfusion by computed tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988325,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"The aim of this study was to measure intra- and interobserver agreement among radiologists in the assessment of pancreatic perfusion by computed tomography (CT). Thirty-nine perfusion CT scans were analyzed. The following parameters were measured by three readers: blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT) and time to peak (TTP). Statistical analysis was performed using the Bland-Altman method, linear mixed model analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). There was no significant intraobserver variability for the readers regarding BF, BV or TTP. There were session effects for BF in the pancreatic body and MTT in the pancreatic tail and whole pancreas. There were reader effects for BV in the pancreatic head, pancreatic body and whole pancreas. There were no effects for the interaction between session and reader for any perfusion parameter. ICCs showed substantial agreement for the interobserver measurements and moderate to substantial agreement for the intraobserver measurements, with the exception of MTT. In conclusion, satisfactory reproducibility of measurements was observed for TTP in all pancreatic regions, for BF in the head and BV in the tail, and these parameters seem to ensure a reasonable estimation of pancreatic perfusion.",Three-dimensional partitioning of resources by congeneric forest predators with recent sympatry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988324,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Coexistence of ecologically similar species can be maintained by partitioning along one or more niche axes. Three-dimensional structural complexity is central to facilitating resource partitioning between many forest species, but is underrepresented in field-based studies. We examined resource selection by sympatric northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), a threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act, and nonnative barred owls (S. varia) in western Oregon, USA to explore the relative importance of canopy heterogeneity, vertical complexity of forest, and abiotic features to resource selection and identify potential differences that may facilitate long-term coexistence. We predicted that within home range selection of understory densities, measured with airborne lidar, would differ between species based on proportional differences in arboreal and terrestrial prey taken by each owl species. We used discrete choice models and telemetry data from 41 spotted owls and 38 barred owls monitored during 2007-2009 and 2012-2015. Our results suggested that while both species used tall canopy areas more often than low canopy areas, spotted owls were more commonly found in areas with lower tree cover, more developed understory, and steeper slopes. This is the first evidence of fine-scale partitioning based on structural forest properties by northern spotted owls and barred owls.",Transcriptome Profiles of Alternaria oxytropis Provides Insights into Swainsonine Biosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988322,Scientific reports,2019 04 19,"Swainsonine (SW) is a toxic alkaloid biosynthesized by the endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis in Oxytropis glabra. The biosynthetic pathway of SW is poorly understood. Saccharopine reductase/dehydrogenase of fungus plays an important role in this pathway. The gene knocked out mutant M1 in A. oxytropis was constructed in our previous work. In this study, the transcriptome of wild-strain OW7.8 and M1 was firstly sequenced to understand the biosynthetic pathway and molecular mechanism of SW in A. oxytropis. A total of 45,634 Unigenes were annotated. 5 genes were up-regulated and 11,213 genes were down-regulated. 41 Unigenes possibly related to the biosynthesis of SW were identified by data analyzing. The biosynthesis pathway of SW in the fungus was speculated, including two branches of P6C and P2C. Delta1-piperidine-2-carboxylate reductase, lysine 6-dehydrogenase, and saccharopine oxidase/L-pipecolate oxidase were involved in P6C. 1-piperidine-2-carboxylate/1-pyrroline-2- carboxylate reductase [NAD(P)H] and delta1-piperidine-2-carboxylate reductase were involved in P2C. Saccharopine reductase was involved in both. In addition, 1-indolizidineone was considered to be the direct precursor in the synthesis of SW, and the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase catalyzed the synthesis of SW. Here we analyzed details of the metabolic pathway of A. oxytropis SW, which is of great significance for the follow-up research."

However, peptide tags often provide minimal benefit post-purification. We previously designed SpyTag, forming an irreversible bond with its protein partner SpyCatcher. SpyTag provides an easy route to anchor, bridge or multimerize proteins. Here we establish Spy&Go, enabling protein purification using SpyTag. Through rational engineering we generated SpyDock, which captures SpyTag-fusions and allows efficient elution. Spy&Go enabled sensitive purification of SpyTag-fusions from Escherichia coli, giving superior purity than His-tag/nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. Spy&Go allowed purification of mammalian-expressed, N-terminal, C-terminal or internal SpyTag. As an oligomerization toolbox, we established a panel of SpyCatcher-linked coiled coils, so SpyTag-fusions can be dimerized, trimerized, tetramerized, pentamerized, hexamerized or heptamerized.

However, characterisation of side-chain motions has so far been restricted to small proteins and methyl-bearing side chains. Here we present a class of methods, based on 13C-detected NMR spectroscopy, to more generally quantify motions and interactions of side chains in medium-to-large proteins. A single, uniformly isotopically labelled sample is sufficient to characterise the side chains of six different amino acid types. Side-chain conformational dynamics on the millisecond time-scale can be quantified by incorporating chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) into the presented methods, whilst long-range 13C-13C scalar couplings reporting on nanosecond to millisecond motions can be quantified in proteins as large as 80 kDa. The presented class of methods promises characterisation of side-chain behaviour at a level that has so far been reserved for the protein backbone.",Luteolin promotes apoptotic cell death via upregulation of Nrf2 expression by DNA demethylase and the interaction of Nrf2 with p53 in human colon cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988303,Experimental & molecular medicine,2019 06 10,"Luteolin, a dietary flavone, modulates various signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism that underlies the apoptotic effects of luteolin mediated by DNA demethylation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) promoter and the interaction of Nrf2 and p53, a tumor suppressor, in human colon cancer cells. Luteolin increased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and antioxidant enzymes. In DNA methylation, luteolin inhibited the expression of DNA methyltransferases, a transcription repressor, and increased the expression and activity of ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA demethylases, a transcription activator. Methyl-specific polymerase chain reaction and bisulfite genomic sequencing indicated that luteolin decreased the methylation of the Nrf2 promoter region, which corresponded to the increased mRNA expression of Nrf2. In addition, luteolin increased TET1 binding to the Nrf2 promoter, as determined using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. TET1 knockdown decreased the percentages of luteolin-treated cells in sub-G1 phase and cells with fragmented nuclei. Furthermore, complex formation between p53 and Nrf2 was involved in the apoptotic effects of luteolin. These results provide insight into the mechanism that underlies the anticancer effects of luteolin on colon cancer, which involve the upregulation of Nrf2 and its interaction with the tumor suppressor.",Origin and differentiation trajectories of fibroblastic reticular cells in the splenic white pulp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988302,Nature communications,2019 05 16,"The splenic white pulp is underpinned by poorly characterized stromal cells that demarcate distinct immune cell microenvironments. Here we establish fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-specific fate-mapping in mice to define their embryonic origin and differentiation trajectories. Our data show that all reticular cell subsets descend from multipotent progenitors emerging at embryonic day 19.5 from periarterial progenitors. Commitment of FRC progenitors is concluded during the first week of postnatal life through occupation of niches along developing central arterioles. Single cell transcriptomic analysis facilitated deconvolution of FRC differentiation trajectories and indicated that perivascular reticular cells function both as adult lymphoid organizer cells and mural cell progenitors. The lymphotoxin-β receptor-independent sustenance of postnatal progenitor stemness unveils that systemic immune surveillance in the splenic white pulp is governed through subset specification of reticular cells from a multipotent periarterial progenitor cell. In sum, the finding that discrete signaling events in perivascular niches determine the differentiation trajectories of reticular cell networks explains the development of distinct microenvironmental niches in secondary and tertiary lymphoid tissues that are crucial for the induction and regulation of innate and adaptive immune processes.",Genome-wide association and transcriptome studies identify target genes and risk loci for breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988301,Nature communications,2019 05 16,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 170 breast cancer susceptibility loci. Here we hypothesize that some risk-associated variants might act in non-breast tissues, specifically adipose tissue and immune cells from blood and spleen. Using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) reported in these tissues, we identify 26 previously unreported, likely target genes of overall breast cancer risk variants, and 17 for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer, several with a known immune function. We determine the directional effect of gene expression on disease risk measured based on single and multiple eQTL. In addition, using a gene-based test of association that considers eQTL from multiple tissues, we identify seven (and four) regions with variants associated with overall (and ER-negative) breast cancer risk, which were not reported in previous GWAS. Further investigation of the function of the implicated genes in breast and immune cells may provide insights into the etiology of breast cancer.",PDGFRα+ stromal adipocyte progenitors transition into epithelial cells during lobulo-alveologenesis in the murine mammary gland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988300,Nature communications,2019 05 16,"The mammary gland experiences substantial remodeling and regeneration during development and reproductive life, facilitated by stem cells and progenitors that act in concert with physiological stimuli. While studies have focused on deciphering regenerative cells within the parenchymal epithelium, cell lineages in the stroma that may directly contribute to epithelial biology is unknown. Here we identify, in mouse, the transition of a PDGFRα+ mesenchymal cell population into mammary epithelial progenitors. In addition to being adipocyte progenitors, PDGFRα+ cells make a de novo contribution to luminal and basal epithelia during mammary morphogenesis. In the adult, this mesenchymal lineage primarily generates luminal progenitors within lobuloalveoli during sex hormone exposure or pregnancy. We identify cell migration as a key molecular event that is activated in mesenchymal progenitors in response to epithelium-derived chemoattractant. These findings demonstrate a stromal reservoir of epithelial progenitors and provide insight into cell origins and plasticity during mammary tissue growth.",Early life stress disrupts intestinal homeostasis via NGF-TrkA signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988299,Nature communications,2019 05 16,"Early childhood is a critical period for development, and early life stress may increase the risk of gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). In rodents, neonatal maternal separation (NMS) induces bowel dysfunctions that resemble IBS. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that NMS induces expansion of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and their differentiation toward secretory lineages including enterochromaffin (EC) and Paneth cells, leading to EC hyperplasia, increased serotonin production, and visceral hyperalgesia. This is reversed by inhibition of nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) signalling, and treatment with NGF recapitulates the intestinal phenotype of NMS mice in vivo and in mouse intestinal organoids in vitro. Mechanistically, NGF transactivates Wnt/β-catenin signalling. NGF and serotonin are positively correlated in the sera of diarrhea-predominant IBS patients. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into early life stress-induced intestinal changes that may translate into treatments for gastrointestinal diseases.",Partially methylated domains are hypervariable in breast cancer and fuel widespread CpG island hypermethylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988298,Nature communications,2019 05 16,"Global loss of DNA methylation and CpG island (CGI) hypermethylation are key epigenomic aberrations in cancer. Global loss manifests itself in partially methylated domains (PMDs) which extend up to megabases. However, the distribution of PMDs within and between tumor types, and their effects on key functional genomic elements including CGIs are poorly defined. We comprehensively show that loss of methylation in PMDs occurs in a large fraction of the genome and represents the prime source of DNA methylation variation. PMDs are hypervariable in methylation level, size and distribution, and display elevated mutation rates. They impose intermediate DNA methylation levels incognizant of functional genomic elements including CGIs, underpinning a CGI methylator phenotype (CIMP). Repression effects on tumor suppressor genes are negligible as they are generally excluded from PMDs. The genomic distribution of PMDs reports tissue-of-origin and may represent tissue-specific silent regions which tolerate instability at the epigenetic, transcriptomic and genetic level.",A universal state and its relaxation mechanisms of long-range interacting polygons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988297,Nature communications,2019 04 26,"Using polygonal magnetic particles, we conduct experiments to explore the space-filling properties of anisotropic blocks with long-range interactions. In contrast to previous studies, we obtain the surprising finding that our systems' structures do not depend on the shape of building blocks: a single state, the hexagonal plastic crystal, appears as a universal attractor for a wide range of different polygons. This robust particle-shape independency appears as the interactions go beyond nearest neighbors. Particle shape plays an essential role in system relaxation, and determines the basic relaxation dynamics through a microscopic control parameter, internal roughness, produced by particle vertices. Thus our study reveals a new pattern-forming paradigm, in which particle shape plays little role in the static structure but determines the essential relaxation dynamics. Due to the ubiquity of long-range interactions and anisotropic building blocks, our discovery may shed new light on diverse problems involving structure formation, self-assembly, and packing.",A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988296,Nature communications,2019 05 03,"Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems, including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some ""visible"" states can be implemented with master equation dynamics-if the dynamics exploits additional, ""hidden"" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of ""hidden"" timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a ""space-time"" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function."

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a direct contributor to the fibroblast pool during fibrogenesis, and prevention of EMT is considered an effective strategy to inhibit tissue fibrosis. Our previous study revealed that TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) regulates EMT in lung cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting TBK1 to prevent RIPF and EMT progression. We found radiation-induced EMT and pulmonary fibrosis in normal alveolar epithelial cells and lung tissues. TBK1 knockdown or inhibition significantly reversed EMT in vivo and in vitro and attenuated pulmonary fibrosis and collagen deposition. Moreover, we observed that TBK1 was elevated in a time- and dose-dependent manner by radiation. Meanwhile, radiation also induced time- and dose-dependent activation of AKT and ERK, each of whose inhibitors suppressed radiation-induced EMT. Intriguingly, silencing of TBK1 with shRNA also blocked the radiation-induced activation of AKT and ERK signaling. The ERK inhibitor did not obviously affect the expression of TBK1 or phosphorylated AKT, while AKT inhibition suppressed activation of ERK without changing the expression of TBK1. Finally, we found that a TBK1 inhibitor inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression in a RIPF model and Amlexanox protected normal cells and mice from ionizing radiation. In conclusion, our results indicate that the TBK1-AKT-ERK signaling pathway regulates radiation-induced EMT in normal alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting that TBK1 is a potential target for pulmonary fibrosis prevention during cancer radiotherapy.",TRAF2 protects against cerebral ischemia-induced brain injury by suppressing necroptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988281,Cell death & disease,2019 04 18,"Necroptosis contributes to ischemia-induced brain injury. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) has been reported to suppress necroptotic cell death under several pathological conditions. In this study, we investigated the role of TRAF2 in experimental stroke using a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model and in vitro cellular models. TRAF2 expression in the ischemic brain was assessed with western blot and real-time RT-PCR. Gene knockdown of TRAF2 by lentivirus was utilized to investigate the role of TRAF2 in stroke outcomes. The expression of TRAF2 was significantly induced in the ischemic brain at 24 h after reperfusion, and neurons and microglia were two of the cellular sources of TRAF2 induction. Striatal knockdown of TRAF2 increased infarction size, cell death, microglial activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory markers at 24 h after reperfusion. TRAF2 expression and necroptosis were induced in mouse primary microglia treated with conditioned medium collected from neurons subject to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and in TNFα-treated mouse hippocampal neuronal HT-22 cells in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD. In addition, TRAF2 knockdown exacerbated microglial cell death and neuronal cell death under these conditions. Moreover, pre-treatment with a specific necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (nec-1) suppressed the cell death exacerbated by TRAF2 knockdown in the brain following MCAO, indicating that TRAF2 impacted ischemic brain damage through necroptosis mechanism. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TRAF2 is a novel regulator of cerebral ischemic injury.",S-nitrosylation of the Peroxiredoxin-2 promotes S-nitrosoglutathione-mediated lung cancer cells apoptosis via AMPK-SIRT1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988280,Cell death & disease,2019 04 18,"Protein S-nitrosylation, the redox-based posttranslational modification of a cysteine thiol by the attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) group, is responsible for a variety of signaling effects. Dysregulation of S-nitrosylation may be directly linked to cancer apoptotic resistance and cancer therapy outcomes, emphasizing the importance of S-nitrosylation in cancer. Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prdx2), an antioxidant enzyme, plays an important role in the protection of cancer cells from oxidative radical damage caused by hydrogen dioxide (H2O2), which is a potential target for cancer therapy. Our studies showed that, as an endogenous NO carrier, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells via nitrosylating Prdx2. The nitrosylation of Prdx2 at Cys51 and Cys172 sites disrupted the formation of Prdx2 dimer and repressed the Prdx2 antioxidant activity, causing the accumulation of endogenous H2O2. H2O2 activated AMPK, which then phosphorylated SIRT1 and inhibited its deacetylation activity toward p53 in A549 cells or FOXO1 in NCI-H1299 cells. Taken together, our results elucidate the roles and mechanisms of Prdx2 S-nitrosylation at Cys51 and Cys172 sites in lung cancer cells apoptosis and this finding provides an effective lung cancer treatment strategy for managing aberrant Prdx2 activity in lung cancers.",Ferritinophagy is required for the induction of ferroptosis by the bromodomain protein BRD4 inhibitor (+)-JQ1 in cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988278,Cell death & disease,2019 04 18,"(+)-JQ1 is an inhibitor of the tumor-driver bromodomain protein BRD4 and produces satisfactory effects because it efficiently increases apoptosis. Ferroptosis is an oxidative cell death program differing from apoptosis. Ferroptosis is characterized by high levels of iron and reactive oxygen species and has been confirmed to suppress tumor growth. In this study, BRD4 expression in cancer and its influence on the prognosis of cancer patients were analyzed using data from public databases. In addition, the effect of the BRD4 inhibitor (+)-JQ1 on ferroptosis was investigated via a series of in vitro assays. A nude mouse model was used to evaluate the function of (+)-JQ1 in ferroptosis in vivo. The potential mechanisms by which (+)-JQ1 regulates ferroptosis were explored. The results showed that BRD4 expression levels were higher in cancer tissues than in normal tissues and were related to poor prognosis in cancer patients. Furthermore, ferroptosis was induced under (+)-JQ1 treatment and BRD4 knockdown, indicating that (+)-JQ1 induces ferroptosis via BRD4 inhibition. Moreover, the anticancer effect of (+)-JQ1 was enhanced by ferroptosis inducers. Further studies confirmed that (+)-JQ1 induced ferroptosis via ferritinophagy, which featured autophagy enhancement by (+)-JQ1 and increased iron levels. Subsequently, the reactive oxygen species levels were increased by iron via the Fenton reaction, leading to ferroptosis. In addition, expression of the ferroptosis-associated genes GPX4, SLC7A11, and SLC3A2 was downregulated under (+)-JQ1 treatment and BRD4 knockdown, indicating that (+)-JQ1 may regulate ferroptosis by controlling the expression of ferroptosis-associated genes regulated by BRD4. Finally, (+)-JQ1 regulated ferritinophagy and the expression of ferroptosis-associated genes via epigenetic inhibition of BRD4 by suppressing the expression of the histone methyltransferase G9a or enhancing the expression of the histone deacetylase SIRT1. In summary, the BRD4 inhibitor (+)-JQ1 induces ferroptosis via ferritinophagy or the regulation of ferroptosis-associated genes through epigenetic repression of BRD4.",ESCRT-III is necessary for the integrity of the nuclear envelope in micronuclei but is aberrant at ruptured micronuclear envelopes generating damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988276,Oncogenesis,2019 04 16,"Micronuclei represent the cellular attempt to compartmentalize DNA to maintain genomic integrity threatened by mitotic errors and genotoxic events. Some micronuclei show aberrant nuclear envelopes (NEs) that collapse, generating damaged DNA that can promote complex genome alterations. However, ruptured micronuclei also provide a pool of cytosolic DNA that can stimulate antitumor immunity, revealing the complexity of micronuclear impact on tumor progression. The ESCRT-III (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III) complex ensures NE reseals during late mitosis and is repaired in interphase. Therefore, ESCRT-III activity maybe crucial for maintaining the integrity of other genomic structures enclosed by a NE. ESCRT-III activity at the NE is coordinated by the subunit CHMP7. We show that CHMP7 and ESCRT-III protect against the genomic instability associated with micronuclei formation. Loss of ESCRT-III activity increases the population of micronuclei with ruptured NEs, revealing that its NE repair activity is also necessary to maintain micronuclei integrity. Surprisingly, aberrant accumulation of ESCRT-III are found at the envelope of most acentric collapsed micronuclei, suggesting that ESCRT-III is not recycled efficiently from these structures. Moreover, CHMP7 depletion relieves micronuclei from the aberrant accumulations of ESCRT-III. CHMP7-depleted cells display a reduction in micronuclei containing the DNA damage marker RPA and a sensor of cytosolic DNA. Thus, ESCRT-III activity appears to protect from the consequence of genomic instability in a dichotomous fashion: ESCRT-III membrane repair activity prevents the occurrence of micronuclei with weak envelopes, but the aberrant accumulation of ESCRT-III on a subset of micronuclei appears to exacerbate DNA damage and sustain proinflammatory pathways.",Radiologic Features with Pathologic Correlation of an Unusual Large Intraosseous Skull Cavernous Hemangioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988275,The American journal of case reports,2019 05 05,"BACKGROUND Intraosseous cavernous skull hemangiomas are rare benign vascular tumors that are usually found incidentally on imaging, with an asymptomatic and slow-growing course. We present a case in which the patient had a mass on her forehead for many years, which began to grow rapidly after head trauma. Imaging characteristics play a crucial role in the diagnosis and description of this disease, and in differentiating it from other more common calvarial lesions that may present with a similar clinical picture. Here, we report an unusual presentation of a large skull hemangioma and discuss the different radiologic imaging findings and pathologic correlations. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old female with history of a lump on her forehead since childhood, which began to grow rapidly after experiencing a closed-head injury. Due to its large size, she went on to seek further management. Radiologic images revealed a frontal skull lesion suggestive of an intraosseous hemangioma. She underwent embolization of the tumor, and 2 days later underwent bilateral frontal craniectomy and cranioplasty. Histopathologic findings confirmed this diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Intraosseous skull hemangioma may be confidently diagnosed and differentiated from other skull lesions by its imaging characteristics. An accurate diagnosis is essential to selecting correct management and avoiding complications.",Identification of Altered Circular RNA Expression in Serum Exosomes from Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma by High-Throughput Sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988274,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 05 03,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to identify altered exosome circular RNA (circRNA) in the serum of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma using high-throughput sequencing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum was collected from three patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma and three patients with a benign thyroid goiter. Exosomes were isolated using an exosome isolation kit and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Exosome circRNAs were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing using the HiSeq 4000 sequencer. The differentially expressed circRNAs were confirmed by fluorescence quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS Twenty-two differentially expressed circRNAs were screened, which included three that were upregulated and 19 that were down-regulated in serum from patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma compared with controls. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that these differentially expressed circRNAs were associated with 16 signaling pathways, including the thyroid hormone signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the AMPK signaling pathway. Three differentially regulated circRNAs included hsacirc_007293, hsacirc_031752, and hsacirc_020135 were confirmed by qRT- PCR. The expression trends were consistent between the high-throughput sequencing technique and qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this study have shown that gene regulation can be studied from exosomes obtained from serum samples in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, and supports the need for further studies on the role of exosome circRNAs in thyroid cancer.",Investigation into Micropollutant Removal from Wastewaters by a Membrane Bioreactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988273,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Direct potable reuse of wastewater is attractive as the demand for potable water increases. However, the presence of organic micropollutants in industrial and domestic wastewater is a major health and environmental concern. Conventional wastewater treatment processes are not designed to remove these compounds. Further many of these emerging pollutants are not regulated. Membrane bioreactor based biological wastewater treatment has recently become a preferred method for treating municipal and other industrial wastewaters. Here the removal of five selected micropollutants representing different classes of emerging micropollutants has been investigated using a membrane bioreactor. Acetaminophen, amoxicillin, atrazine, estrone, and triclosan were spiked into wastewaters obtained from a local wastewater treatment facility prior to introduction to the membrane bioreactor containing both anoxic and aerobic tanks. Removal of these compounds by adsorption and biological degradation was determined for both the anoxic and aerobic processes. The removal as a function of operating time was investigated. The results obtained here suggest that removal may be related to the chemical structure of the micropollutants.",More than a Toxin: Protein Inventory of Clostridium tetani Toxoid Vaccines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988272,Proteomes,2019 04 16,"Clostridium tetani is the etiological agent of tetanus, a life-threatening bacterial infection. The most efficient protection strategy against tetanus is a vaccination with the C. tetani neurotoxin, which is inactivated by formaldehyde-crosslinking. Since we assumed that besides the tetanus toxin, other proteins of C. tetani may also be present in toxoid preparations, we analyzed commercially available vaccines from different countries in respect to their protein content using mass spectrometry. In total 991 proteins could be identified in all five analyzed vaccines, 206 proteins were common in all analyzed vaccines and 54 proteins from the 206 proteins were potential antigens. The additionally present proteins may contribute at least partially to protection against C. tetani infection by supporting the function of the vaccine against the devastating effects of the tetanus toxin indirectly. Two different label-free protein quantification methods were applied for an estimation of protein contents. Similar results were obtained with a Total Protein Approach (TPA)-based method and Protein Discoverer 2.2 software package based on the minora algorithm. Depending on the tetanus toxoid vaccine and the quantification method used, tetanus neurotoxin contributes between 14 and 76 % to the total C. tetani protein content and varying numbers of other C. tetani proteins were detected.",Renoprotective Effect of Laminaria japonica Polysaccharide in Adenine-Induced Chronic Renal Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988271,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a major public health problem worldwide. In this work, we investigated the effects of a purified Laminaria japonica polysaccharide (LJP61A) on renal function using an adenine-induced CRF mice model. Results exhibited that adenine treatment caused serious renal pathological damages and elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen of mice. However, these changes could be significantly reversed by the administration of LJP61A in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, LJP61A could dramatically reduce weight loss, improve the urine biochemical index, and regulate the electrolyte disturbance of CRF mice. These results suggest that the renal function of adenine-induced CRF mice can be improved by LJP61A, which might be developed into a potential therapeutic agent for CRF patients."

Section D, Structural biology",2019 04 16,"The structure of the γ subunit of archaeal translation initiation factor 2 (aIF2) from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoIF2γ) was determined in complex with GDPCP (a GTP analog). Crystals were obtained in the absence of magnesium ions in the crystallization solution. They belonged to space group P1, with five molecules in the unit cell. Four of these molecules are related in pairs by a common noncrystallographic twofold symmetry axis, while the fifth has no symmetry equivalent. Analysis of the structure and its comparison with other known aIF2 γ-subunit structures in the GTP-bound state show that (i) the magnesium ion is necessary for the formation and the maintenance of the active form of SsoIF2γ and (ii) in addition to the two previously known structural switches 1 and 2, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and aIF2 molecules have another flexible region (switch 3), the function of which may consist of initiation of the hydrolysis of GTP and the removal of e/aIF2 from the ribosome after codon-anticodon recognition.",Conformational changes in the third PDZ domain of the neuronal postsynaptic density protein 95.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988255,"Acta crystallographica. Section D, Structural biology",2019 04 16,"PDZ domains are protein-protein recognition modules that interact with other proteins through short sequences at the carboxyl terminus. These domains are structurally characterized by a conserved fold composed of six β-strands and two α-helices. The third PDZ domain of the neuronal postsynaptic density protein 95 has an additional α-helix (α3), the role of which is not well known. In previous structures, a succinimide was identified in the β2-β3 loop instead of Asp332. The presence of this modified residue results in conformational changes in α3. In this work, crystallographic structures of the following have been solved: a truncated form of the third PDZ domain of the neuronal postsynaptic density protein 95 from which α3 has been removed, D332P and D332G variants of the protein, and a new crystal form of this domain showing the binding of Asp332 to the carboxylate-binding site of a symmetry-related molecule. Crystals of the wild type and variants were obtained in different space groups, which reflects the conformational plasticity of the domain. Indeed, the overall analysis of these structures suggests that the conformation of the β2-β3 loop is correlated with the fold acquired by α3. The alternate conformation of the β2-β3 loop affects the electrostatics of the carboxylate-binding site and might modulate the binding of different PDZ-binding motifs.",Refinement of protein structures using a combination of quantum-mechanical calculations with neutron and X-ray crystallographic data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988254,"Acta crystallographica. Section D, Structural biology",2019 04 21,"Neutron crystallography is a powerful method to determine the positions of H atoms in macromolecular structures. However, it is sometimes hard to judge what would constitute a chemically reasonable model, and the geometry of H atoms depends more on the surroundings (for example the formation of hydrogen bonds) than heavy atoms, so that the empirical geometry information for the H atoms used to supplement the experimental data is often less accurate. These problems may be reduced by using quantum-mechanical calculations. A method has therefore been developed to combine quantum-mechanical calculations with joint crystallographic refinement against X-ray and neutron data. A first validation of this method is provided by re-refining the structure of the galectin-3 carbohydrate-recognition domain in complex with lactose.

Section D, Structural biology",2019 04 21,"The cation diffusion facilitators (CDFs) are a family of membrane-bound proteins that maintain cellular homeostasis of essential metal ions. In humans, the zinc-transporter CDF family members (ZnTs) play important roles in zinc homeostasis. They do this by facilitating zinc efflux from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space across the plasma membrane or into intracellular organelles. Several ZnTs have been implicated in human health owing to their association with type 2 diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Although the structure determination of CDF family members is not trivial, recent advances in membrane-protein structural biology have resulted in two structures of bacterial YiiPs and several structures of their soluble C-terminal domains. These data reveal new insights into the molecular mechanism of ZnT proteins, suggesting a unique rocking-bundle mechanism that provides alternating access to the metal-binding site.",Rituximab to Abbreviate Plasma Exchange in Anti-CFH (Complement Factor H) Antibody Mediated Atypical HUS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988252,Iranian journal of kidney diseases,2019 05 21,"While terminal complement blockade with Eculizumab is the first line therapy for atypical HUS (Haemolytic uremic syndrome), lack of its availability and cost limits its use. Plasma exchange becomes a first line modality in the current scenario. However, exposure to large volumes of allogenic plasma and lack of skilled manpower are the limiting factors associated with it. Moreover, there is a subset of patients who fail to respond to plasma exchange. Treatment and follow up records of the children with atypical HUS who did not respond to daily plasma exchange therapy and their course during follow up was reviewed. Three children with positive anti-complement factor H antibody atypical HUS did not respond to daily plasma exchange and were  Rituximab administered after completing five daily treatments. It was seen that these children, initially non-responsive to plasma therapy, attained remission after Rituximab and did not require further plasma exchanges. The remission was sustained in long term with a follow up of 7 years, 4 years and 6 months respectively. Rituximab might be a useful alternative in inducing haematological remission in children with poor or no response to plasma therapy.

Efficiency and safety are also needed in the ""production logistics"" of manufacturing companies, and the ""crowd dynamics"" pertaining to people or vehicles. Investigating the growth of the embryonic cerebral cortex with an insight into such a system-level management of collective flows has recently revealed interesting cellular strategies to combat the spatiotemporal limitations. First, two sibling cells enter a narrow outflow space to overcome a bottleneck via a sequential departure similar to staggered commuting. This is achieved by asymmetric inheritance from the mother cell to one of the sibling cells with respect to cellular structure, and is analogous to a priority boarding pass. Second, newly generated sibling cells passively propel due to a mechanical force from the surrounding space. This space, densely filled with neighboring cells' processes, is elastic and assists in an indirect mother-to-daughter energy transfer. The mother cell has stored mechanical energy during its lateral/centrifugal expansion stage of mitosis while the surrounding space centripetally recoils to push the daughter cells. Third, young neurons act as a mechanical barrier to the movement of the mother cells thereby ensuring their normal proliferation.",[Diabetes Mellitus and Dementia].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988230,Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,2019 05 24,"Accumulating data have established that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for dementia of both Alzheimer's and vascular types.

While such communication is essential for solving the complex social and technological problems that affect multiple stakeholders, a diversity of knowledge among communicators can create representational gaps (rGaps). rGaps occur when senders make assumptions that receivers do not, creating conflict over the meaning and value of the information communicated. Such conflict could, if managed, promote learning and innovation as communicators reconcile their assumptions. More often, however, rGaps cause conflict to transform from a debate that informs to an argument that divides. Managing rGap conflict so that it does not degrade communication requires relationship building to mitigate the negative by-products of persistent conflict while maintaining appropriate levels of cognitive distinctiveness among diverse stakeholders. Thus, we provide a framework for identifying and leveraging rGaps through managed conflict so that communication between those with different perspectives builds rather than burns bridges.",Correlated interfacial water transport and proton conductivity in perfluorosulfonic acid membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988207,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Water must be effectively transported and is also essential for maximizing proton conductivity within fuel-cell proton-exchange membranes (PEMs).

Moreover, the diffusivity of interfacial water was consistently larger than that of bulk-like water. These measurements of microscopic transport were combined with through-plane proton conductivity measurements to reveal the correlation between interfacial water transport and proton conductivity. Our results demonstrate the importance of maximizing the diffusivity and fractional contribution of interfacial water to maximize the proton conductivity in PFSA PEMs.",Functional characterization of 3D protein structures informed by human genetic diversity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988206,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Sequence variation data of the human proteome can be used to analyze 3D protein structures to derive functional insights.

Dynamic control of p53 degradation and DNA binding in response to stress signals are critical for tumor suppression. The p53 N terminus (NT) contains two transactivation domains (TAD1 and TAD2), a proline-rich region (PRR), and multiple phosphorylation sites. Previous work revealed the p53 NT reduced DNA binding in vitro. Here, we show that TAD2 and the PRR inhibit DNA binding by directly interacting with the sequence-specific DNA binding domain (DBD). NMR spectroscopy revealed that TAD2 and the PRR interact with the DBD at or near the DNA binding surface, possibly acting as a nucleic acid mimetic to competitively block DNA binding. In vitro and in vivo DNA binding analyses showed that the NT reduced p53 DNA binding affinity but improved the ability of p53 to distinguish between specific and nonspecific sequences. MDMX inhibits p53 binding to specific target promoters but stimulates binding to nonspecific chromatin sites. The results suggest that the p53 NT regulates the affinity and specificity of DNA binding by the DBD. The p53 NT-interacting proteins and posttranslational modifications may regulate DNA binding, partly by modulating the NT-DBD interaction.",Unified energetics analysis unravels SpCas9 cleavage activity for optimal gRNA design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988204,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"While CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful tool in genome engineering, the on-target activity and off-target effects of the system widely vary because of the differences in guide RNA (gRNA) sequences and genomic environments. Traditional approaches rely on separate models and parameters to treat on- and off-target cleavage activities. Here, we demonstrate that a free-energy scheme dominates the Cas9 editing efficacy and delineate a method that simultaneously considers on-target activities and off-target effects. While data-driven machine-learning approaches learn rules to model particular datasets, they may not be as transferrable to new systems or capable of producing new mechanistic insights as principled physical approaches. By integrating the energetics of R-loop formation under Cas9 binding, the effect of the protospacer adjacent motif sequence, and the folding stability of the whole single guide RNA, we devised a unified, physical model that can apply to any cleavage-activity dataset. This unified framework improves predictions for both on-target activities and off-target efficiencies of spCas9 and may be readily transferred to other systems with different guide RNAs or Cas9 ortholog proteins.",How a well-adapting immune system remembers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988203,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"An adaptive agent predicting the future state of an environment must weigh trust in new observations against prior experiences. In this light, we propose a view of the adaptive immune system as a dynamic Bayesian machinery that updates its memory repertoire by balancing evidence from new pathogen encounters against past experience of infection to predict and prepare for future threats. This framework links the observed initial rapid increase of the memory pool early in life followed by a midlife plateau to the ease of learning salient features of sparse environments. We also derive a modulated memory pool update rule in agreement with current vaccine-response experiments. Our results suggest that pathogenic environments are sparse and that memory repertoires significantly decrease infection costs, even with moderate sampling.

Here, we report that our epitaxial [Formula: see text] thin films grown by solid-state epitaxy exhibit a spontaneous Hall effect that persists up to 50 K without having spontaneous magnetization within our experimental accuracy. This indicates that the system breaks the time reversal symmetry at a temperature scale that is too high for the magnetism to be due to Pr 4f moments and must be related to magnetic order of the iridium 5d electrons. Moreover, our analysis finds that the chiral anomaly induces the negative contribution to the magnetoresistance only when a magnetic field and the electric current are parallel to each other. Our results indicate that the strained part of the thin film forms a magnetic Weyl semimetal state."

Unlike the local equilibrium growth condition, the interplay becomes blurred under local nonequilibrium, which raises many questions about the nature of diverse crystal growth and morphological transitions. Here, we systematically control the growth condition from local equilibrium to local nonequilibrium by using an advanced dynamic diamond anvil cell (dDAC) and generate anomalously fast growth of ice VI phase with a morphological transition from three- to two-dimension (3D to 2D), which is called a shock crystal growth. Unlike expected, the shock growth occurs from the edges of 3D crystal along the (112) crystal plane rather than its corners, which implies that the fast compression yields effectively large overpressure at the crystal-liquid interface, manifesting the local nonequilibrium condition. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation reproduces the faster growth of the (112) plane than other planes upon applying large overpressure. Moreover, the MD study reveals that the 2D shock crystal growth originates from the similarity of the interface structure between water and the (112) crystal plane under the large overpressure.

Today, we understand that GB migration occurs through the motion of disconnections in the GB plane (line defects with both step and dislocation character). We present evidence from molecular dynamics grain growth simulations and idealized microstructures that demonstrates that TJ motion and GB migration are coupled through disconnection dynamics. Based on these results, we develop a theory of coupled GB/TJ migration and use it to develop a physically based, disconnection mechanism-specific continuum model of microstructure evolution. The continuum approach provides a means of reducing the complexity of the discrete disconnection picture to extract the features of disconnection dynamics that are important for microstructure evolution. We implement this model in a numerical, continuum simulation and demonstrate that it is capable of reproducing the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results.",Comparing signals of natural selection between three Indigenous North American populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988184,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"While many studies have highlighted human adaptations to diverse environments worldwide, genomic studies of natural selection in Indigenous populations in the Americas have been absent from this literature until very recently. Since humans first entered the Americas some 20,000 years ago, they have settled in many new environments across the continent. This diversity of environments has placed variable selective pressures on the populations living in each region, but the effects of these pressures have not been extensively studied to date. To help fill this gap, we collected genome-wide data from three Indigenous North American populations from different geographic regions of the continent (Alaska, southeastern United States, and central Mexico). We identified signals of natural selection in each population and compared signals across populations to explore the differences in selective pressures among the three regions sampled. We find evidence of adaptation to cold and high-latitude environments in Alaska, while in the southeastern United States and central Mexico, pathogenic environments seem to have created important selective pressures.

We link census data from 29 countries across the global tropics to high-resolution gridded climate data to understand how climatic conditions experienced in utero and during early childhood affect educational attainment at ages 12 to 16. We show that exposure to higher-than-average temperatures during the prenatal and early-life period is associated with fewer years of schooling in Southeast Asia. In this region, a child who experiences temperatures 2 SDs above average is predicted to attain 1.5 fewer years of schooling than one who experiences average temperatures. In addition, early-life rainfall is positively correlated with attainment in West and Central Africa as well as Southeast Asia, and negatively correlated with attainment in Central America and the Caribbean. While we expected that children from the most educated households would be buffered from these effects, we discover that they tend to experience the greatest educational penalties when exposed to hotter early-life conditions and, in some regions, to drier conditions. For example, among the most educated households in West and Central Africa, predicted schooling is 1.8 years lower for children who experience early-life rainfall 2 SDs below average versus 2 SDs above average, while the difference is just 0.8 years for children from the least educated households. These results suggest that development and educational gains in the tropics could be undermined by climate change, even for better-off households.",K isotopes as a tracer for continental weathering and geological K cycling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988182,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"The causal effects among uplift, climate, and continental weathering cannot be fully addressed using presently available geochemical proxies. However, stable potassium (K) isotopes can potentially overcome the limitations of existing isotopic proxies. Here we report on a systematic investigation of K isotopes in dissolved load and sediments from major rivers and their tributaries in China, which have drainage basins with varied climate, lithology, and topography. Our results show that during silicate weathering, heavy K isotopes are preferentially partitioned into aqueous solutions. Moreover, δ41K values of riverine dissolved load vary remarkably and correlate negatively with the chemical weathering intensity of the drainage basin. This correlation allows an estimate of the average K isotope composition of global riverine runoff (δ41K = -0.22‰), as well as modeling of the global K cycle based on mass balance calculations. Modeling incorporating K isotope mass balance better constrains estimated K fluxes for modern global K cycling, and the results show that the δ41K value of seawater is sensitive to continental weathering intensity changes. Thus, it is possible to use the δ41K record of paleo-seawater to infer continental weathering intensity through Earth's history.",Megalithic tombs in western and northern Neolithic Europe were linked to a kindred society.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988179,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"Paleogenomic and archaeological studies show that Neolithic lifeways spread from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9000 BCE, reaching northwestern Europe by 4000 BCE. Starting around 4500 BCE, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments, particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic façade. While it has been suggested that the emergence of megaliths was associated with the territories of farming communities, the origin and social structure of the groups that erected them has remained largely unknown. We generated genome sequence data from human remains, corresponding to 24 individuals from five megalithic burial sites, encompassing the widespread tradition of megalithic construction in northern and western Europe, and analyzed our results in relation to the existing European paleogenomic data. The various individuals buried in megaliths show genetic affinities with local farming groups within their different chronological contexts. Individuals buried in megaliths display (past) admixture with local hunter-gatherers, similar to that seen in other Neolithic individuals in Europe. In relation to the tomb populations, we find significantly more males than females buried in the megaliths of the British Isles. The genetic data show close kin relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths, and for the Irish megaliths, we found a kin relation between individuals buried in different megaliths. We also see paternal continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome haplotypes reoccurring. These observations suggest that the investigated funerary monuments were associated with patrilineal kindred groups. Our genomic investigation provides insight into the people associated with this long-standing megalith funerary tradition, including their social dynamics.",Exaggeration and cooption of innate immunity for social defense.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988178,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Social insects often exhibit striking altruistic behaviors, of which the most spectacular ones may be self-destructive defensive behaviors called autothysis, ""self-explosion,"" or ""suicidal bombing."" In the social aphid Nipponaphis monzeni, when enemies damage their plant-made nest called the gall, soldier nymphs erupt to discharge a large amount of body fluid, mix the secretion with their legs, and skillfully plaster it over the plant injury. Dozens of soldiers come out, erupt, mix, and plaster, and the gall breach is promptly sealed with the coagulated body fluid. What molecular and cellular mechanisms underlie the self-sacrificing nest repair with body fluid for the insect society? Here we demonstrate that the body cavity of soldier nymphs is full of highly differentiated large hemocytes that contain huge amounts of lipid droplets and phenoloxidase (PO), whereas their hemolymph accumulates huge amounts of tyrosine and a unique repeat-containing protein (RCP). Upon breakage of the gall, soldiers gather around the breach and massively discharge the body fluid. The large hemocytes rupture and release lipid droplets, which promptly form a lipidic clot, and, concurrently, activated PO converts tyrosine to reactive quinones, which cross-link RCP and other macromolecules to physically reinforce the clot to seal the gall breach. Here, soldiers' humoral and cellular immune mechanisms for wound sealing are extremely up-regulated and utilized for colony defense, which provides a striking case of direct evolutionary connection between individual immunity and social immunity and highlights the importance of exaggeration and cooption of preexisting traits to create evolutionary novelties.",Severe haze in northern China: A synergy of anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988177,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Regional severe haze represents an enormous environmental problem in China, influencing air quality, human health, ecosystem, weather, and climate. These extremes are characterized by exceedingly high concentrations of fine particulate matter (smaller than 2.5 µm, or PM2.5) and occur with extensive temporal (on a daily, weekly, to monthly timescale) and spatial (over a million square kilometers) coverage. Although significant advances have been made in field measurements, model simulations, and laboratory experiments for fine PM over recent years, the causes for severe haze formation have not yet to be systematically/comprehensively evaluated. This review provides a synthetic synopsis of recent advances in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of severe haze formation in northern China, focusing on emission sources, chemical formation and transformation, and meteorological and climatic conditions. In particular, we highlight the synergetic effects from the interactions between anthropogenic emissions and atmospheric processes. Current challenges and future research directions to improve the understanding of severe haze pollution as well as plausible regulatory implications on a scientific basis are also discussed.",Exploratory trial of a biepitopic CAR T-targeting B cell maturation antigen in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988175,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"Relapsed and refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) patients have very poor prognosis. Chimeric antigen receptor modified T (CAR T) cells is an emerging approach in treating hematopoietic malignancies. Here we conducted the clinical trial of a biepitope-targeting CAR T against B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) (LCAR-B38M) in 17 R/R MM cases. CAR T cells were i.v. infused after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Two delivery methods, three infusions versus one infusion of the total CAR T dose, were tested in, respectively, 8 and 9 cases. No response differences were noted among the two delivery subgroups. Together, after CAR T cell infusion, 10 cases experienced a mild cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 6 had severe but manageable CRS, and 1 died of a very severe toxic reaction. The abundance of BCMA and cytogenetic marker del(17p) and the elevation of IL-6 were the key indicators for severe CRS. Among 17 cases, the overall response rate was 88.2%, with 13 achieving stringent complete response (sCR) and 2 reaching very good partial response (VGPR), while 1 was a nonresponder. With a median follow-up of 417 days, 8 patients remained in sCR or VGPR, whereas 6 relapsed after sCR and 1 had progressive disease (PD) after VGPR. CAR T cells were high in most cases with stable response but low in 6 out of 7 relapse/PD cases. Notably, positive anti-CAR antibody constituted a high-risk factor for relapse/PD, and patients who received prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had more durable response. Thus, biepitopic CAR T against BCMA represents a promising therapy for R/R MM, while most adverse effects are clinically manageable.",Gatekeeping hormone replacement therapy for transgender patients is dehumanising.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988174,Journal of medical ethics,2019 04 16,"Although informed consent models for prescribing hormone replacement therapy are becoming increasingly prevalent, many physicians continue to require an assessment and referral letter from a mental health professional prior to prescription. Drawing on personal and communal experience, the author argues that assessment and referral requirements are dehumanising and unethical, foregrounding the ways in which these requirements evidence a mistrust of trans people, suppress the diversity of their experiences and sustain an unjustified double standard in contrast to other forms of clinical care. Physicians should abandon this unethical requirement in favour of an informed consent approach to transgender care."

Enforced expression of GFI1B in K562 erythroleukemia cells favors erythroid over megakaryocytic differentiation, providing a platform to define molecular determinants of binary fate decisions triggered by GFI1B. We deployed proteome-wide proximity labeling to identify factors whose inclusion in GFI1B complexes depends upon GFI1B's obligate effector, lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). We show that GFI1B preferentially recruits core and putative elements of the BRAF-histone deacetylase (HDAC) (BHC) chromatin-remodeling complex (LSD1, RCOR1, HMG20A, HMG20B, HDAC1, HDAC2, PHF21A, GSE1, ZMYM2, and ZNF217) in an LSD1-dependent manner to control acquisition of erythroid traits by K562 cells. Among these elements, depletion of both HMG20A and HMG20B or of GSE1 blocks GFI1B-mediated erythroid differentiation, phenocopying impaired differentiation brought on by LSD1 depletion or disruption of GFI1B-LSD1 binding. These findings demonstrate the central role of the GFI1B-LSD1 interaction as a determinant of BHC complex recruitment to enable cell fate decisions driven by GFI1B.",CKS1 Germ Line Exclusion Is Essential for the Transition from Meiosis to Early Embryonic Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988159,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 06 14,"Cell division cycle (Cdc) kinase subunit (CKS) proteins bind cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and play important roles in cell division control and development, though their precise molecular functions are not fully understood. Mammals express two closely related paralogs called CKS1 and CKS2, but only CKS2 is expressed in the germ line, indicating that it is solely responsible for regulating CDK functions in meiosis. Using cks2-/- knockout mice, we show that CKS2 is a crucial regulator of maturation-promoting factor (MPF; CDK1-cyclin A/B) activity in meiosis. cks2-/- oocytes display reduced and delayed MPF activity during meiotic progression, leading to defects in germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activation, and meiotic spindle assembly. cks2-/- germ cells express significantly reduced levels of the MPF components CDK1 and cyclins A1/B1. Additionally, injection of MPF plus CKS2, but not MPF alone, restored normal GVBD in cks2-/- oocytes, demonstrating that GVBD is driven by a CKS2-dependent function of MPF. Moreover, we generated cks2cks1/cks1 knock-in mice and found that CKS1 can compensate for CKS2 in meiosis in vivo, but homozygous embryos arrested development at the 2- to 5-cell stage. Collectively, our results show that CKS2 is a crucial regulator of MPF functions in meiosis and that its paralog, CKS1, must be excluded from the germ line for proper embryonic development.",Unexpected Role of Matrix Gla Protein in Osteoclasts: Inhibiting Osteoclast Differentiation and Bone Resorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988158,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 06 16,"Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is an extracellular protein responsible for inhibiting mineralization. MGP inhibits osteoblast mineralization and bone formation by regulating the deposition of bone matrix. However, Mgp-/- mice display an osteopenic phenotype. To explain this contradiction, we investigated the role of MGP in osteoclastogenesis, the other side of bone remodeling. We found that MGP expression is markedly increased by osteoclastic commitment. Osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption are accelerated by MGP depletion while suppressed by MGP overexpression. The in vivo results confirmed its inhibitory role in osteoclastogenesis by the administration of Cre-dependent FLEX-On recombinant MGP-AAV to LysM Cre mice. Furthermore, we found that the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), are under the control of MGP. MGP loss results in elevation of intracellular Ca2+ flux. Vitronectin-induced activation of Src/Rac1 is magnified in the absence of MGP but reduced when MGP is overexpressed. Inhibition of Src activation or NFATc1 nuclear import rescues the increased osteoclastogenesis induced by MGP deficiency. These observations (i) establish, for the first time to our knowledge, that MGP plays an essential role in osteoclast differentiation and function, (ii) enrich the current knowledge of MGP function, and (iii) indicate the potential of MGP as a therapeutic target for low-bone-mass disorders.",Uncoupling the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype from Cell Cycle Exit via Interleukin-1 Inactivation Unveils Its Protumorigenic Role.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988157,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 06 16,"Cellular senescence has emerged as a potent tumor suppressor mechanism in numerous human neoplasias. Senescent cells secrete a distinct set of factors, collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which has been postulated to carry both pro- and antitumorigenic properties depending on tissue context. However, the in vivo effect of the SASP is poorly understood due to the difficulty of studying the SASP independently of other senescence-associated phenotypes. Here, we report that disruption of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway completely uncouples the SASP from other senescence-associated phenotypes such as cell cycle exit. Transcriptome profiling of IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)-depleted senescent cells indicates that IL-1 controls the late arm of the senescence secretome, which consists of proinflammatory cytokines induced by NF-κB. Our data suggest that both IL-1α and IL-1β signal through IL-1R to upregulate the SASP in a cooperative manner. Finally, we show that IL-1α inactivation impairs tumor progression and immune cell infiltration without affecting cell cycle arrest in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, highlighting the protumorigenic property of the IL-1-dependent SASP in this context. These findings provide novel insight into the therapeutic potential of targeting the IL-1 pathway in inflammatory cancers.",Knockdown of Long Noncoding RNA H19 Represses the Progress of Pulmonary Fibrosis through the Transforming Growth Factor β/Smad3 Pathway by Regulating MicroRNA 140.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988156,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 06 16,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in various human diseases. Recently, H19 was reported to be upregulated in fibrotic rat lung and play a stimulative role in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. However, its expression in human fibrotic lung tissues and mechanism of action remain unclear. Here, our observations showed that H19 expression was significantly upregulated and that of microRNA 140 (miR-140) was markedly reduced in pulmonary fibrotic tissues from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-induced HBE and A549 cells. Moreover, the expression of H19 was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-140 in IPF tissues. H19 knockdown attenuated TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vitro Furthermore, animal experiments showed that H19 knockdown attenuated BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. The study of molecular mechanisms showed that H19 functioned via reduction of miR-140 expression by binding to miR-140. The increase of miR-140 inhibited TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and H19 upregulation diminished the inhibitory effects of miR-140 on TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis, which was involved in the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway. Taken together, our findings showed that H19 knockdown attenuated pulmonary fibrosis via the regulatory network of lncRNA H19-miR-140-TGF-β/Smad3 signaling, and H19 and miR-140 might represent therapeutic targets and early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for patients with pulmonary fibrosis.",NOL12 Repression Induces Nucleolar Stress-Driven Cellular Senescence and Is Associated with Normative Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988155,Molecular and cellular biology,2019 06 16,"The nucleolus is a subnuclear compartment with key roles in rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis, complex processes that require hundreds of proteins and factors. Alterations in nucleolar morphology and protein content have been linked to the control of cell proliferation and stress responses and, recently, further implicated in cell senescence and ageing. In this study, we report the functional role of NOL12 in the nucleolar homeostasis of human primary fibroblasts. NOL12 repression induces specific changes in nucleolar morphology, with increased nucleolar area but reduced nucleolar number, along with nucleolar accumulation and increased levels of fibrillarin and nucleolin. Moreover, NOL12 repression leads to stabilization and activation of p53 in an RPL11-dependent manner, which arrests cells at G2 phase and ultimately leads to senescence. Importantly, we found NOL12 repression in association with nucleolar stress-like responses in human fibroblasts from elderly donors, disclosing it as a biomarker in human chronological aging.",Comparative performance of urinary biomarkers for vancomycin induced kidney injury according to timeline of injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988153,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2019 05 08,"Introduction: Urinary biomarkers are superior to serum creatinine for defining onset and extent of kidney injury. This study classifies the temporal predictive ability of biomarkers for vancomycin-induced kidney injury (VIKI) as defined by histopathologic damage.Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=125) were randomized to receive 150 to 400 mg/kg/day vancomycin via once or twice daily intraperitoneal injection over 1, 3, or 6 days. Urine was collected once during the 24 hours prior to euthanasia or twice for rats treated for 6 days. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were employed to assess urinary biomarker performance of kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), clusterin, osteopontin (OPN), cystatin C, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) to predict histopathologic defined VIKI (using a national standard pathologic assessment scheme from hematoxylin and eosin stained kidneys).Results: Urinary KIM-1, clusterin, and OPN outperformed cystatin C and NGAL according to sensitivity and specificity. For the earliest injury, urinary KIM-1 (AUC 0.662, p<0.001) and clusterin (AUC 0.706, p<0.001) were most sensitive to predicting even low-level histopathologic damage at 24 h when compared to NGAL.Conclusions: KIM-1 and clusterin are earliest and most sensitive predictors of VIKI.

Here, the in vitro activity of cefepime-enmetazobactam was determined for 1,993 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in the US and Europe during 2014 and 2015. Enmetazobactam at a fixed concentration of 8 μg/ml lowered the cefepime MIC90 from 16 to 0.12 μg/ml for Escherichia coli, >64 to 0.5 μg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 16 to 1 μg/ml for Enterobacter cloacae, and 0.5 to 0.25 μg/ml for Enterobacter aerogenes Enmetazobactam did not enhance the potency of cefepime against P. aeruginosa Applying the CLSI 'susceptible-dose dependent' (SDD) breakpoint of 8 μg/ml to cefepime-enmetazobactam for comparative purposes resulted in cumulative inhibitions of 99.9% for E. coli, 96.4% for K. pneumoniae, 97.0% for E. cloacae, 100% for E. aerogenes, 98.1% for all Enterobacteriaceae surveilled, and 82.8% for P. aeruginosa Comparator susceptibilities for all Enterobacteriaceae were 99.7% for ceftazidime-avibactam, 96.2% for meropenem, 90.7% for ceftolozane-tazobactam, 87% for cefepime (SDD breakpoint), 85.7% for piperacillin-tazobactam, and 81.2% for ceftazidime. For the subset of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, addition of 8 μg/ml enmetazobactam to cefepime lowered the MIC90 from >64 to 1 μg/ml, whereas the shift for 8 μg/ml tazobactam was from >64 to 8 μg/ml.

Herein, we report that the antitumor drug PFK-158 and its analogs PFK-015 and 3PO can exert synergistic effects with colistin against colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including mcr-1 positive or high-level colistin resistant (HLCR) isolates, as shown by a checkerboard assay. The results of a time-killing assay revealed that colistin combined with PFK-158 continuously eliminated colistin-resistant Escherichia coli 13-43, Klebsiella pneumoniae H04 and Enterobacter cloacae D01 in 24 h. Images from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 5 h post-inoculation confirmed the killing effect of the combination. Finally, the in vivo treatment showed that PFK-158 had a better synergistic effect than its analogs. Compared to the corresponding rates after colistin monotherapy, the survival rates of systemically infected mice were significantly increased 30% or 60% when the mice received an intravenous injection of colistin in combination with 15 mg/kg PFK-158. These results have important implications for repurposing PFK-158 to combat colistin resistance."

The main goal of the regulation is to keep the basic photosynthetic reactions, i.e. capturing light energy, conversion into chemical energy and production of carbohydrates, in balance. The rationale behind the evolution of strong regulation mechanisms is to keep photosynthesis functional under all conditions encountered by sessile plants during their lifetimes. The regulatory mechanisms may, however, also impair photosynthetic efficiency by overriding the photosynthetic reactions in controlled environments like crop fields or bioreactors, where light energy could be used for production of sugars instead of dissipation as heat and down-regulation of carbon fixation. The plant chloroplast has a high number of regulatory proteins called thioredoxins (TRX), which control the function of chloroplasts from biogenesis and assembly of chloroplast machinery to light and carbon fixation reactions as well as photoprotective mechanisms.

They are categorised as either predictable or unpredictable drug-induced injury and may be exhibited after a single or prolonged exposure to one or multiple compounds. Historically, toxicology studies rely heavily on animal models to understand and characterise the toxicity of novel compounds. However, animal models are imperfect proxies for human toxicity and there have been several high-profile cases of failure of animal models to predict human toxicity e.g. fialuridine, TGN1412 which highlight the need for improved predictive models of human toxicity. As a result, stem cell-derived models are under investigation as potential models for toxicity during early stages of drug development. Stem cells retain the genotype of the individual from which they were derived, offering the opportunity to model the reproducibility of rare phenotypes in vitro Differentiated 2D stem cell cultures have been investigated as models of hepato- and cardiotoxicity. However, insufficient maturity, particularly in the case of hepatocyte-like cells, means that their widespread use is not currently a feasible method to tackle the complex issues of off-target and often unpredictable toxicity of novel compounds. This review discusses the current state of the art for modelling clinically relevant toxicities, e.g. cardio- and hepatotoxicity, alongside the emerging need for modelling gastrointestinal toxicity and seeks to address whether stem cell technologies are a potential solution to increase the accuracy of ADR predictivity in humans.",Membrane lipids and their degradation compounds control GM2 catabolism at intralysosomal luminal vesicles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988135,Journal of lipid research,2019 06 02,"The catabolism of ganglioside GM2 is dependent on three gene products. Mutations in any of these genes result in a different type of GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and the B1 and AB variants of GM2 gangliosidosis), with GM2 as the major lysosomal storage compound. GM2 is also a secondary storage compound in lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann-Pick disease types A-C, with primary storage of SM in type A and cholesterol in types B and C, respectively. The reconstitution of GM2 catabolism at liposomal surfaces carrying GM2 revealed that incorporating lipids into the GM2-carrying membrane such as cholesterol, SM, sphingosine, and sphinganine inhibits GM2 hydrolysis by β-hexosaminidase A assisted by GM2 activator protein, while anionic lipids, ceramide, fatty acids, lysophosphatidylcholine, and diacylglycerol stimulate GM2 catabolism. In contrast, the hydrolysis of the synthetic, water-soluble substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside was neither significantly affected by membrane lipids such as ceramide or SM nor stimulated by anionic lipids such as bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate added as liposomes, detergent micelles, or lipid aggregates.

Escape from initial courses of treatment can involve re-activation of embryonic developmental stages, with the formation of polynuclear giant cancer cells (PGCC). This strategy of de-differentiation can insulate cancer cells from a variety of treatments and allows a residual subpopulation to re-establish tumors after treatment. Here we show that expression of acid ceramidase (ASAH1), an enzyme in the sphingolipid pathway linked to therapy resistance and poor outcomes, is elevated in PGCC. Targeting ASAH1 with shRNA or treatment with the ASAH1 inhibitor LCL-521 did not impair the formation of PGCC but prevented the formation of PGCC progeny that arise through an asymmetric cell division called neosis. Our results suggest that PGCC, which are known to have undergone de-differentiation, re-activate the same dependence of ASAH1 expression as observed during embryonic development. Since ASAH1 knock out is embryonic lethal but not deleterious to adult animals, targeting this enzyme has the potential to be highly specific to cells undergoing the de-differentiation process to escape cancer treatments. Pharmacological inhibition of ASAH1 is a potentially powerful strategy to eliminate cells that could otherwise serve as seed populations for recurrence.",The human duodenal mucosa harbors all components for a local renin angiotensin system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988133,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2019 04 30,"The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract but remains to be fully characterized, particularly in man. The duodenum plays a role in both the upper and lower GI regulation, as well as in distant organs. The present study investigates the presence and functional potential of RAS in the human duodenal mucosa of healthy individuals. Endoscopically acquired mucosal biopsies from healthy volunteers were examined using western blot, immunohistochemistry, and ELISA. Functionality was examined by using Ussing chambers and recording duodenal transmucosal potential difference (PD) and motility in vivo Angiotensinogen, Angiotensin II (AngII) and its receptors (AT1R, AT2R) as well as to the RAS associated enzymes renin, ACE, and neprylisin were detected in all samples of duodenal mucosa. Migrating motility complex induced elevations of transmucosal PD were significantly larger after per-oral administration of the AT1R receptor antagonist candesartan. Fasting duodenal motility per se was not influenced by candesartan. The epithelial current produced by duodenal mucosae mounted in Ussing chambers increased significantly after addition of AngII to specimens where the AT1R was blocked using losartan. The epithelial current also increased after addition of the AT2R-selective agonist C21. Immunostaining and pharmacological data demonstrate the presence of a local RAS in the human duodenal mucosa with capacity to influence epithelial ion transport by way of particulary the AT2R.",Endothelial cell-derived small extracellular vesicles suppress cutaneous wound healing through regulating fibroblasts autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988132,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2019 05 03,"Diabetic foot ulcer is a life-threatening clinical problem in diabetic patients. Endothelial cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are important mediators of intercellular communication in the pathogenesis of several diseases. However, the exact mechanisms of wound healing mediated by endothelial cell-derived sEVs remain unclear. sEVs were isolated from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) pretreated with or without advanced glycation end products (AGEs). The roles of HUVEC-derived sEVs on the biological characteristics of skin fibroblasts were investigated both in vitro and in vivo We demonstrate that sEVs derived from AGEs-pretreated HUVECs (AGEs-sEVs) could inhibit collagen synthesis by activating autophagy of human skin fibroblasts. Additionally, treatment with AGEs-sEVs could delay the wound healing process in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Further analysis indicated that miR-106b-5p was up-regulated in AGEs-sEVs and importantly, in exudate-derived sEVs from patients with diabetic foot ulcer. Consequently, sEV-mediated uptake of miR-106b-5p in recipient fibroblasts reduces expression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), resulting in fibroblasts autophagy activation and subsequent collagen degradation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that miR-106b-5p could be enriched in AGEs-sEVs, then decreases collagen synthesis and delays cutaneous wound healing by triggering fibroblasts autophagy through reducing ERK1/2 expression.",Pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 channels protects against ischemia-reperfusion-induced renal insufficiency in neonatal pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988131,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2019 05 03,"Renal vasoconstriction, an early manifestation of ischemic acute kidney injury (AKI), results in renal hypoperfusion and a rapid decline in kidney function. The pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced renal insufficiency are poorly understood, but possibilities include alterations in ion channel-dependent renal vasoregulation. In the present study, we show that pharmacological activation of TRPV4 channels constricted preglomerular microvessels and elicited renal hypoperfusion in neonatal pigs. Bilateral renal ischemia followed by short-term reperfusion increased TRPV4 protein expression in resistance size renal vessels and TRPV4-dependent cation currents in renal vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Selective TRPV4 channel blockers attenuated IR-induced reduction in total renal blood flow (RBF), cortical perfusion, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). TRPV4 inhibition also diminished renal IR-induced increase in AKI biomarkers. Furthermore, the level of angiotensin II (Ang II) was higher in the urine of IR- compared with sham-operated neonatal pigs. IR did not alter renal vascular expression of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors. However, losartan, a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, ameliorated IR-induced renal insufficiency in the pigs. Blockade of TRPV4 channels attenuated Ang II-evoked receptor-operated Ca2+ entry and constriction in preglomerular microvessels. TRPV4 inhibition also blunted Ang II-induced increase in renal vascular resistance (RVR) and hypoperfusion in the pigs. Together, our data suggest that SMC TRPV4-mediated renal vasoconstriction and the ensuing increase in RVR contribute to early hypoperfusion and renal insufficiency elicited by renal IR in neonatal pigs. We propose that multimodal signaling by renal vascular SMC TRPV4 channels controls neonatal renal microcirculation in health and disease.",Construction of a frailty index as a novel health measure in systemic lupus erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988130,The Journal of rheumatology,2019 06 10,"To construct a frailty index (FI) as a measure of vulnerability to adverse outcomes among patients with SLE, using data from the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) inception cohort.",Response to Early-onset Pamidronate Treatment in Chronic Non-Bacterial Osteomyelitis: A Retrospective Single Center Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988129,The Journal of rheumatology,2019 04 16,Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a sterile inflammatory bone disorder with an unpredictable course of disease.

Evobrutinib is a novel, highly selective, irreversible BTK inhibitor that potently inhibits BCR- and Fc receptor-mediated signaling and, thus, subsequent activation and function of human B cells and innate immune cells such as monocytes and basophils. We evaluated evobrutinib in preclinical models of RA and SLE and characterized the relationship between BTK occupancy and inhibition of disease activity. In mouse models of RA and SLE, orally administered evobrutinib displayed robust efficacy, as demonstrated by reduction of disease severity and histological damage. In the SLE model, evobrutinib inhibited B cell activation, reduced autoantibody production and plasma cell numbers, and normalized B and T cell subsets. In the RA model, efficacy was achieved despite failure to reduce autoantibodies. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling showed that mean BTK occupancy in blood cells of 80% was linked to near-complete disease inhibition in both RA and SLE mouse models. In addition, evobrutinib inhibited mast cell activation in a passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. Thus, evobrutinib achieves efficacy by acting both on B cells and innate immune cells. Taken together, our data show that evobrutinib is a promising molecule for the chronic treatment of B cell-driven autoimmune disorders.",Immune Pharmacodynamic Responses of the Novel Cancer Immunotherapeutic Imprime PGG in Healthy Volunteers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988115,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 05 07,"Imprime PGG (Imprime) is an i.v. administered, yeast β-1,3/1,6 glucan in clinical development with checkpoint inhibitors. Imprime-mediated innate immune activation requires immune complex formation with naturally occurring IgG anti-β glucan Abs (ABA). We administered Imprime to healthy human volunteers to assess the necessity of ABA for Imprime-mediated immunopharmacodynamic (IPD) changes. Imprime (4 mg/kg) was administered i.v. in single and multiple infusions. Subsets of subjects were premedicated with antihistamine and corticosteroid. Peripheral blood was measured before, during and after Imprime administration for IPD changes (e.g., ABA, circulating immune complexes, complement activation, complete blood counts, cytokine/chemokine, and gene expression changes). IPD changes were analyzed based on pretreatment serum ABA levels: low-ABA (<20 μg/ml), mid-ABA (≥20-50 μg/ml), and high-ABA (≥50 μg/ml). At the end of infusion, free serum ABA levels decreased, circulating immune complex levels increased, and complement activation was observed. At ∼1-4 h after end of infusion, increased expression of cytokines/chemokines, a 1.5-4-fold increase in neutrophil and monocyte counts and a broad activation of innate immune genes were observed. Low-ABA subjects typically showed minimal IPD changes except when ABA levels rose above 20 μg/ml after repeated Imprime dosing. Mild-to-moderate infusion-related reactions occurred in subjects with ABA ≥20 μg/ml. Premedications alleviated some of the infusion-related reactions, but also inhibited cytokine responses. In conclusion, ABA levels, being critical for Imprime-mediated immune activation may provide a plausible, mechanism-based biomarker to identify patients most likely to respond to Imprime-based anticancer immunotherapy.",GM-CSF- and IRF4-Dependent Signaling Can Regulate Myeloid Cell Numbers and the Macrophage Phenotype during Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988114,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 05 07,"Studies have demonstrated the importance of a GM-CSF→IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)→CCL17 pathway, first identified in monocytes/macrophages, for arthritic pain and disease development. In this study, we further investigated the involvement of this new pathway in shaping the inflammatory response using the zymosan-induced peritonitis (ZIP) model. ZIP (8 mg of zymosan, i.p., day 0) was induced in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), GM-CSF-/- , Irf4-/- , and Ccl17E/E mice. In comparison with WT mice, GM-CSF-/- and Irf4-/- mice had a reduced ZIP response, as judged by a reduced number of neutrophils and macrophages in the peritoneal cavity. Moreover, the phenotype of the ZIP macrophages was altered by a lack of GM-CSF or IRF4 (increased IL-10 secretion and Arg1 mRNA expression), with IRF4 levels being lower in GM-CSF-/- ZIP macrophages than in the WT cells. In addition, GM-CSF ̶IRF4 signaling upregulated MHC class II expression in ZIP macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Although Ccl17 mRNA expression was reduced in ZIP macrophages in the absence of either GM-CSF or IRF4, thus supporting the presence of the new pathway in inflammatory macrophages, CCL17 did not modulate the inflammatory response, both in terms of number of myeloid cells or the macrophage phenotype. Thus, during an inflammatory response, both macrophage numbers and their phenotype can depend on GM-CSF- and IRF4-dependent signaling independently of CCL17.",Knee sliced open by skate blade: complete patellar tendon rupture in an elite long track speed skater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988109,BMJ case reports,2019 04 16,"A long track speed skater sustained a deep horizontal cut to the right knee just distally to the patella, after he got hit by the skate blade of the pair mate.

TNBC is highly aggressive and associated with poor prognosis. The present study aimed to compare gene expression between TNBC patients with pathological complete response (pCR) and those with not complete response (nCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Microarray data of 16 TNBC patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were identified from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and 10 patients of them had pCR. We found that 250 coding genes and 155 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were statistically differentially expressed between patients with pCR and nCR. Receiver operator characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess predictive value of differentially expressed genes.

Neovascularization has been identified as an important clinical property in DR, however, the exact mechanisms in DR neovascularization are still unclear and need further elucidation.Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to detect the expression level of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), miR-125b and vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) in human retina microvascular endothelial cells (hRMECs) treated with high glucose (HG). Luciferase assay was used to detect interaction of MALAT1 with miR-125b and miR-125b with VE-cadherin. MTT assay, transwell assay, tube formation assay and vascular permeability assay were conducted to detect the cell viability, migration tube formation ability and permeability of hRMECs, respectively. ELISA was used to examine the release of VE-cadherin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Western blotting was used to access the protein expression of VE-cadherin, VEGF, β-catenin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 (MMP2) and MMP9.Results: MALAT1 and VE-cadherin were up-regulated while miR-125b was down-regulated in hRMECs treated with HG. MALAT1 could competitively bind to miR-125b against VE-cadherin at the site of 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), leading to the up-regulation of VE-cadherin. Knockdown of MALAT1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, tube formation and vascular permeability of hRMECs induced by HG through up-regulating miR-125b. Furthermore, we found the deletion of MALAT1 suppressed the VE-cadherin/β-catenin complex and neovascularization related proteins expression, which was up-regulated by HG.Conclusion: Knockdown of MALAT1 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of hRMECs via suppressing the VE-cadherin/β-catenin complex through targeting miR-125b.

Osteosarcoma cells were treated with hydroxyurea to investigate the expression pattern of TET proteins in these cells. The expression of TET1 was increased in U2OS cells after treatment with hydroxyurea. In addition, hydroxyurea increased cell apoptosis and altered the cell cycle. TET proteins catalyze the oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC); therefore, 5mC and 5hmC levels were evaluated. Increased 5hmC levels were observed after the hydroxyurea treatment. Experiments examining cell apoptosis and the cell cycle after knockdown and overexpression of TET1 were conducted to further investigate whether TET1 expression affected cell growth. The overexpression of TET1 increased cell apoptosis and inhibited cell growth. Taken together, TET1 expression regulated proliferation and apoptosis in U2OS cells, changes that were associated with 5hmC levels.",CircLMTK2 acts as a novel tumor suppressor in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988068,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"Recently, circRNAs have been found to play regulatory roles in cancer. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the characteristics and effect of circLMTK2, and its potential role as a novel biomarker in cases of gastric cancer (GC). About 111 pairs of clinical tissues from patients were collected for circLMTK2 expression investigation. Afterward, the relationship of circLMTK2 expression level and clinical features, such as survival, tumor size and so on, were analyzed, along with a multivariate Cox hazards analysis. Finally, malignant biological properties, like cell viability and mobility, were explored in cell line MGC-803. We found that circLMTK2 was a stable circRNA generated from the back-spliced Exon 10 and Exon 11 of the LMTK2 gene in GC cells. CircLMTK2 expression was significantly down-regulated in gastric carcinoma tissue specimens (P<0.001) compared with its expression in paired normal tissues. Furthermore, a Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that lower levels of circLMTK2 expression were associated with decreased overall survival (OS) (P<0.001), and a multivariate Cox hazards analysis showed that high circLMTK2 expression was an independent factor for OS. Afterward, overexpression of circLMTK2 was performed in gastric cancer cell line MGC-803, and results indicated that malignant biological properties were inhibited by circLTMK2 overexpression. The present study showed the first evidence that circLMTK2 was down-regulated in GC, suggesting it as a novel biomarker for prognosis, and also as a therapeutic target in treatment of GC.",miR-20a regulates sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to NK cells by targeting MICA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988067,Bioscience reports,2019 04 16,"This site is designed to facilitate the manuscript submission and peer review process.

However, regulatory factors associated with Tregs-Th17 balance were not completely understood. We previously demonstrated an immune-modulatory capacity by Notch signaling inactivation to reverse Tregs-Th17 disequilibrium in chronic hepatitis C. Thus, the aim of current study was to assess the role of Notch signaling in modulation Tregs and Th17 cells function in gastric cancer (GC) patients. A total of 51 GC patients and 18 normal controls (NCs) were enrolled. Notch1 and Notch2 mRNA expressions were semiquantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Tregs/Th17 percentages, transcriptional factors, and cytokines production were investigated in response to the stimulation of Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT. Both Notch1 and Notch2 mRNA expressions were elevated in GC tissues and peripheral bloods in GC patients. CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- Tregs and Th17 cells percentage was also elevated in GC patients compared with in NCs. DAPT treatment did not affect frequency of either circulating Tregs or Th17 cells, however, reduced FoxP3/RORγt mRNA expression and interleukin (IL)-35/IL-17 production in purified CD4+ T cells from GC patients. Moreover, blockade of Notch signaling also inhibited the suppressive function of purified CD4+CD25+CD127dim/- Tregs from GC patients, which presented as elevation of cellular proliferation and IL-35 secretion. The current data further provided mechanism underlying Tregs-Th17 balance in GC patients. The link between Notch signaling and Th cells might lead to a new therapeutic target for GC patients.",Associations between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 gene polymorphisms and diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis of 76 case-control studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988065,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"Background: Several genetic association studies already investigated potential roles of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) gene polymorphisms in diabetes mellitus (DM), with inconsistent results. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to better assess the relationship between CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms and DM in a larger pooled population.Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI were systematically searched for eligible studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the strength of associations between CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms and DM in all possible genetic models.Results: A total of 76 studies were finally included in our analyses. Significant associations with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) were detected for rs231775 (dominant model: P=0.008, OR = 0.83, 95%CI 0.73-0.95; recessive model: P=0.003, OR = 1.27, 95%CI 1.09-1.50; allele model: P=0.004, OR = 0.85, 95%CI 0.77-0.95) and rs5742909 (recessive model: P=0.02, OR = 1.50, 95%CI 1.05-2.13) polymorphisms in overall population. Further subgroup analyses revealed that rs231775 polymorphism was significantly associated with susceptibility to T1DM in Caucasians and South Asians, and rs5742909 polymorphism was significantly associated with susceptibility to T1DM in South Asians. Moreover, rs231775 polymorphism was also found to be significantly associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in East Asians and South Asians.Conclusions: Our findings indicated that rs231775 and rs5742909 polymorphisms may serve as genetic biomarkers of T1DM, and rs231775 polymorphism may also serve as a genetic biomarker of T2DM.",PDK-1 mediated Hippo-YAP-IRS2 signaling pathway and involved in the apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988063,Bioscience reports,2019 06 10,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), a gatekeeper enzyme, was involved in cancer progression, such as tumor angiogenesis, cell survival, and growth. Recent evidence indicated that PDK-1 may be involved in lung cancer, however, the function and underlying mechanism of PDK-1 is remaining unclear. In the present study, our aim was to investigate the role and mechanisms of PDK-1 in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We first observed that PDK-1 was highly expressed in NSCLC cell lines. PDK-1 silence resulted in the inhibition of NSCLC cell survival. Also, cell apoptosis and caspase-3 activity were increased by PDK-1 knockdown in H1299 and A549 cells. Attenuation of PDK-1 expression blocked YAP and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) expression, and PDK-1 silence suppressed IRS2 expression dependent on Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Moreover, further studies confirmed that YAP or IRS2 overexpression reversed the action of PDK-1 in NSCLC cells. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PDK1/Hippo-YAP/IRS2 signaling pathway plays a critical role in NSCLC cell survival and apoptosis."

This modification has only recently been described in eukaryotes, where it seems to have evolved species-specific functions ranging from nucleosome positioning to transposon repression. In Drosophila, 6mA has been shown to be important for enforcing the tissue specificity of neuronal genes in the brain and suppressing transposable element expression in the ovaries. In this study, we have analyzed the raw signal data from nanopore sequencing to identify 6mA positions in the D. melanogaster genome at single-base resolution. We find that this modification is enriched upstream from transcription start sites, within the introns and 3' UTRs of genes, as well as in simple repeats. These 6mA positions are enriched for sequence motifs that are recognized by known transcriptional activators involved in development, such as Bicoid and Caudal, and the genes that carry this modification are enriched for functions involved in development, regulation of transcription, and neuronal activity. These genes show high expression specificity in a variety of tissues besides the brain, suggesting that this modification may play a more general role in enforcing the specificity of gene expression across many tissues, throughout development, and between the sexes.",A Double-Strand Break Does Not Promote Neisseria gonorrhoeae Pilin Antigenic Variation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988037,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"The major subunit of the type IV pilus (T4p) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae undergoes antigenic variation (AV) dependent on a guanine quadruplex (G4) DNA structure located upstream of the pilin gene. Since the presence of G4 DNA induces genome instability in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic chromosomes, we tested whether a double-strand break (DSB) at the site of the pilE G4 sequence could substitute for G4-directed pilin AV. The G4 motif was replaced by an I-SceI cut site, and the cut site was also introduced to locations near the origin of replication and the terminus. Expression of the I-SceI endonuclease from an irrelevant chromosomal site confirmed that the endonuclease functions to induce double-strand breaks at all three locations. No antigenic variants were detected when the G4 was replaced with the I-SceI cut site, but there was a growth defect from having a DSB in the chromosome, and suppressor mutations that were mainly deletions of the cut site and/or the entire pilE gene accumulated. Thus, the pilE G4 does not act to promote pilin AV by generating a DSB but requires either a different type of break, a nick, or more complex interactions with other factors to stimulate this programmed recombination system.IMPORTANCENeisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea, possesses a DNA recombination system to change one of its surface-exposed antigens. This recombination system, known as antigenic variation, uses an alternate DNA structure to initiate variation. The guanine quadruplex DNA structure is known to cause nicks or breaks in DNA; however, much remains unknown about how this structure functions in cells. We show that inducing a break by different means does not allow antigenic variation, indicating that the DNA structure may have a more complicated role.",Copper-Induced Expression of a Transmissible Lipoprotein Intramolecular Transacylase Alters Lipoprotein Acylation and the Toll-Like Receptor 2 Response to Listeria monocytogenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988036,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"Bacterial lipoproteins are globular proteins anchored to the extracytoplasmic surfaces of cell membranes through lipidation at a conserved N-terminal cysteine. Lipoproteins contribute to an array of important cellular functions for bacteria, as well as being a focal point for innate immune system recognition through binding to Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) heterodimer complexes. Although lipoproteins are conserved among nearly all classes of bacteria, the presence and type of α-amino-linked acyl chain are highly variable and even strain specific within a given bacterial species. The reason for lyso-lipoprotein formation and N-acylation variability in general is presently not fully understood. In Enterococcus faecalis, lipoproteins are anchored by an N-acyl-S-monoacyl-glyceryl cysteine (lyso form) moiety installed by a chromosomally encoded lipoprotein intramolecular transacylase (Lit). Here, we describe a mobile genetic element common to environmental isolates of Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus spp. encoding a functional Lit ortholog (Lit2) that is cotranscribed with several well-established copper resistance determinants. Expression of Lit2 is tightly regulated, and induction by copper converts lipoproteins from the diacylglycerol-modified form characteristic of L. monocytogenes type strains to the α-amino-modified lyso form observed in E. faecalis Conversion to the lyso form through either copper addition to media or constitutive expression of lit2 decreases TLR2 recognition when using an activated NF-κB secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase reporter assay. While lyso formation significantly diminishes TLR2 recognition, lyso-modified lipoprotein is still predominantly recognized by the TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer.IMPORTANCE The induction of lipoprotein N-terminal remodeling in response to environmental copper in Gram-positive bacteria suggests a more general role in bacterial cell envelope physiology. N-terminal modification by lyso formation, in particular, simultaneously modulates the TLR2 response in direct comparison to their diacylglycerol-modified precursors. Thus, use of copper as a frontline antimicrobial control agent and ensuing selection raises the potential of diminished innate immune sensing and enhanced bacterial virulence.",Acetate Metabolism and the Inhibition of Bacterial Growth by Acetate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988035,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"During aerobic growth on glucose, Escherichia coli excretes acetate, a mechanism called ""overflow metabolism."" At high concentrations, the secreted acetate inhibits growth. Several mechanisms have been proposed for explaining this phenomenon, but a thorough analysis is hampered by the diversity of experimental conditions and strains used in these studies. Here, we describe the construction of a set of isogenic strains that remove different parts of the metabolic network involved in acetate metabolism. Analysis of these strains reveals that (i) high concentrations of acetate in the medium inhibit growth without significantly perturbing central metabolism; (ii) growth inhibition persists even when acetate assimilation is completely blocked; and (iii) regulatory interactions mediated by acetyl-phosphate play a small but significant role in growth inhibition by acetate. The major contribution to growth inhibition by acetate may originate in systemic effects like the uncoupling effect of organic acids or the perturbation of the anion composition of the cell, as previously proposed. Our data suggest, however, that under the conditions considered here, the uncoupling effect plays only a limited role.IMPORTANCE High concentrations of organic acids such as acetate inhibit growth of Escherichia coli and other bacteria. This phenomenon is of interest for understanding bacterial physiology but is also of practical relevance. Growth inhibition by organic acids underlies food preservation and causes problems during high-density fermentation in biotechnology. What causes this phenomenon? Classical explanations invoke the uncoupling effect of acetate and the establishment of an anion imbalance. Here, we propose and investigate an alternative hypothesis: the perturbation of acetate metabolism due to the inflow of excess acetate. We find that this perturbation accounts for 20% of the growth-inhibitory effect through a modification of the acetyl phosphate concentration. Moreover, we argue that our observations are not expected based on uncoupling alone.",Guanidine Riboswitch-Regulated Efflux Transporters Protect Bacteria against Ionic Liquid Toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988034,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"Plant cell walls contain a renewable, nearly limitless supply of sugar that could be used to support microbial production of commodity chemicals and biofuels. Imidazolium ionic liquid (IIL) solvents are among the best reagents for gaining access to the sugars in this otherwise recalcitrant biomass. However, the sugars from IIL-treated biomass are inevitably contaminated with residual IILs that inhibit growth in bacteria and yeast, blocking biochemical production by these organisms. IIL toxicity is, therefore, a critical roadblock in many industrial biosynthetic pathways. Although several IIL-tolerant (IILT) bacterial and yeast isolates have been identified in nature, few genetic mechanisms have been identified. In this study, we identified two IILTBacillus isolates as well as a spontaneous IILTEscherichia coli lab strain that are tolerant to high levels of two widely used IILs. We demonstrate that all three IILT strains contain one or more pumps of the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family, and two of these strains contain mutations that affect an adjacent regulatory guanidine riboswitch. Furthermore, we show that the regulation of E. colisugE by the guanidine II riboswitch can be exploited to promote IIL tolerance by the simple addition of guanidine to the medium. Our results demonstrate the critical role that transporter genes play in IIL tolerance in their native bacterial hosts. The study presented here is another step in engineering IIL tolerance into industrial strains toward overcoming this key gap in biofuels and industrial biochemical production processes.IMPORTANCE This study identifies bacteria that are tolerant to ionic liquid solvents used in the production of biofuels and industrial biochemicals. For industrial microbiology, it is essential to find less-harmful reagents and microbes that are resistant to their cytotoxic effects. We identified a family of small multidrug resistance efflux transporters, which are responsible for the tolerance of these strains. We also found that this resistance can be caused by mutations in the sequences of guanidine-specific riboswitches that regulate these efflux pumps. Extending this knowledge, we demonstrated that guanidine itself can promote ionic liquid tolerance. Our findings will inform genetic engineering strategies that improve conversion of cellulosic sugars into biofuels and biochemicals in processes where low concentrations of ionic liquids surpass bacterial tolerance.",Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires the DNA-specific endonuclease EndA to degrade eDNA to disperse from the biofilm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988033,Journal of bacteriology,2019 04 16,"The dispersion of biofilms is an active process resulting in the release of planktonic cells from the biofilm structure. While much is known about the process of dispersion cue perception and the subsequent modulation of the c-di-GMP pool, little is known about subsequent events resulting in the release of cells from the biofilm. Given that dispersion coincides with void formation and an overall erosion of the biofilm structure, we asked whether dispersion involves degradation of the biofilm matrix. Here, we focused on eDNA due to its almost universal presence in the matrix of biofilm-forming species. We identified two probable nucleases, endA and eddB, and eddA encoding a phosphatase, to be significantly increased in transcript abundance in dispersed cells. However, only inactivation of endA but not eddA or eddB impaired dispersion by P. aeruginosa biofilms in response to glutamate and NO. Heterologously produced EndA was found to be secreted and active in degrading genomic DNA. While endA inactivation had little effect on biofilm formation and the presence of eDNA in biofilms, eDNA degradation upon induction of dispersion was impaired. In contrast, induction of endA expression coincided with eDNA degradation and resulted in biofilm dispersion. Thus released cells demonstrated a hyperattaching phenotype but remained as resistant to tobramycin as biofilm cells from which they egress, indicating EndA-dispersed cells adopted some but not all of the phenotypes associated with dispersed cells. Our findings indicate for the first time a role of DNAse EndA in dispersion, and suggest weakening of the biofilm matrix to be a requisite for biofilm dispersion.IMPORTANCEThe finding that exposure to DNase-I impairs biofilm formation or leads to the dispersal of early stage biofilms has led to the realization of extracellular genomic DNA (eDNA) being a structural component of the biofilm matrix. However, little is known about the contribution of intrinsic DNases to the weakening of the biofilm matrix and dispersion of established biofilms. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that nucleases are induced in dispersed P. aeruginosa cells, are essential to the dispersion response, and that degradation of matrix eDNA by endogenously produced/secreted EndA is required for P. aeruginosa biofilm dispersion. Our findings suggest that dispersing cells mediate their active release from the biofilm matrix via the induction of nucleases.",25th Annual Midwest Microbial Pathogenesis Conference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988032,Journal of bacteriology,2019 04 16,"The 25th Annual Midwest Microbial Pathogenesis Conference (MMPC) was held at the University of Iowa from September 28-30, 2018.

Two variants of this pyocin were identified whose sequences mainly differed in the N-terminal protein moiety, i.e., the region involved in the binding to the FiuA outer membrane receptor and translocation into the periplasm. The antibacterial activity of these two variants, PaeM1 and PaeM2, was tested against various P. aeruginosa strains comprising reference strains PAO1 and PA14, PaeM-producing strains, and 60 clinical isolates. Seven of these strains, including PAO1, were susceptible to only one variant (2 to PaeM1 and 5 to PaeM2), and 11 were affected by both. The remaining strains, including PA14 and four PaeM1 producers, were resistant to both variants. The differences in the antibacterial spectra of the two PaeM homologs prompted us to investigate the molecular determinants allowing their internalization into P. aeruginosa cells, taking the PAO1 strain that is susceptible to PaeM2 but resistant to PaeM1 as the indicator strain. Heterologous expression of fiuA gene orthologs from different strains into PAO1, site-directed mutagenesis experiments, and construction of PaeM chimeric proteins provided evidence that the cell susceptibility and discrimination differences between the PaeM variants resulted from a polymorphism of both the pyocin and the outer membrane receptor FiuA. Moreover, we found that a third component, TonB1, a protein involved in iron transport in P. aeruginosa, working together with FiuA and the ExbB/ExbD complex, was directly implicated in this discrimination.IMPORTANCE Bacterial antibiotic resistance constitutes a threat to human health, imposing the need for identification of new targets and development of new strategies to fight multiresistant pathogens. Bacteriocins and other weapons that bacteria have themselves developed to kill competitors are therefore of great interest and a valuable source of inspiration for us. Attention was paid here to two variants of a colicin M homolog (PaeM) produced by certain strains of P. aeruginosa that inhibit the growth of their congeners by blocking cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Molecular determinants allowing recognition of these pyocins by the outer membrane receptor FiuA were identified, and a receptor polymorphism affecting the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa clinical strains was highlighted, providing new insights into the potential use of these pyocins as an alternative to antibiotics.",Competence beyond Genes: Filling in the Details of the Pneumococcal Competence Transcriptome by a Systems Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988030,Journal of bacteriology,2019 06 11,"DNA uptake by natural competence is a central process underlying the genetic plasticity, biology, and virulence of the human respiratory opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae A study reported in this issue (J.

Here, we generated mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) knocked in for a slow elongating form of RNAPII We show that a reduced transcriptional elongation rate results in early embryonic lethality in mice. Focusing on neuronal differentiation as a model, we observed that slow elongation impairs development of the neural lineage from ESCs, which is accompanied by changes in AS and in gene expression along this pathway. In particular, we found a crucial role for RNAPII elongation rate in transcription and splicing of long neuronal genes involved in synapse signaling. The impact of the kinetic coupling of RNAPII elongation rate with AS is greater in ESC-differentiated neurons than in pluripotent cells. Our results demonstrate the requirement for an appropriate transcriptional elongation rate to ensure proper gene expression and to regulate AS during development.",PAS domain-containing phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency in Leishmania major results in increased autophagosome formation and cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30988012,The Biochemical journal,2019 05 01,"Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains are structurally conserved and present in numerous proteins throughout all branches of the phylogenetic tree.

Here, we report a PAS domain-containing PGK (LmPAS-PGK) in the unicellular pathogen Leishmania The modeled structure of N-terminal of this protein exhibits four antiparallel β sheets centrally flanked by α helices, which is similar to the characteristic signature of PAS domain. Activity measurements suggest that acidic pH can directly stimulate PGK activity. Localization studies demonstrate that the protein is highly enriched in the glycosome and its presence can also be seen in the lysosome. Gene knockout, overexpression and complement studies suggest that LmPAS-PGK plays a fundamental role in cell survival through autophagy. Furthermore, the knockout cells display a marked decrease in virulence when host macrophage and BALB/c mice were infected with them.

MDA MB 231 and B16F10 cells were incubated with Cur_Tpt_NC.MB and exposed with ultrasound. Ultrasound exposure reduced the IC50 concentration of topotecan and curcumin significantly (P<0.05) as compared to free drug. Anti-tumor efficacy study of the Cur_Tpt_NC.MB in B16F10 melanoma tumor bearing C57BL/6 mice showed that ultrasound exposure of right tumor reduced the growth by 3.5 times as compared to the unexposed left tumor of same mice and 14.8 times as compared to the group treated with physical mixture of drug. These results suggest that the developed nanotherapeutic system induces site specific inhibition of tumor growth at higher rate and it has the potential to be used as therapeutic regimen for spatiotemporal delivery of dual drug for treatment of cancer. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 1. Topotecan and curcumin co-encapsulated nanocapsule and microbubble nanoconjugates were successfully developed and characterized. 2. Both nanoconjugates and microbubbles showed echogenicity in agarose phantom model. 3. Nanoconjugates reduced the IC50 of topotecan and curcumin significantly in MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells and B16F10 melanoma cells upon exposure of ultrasound. 4. Ultrasound exposure over tumor following intravenous administration of dual drug loaded nanoconjugates induced the spatial accelerated regression of the insonated tumor. 5.

However, adropin's roles in human metabolism are unclear. In silico expression profiling in a nonhuman primate diurnal transcriptome atlas (GSE98965) revealed a dynamic and diurnal pattern of ENHO expression. ENHO expression is abundant in brain, including ventromedial and lateral hypothalamic nuclei regulating appetite and autonomic function. Lower ENHO expression is present in liver, lung, kidney, ileum, and some endocrine glands. Hepatic ENHO expression associates with genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified 426 genes co-regulated with ENHO in liver, ileum, kidney medulla, and lung. Gene Ontology analysis of this cluster revealed enrichment for epigenetic silencing by histone H3K27 trimethylation and biological processes related to neural function. Dietary intervention experiments with 59 adult male rhesus macaques indicated low plasma adropin concentrations were positively correlated with fasting glucose, plasma leptin and apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) concentrations. During consumption of a high sugar (fructose) diet which induced 10% weight gain, animals with low adropin had larger increases of plasma leptin and more severe hyperglycemia. Declining adropin concentrations were correlated with increases of plasma APOC3 and triglycerides. In summary, peripheral ENHO expression associates with pathways related to epigenetic and neural pathways, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, suggesting co-regulation in nonhuman primates.

Previously, we have illustrated the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1) in neoplastic transformation of melanocytes in vitro and spontaneous metastatic melanoma in vivo. In this study, we showed that autocrine stimulation constitutively activates the GRM1 receptor and its downstream mitogenic signaling. GRM1-activated (GRM1+) melanomas exhibited significantly increased expression of glutaminase (GLS), which catalyzes the first step in the conversion of glutamine to glutamate. In cultured GRM1+ melanoma cell lines, CB-839, a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of GLS, suppressed cell proliferation, while riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release, promoted apoptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo. Combined treatment with CB-839 and riluzole treatment proved to be superior to single-agent treatment, restricting glutamate bioavailability and leading to effective suppression of tumor cell proliferation in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. Hyperactivation of GRM1 in malignant melanoma is an oncogenic driver, which acts independently of canonical melanoma proto-oncogenes, BRAF or NRAS. Overall, these results indicate that expression of GRM1 promotes a metabolic phenotype that supports increased glutamate production and autocrine glutamatergic signaling, which can be pharmacologically targeted by decreasing glutamate bioavailability and the GLS-dependent glutamine to glutamate conversion. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that targeting glutaminolytic glutamate bioavailability is an effective therapeutic strategy for GRM1-activated tumors.",Lulling the Cancer Cell into an Eternal Sleep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987978,Cancer research,2019 04 16,"A hallmark of metastasis is the ability of cancer cells to undergo the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to invade and disseminate to distal sites. More recently, the case has been made that the critical last step in metastasis is dependent on the ability to undergo reversion to an epithelial phenotype in a process known as the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). It is this transition in the metastatic cascade that researchers are focusing on clinically to treat disseminated disease. Shinde and colleagues identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as a critical mediator of MET that facilitated the removal of P-bodies during autophagy. Remarkably, pharmacologic inhibition of SYK inhibited the clearance of P-bodies and autophagy in preclinical models of metastasis, arresting cancer cells in an indefinite dormant state and preventing tumor cell colonization and thus the establishment of aggressive metastatic disease.See related article by Shinde et al., p. 1831."

Authors may refer to other more comprehensive and recent reviews on AKT/PKB (Manning and Cantley, 2007; Manning and Toker, 2017). AKT/PKB is one of the most enigmatic and most studied signaling molecule in cancers and is a significant therapeutic target (Brown and Banerji, 2017). Yet, how AKT/PKB activation couples with its downstream target/substrate molecules that function in diverse subcellular compartments remains obscure. Recent studies indicate the continuous interaction of AKT/PKB with PI3,4,5P3 or PI3,4P2 in a lipid membrane is required for its activation throughout the cells (Ebner et al., 2017).

Penile reconstruction may ameliorate the risk of suicide due to mental illness, social harassment, and isolation commonly experienced by these individuals. The ideal aim is to allow micturition while standing and penetrative intercourse with full sensation, but there is no universal agreement on the ideal flap design. Contemporary options for penile reconstruction include metoidioplasty and phalloplasty using either a pedicled or free flap. The most common flap currently performed is the radial artery forearm free flap. Secondary procedures following phalloplasty may include glansplasty, scrotoplasty, and insertion of penile and testicular prostheses. Patient summary: Penile reconstruction is offered to transgender men as part of their transition from female to male.

Regarding the remarkable increase of the schizophrenia incidence in individuals exposed to an urban environment during upbringing the understanding of responsible pathogenetic mechanisms is important. Schizophrenia has been conceptualized as a disorder of brain dysconnectivity. We investigated the association between urban upbringing and gray matter as well as white matter in a large sample of healthy subjects (n = 290). Voxelwise analyses revealed a strong inverse correlation of early life urbanicity and gray matter volume of the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC) and the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) as well as the white matter characteristics in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). A positive correlation was found for the gray matter volume of the left precuneus. These results may point to an altered brain development associated with urban upbringing, which not only affects single brain regions but a fronto-parietal network.

Mouse models of rare mutations, paired with analysis of homologous cognitive and sensory processing deficits and state-of-the-art neuroscience methods to manipulate and record neuronal activity have started providing unprecedented insights into pathogenic mechanisms and building the foundation of a new biological framework for understanding mental illness. A number of important principles are emerging, namely that degradation of the computational mechanisms underlying the ordered activity and plasticity of both local and long-range neuronal assemblies, the building blocks necessary for stable cognition and perception, might be the inevitable consequence and the common point of convergence of the vastly heterogeneous genetic liability, manifesting as defective internally- or stimulus-driven neuronal activation patterns and triggering the constellation of schizophrenia symptoms. Animal models of rare mutations have the unique potential to help us move from ""which"" (gene) to ""how"", ""where"" and ""when"" computational regimes of neural ensembles are affected. Linking these variables should improve our understanding of how symptoms emerge and how diagnostic boundaries are established at a circuit level.

The results revealed that evolvability, which is the appearance frequency of variants with higher activity than the parent protein, correlates with parental stability. This suggests that protein evolution that does not take stability into account does not make sense. Here, we used those data to further evaluate the relationship between activity and stability in random mutations, revealing that the maximum increase in activity due to mutation conflicts with parental stability. That is, many activated variants are produced when parental stability is high, whereas lower stability offers a few excellent variants with much higher activity. Moreover, we used the random mutant library to compute a novel criterion, robustizability (stabilizability), which is the appearance frequency of variants with a higher stability than the parent protein. Robustizability correlates positively with parental activity and negatively with parental stability. The results indicated that the principle of activity-stability trade-off dominates, in even random mutations. We propose its application in protein engineering via directed evolution by stability selection.","Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO)-mediated de novo synthesis of glycolate-based polyhydroxyalkanoate in Escherichia coli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987875,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019 04 16,"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) generates 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) as one of the metabolites from the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. In this study, we focused on the fact that glycolate (GL) derived from 2PG can be incorporated into the bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) as the monomeric constituent by using the evolved PHA synthase (PhaC1PsSTQK). In this study, the function of the RuBisCO-mediated pathway for GL-based PHA synthesis was evaluated using Escherichia coli JW2946 with the deletion of glycolate oxidase gene (ΔglcD) as the model system. The genes encoding RuBisCO, phosphoribulokinase and 2PG phosphatase (PGPase) from several photosynthetic bacteria were introduced into E. coli, and the cells were grown on xylose as a sole carbon source. The functional expression of RuBisCO and relevant enzymes was confirmed based on the increases in the intracellular concentrations of RuBP and GL. Next, PHA biosynthetic genes encoding PhaC1PsSTQK, propionyl-CoA transferase and 3-hydroxybutyryl(3HB)-CoA-supplying enzymes were introduced. The cells accumulated poly(GL-co-3HB)s with GL fractions of 7.8-15.1 mol%. Among the tested RuBisCOs, Rhodosprium rubrum and Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 enzymes were effective for P(GL-co-3HB) production as well as higher GL fraction. The heterologous expression of PGPase from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and R. rubrum increased GL fraction in the polymer.

In early 2018, a measles outbreak started in the North region of Brazil, reaching 11 of the 27 federal units by January 24, 2019. In this period, 10,302 cases were confirmed. Although the reintroduction of measles in Brazil is likely due to migration from Venezuela, the spread of the virus was made possible by the low levels of MMR coverage, as a result of significant decreases during the study period. Areas with high concentration of municipalities with low coverage are more susceptible to the spread of the virus, especially in the North and Northeast regions. Increasing vaccination coverage is essential to block the ongoing outbreak in Brazil. Vaccination strategies might target priority areas, especially those with a marked decrease in coverage. Moreover, it is essential to extend actions to travelers, migrants and refugees.","Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus fusion glycoprotein F subunit vaccine in healthy adults: Results of a phase 1, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, dosage-escalation study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987852,Vaccine,2019 05 03,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in infants.

Thrombosis, as manifested in these diseases, is the leading cause of disability and death in the western world. Current parenteral antithrombotic and thrombolytic agents used to treat these conditions are limited by a short therapeutic window, irreversibility, and major risk of hemorrhage. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel anti-vWF aptamer, called DTRI-031, that selectively binds and inhibits vWF-mediated platelet adhesion and arterial thrombosis while enabling rapid reversal of this antiplatelet activity by an antidote oligonucleotide (AO). Aptamer DTRI-031 exerts dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation and thrombosis in whole blood and mice, respectively. Moreover, DTRI-031 can achieve potent vascular recanalization of platelet-rich thrombotic occlusions in murine and canine carotid arteries. Finally, DTRI-031 activity is rapidly (<5 min) and completely reversed by AO administration in a murine saphenous vein hemorrhage model, and murine toxicology studies indicate the aptamer is well tolerated. These findings suggest that targeting vWF with an antidote-controllable aptamer potentially represents an effective and safer treatment for thrombosis patients having platelet-rich arterial occlusions in the brain, heart, or periphery.",Clinicopathological spectrum of renal parenchymal involvement in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987838,Kidney international,2019 04 16,"The clinicopathological characteristics of kidney infiltration in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders remain poorly described. We retrospectively studied 52 adults with biopsy-proven malignant B-cell kidney infiltration, including Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (n=21), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=11), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n=8), other lymphoma (n=11), and multiple myeloma (n=1). Kidney disease varied according to the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. In DLBCL, malignant kidney infiltration was prominent, resulting in acute kidney injury (AKI, 75%) and kidney enlargement (88%). In the other types, associated immunoglobulin-related nephropathy (most commonly AL amyloidosis) was more common (45%), and chronic kidney disease with proteinuria was the primary presentation. All patients received chemotherapy. Over a median follow-up of 31 months, 20 patients died and 21 reached end-stage kidney disease. Renal response, achieved in 25 patients (48%), was associated with higher overall survival (97 vs. 37 months in non-renal responders). In univariate analysis, percentage of sclerotic glomeruli, kidney enlargement, and complete hematological response at 6 months were predictive of renal response. In multivariate analysis, concomitant immunoglobulin-related nephropathy was the sole independent predictor of poor renal outcome. In conclusion, clinical presentation of renal lymphomatous infiltration depends on the nature of the underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. In DLBCL, massive renal infiltration manifests with enlarged kidneys and AKI, and the diagnosis primarily relies on lymph node biopsy. In other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, the clinicopathological spectrum is more heterogeneous, with a high frequency of immunoglobulin-related nephropathy that may affect renal outcome; thus kidney biopsy is required for early diagnosis and prognostic assessment."

We report the identification of the tumor suppressor protein, p53, as a binding partner of Pellino1. Their interaction has a Kd of 42 ± 2 μM and requires phosphorylation of Thr18 within p53 and association with the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of Pellino1. We employed laser micro-irradiation and live cell microscopy to show that Pellino1 is recruited to newly occurring DNA damage sites, via its FHA domain. Mutation of a hitherto unidentified nuclear localization signal within the N-terminus of Pellino1 led to its exclusion from the nucleus. This study provides evidence that Pellino1 translocates to damaged DNA in the nucleus and has a functional role in p53 signaling and the DNA damage response.",Identification of a potent inhibitor of type II secretion system from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987825,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen infecting human population. The pathogen is becoming a serious health problem due to its ability to evade normal immune response of the host and multiple drug resistance to many antibiotics. The pathogen has 2 major virulence systems of which the type III secretion system (T3SS) is of major concern to humans. A third system, type 2 secretion system (T2SS), is common to bacteria and used to secrete exotoxin A (ExoA) responsible for human cell destruction. To help bypass the drug resistance, a strategy to block the T2SS based on a low similarity between human ATPases and the essential ATPases of the T3SS and T2SS of P. aeruginosa, was used. An in silico-optimized inhibitor of T3SS, made directly from the computer-optimized of previously published compounds and their combinatorial libraries, showed IC50 = 1.3 ± 0.2 μM in the T2SS ExoA secretion blocking test. The compound was non-toxic to human lung epithelial cell line A549 and could block cellular destruction of those cells in a cell infection model at 200 μM for at least 24 h. The compound could be a lead candidate for the development of T2SS virulence blockers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",Construction of small molecular CTLA4 analogs with CD80-binding affinity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987824,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"A variety of CTLA4-Fc fusion proteins and anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody have been approved. Given the shortcomings of macromolecular antibodies, recombinant proteins derived from the tenth unit of human type III fibronectin (FN3) termed monobody were studied as CTLA4 analogs in this study. A peptide EL161 derived from CD80-binding domain (MYPPPY motifs) in the complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 of CTLA4 was found to inhibit the interaction of CTLA4 with CD80 significantly. Afterward, the peptide EL16 as well as the CDR1 of CTLA4 which is also critical for its binding to CD80 were grafted onto FN3 and obtained a novel CD80 binding monobody protein CFN13.2 CFN13 showed 80% binding affinity compared to CTLA4. In addition, to increase the half-life, CFN13 was fused to human IgG1 Fc to generate CFN13-Fc fusion protein. As expected, CFN13-Fc bound to CD80 in a dosage-dependent manner as CFN13 did, and displayed 41.0% and 31.4% inhibition on the interaction of CTLA4-Fc with CD80 at 200 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml respectively. Moreover, peptide EL16 could inhibit CFN13-Fc binding to CD80 significantly, with the inhibition ratio of 64.3% and 52.8% at 100 and 50 μg/ml respectively, indicating that the peptide EL16 and CFN13-Fc shared the similar binding sites with CD80 and the CDR3 motif of CTLA4 contributed more than CDR1 in binding to CD80. In summary, our study provides insights into small molecular analogs of CTLA4.",Intra-individual variation and transcribed pseudogenes in the ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA of Paraplagusia japonica (Pleuronectiformes: Cynoglossidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987823,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"The eukaryotic ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cluster consists of multiple copies of three genes (18S, 5.8S, and 28S rDNA) and two internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2). Typically, rDNA is thought to be evolved in a strict concerted evolution pattern, in which show little or even no variations within species, while sequence diversity between species or higher taxa. However, in the present study, we reported a high level of intra-individual polymorphism of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA in the genome of Paraplagusia japonica (Pleuronectiformes: Cynoglossidae), suggesting it conformed a non-concerted evolutionary pattern. Three divergent type sequences (Type A, B, and C) differing in length, GC content, secondary structure stability and minimum free energy coexisted in the genome of each studied individual. According to the particular features of ribosomal pseudogenes, Type B and Type C sequences were postulated as pseudogenes. Expression analyses gave clear evidence that both the functional gene and pseudogenes were abundantly transcribed, indicating expression is not an applicable criterion for identifying ribosomal pseudogenes. These findings will enrich useful data for the studies on rDNA evolution in flatfishes, as well as provide fresh insight on the transcribed ribosomal pseudogenes and further consideration of the definition of ribosomal pseudogene.",Protein interactome of the deamidase phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthetase (PFAS) by LC-MS/MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987822,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PFAS) is an essential enzyme in de novo synthesis of purine. Previously, PFAS has been reported to modulate RIG-I activation during viral infection via deamidation. In this study, we sought to identify potential substrates that PFAS can deamidate. Flag-PFAS was transfected into HEK-293T cells and PFAS associated proteins were purified with anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads. PFAS associated proteins were identified using mass spectrometry and were analyzed using bioinformatics tools including KEGG pathway analysis, gene ontology annotation, and protein interaction network analysis. A total of 441 proteins is suggested to potentially interact with PFAS. Of this number, 12 were previously identified and 429 are newly identified. The interactions of PFAS with CAD, CCT2, PRDX1, and PHGDH were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting. This study is first to report the interaction of PFAS with several proteins which play physiological roles in tumor development including CAD, CCT2, PRDX1, and PHGDH. Furthermore, we show here that PFAS is able to deamidate PHGDH, and induce other posttranslational modification into CAD, CCT2 and PRDX1. The present data provide insight on the biological function of PFAS. Further study to explore the role of these protein interactions in tumorigenesis and other diseases is recommended.",Intrauterine low-protein diet disturbs metanephric gene expression and induces urinary tract developmental abnormalities in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987821,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Intrauterine low-protein diet can affect kidney development and hence final nephron number. In this study, we reported that intrauterine low-protein diet can cause congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) phenotypes, which was dominated by the duplicated collecting system phenotype. At the same time, ectopic ureteric buds were increased under intrauterine low-protein diet and the number of UB branches was reduced in the serum-free culture. Intrauterine low-protein diet can change metanephric gene expression. Slit2/Robo2 and Spry1 expression levels were decreased, Ret expression was increased, and downstream p-Akt activity enhanced with apoptosis abnormal in ureteric bud tissue, which may be the mechanisms that intrauterine low-protein diet causes increased incidence of CAKUT in offspring.

We highlight that their prey spectrum, their molecular malleability, and their multiple modes of production might lead to specific and personalized treatments to prevent systemic disorders. Complementarily, we discuss how we might exploit prevailing bacterial commensals, such as Streptococcus salivarius, and deliberately mobilize their bacteriocin arsenal 'on site' to cure multiresistant infections or finely reshape the endogenous microbiota for prophylaxis purposes."

Historically, radiologists have been considered ""doctors' doctors,"" communicating primarily with referring physicians and other radiologists. Aside from interventional radiology and breast imaging, direct communication between radiologists and patients has typically been limited. In recent years, major radiology professional societies have launched initiatives aimed toward increasing direct radiologist and patient communication. These include the American College of Radiology's Imaging 3.0 and Radiological Society of North America's Radiology Cares initiatives. Prior work has highlighted potential patient benefits of increased communication by demonstrating patient preferences for speaking with imaging experts about the results of their imaging studies and introducing strategies to harness existing information technology resources to achieve this goal.

A,2019 06 11,"In the present study, an electrospun composite of polyamide-graphene oxide-polypyrrole was synthesized. The characterization of the synthesized material was accomplished using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). FESEM images showed uniform and beadles nanofibers. The composite was employed as a novel sorbent for spin-column micro solid phase extraction to determine parabens in milk samples. Addition of graphene oxide and polypyrrole into the polymeric network of polyamide significantly improves the extraction efficiency of the electrospun sorbent due to providing the possibility of various interactions with the target analytes such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and π-π stacking. All effective parameters on the efficiency of both adsorption and desorption steps were optimized. These parameters were pH of sample solution (5.0), sorbent amount (20 mg), type and volume of desorption solvent (200 μL of methanol), number of cycles (7 and 14) and centrifugation speed (600 and 500 rpm) of both adsorption and desorption steps. Under the optimal conditions, the calibration plots were linear within the range of 10-1000, 15-1000, and 20-1000 ng mL-1 for methyl paraben, ethyl paraben and propyl paraben, respectively. Limits of detection were obtained lower than 7.0 ng mL-1 by HPLC-UV. Intra- and inter-assay relative standard deviations were less than 8.6% and 5.8%, respectively.

A,2019 06 03,"Two novel extraction chromatographic resins (EC), termed as RL-1 and RL-2, were prepared by impregnating two benzene-centered tripodal iglycolamide ligands (Bz-T-DGA) containing different spacer groups where the ligands are termed as L-1 and L-2, respectively. They were employed for the uptake of actinide and fission product ions, viz. Am3+, Eu3+, UO22+, Np4+, Pu4+, Sr2+, and Cs+, from acidic feeds. Weight distribution coefficient (Kd) values were measured by the batch method and the loaded metal ions were back extracted using a 0.01 M EDTA solution at pH 4. Kinetic modeling of the sorption data of Am(III) on both resins suggested pseudo-second order rate kinetics with rate constants of 1.68 × 10-6 and 2.47 × 10-6 g/cpm.min for the resins containing L-1 and L-2, respectively. Sorption isotherm studies indicated the Langmuir monolayer chemisorption phenomenon with Eu(III) experimentally determined saturation uptake capacities of 6.02 ± 0.11 and 5.49 ± 0.14 mg per g of RL-1 and RL-2 resins, respectively. As the batch uptake study results appeared encouraging, column studies were also carried out using both resins. The resin reusability data indicated a marginal change in the Kd values for the RL-1 resin up to three repeat runs beyond which a steady decrease of the Kd value was seen. On the other hand, in the case of RL-2 a steady decrease in the Kd values was observed for three repeat runs beyond which there was marginal change.",Improved oil spill dispersant monitoring in seawater using dual tracers: Dioctyl and monoctyl sulfosuccinates sourced from corexit EC9500A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987784,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 06 03,"A high resolution mass spectrometry method was developed for the environmental impact monitoring of oil spill dispersants. Previously reported instability of dioctyl sulfosuccinate (DOSS) dispersant tracer was addressed by the new procedure. The method monitors both DOSS and its degradation product, monooctyl sulfosuccinate (MOSS), by liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The related isomer, 4-(2-ethylhexyl) 2-sulfobutanedioate, was chromatographically resolved from MOSS but was not a product of DOSS degradation. Using this direct injection method (10 μL), the practical lower limit of quantitation was 0.5 nM for each analyte, a concentration equivalent to 0.22 ng mL-1, or 0.30 ng mL-1 including initial dilution factor with acetonitrile. The method was shown applicable to analysis of the dispersants Corexit® EC9500 A, Finasol OSR 52, Slickgone NS, and Slickgone EW for which DOSS is an active ingredient. A marine microcosm study of Corexit EC9500A, together with diluted bitumen (dilbit), at 15 ± 1 °C, provided evidence of the stoichiometric conversion of DOSS to MOSS under conditions reflecting a western Canadian marine environment. The advantage of the developed method is in its ability to extend environmental seawater sample collection time from 4 days for DOSS alone, to 14 days when both DOSS and MOSS are simultaneously analysed and results combined. The collection time is likely extended beyond the 14 day period with cooler temperatures. Preservation of collected seawater samples using sodium hydroxide, converting DOSS into MOSS in situ, was rejected due to stability issues. Addition of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid did not improve hold times, thus eliminating the theory of cation induced micelle effects causing DOSS loss.",Aborted small-incision lenticule extraction resulting from false plane creation and strategy for subsequent removal based on corneal layered pachymetry imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987783,Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,2019 05 31,"We describe a complication of false plane creation during small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and the surgical plan for subsequent lenticule removal. During a primary SMILE procedure to treat high myopia, the separator instrument entered a false lamellar plane as a result of an area of resistance caused by an area of opaque bubble layer (OBL). The procedure was aborted to avoid removing an irregular lenticule. Based on measurements of the anatomic landscape, a new inferonasal small incision was created. The lenticule was separated and removed without further incidence. The patient recovered as normal and at 6 months, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/16-1. This case highlights the importance of monitoring the bubble layer creation and interface separation to avoid creating or removing an irregular lenticule. It also shows the importance of layered corneal imaging to analyze and diagnose complications as well as of aborting a procedure and planning lenticule removal at a later time if deemed appropriate."

Neuroimaging,2019 05 19,"Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS) was designed for testing patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a multi-system neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive physical disability. In this study, we aim to explore the potential brain microstructural substrates associated with performance on ECAS in the early stages of ALS, using a whole-brain tract-based spatial statistics diffusion tensor imaging approach. Thirty-six non-demented ALS patients, assessed using ECAS, and 35 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. The ALS patients showed decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cortico-spinal tracts and corpus callosum (CC) and significant association between verbal fluency score, among ALS-specific ECAS scores, and FA measures in several long association fiber tracts in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Furthermore, the ALS non-specific total score was inversely related to axial diffusivity (AD) in the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, with more extended areas of correlation in the CC, when considering only the memory subscore. Our results point towards microstructural degeneration across motor and extra-motor areas in ALS, underlining that alterations in verbal fluency performances may be related to impairment of frontotemporal connectivity, while alterations of memory may be associated with damage of thalamocortical circuits.",Biomarker and behavioural responses of an estuarine fish following acute exposure to fluoxetine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987769,Marine environmental research,2019 05 27,"Antidepressants such as fluoxetine are frequently detected in estuaries and can have profound effects on non-target organisms by interfering with the neural system and affecting essential physiological processes and behaviours. In this context, short-term effects of fluoxetine exposure were analysed in the common goby Pomatoschistus microps, an estuarine resident fish species. Two experiments were conducted with fish exposed to: i) fluoxetine concentrations within the μg/L range for 96 h (0.1, 0.5, 10 and 100 μg/L) and ii) fluoxetine concentrations within the mg/L range for 1 h (1, 5 and 10 mg/L). Acute toxicity was assessed via multiple biomarker responses, namely: activity levels of antioxidant (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and detoxification enzymes (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and glutathione S-transferase); and biomarkers of effects (lipid peroxidation and DNA damage) and of neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase inhibition). Furthermore, behavioural responses concerning activity (active time, movement delay and number of active individuals) and feeding (number of feeding individuals) were also recorded and analysed. Acute fluoxetine exposure for 96 h (in the μg/L range) reduced antioxidant CAT activity with increasing concentrations but had no significant effect on SOD activity. Biotransformation enzymes showed bell-shaped response curves, suggesting efficient fluoxetine metabolism at concentrations up to 10 μg/L. No significant damage (LPO and DNAd) was observed at both concentration ranges (μg/L and mg/L), yet 1 h exposure to higher fluoxetine concentrations (mg/L range) inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity (up to 37%). Fluoxetine (at mg/L) also decreased the number of both feeding and active individuals (by 67%), decreased fish active time (up to 93%) and increased movement delay almost 3-fold (274%). Overall, acutely exposed P. microps were able to cope with fluoxetine toxicity at the μg/L range but higher concentrations (mg/L) affected fish cholinergic system and behavioural responses.",Patients' ratings of the in-hospital discharge briefing and post-discharge primary care follow-up: The association with 30-day readmissions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987768,Patient education and counseling,2019 06 13,We examined whether patients' ratings of their in-hospital discharge briefing and their post-discharge Primary Care Physicians' (PCP) review of the discharge summary are associated with 30-day readmissions.,Thrombocytopenia as a Prognostic Marker for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987767,The American journal of the medical sciences,2019 05 25,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients often exhibit hematological abnormalities, but the role of thrombocytopenia on the prognosis of SLE shows inconsistent results.

Secretory IgE can bind FcεRI or FcεRII/CD23. The combination of IgE and FcεRI, a high-affinity interaction, has long received attention and is believed to facilitate helminth control, while the properties of CD23-bound IgE have long been unexplored. Here, we established a Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infection model with different mouse strains and investigated membrane-bound IgE on B cells during infection. We show that after infection, the increase in CD23 expression on B cells was obvious, even in relatively resistant C57BL/6 mice, as well as in susceptible BALB/c and FVB mice. Although the serum IgE amount was lower in C57BL/6 mice than in BALB/c and FVB mice, the level of IgE binding to peripheral B cells was also elevated. Additionally, the IgE on B cells was soon undetectable in vitro due to dissociable binding. The results of the present study demonstrate the dramatic increase in CD23-bound IgE on B cells after C. sinensis infection. The significance of CD23-bound IgE in Ag transport and presentation has gained consideration in allergy development for its potential ability to promote the Th2 response. Therefore, even though the association of IgE and CD23 is not as substantial as that of IgE and FcεRI, membrane-bound IgE on B cells may be worth further study regarding clonorchiasis and other parasitic infections.",[Evaluation of the quality of life of adult patients treated in low vision at the CHU-IOTA].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987760,Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,2019 05 11,"Visual impairment is a handicap defined as any alteration of visual function responsible for a partial or total limitation of the activities of daily living (OMS, 2004).

Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a family member of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), is a known environmental carcinogen found in coal tar, tobacco smoke, barbecued food and incomplete combustion of auto fuel. BaP recruits cytochrome P450 to transform itself into benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (B(a)PDE), which covalently interacts with DNA causing tumorigenesis. BaP can be detoxified through GNMT and induces GNMT translocation into the cellular nucleus. GNMT translocation is accompanied by phosphorylation, but the role of phosphorylation in GNMT remains to be explored. Using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, this study identified serine 9 of GNMT as the phosphorylation site upon BaP treatment. When serine 9 was mutated and lost the capability to be phosphorylated, the occurrence of BaP-induced GNMT nuclear translocation was dramatically decreased. Also, this mutant from of GNMT lost the ability of phosphorylation and increased cytochrome P450 1A1 (Cyp1a) expression upon BaP treatment. In addition, protein kinase C (PKC) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) may be required for such phosphorylation. Further characterization of phosphorylated GNMT for its link to BaP may bring new insights into chemical detoxification.",Analysis of heterocyclic amines in meat products by liquid chromatography - Tandem mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987731,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"Heterocyclic amines (HCAs), a class made up of more than 25 compounds, are unintended hazardous substances that are generated by the heating or processing of proteinaceous foods at high temperatures. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified four such HCAs (IQ, MeIQ, MeIQx, and PhIP) as being probable or possible human carcinogens. In this study, two sample preparation strategies, liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with solid-phase extraction (SPE) and a rapid, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe extraction (QuEChERS) method, were investigated for the determination of 11 types of HCAs in meat products by LC-MS/MS. The HCAs in the samples were first extracted with acetonitrile by LLE, and followed by SPE. In the case of QuEChERS extraction, acetonitrile is used as the LLME solvent, and PSA, C18EC and MgSO4 were used as the dSPE sorbent. Both methods showed good performance with respect to precision (RSD < 15.15%), accuracy (79.80-117.64%), recovery (52.39-116.88%), limit of quantitation for a spiked meat extract (0.01-10 ppb) and correlation coefficients (>0.993). The QuEChERS extraction strategy provided a better linear dynamic range and superior sensitivity in comparison with the LLE-SPE approach. HCAs were successfully quantified in real samples using the two proposed approaches by LC-MS/MS.",Exposure marker discovery of di-2(propylheptyl) phthalate using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987730,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"Di-(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP) is a plasticizer and has been suggested to be a subchronic toxicant in rats. DPHP has been approved to be used in food containers and handling by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The use of DPHP is still increasing, and the risk of human exposure to DPHP via food may be high. Exposure markers measured in human samples are commonly used to monitor human exposure levels. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and a rat model were used to discover tentative DPHP exposure markers. DPHP and mono-(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (MPHP) were used as the precursors for calculating metabolite candidates using biotransformation mass changes of known enzymatic reactions. A rat model was designed to validate these metabolite candidates as tentative exposure markers. A total of 28 signals show dose-response relationships and these signals contain a few isomers. The chemical structures of 15 tentative exposure marker signals were speculated based on the product ion mass spectra from MS/MS analysis. These 15 signals included 7 chemical structures and some of them may be isomers. The different arrangement of the atoms in space of these isomers should be validated by standard compounds in the future studies. Among the 7 speculated chemical structures, 2 structures were novel tentative DPHP metabolites, and 5 structures have been previously reported in the literature. The results indicate that using UPLC-MS and a rat model can be used to identify tentative toxicant exposure markers.",Identification of bacteria in juice/lettuce using magnetic nanoparticles and selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987729,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"Ensuring food safety requires a rapid and reliable method for detecting food-borne pathogens. Mass spectrometry has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to classify pure bacterial species. However, matrix interference from food backgrounds may lead to false results because of the suppression of microbial signals. It is useful to develop a method for bacterial enrichment and marker identification in food samples. Magnetic zirconia nanoparticles were used to concentrate spiked microorganisms from apple juice/lettuce under specific conditions (pH 4.5). Bacterial identification was achieved using nanoLC-MS. Selected reaction monitoring of bacteria-related peptides was applied for the first time to identify bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This study presents an accurate means for bacterial identification in food matrixes using MS. The analysis time is less than 90 min and the minimum concentration of E. coli detected was 5 × 103 CFU/mL. The interaction between bacteria and the magnetic nanoparticles was electrostatic and nonspecific, in contrast to immunoassays which require specific antibodies. The targeted peptide analysis focuses on the bacterial markers, thus significantly simplifying the analysis and leading to an accurate identification of bacteria.",Chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry for investigating acute dietary effects of cow milk consumption on human urine metabolome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987728,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"Biomarker discovery has been increasingly important in the field of metabolomics for the detection and understanding of diseases. Of the many biofluids available for metabolomics, urine is a preferred option as it is non-invasive to collect and contains a wide range of metabolites reflective of the health status of the testing individual. However, urine also contains many exogenous metabolites which are introduced through various sources such as diet. This complicates the data interpretation when searching the metabolome for disease-related endogenous metabolites. Since diet is difficult to control, this work aims to study the acute effects of diet (particularly cow milk) consumption on the human urine amine/phenol submetabolome by utilizing differential chemical isotope labeling (CIL) liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). LC-MS analysis of 62 urine samples collected before and after (1 hour and 2 hours) milk intake resulted in the detection of 4985 metabolites with an average of 3815 ± 206 (n = 62) detected per sample. The work aims to differentiate the exogenous ""food"" metabolites from the endogenous metabolite pool and to determine any dietary effects from milk intake on the human urine metabolome.",PON-1 carbamylation is enhanced in HDL of uremia patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987726,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"High-density lipoprotein (HDL) carbamylation has been known in uremia patients. Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) is an important HDL protein responsible for HDL anti-oxidant, arylesterase and lactonase activities. PON-1 carbamylation in uremic HDL has never been explored. We isolated HDL from uremia patients and control healthy subjects for study. Sandwich ELISA was used to estimate carbamylated PON-1 protein expression in HDL, and nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) was applied to identify the amino acid in PON-1 carbamylated. PON-1 enzyme activities were estimated by substrates conversion method. HDL anti-oxidant activity was gauged by fluorescence changes of indicator dye in the presence of H2O2. Our study results proved that the degree of PON-1 carbamylation was higher in uremic HDL than in control HDL. Sandwich ELISA study showed that carbamylated PON-1 concentration in uremic HDL was 1.49 ± 0.08 fold higher than that in HDL from controls (p < 0.05). The nanoLC-MS/MS showed that the carbamylation of lysine 290 (K290) of PON-1, a residue adjacent to PON-1 activity determining site, was detected in uremic HDL but not detected in control HDL. K290 carbamylation leads to local conformation changes that reduce accessible solvent accessibility. The HDL paraoxonase, arylesterase, and lactonase activities were all significantly lower in uremia patients than in control subjects. Additionally, HDL anti-antioxidant ability was also lower in uremia patients. Carbamylation of PON-1 in uremia patients could be one of the factors in impairing PON-1 enzyme activities and HDL anti-oxidation function.",Complete mapping of disulfide linkages for etanercept products by multi-enzyme digestion coupled with LC-MS/MS using multi-fragmentations including CID and ETD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987725,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"The disulfide linkages of two etanercept products, Enbrel® (innovator drug) and TuNEX®, were characterized and compared using a multi-fragmentation approach consisting of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and collision induced dissociation (CID) in combination with multi-enzyme digestion protocols (from Lys-C, trypsin, Glu-C, and PNGase F). Multi-fragmentation approach allowed multi-disulfide linkages contained in a peptide to be un-ambiguously assigned based on the cleavage of both the disulfide and the backbone linkages in a MS3 schedule. New insights gained using this approach were discussed. A total of 29 disulfides, Cys18-Cys31, Cys32-Cys45, Cys35-Cys53, Cys56-Cys71, Cys74-Cys88, Cys78-Cys-96, Cys98-Cys104, Cys112-Cys121, Cys115-Cys139, Cys-142-Cys157, Cys163-Cys178 in TNFR portion and Cys240-Cys240, Cys246-Cys246, Cys249-Cys249, Cys281-Cys341, Cys387-Cys445 in IgG1 Fc domain, were completely assigned with the demonstration of the same disulfide linkages between the Enbrel® and TuNEX® products.

It is often used for analysis of small molecules, such as metabolites. Recently, DBS sampling has been applied for quantification of post-translational protein modifications. Glyoxal and methylglyoxal are two simple oxoaldehydes released from glycated proteins in the Maillard reaction. They are widely distributed in the environment (e.g. cigarette smoke) and found in foods and beverages. Glyoxal and methylglyoxal are shown to react with biomolecules including DNA and proteins. In this laboratory, we previously identified the sites of modification by these two oxoaldehydes in human hemoglobin and found that the extents of modification at certain sites of lysine and arginine residues are significantly higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients than in nondiabetic individuals. In this study, we examine the stability of these modifications of hemoglobin stored on DBS cards at room temperature or 4 °C in the ambient air. After hemoglobin was extracted from the DBS cards, it was digested by trypsin and analyzed by nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled with nanospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The results show that the extents of all these PTMs are stable within 14 and 21 days when stored on DBS at room temperature and at 4 °C, respectively. Extraction of globin from DBS cards is mostly advantageous for hemolytic blood samples. This assay is sensitive as only a quarter of a DBS card containing ca. 12 μL of blood is required. Thus, it is practically useful to measure the extents of glyoxal- and methylglyoxal-induced hemoglobin modifications from DBS cards.",Detection of BPDE-DNA adducts in human umbilical cord blood by LC-MS/MS analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987723,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"Benzo [a]pyrene (BaP) is a model compound for the study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) carcinogenesis.

In this study, we employed our developed LC-MS/MS method to detect and quantity BPDE-dG adducts present in 42 normal human umbilical cord blood samples and 42 birth defect cases. We determined that there is no significant difference in the level of BPDE-dG formation between the normal and birth defect groups. This represents the first time to use an LC-MS/MS method to quantify BPDE-dG in human umbilical blood samples. The results indicated that under experimental conditions, BPDE-dG adducts were detected in all the human umbilical cord blood samples from the normal and birth defect groups."

Mass spectrometers are able to perform traditional target analyte identification and quantitation; however, they may also be used within a clinical setting for the rapid identification of bacteria. The causative agent in sepsis is changed over time, and clinical decisions affecting the management of infections are often based on the outcomes of bacterial identification. Therefore, it is essential that such identifications are performed quickly and interpreted correctly. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer is one of the most popular MS instruments used in biology, due to its rapid and precise identification of genus and species of an extensive range of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. Microorganism identification by Mass spectrometry is based on identifying a characteristic spectrum of each species and then matched with a large database within the instrument. The present review gives a contemporary perspective on the challenges and opportunities for bacterial identification as well as a written report of how technological innovation has advanced MS. Future clinical applications will also be addressed, particularly the use of MALDI-TOF MS in the field of microbiology for the identification and the analysis of antibiotic resistance.",Development of biomarkers of genitourinary cancer using mass spectrometry-based clinical proteomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987711,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"Prostate, bladder and kidney cancer are the three most common types of genitourinary cancer in the world. Of these, prostate and bladder cancers are within the top 10 most common cancers in men. Notably, kidney cancer causes no obvious symptoms in the early stages. To satisfy clinical-management requirements, researchers have developed numerous biomarkers by applying proteomic approaches using clinical serum, urine and tissue specimens, as well as cell and animal models. Through application of biomarker pipeline protocols, including discovery, verification and validation phases, and mass-spectrometric based proteomic platforms coupled with multiplexed quantification assays, these studies have led to recent rapid progress in this area. With improvements in mass-spectrometric based proteomic techniques, numerous promising biomarker candidates and marker panels for various clinical purposes have been proposed. Verification of novel protein biomarker candidates is very resource demanding (e.g. on the clinical and laboratory sides). With the support of national consortia, it is now possible to investigate the future clinical use of such biomarker strategies and assess their cost-effectiveness in personalized medicine.",Analytical methods for cholesterol quantification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987710,Journal of food and drug analysis,2019 04 16,"Cholesterol is an important lipid molecule in cell membranes and lipoproteins. Cholesterol is also a precursors of steroid hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. Abnormal levels of cholesterol or its precursors have been observed in various human diseases, such as heart diseases, stroke, type II diabetes, brain diseases and many others. Therefore, accurate quantification of cholesterol is important for individuals who are at increased risk for these diseases. Multiple analytical methods have been developed for analysis of cholesterol, including classical chemical methods, enzymatic assays, gas chromatography (GC), liquid chromatography (LC), and mass spectrometry (MS). Strategy known as ambient ionization mass spectrometry (AIMS), operating at atmospheric pressure, with only minimal sample pretreatments for real time, in situ, and rapid interrogation of the sample has also been employed for quantification of cholesterol. In this review, we summarize the most prevalent methods for cholesterol quantification in biological samples and foods. Nevertheless, we highlight several new technologies, such as AIMS, used as alternative methods to measure cholesterol that are potentially next-generation platforms. Representative examples of molecular imaging of cholesterol in tissue sections are also included in this review article.",The dual role of innate immunity during influenza.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987709,Biomedical journal,2019 04 26,"One of the distinguishing features of the 1918 pandemic is the occurrence of massive, potentially detrimental, activation of the innate immune system in critically ill patients.

A recent hypothesis proposes a prion-like spreading mechanism for this α-synucleinopathy. Early neuropathological deposits occur, among others, in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). This study investigates the anterograde and/or retrograde transmissibility of exogenous α-synuclein inoculated in the right AON of the A53T model of Parkinson's disease and wild-type mice as well as neuronal and glial involvement. Seven experimental groups were established: wild-type injected with tracers; A53T mice injected with either α-synuclein or saline 2 months beforehand; wild-type injected with either α-synuclein or saline 2 months beforehand; and wild-type injected with either α-synuclein or saline 4 months beforehand. Weight and behavioral changes were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry against α-synuclein, NeuN, Iba-1 and GFAP was performed. Volume and marker distributions in the olfactory bulb (OB), AON and piriform cortex were analyzed using unbiased stereology. The behavioral analyses reveal higher levels of hyperactivity in transgenic as compared to wild-type mice. Tract-tracing experiments show that the main contralateral afferent projections to the dorsal AON come from the AON and secondarily from the OB. In saline-injected transgenic animals, α-synuclein expression in the OB and the AON is higher in the left hemisphere than in the right hemisphere, which could be due to basal interhemispheric differences. α-synuclein injection could provoke a significant increase in the left hemisphere of the transgenic mice's OB, compared to saline-injected animals. Neuronal loss was observed in saline-injected transgenic mice relative to the saline-injected wild-type group. There were no overall differences in neuron number following injection of α-synuclein into either wild-type or transgenic mice, however some neuron loss was apparent in specific regions of α-synuclein injected wild-types. Microglia labeling appeared to be correlated with surgery-induced inflammation. Astroglial labeling was higher in transgenic animals, which could be due to endogenous α-synucleinopathy.

Phenotypes and genotypes up to sequence level of 35,775 dairy bulls and cows were used for QTL mapping, and gene expression and genotypes of 131 cows were used to identify eQTL.","Risk factors for death among children 0-59 months of age with moderate-to-severe diarrhea in Manhiça district, southern Mozambique.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987589,BMC infectious diseases,2019 04 23,"Despite major improvements in child survival rates, the number of deaths due to diarrhea remains unacceptably high.

Several clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that aggressive treatment of hypertension in patients with and without CKD lowers the risk of CVD and all-cause mortality, nevertheless the effects of blood pressure (BP) lowering in terms of renal protection or harm remain controversial. Both home and ambulatory BP estimation have shown that patients with CKD display abnormal BP patterns outside of the office and further investigation is required, so as to compare the association of ambulatory versus office BP measurements with hard outcomes and adjust treatment strategies accordingly. Although renin-angiotensin system blockade appears to be beneficial in patients with advanced CKD, especially in the setting of proteinuria, discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibition should be considered in the setting of frequent episodes of acute kidney injury or hypotension while awaiting the results of ongoing trials. In light of the new evidence in favor of renal denervation in arterial hypertension, the indications and benefits of its application in individuals with CKD needs to be clarified by future studies.

Blood pressure (BP) control remains unsatisfactory worldwide. Medical inertia and poor adherence to treatment are among the factors that can partially explain, why BP control rate remains low. The introduction of a method for measuring the degree of adherence to a given medication is now a prerequisite. Complex treatment regimes, inadequate tolerance and frequent replacements of pharmaceutical formulations are the most common causes of poor adherence. In contrast, the use of stable combinations of antihypertensive drugs leads to improved patient adherence. We aim to review the relationships between arterial stiffness, cognitive function and adherence to medication in patients with HTN. Large artery stiffening can lead to HTN. In turn, arterial stiffness induced by HTN is associated with an increased CV and stroke risk. In addition, HTN can induce disorders of brain microcirculation resulting in cognitive dysfunction. Interestingly, memory cognitive dysfunction leads to a reduced adherence to drug treatment. Compliance with antihypertensive treatment improves BP control and arterial stiffness indices.

Samples for B12 were available from 488 children and 464 women, a sub-sample of the nationally representative 1999 NNS. The national overall prevalence of low (<200 pg/mL) and marginal (200 to 300 pg/mL) serum B12 was 25.6% and 21.0%, respectively. Adolescent girls had the lowest serum B12 concentrations (325 ± 308 pg/mL) and the prevalence of deficiency was 40% in pregnant women even using a lower cut-point (<135 pg/mL). Residents of rural areas and the South, population groups with poorest socioeconomic status, and illiterate and indigenous women had the lowest serum B12 Children and women who met dietary recommendations for B12 intake had higher serum B12 than those who did not. Overall 45.9% of intakes fell below the Estimated Adequate Requirement. Dietary B12 intake of children and women was directly correlated with serum B12 (r = 0.18, p < 0.001 and r = 0.11, p = 0.0304).

Hair samples were taken from several points of the occipital scalp. Ca, Na, K and Mg in the hair were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The content of Ca and Na in the hair of obese people (>30.0 kg·m2) was higher (323 mg·kg-1 and 180 mg·kg-1) in comparison with the groups of people with normal body weight and those grade 2 underweight (<16.9 kg·m2): 191 mg·kg-1 and 103 mg·kg-1 respectively. The highest level of K (317 mg·kg-1) was found in the hair of people classed as grade 2 underweight. The body mass index caused no differentiation in the content of Mg in hair. Positive correlations were found between Ca-Na, Ca-Mg and Na-Mg and between the BMI of the subjects and the content of Ca in hair (R = 0.163; p < 0.01) and between the BMI and the content of Na (R = 0.191; p < 0.01).

Additionally groups 3, 4, and 5 received a daily supplement in their drinking water of 20 mg vitamin E, 0.3 mg Se, and a combination of vitamin E and Se (20 mg/ 0.3 mg), respectively, for 30 days. For 3 d subsequently, control group was treated with placebo, and remaining four groups were injected intramuscularly with 100 mg/kg prednisolone. After last administration of prednisolone, 10 rats from each group were killed at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h and the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the levels of GSH and TBARS were measured. GSH-Px, CAT activities and GSH levels decreased starting from 4th hour to 48% and 65% of control levels by 24th hour, respectively and it reincreased to control levels at 48th hour in the prednisolone group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). In addition, prednisolone administration led 2-fold increase in heart TBARS levels at 24th hour (p < 0.001). E vitamins and Se inhibited the increase in heart TBARS and the decrease in antioxidative enzymes levels. Therefore, It is concluded that vitamin E and Se may have a preventive role in decreasing the increase of TBARS caused by prednisolone administration in our study.",Breast milk provides inadequate amounts of vitamin B12 for predominantly breastfed Guatemalan infants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987548,International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Journal international de vitaminologie et de nutrition,2019 04 16,"Vitamin B12 (B12) plays in an important role in the development and function of the brain and nervous system, and adequate B12 status is especially important for the normal development of infants. In previous research conducted in Guatemala City we reported a high prevalence of B12 deficiency in lactating women and their infants 3 and 12 months of age, and low B12 concentrations in breast milk. The objective of this study was to assess predictors of serum B12 concentration in predominantly breastfed Guatemalan infants including intake of B12 from breast milk and other foods. Serum B12, breast milk and other food intakes, anthropometry, morbidity and socioeconomic status were assessed in infants 6.7 ± 0.6 months of age (n = 127, 52% female) in peri-urban Guatemala City. Twenty-four percent of infants had deficient B12 status (serum B12 concentration < 148 pmol/L) and 37% had marginal B12 status (148-220 pmol/L). Serum B12 concentrations were negatively correlated with infants' consumption of energy from breast milk (r = -0.37, p = 0.001), and positively correlated with their total consumption of animal source foods, especially cow's milk (r = 0.40, p = 0.001). Based on previously analyzed breast milk B12 concentrations in a nearby community, breast milk provided < 10% of the recommended daily B12 intake for this age. We conclude that there was a high prevalence of B12 deficiency in these Guatemalan infants by 6 months of age. Serum B12 was higher in infants consuming more cow's milk and lower in those consuming more breast milk.",Food Insecurity is positively related to Dietary Inflammatory Index in Iranian high school girls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987547,International journal for vitamin and nutrition research.

Journal international de vitaminologie et de nutrition,2019 04 29," Oxidative stress is part of the mechanisms involved in ethanol toxicity. We investigated effects of vitamins C (VC), E (VE) and the combination of VC+VE on chronic ethanol-induced toxicity in rat erythrocytes. The following groups were treated for 30 days: control (C), VC (200 mg/kg), VE (200 mg/kg), VC (200 mg/kg) + VE (200 mg/kg), ethanol 4 g/kg, ethanol + VC, ethanol + VE and ethanol + VC + VE. The doses of vitamins and ethanol were selected for per kilogram of animal's body weight. Blood samples collected at the end of treatments were analyzed for erythrocyte osmotic fragility and plasma scavenging activity. The washed erythrocytes were used to determine superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and malondialdeyde (MDA). Ethanol induced erythrocyte fragility (p < 0.001) and increased lipid peroxidation (p < 0.001) in rat erythrocytes. Furthermore, there were significant decreases in plasma scavenging (p < 0.001), SOD (p < 0.001), CAT (p < 0.01) and GPx (p < 0.001) activities in erythrocytes of ethanol-treated animals. Although VC or VE alone restored all of ethanol-induced disturbances to near normal (p > 0.05) but there were still significant differences compared to control animals. Combination therapy completely corrected ethanol-induced erythrocyte fragility, lipid peroxidation and prooxidant/antioxidant imbalance. We showed the beneficial effects of VC and VE combination in decreasing erythrocyte fragility and lipid peroxidation in both ethanol and control groups. Therefore this combination treatment may provide a new potential alternative for prevention of ethanol toxicity which deserves consideration and further examination.",Trauma and anxious attachment influence the relationship between suggestibility and dissociation: a moderated-moderation analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987544,Cognitive neuropsychiatry,2019 05 10,"Hypnotic suggestibility is elevated in the dissociative disorders but the relationship between dissociative tendencies and suggestibility in the general population seems to be constrained by additional factors.

We observed that while anger is understood to be strongly related to moral disapproval of people's actions and character, disgust is not (Studies 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3), and that, in contexts where disgust expressions are thought to coincide somewhat with moral disapproval, part of the reason is that the expression is perceived as anger (Study 4). Expressions of sadness are also construed as communicating anger in such contexts (Study 5).

We aimed to compare the effect of different prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy regimens in bladder recurrence-free survival. From 2000 to 2016, a total of 270 patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy at both institutions were enrolled. Patients were divided into 3 groups: multiple-instillation group, single-instillation group, and no-instillation group. Univariable and multivariable analyses with Cox regression methods were performed to calculate hazard ratios for bladder recurrence using clinicopathologic data, including our different instillation strategies. Sixty-three (23.3%) of 270 patients had subsequent intravesical recurrence. Significantly fewer patients in both the instillation groups had a recurrence compared to in the no-instillation group (13.1% vs 25.4% vs 41.5%, P = .001). Furthermore, there was a significant difference between both the instillation groups ( P = .016). In different subsets of patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma, intravesical chemotherapy, either multiple or single instillation, was a protective factor of bladder recurrence in pT2-4 ( P = .002) and high grade ( P < .0001). Importantly, Kaplan-Meier curves of bladder recurrence-free survival rate were increased observably in multiple-instillation group compared to that in single-instillation group ( P = .053 in pT2-4 subgroup; P = .048 in high-grade subgroup, respectively). On multivariable analysis, intravesical chemotherapy ( P < .001), especially multiple instillations (hazard ratio 0.230; 95% confidence interval 0.110-0.479), was identified an independent predictor of bladder recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, prophylactic intravesical chemotherapy effectively prevents bladder recurrence after nephroureterectomy, especially with multiple instillations, in patients with invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma or at high-grade status.",Effect of Water Precautions on Otorrhea Incidence after Pediatric Tympanostomy Tube: Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987526,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 16,"Tympanostomy with ventilation tube insertion is the most common otologic surgery.

This lesion has long been considered as a compound-related change, with no spontaneous cases reported in the Wistar rat. In addition to routine hematoxylin and eosin stains evaluation, we applied Masson's trichrome staining, Alcian blue-periodic acid-Schiff staining, and OV-6 immunohistochemistry staining. The special staining demonstrated the fibrous component in the interstitium and intestinal metaplasia of the epithelium (presence of goblet cells), while the positive anti-OV-6 reaction indicated the bile duct origin of the epithelium. These results help to confirm the diagnosis of cholangiofibrosis in this case. We report this rare case to alert pathologists that spontaneous cholangiofibrosis does occur in Wistar rats.",Pediatric Tracheostomy Decannulation: 11-Year Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987524,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 16,To determine the successful decannulation rate with a published pediatric tracheostomy decannulation protocol.,Fear of the known: semantic generalisation of fear conditioning across languages in bilinguals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987523,Cognition & emotion,2019 04 16,"While modern theories of emotion emphasize the role of higher-order cognitive processes such as semantics in human emotion, much research into emotional learning has ignored the potential contributions of such processes. This study aimed to determine whether emotional learning affects semantic representations of words independent of perceptual features by assessing whether fear conditioning to a neutral word generalises across languages in bilingual participants. Two sessions differing according to the reinforced language were performed by English-Spanish bilinguals. In each session, a neutral word was reinforced by an electrical shock whereas its equivalent in the other language was never paired with shock. Across two sessions within our sample, we found replicable evidence that fear conditioning consistently transferred to the non-reinforced language as measured by both self-reported fear and electrodermal activity, irrespective of the conditioned language. Our findings extend knowledge about the role of semantic similarity in fear generalisation and highlight the importance of higher-order cognitive processes in human emotions.",Efficacy of HRCT Imaging vs SPECT/CT Scans in the Staging of Malignant External Otitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987522,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 16,The prognosis of patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) depends on the extent of the inflammatory changes in the temporal bone and skull base.

Chemotherapy drugs have been widely used in the anti-hepatoma research. However, low targeting efficiency and serious adverse reaction are their main drawbacks. Liver tumor was proved to have a slightly acidic microenvironment (pH 4.5-5.5) and many glycyrrhetinic-acid-specific binding sites. Therefore, in the present study, the glycyrrhetinic acid- and hydrazone bond-modified micelles were designed. mPEG-HZ-PLA and GA-PEG-PLA copolymer were synthesized to prepare glycyrrhetinic-acid-modified pH-sensitive polymeric micelles (GA-PEG-HZ-PLA). The targeted pharmacokinetics was used to evaluate the effect in hepatoma 22 tumor-bearing mice after the micelles were administered intravenously. The contents of coumarin-6 in blood and tissues were determined through high-performance liquid chromatography using a fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) with coumarin-30 as inner standard. The micelles have shown long-circulation effects and two-department models. In the targeting pharmacokinetics, the relative intake efficiency, targeted efficiency, relative targeting efficiency, and concentration ratio of GA-PEG-HZ-PLA in the tumor were 3.24, 4.04, 3.00, and 2.47, respectively. We have demonstrated that GA-PEG-HZ-PLA was more effectively accumulated in the liver and tumor. Thus, the prepared active-targeted and pH-sensitive micelles modified with glycyrrhetinic acid structure and hydrazone bond are promising tools for effective liver cancer therapy.",Evaluation of comparative soft tissue response to bone void fillers with antibiotics in a rabbit intramuscular model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987506,Journal of biomaterials applications,2019 04 16,"Management of osseous and soft tissue dead space can be a significant challenge in the clinical setting. Calcium sulphate and calcium phosphate-based biomaterials are increasingly being used as alternatives to PMMA for local release of antibiotics, in particular to fill dead space following surgical debridement. This study aims to observe the in-vivo absorption characteristics and tissue response of three commercially available calcium sulphate-based materials combined with gentamicin in an established soft tissue rabbit model. The implant materials (1cc) were placed into four intramuscular sites in 18 New Zealand White rabbits (n = 6). In-life blood samples and radiographs were taken from each animal following implantation. Animals were sacrificed at 0, 1, 7, 21, 42 and 63 days post-operatively (n = 3) and implant sites analysed by micro-computed tomography and histology. Radiographically and histologically, recrystallized calcium sulphate (RCS) absorbed the fastest with complete absorption by day 21. Calcium sulphate/HA composite (CSHA) and Calcium sulphate/calcium carbonate (CSCC) absorbed slower and were detectable at day 63. Residual bead analysis revealed the presence of detectable gentamicin at 24 h and 7 days for CSHA and RCS but none in CSCC. Systemic levels of gentamicin were only detected between 1 h and 24 h. Serological inflammatory cytokine expression for IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β indicated no unusual inflammatory response to the implanted materials. Calcium sulphate materials loaded with gentamicin are effective in resolving a surgically created dead space without eliciting any adverse host response.",Brain Activation Changes During Balance- and Attention-Demanding Tasks in Middle- and Older-Aged Adults With Multiple Sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987505,Motor control,2019 04 16,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to evaluate prefrontal cortex activation differences between older adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy older adults (HOA) during the performance of a balance- and attention-demanding motor task. Ten older adults with MS and 12 HOA underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy recording while talking, virtual beam walking, or virtual beam walking while talking on a self-paced treadmill. The MS group demonstrated smaller increases in prefrontal cortex oxygenation levels than HOA during virtual beam walking while talking than talking tasks. These findings indicate a decreased ability to allocate additional attentional resources in challenging walking conditions among MS compared with HOA. This study is the first to investigate brain activation dynamics during the performance of balance- and attention-demanding motor tasks in persons with MS.",Estimation of overdiagnosis by detection to incidence ratio in cancer screening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987504,Journal of medical screening,2019 04 16,"We aimed to introduce a concept of overdiagnosis with actual formulae.

Fifteen patients underwent clinical and radiological evaluation with average follow-up of 26 months. Parameters assessed were time of surgery, blood loss, segmental kyphosis or lordosis angle, time to solid bony fusion, ambulatory status, and functional outcome. Mean time of surgery was 150 min with mean blood loss of 530 ml. One patient died in early postoperative period. All patients without preoperative neurologic deficit were walking unaided first day postoperatively. Solid bony fusion was demonstrated in 14 patients, on average 7.1 months postoperatively. Functional outcome at the latest follow-up was excellent, good, or fair in 86%. Two failures with recurrent infection were treated with PEEK cage removal and reinstrumentation.

The surgery was performed between 8 and 43 weeks after injury. Intraoperatively, 11 fractures were deemed stable to probing and underwent percutaneous screw fixation only; 14 were unstable and received arthroscopic bone grafting with percutaneous screw fixation. All fractures united. At a mean follow-up of 21 months (range 12-48), the mean Mayo wrist score was 96, and patient-rated wrist evaluation was 4, and the flexion-extension arc was 90% of the contralateral wrist. We conclude that arthroscopy is valuable in the treatment of scaphoid delayed or nonunions and in judging the need for bone grafting. Our data indicate that regardless of cystic formation in the scaphoid, bone grafting is not always necessary. Percutaneous fixation alone is sufficient when scaphoid delayed or nonunions are between 8 weeks and 1 year following injury, without scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse or dorsal intercalated segment instability, and when forceful probing confirms stability of the scaphoid arthroscopically.

Swine sero-convert 2-3 weeks before infection occurs in humans and thus serves as a suitable sentinel for JE surveillance and outbreak prediction in human population. The present study was conducted with the objective of developing a lateral flow assay (LFA) for detecting JEV antibodies in swine sera. Three different formats were tried using recombinant NS1 protein as antigen in order to select the best format. In format I, gold nanoparticles were conjugated with antigen followed by spotting of antigen on NCM as test line and anti-antigen IgG on NCM as control line. In format II, gold nanoparticles were conjugated with antigen followed by spotting of staphylococcal protein A as test line and anti-antigen IgG as control line. Format III used gold nanoparticles conjugated with goat anti-pig IgG followed by spotting of antigen as test line and pig IgG as control line. Amongst the three formats, format II was found to be superior with 100% relative diagnostic sensitivity and 100% relative diagnostic specificity during monsoon and post-monsoon period.

However, due to negative media news seeking for sensation, and sometimes irresponsible producer behaviour, utilisation of food additives generates consumer aversion, thus shopping rejection. The present study examines the factors that influence consumers' motives and attitudes towards the avoidance of food additives. On the basis of a questionnaire survey, a theoretical model was developed and applied by path analysis in three European countries (Hungary, Romania and Spain), respectively. Results suggested that even though the avoidance of food additives (action) can be modelled identically, it can be influenced by different measures based on the country's specific features. For the grounding of the shopping decisions towards the avoidance of food additives, it is important to decrease the perceived risk, to improve consumers' knowledge, as well as to take into consideration the peculiarities of the concerned countries.",Modified Extraperitoneal Uterosacral Ligament Suspension in Preventing Cuff Prolapse Risk after Vaginal Hysterectomy; 4 Clamp Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987482,Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,2019 05 31,"Objectives: The extraperitoneal uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS) can be performed during the removal of the uterus in vaginal hysterectomy to prevent cuff prolapse. In this study, we evaluated the modified extraperitoneal ULS technique in terms of preventing cuff prolapse. Methods/Technique: Forty patients with second and third-stage uterine prolapse who were operated were included in the study. During routine vaginal hysterectomy procedure performed on patients, after sacrouterine ligaments which are the first-bites and uteroovarian and round ligaments which are the last-bites have been sutured and knotted, these ligaments were marked with 4-distinct clamps to make the right and left, upper and lower separation. After vaginal cuff was closed the sutures hanged by the clamps were ligated together, and the cuff tissue was stretched to the apical line. Results: According to the POP-Q classification, 22 patients with stage-2 and 18 patients with stage-3 prolapse were operated. During the 2-year follow-up; 4 patients could not be reached and were excluded from follow-up.

Screening and prevention of patients at risk are the optimal way to reduce the morbi-mortality of this disease. To set-up a preventive approach to preeclampsia (PE), one has to identify using a screening strategy for the population at risk and propose them an appropriate therapeutic intervention that would bear a favorable benefits/risk ratio. While the classical method only considers epidemiological risk factors to set up preventive measures, several authors have set-up complex multiparameter algorithm to detect a population at risk of PE. The new pyramid of pregnancy care integrates an early clinic allowing the assessment of biophysical and biochemical markers combined with maternal factors. Such an approach can identify pregnancies that are at high risk of PE and reduce its prevalence using low-aspirin regimen initiated as early as possible in the population at risk.",A qualitative review of parents' perspectives on the value of CAEP recording in influencing their acceptance of hearing devices for their child.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987480,International journal of audiology,2019 06 10,"Objective: To obtain a parental perspective on how audiological tests, including recording cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEP) to speech sounds, influenced their uptake of hearing devices for their infant. Design: A focus group was established by parents of hearing-impaired children. A facilitator explored how audiology tests influenced their understanding and management of hearing loss in their child and their acceptance of hearing aids or cochlear implant referral. The views were transcribed and thematic analysis was used to understand key topics. Study samples: Eight sets of parents participated. Their children had been enrolled in an audiology pathway that included CAEP testing. The sample included six children who were aided, one child who was going through the implant assessment and one child who was implanted. Results: Parents reported that it was important for them to understand the test results because this influenced acceptance of hearing aids and cochlear implant assessments. Seven sets of parents had not understood ABR results, while six reported that CAEPs had helped them to understand their child's hearing and need for intervention. Conclusion: Compliance with early hearing aid use and referral for cochlear implant depends upon parents' understanding of their infant's hearing loss by including CAEPs in the audiology pathway.","Prevalence, comorbidity, quality of life and use of services of obsessive-compulsive disorder and subthreshold obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the general adult population of Greece.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987479,International journal of psychiatry in clinical practice,2019 04 16,"We aimed to describe the epidemiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related subthreshold symptoms in the general population of Greece and to assess the comorbidity, use of health services and impact on quality of life of these syndromes in the general population.",BRAF status as a predictive factor for response in isolated limb perfusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987478,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",2019 04 26,"Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) is a treatment option for unresectable in-transit melanoma metastases of the extremities.

Adult,2019 04 16,"The neurobehavioral syndrome of hemispatial neglect, which can result from insults such as stroke, brain tumor, or head injury, has most frequently been described as occurring for the left-side of hemispace following lesions to the right hemisphere. While right hemispatial neglect/inattention may occur following left hemisphere lesions as well, it has received limited attention in the scientific literature. The present case describes an inpatient neuropsychological evaluation with a 67-year-old, African American man presenting with right hemispatial neglect following resection of a large glioblastoma in the left occipitotemporoparietal region. The evaluation included a clinical interview, neurobehavioral status examination, and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results documented consistent evidence of right hemispatial neglect across the administered tests, which could not be attributed to an established right visual field cut. Neuropsychological testing also revealed nearly global deficits in complex visuoperception, posterior/receptive language, memory, and complex attention/executive functioning abilities, while basic attention remained intact. Further remarkable findings of this case included color anomia and transcortical sensory aphasia. Findings from the case are discussed in the context of the preexisting literature on hemispatial neglect and the theoretical specialization of the parietal lobe for spatial attention/awareness.",The Making of an Addiction: Examining Psychological Determinants of Prescription Stimulant Abuse among College Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987453,Health communication,2019 04 16,"Diagnoses of attention-deficit-disorders and stimulant prescriptions to treat these disorders (e.g., Adderall) are on the rise.

This study examined the following PVTs in the Advanced Clinical Solutions (ACS) package to determine their utility alone and in concert: Word Choice Test (WCT), Reliable Digit Span (RDS), and Logical Memory Recognition (LMR). Ninety-three veterans participated in clinical neuropsychological evaluations to determine presence of cognitive impairment; 25% of the performances were deemed invalid via criterion PVTs. Classification accuracy of the ACS measures was assessed via receiver operating characteristic curves, while logistic regressions determined utility of combining these PVTs. The WCT demonstrated superior classification accuracy compared to the two embedded measures of the ACS, even in veterans with cognitive impairment. The two embedded measures (even when used in concert) exhibited inadequate classification accuracy. A combined model with all three ACS PVTs similarly demonstrated little benefit of the embedded indicators over the WCT alone. Results suggest the ACS WCT has utility for detecting invalid performance in a clinical sample with likely cognitive impairment, though the embedded ACS measures (RDS and LMR) may have limited incremental utility, particularly in individuals with cognitive impairment.",Ethical consideration of the research proposal and the informed-consent process: An online survey of researchers and ethics committee members in Thailand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987450,Accountability in research,2019 05 23,"Researchers designing and conducting studies using human data should consider the values and principles of ethical conduct. Research ethics committees (RECs) typically evaluate the ethical acceptability of research proposals. Sometimes, differences arise between how researchers and RECs interpret ethical principles, and how they decide what constitutes ethical conduct. This study aimed to explore the opinions of these two groups about the importance of core ethical issues in the proposal and in the informed-consent process. An anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to a target population in health-related academic/research institutes across Thailand; 219 researchers and 72 REC members participated. Significantly, more REC members than researchers attributed the highest importance to three core ethical considerations - risk/benefit, vulnerability, and confidentiality/privacy. For the informed-consent process, significant differences were found for communication of risks, decision-making authority for consent, process for approaching study participants, and availability of a contact for study deviations/violations. The different ratings indicate differences in the groups' perspectives on ethical principles, which may affect focal congruence on ethical issues in the proposal. Communication of these findings should help close gaps between REC and researcher perceptions.

Two samples of youth that presented to an out-patient clinic (n = 121, M = 10.59, SD = 2.78, range = 6-16; n = 92, M = 10.07, SD = 2.76, range = 6-16) were administered well-established performance measures of academic and intellectual functioning, along with a measurement of anxiety. In an exploratory analysis, the interaction between worry and physiological anxiety was the only significant effect, robust across all academic composites and intelligence indices. Physiological anxiety had a differential relationship with academic achievement domains (and processing speed) dependent on levels of worry; low-levels of worry were predictive of improved scores at high, but not low-, levels of physiological anxiety. In contrast, high-, but not low-, levels of physiological anxiety were associated with lower scores when accompanied by elevated levels of worry when predicting intelligence indices.",Genetic Variants Associated with Cancer Therapy-Induced Cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987448,Circulation,2019 04 16,Cancer therapy-induced cardiomyopathy (CCM) is associated with cumulative drug exposures and pre-existing cardiovascular disorders.

The performance characteristics of such SLM devices based on liquid crystal (LC) and digital micromirror device (DMD) technologies, in particular, has developed to the point where they are compatible with increasingly sensitive instrumental applications, for example, Raman spectroscopy. Spatial light modulators provide additional flexibility, from modulation of the laser excitation (including multiple laser foci patterns), manipulation of microscopic samples (optical trapping), or selection of sampling volume (adaptive optics or spatially offset Raman spectroscopy), to modulation in the spectral domain for high-resolution spectral filtering or multiplexed/compressive fast detection.

The ES ATR FT-IR method is evaluated with non-volatile and semi-volatile organic and inorganic compounds dissolved in pure organic solvents or organics in a mixture with water. The technique demonstrates the capability for rapid solvent evaporation from dilute solutions, facilitating the creation of thin films that allow ATR FT-IR to generate transmission-mode-like spectra. Electrospray ATR FT-IR with multiple reflections displays a linear response ( R2 = 0.95-0.99) in absorbance with the deposited mass and instrumental detection limit < 100 ng, which demonstrates potential for quantitative applications. The method is applicable when crystalline substances are present, even though the formation of particles restricts the upper limit of mass loadings relative to substances forming homogeneous films.

These drugs are critical for the practice of medicine in applications, including kidney dialysis, cardiopulmonary bypass, and in the management of venous thromboembolism. Currently, these drugs are derived from livestock, primarily porcine intestine and less frequently bovine intestine and bovine lung. The worldwide dependence on the pig as a single dominant animal species has made the supply chain for this critical drug quite fragile, leading to the search for other sources of these drugs, including the expanded use of bovine tissues. A number of laboratories are now also examining the similarities between heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins prepared from porcine and ovine tissues. This study was designed to compare low-molecular-weight heparin prepared from ovine heparin through chemical β-elimination, a process currently used to prepare the low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin. Using top-down, bottom-up, and compositional analyses as well as bioassays, low-molecular-weight heparin derived from ovine intestine was shown to closely resemble enoxaparin. Moreover, the compositions of daughter low-molecular-weight heparins prepared from three unfractionated ovine parent heparins were compared. Ovine enoxaparins had similar molecular weight and in vitro anticoagulant activities as Lovenox. Some disaccharide compositional, oligosaccharide composition at the reducing and nonreducing ends and intact chain compositional differences could be observed between porcine enoxaparin and ovine low-molecular-weight heparin. The similarity of these ovine and porcine heparin products suggests that their preclinical evaluation and ultimately clinical assessment is warranted.",Learning about Aboriginal health and wellbeing at the postgraduate level: novel application of the Growth and Empowerment Measure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987426,Rural and remote health,2019 05 29,"Public health education strives to transform and empower students to engage in policy and practice improvement.

The cathode of the BPE was electrochemically synthesized by 3D porous copper foam, followed by decorating with nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheet and ruthenium nanoparticles. As an alternative, we employed carboxylate-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for immobilization of the primary antibody (Ab1) and utilized the L@MIL-53(Fe)-NH2 conjugated to secondary antibody (Ab2) as a signaling probe and coreaction accelerator.

In contrast to its planar analogue IECIO, i-IEICO possesses an obviously twisted backbone, leading to significant hypsochromic shift in film absorption, slight enhancement in solution extinction coefficient, and significantly elevated molecular energy level. Benefited from these features, i-IEICO is matched well with two wide band gap polymer donor materials (J52 and PBDB-T) both in absorption spectra and molecular energy levels. Relative to the planar-molecule IEICO-based devices, the open-circuit voltage ( VOC), short-circuit current density, and fill factor of the i-IEICO-based devices are simultaneously improved, giving rising to a 10.48% (with J52) and 8.79% (with PBDB-T) power conversion efficiency, respectively. Moreover, J52:i-IEICO device exhibits a high VOC of 0.96 V accompanied by a small energy loss of 0.64 eV, which can be further improved to 1.01 V and 0.59 eV for the PBDB-T-based device. The obtained VOC of i-IEICO-based devices are among one of the highest values of either J52 or PBDB-T-based binary devices, suggesting the effectiveness of main-chain twisted strategy coupled with end-group modification to achieve highly efficient nonfullerene acceptors with low energy loss and high VOC."

During osteoblast differentiation, Runx2 is weakly expressed in uncommitted mesenchymal cells, and its expression is upregulated in preosteoblasts, reaches the maximal level in immature osteoblasts, and is down-regulated in mature osteoblasts. Runx2 enhances the proliferation of osteoblast progenitors by directly regulating Fgfr2 and Fgfr3. Runx2 enhances the proliferation of suture mesenchymal cells and induces their commitment into osteoblast lineage cells through the direct regulation of hedgehog (Ihh, Gli1, and Ptch1), Fgf (Fgfr2 and Fgfr3), Wnt (Tcf7, Wnt10b, and Wnt1), and Pthlh (Pthr1) signaling pathway genes, and Dlx5. Runx2 heterozygous mutation causes open fontanelle and sutures because more than half of the Runx2 gene dosage is required for the induction of these genes in suture mesenchymal cells.

Clinical efficacy was defined as disease activity score below 10. Candidate genetic variants (TPMT rs1142345, rs1800460, rs1800462, GSTA1 rs3957357, GSTM1, and GSTT1 deletion) were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and pyrosequencing. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed effects models for the association between the candidate variants and the pharmacological variables (azathioprine doses and metabolites). Azathioprine metabolites were measured in 257 samples (median 2 per patient, inter-quartile range IQR 1-3). Clinical efficacy at the first evaluation available resulted better in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease patients (88.0% versus 52.5% responders, p = 0.0003, linear mixed effect model, LME).

In this paper, we propose an online IMU self-calibration method for visual-inertial systems equipped with a low-cost inertial sensor. The goal of our method is to concurrently perform 3D pose estimation and online IMU calibration based on optimization methods in unknown environments without any external equipment. To achieve this goal, we firstly develop a novel preintegration method that can handle the IMU intrinsic parameters error propagation. Then, we frame IMU calibration problem into general factors so that we can easily integrate the factors into the current graph-based visual-inertial frameworks and jointly optimize the IMU intrinsic parameters as well as the system states in a big bundle.

Subsequently, core-shell piezoelectric nanofiber yarns were prepared by twining the yarns around a conductive thread. To create the outer electrode layers, the core-shell piezoelectric nanofiber yarns were braided with conductive thread. Core-shell piezoelectric nanofiber yarns with external electrodes were then directly stitched onto the fabric. In bending tests, the output voltages were investigated according to the total length, effective area, and stitching interval of the piezoelectric yarns. Stitching patterns of the piezoelectric yarns on the fabric were optimized based on these results. The output voltages of the stitched piezoelectric yarns on the fabric were improved with an increase in the pressure, and the output voltage characteristics were investigated according to various body movements of bending and pressing conditions.","Marine Bacterium Vibrio sp.

Only two years later, in 2016, it was also recorded in the turkey and broiler sectors in Ireland and Spain. These S. Derby isolates were characterised as members of the multilocus sequence type (MLST) profile 71 (ST71). For the first time, we characterise by whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis a panel of 90 S. Derby ST71 genomes to understand the routes of transmission of this emerging pathogen within the poultry/turkey food trade. Selected panel included strains isolated as early as 2010 in five leading European g countries for turkey meat production. Twenty-one of the 90 genomes were extracted from a public database-Enterobase. Five of these originated from the United States (n=3), China (n=1) and Taiwan (n=1) isolated between 1986 and 2016. A phylogenomic analysis at the core-genome level revealed the presence of three groups. The largest group contained 97.5% of the European strains and included both, turkey and human isolates that were genetically related by an average of 35 ± 15 single nucleotide polymorphism substitutions (SNPs).

Different mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), Isocitrate Dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), and Tumor Supressor P53 (TP53) and deletion of Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) were detected both in cell lines and tumor samples. In addition, other mutations in TP53 and the amplification of Mouse Double Minute 2 homolog (MDM2) arose during cell culture in CDS17 cells. Whole exome sequencing analysis of CDS17, T-CDS17, and matched patient samples confirmed that cell lines kept the most relevant mutations of the tumor, uncovered new mutations and revealed structural variants that emerged during in vitro/in vivo growth. Altogether, this work expanded the panel of clinically and genetically-annotated chondrosarcoma lines amenable for in vivo studies and cancer stem cell (CSC) characterization. Moreover, it provided clues of the genetic drift of chondrosarcoma cells during the adaptation to grow conditions.",Therapeutic Approaches with Intravitreal Injections in Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Current Drugs and Potential Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987401,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"The present review focuses on recent clinical trials that analyze the efficacy of intravitreal therapeutic agents for the treatment of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), such as neuroprotective drugs, and complement inhibitors, also called immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory agents. A systematic literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials published prior to January 2019. Patients affected by dry AMD treated with intravitreal therapeutic agents were included. Changes in the correct visual acuity and reduction in geographic atrophy progression were evaluated. Several new drugs have shown promising results, including those targeting the complement cascade and neuroprotective agents. The potential action of the two groups of drugs is to block complement cascade upregulation of immunomodulating agents, and to prevent the degeneration and apoptosis of ganglion cells for the neuroprotectors, respectively. Our analysis indicates that finding treatments for dry AMD will require continued collaboration among researchers to identify additional molecular targets and to fully interrogate the utility of pluripotent stem cells for personalized therapy.",Nanoindentation of Graphene-Reinforced Silica Aerogel: A Molecular Dynamics Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987400,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"In the present work, we performed nanoindentation tests using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on graphene, native silica aerogels, and single- and multi-layered graphene-reinforced silica aerogel nanocomposites. This work mainly focused on the two aspects of nanoindentation simulations: first, the resultant indentation force-depth curves, and second, the associated mechanical deformation behavior. We found that in the single-layer graphene-reinforced silica aerogel nanocomposite, the indentation resistance was four-fold that of native silica aerogels. Moreover, the combined system proved to be higher in stiffness compared to the individual material. Furthermore, the indentation resistance was increased significantly as we proceeded from single- to two-layered graphene-reinforced silica aerogel nanocomposites. The results of the study provide a detailed understanding of the mechanical behavior during the indentation tests of nanocomposites, which helps to design advanced nanoscale multi-layered materials."

We used a k-mean cluster analysis based on the contribution of 21 grain-based foods to total energy intake of adults in Canada to find the dietary patterns of GBFs. Cluster analyses rendered seven dietary patterns including: 'other bread', 'cake and cookies', 'pasta', 'rice', 'mixed', 'white bread', and finally 'whole wheat and whole-grain bread'. 'No grain' and 'rice' consumers had lower intakes of dietary fibre, folate, iron and calcium, which are the nutrients of public health concern in Canada. Adults consuming a 'mixed grain' dietary pattern had a greater daily intake of calcium, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, and vitamin B6 than those in the 'no grain' dietary pattern. We also observed that a considerable proportion of individuals clustered in the 'rice' group are immigrants and belong to households with lower income levels.",Tuning the Transdermal Delivery of Hydroquinone upon Formulation with Novel Permeation Enhancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987387,Pharmaceutics,2019 06 10,"Hydroquinone (HQ) is an anti-hyperpigmentation agent with poor physicochemical stability. HQ formulations are currently elaborated by compounding in local pharmacies. Variability in the characteristics of HQ topical formulations can lead to remarkable differences in terms of their stability, efficacy, and toxicity. Four different semisolid O/W formulations with 5% HQ were prepared using: i) Beeler´s base plus antioxidants (F1), ii) Beeler´s base and dimethyl isosorbide (DMI) as solubiliser (F2), iii) olive oil and DMI (F3), and iv) Nourivan®, a skin-moisturising and antioxidant base, along with DMI (F4). Amongst the four formulations, F3 showed the greatest physicochemical stability with less tendency to coalescence but with marked chromatic aberrations. An inverse correlation was established by multivariate analysis between the mean droplet size in volume and the steady-state flux, which explains why F3, with the smallest droplet size and the most hydrophobic excipients, exhibited the highest permeation across both types of membranes with enhancement ratios of 2.26 and 5.67-fold across Strat-M® and mouse skin, respectively, compared to F1. It is crucial to understand how the HQ is formulated, bearing in mind that the use of different excipients can tune the transdermal delivery of HQ significantly.",Uncovering Missing Heritability in Rare Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987386,Genes,2019 06 10,"The problem of 'missing heritability' affects both common and rare diseases hindering: discovery, diagnosis, and patient care. The 'missing heritability' concept has been mainly associated with common and complex diseases where promising modern technological advances, like genome-wide association studies (GWAS), were unable to uncover the complete genetic mechanism of the disease/trait. Although rare diseases (RDs) have low prevalence individually, collectively they are common. Furthermore, multi-level genetic and phenotypic complexity when combined with the individual rarity of these conditions poses an important challenge in the quest to identify causative genetic changes in RD patients. In recent years, high throughput sequencing has accelerated discovery and diagnosis in RDs. However, despite the several-fold increase (from ~10% using traditional to ~40% using genome-wide genetic testing) in finding genetic causes of these diseases in RD patients, as is the case in common diseases-the majority of RDs are also facing the 'missing heritability' problem. This review outlines the key role of high throughput sequencing in uncovering genetics behind RDs, with a particular focus on genome sequencing. We review current advances and challenges of sequencing technologies, bioinformatics approaches, and resources.",Effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Apples Enriched-Dark Chocolate on Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A Randomized Cross-Over Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987385,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Endothelial dysfunction has been associated to cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

This is not surprising since CO₂ is an important nutrient for plant matter, being directly involved in photosynthesis. However, it is also known that the conditions which have accompanied this increase in atmospheric CO₂ concentration have also had significant effects on other environmental factors. It is possible that these other effects may emerge as limiting factors which could act to prevent plant growth. This may involve complex interactions between prevailing sunlight and water conditions, variable temperatures, the availability of essential nutrients and the type of synthetic pathway for the plant species. The issue of concern to this investigation is if we should be worried about a possible shift in the C₃-C₄ paradigm driven by changes in the atmospheric CO₂ concentration, or if some other factor, such as water scarcity, is much more relevant within a 30-year time frame. If an opinion is needed on what will have the worst effect on the survival of the planet between the scarcity of water or the reduced efficiency of C₃ plants to sequester CO₂, the issue of water is the more incisive.",Perinatal Lead (Pb) Exposure and Cortical Neuron-Specific DNA Methylation in Male Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987383,Genes,2019 06 10,": Lead (Pb) exposure is associated with a wide range of neurological deficits. Environmental exposures may impact epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, and can affect neurodevelopmental outcomes over the life-course. Mating mice were obtained from a genetically invariant C57BL/6J background agouti viable yellow Avy strain. Virgin dams (a/a) were randomly assigned 0 ppm (control), 2.1 ppm (low), or 32 ppm (high) Pb-acetate water two weeks prior to mating with male mice (Avy/a), and this continued through weaning. At age 10 months, cortex neuronal nuclei were separated with NeuN⁺ antibodies in male mice to investigate neuron-specific genome-wide promoter DNA methylation using the Roche NimbleGen Mouse 3x720K CpG Island Promoter Array in nine pooled samples (three per dose). Several probes reached p-value < 10-5 , all of which were hypomethylated: 12 for high Pb (minimum false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.16, largest intensity ratio difference = -2.1) and 7 for low Pb (minimum FDR = 0.56, largest intensity ratio difference = -2.2). Consistent with previous results in bulk tissue, we observed a weak association between early-life exposure to Pb and DNA hypomethylation, with some affected genes related to neurodevelopment or cognitive function. Although these analyses were limited to males, data indicate that non-dividing cells such as neurons can be carriers of long-term epigenetic changes induced in development.",Current Status and Perspectives on Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987382,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the manufacturing paradigm in recent years due to the possibility of creating complex shaped three-dimensional parts which can be difficult or impossible to obtain by conventional manufacturing processes. Among the different additive manufacturing techniques, wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is suitable to produce large metallic parts owing to the high deposition rates achieved, which are significantly larger than powder-bed techniques, for example. The interest in WAAM is steadily increasing, and consequently, significant research efforts are underway. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the most significant achievements in WAAM, highlighting process developments and variants to control the microstructure, mechanical properties, and defect generation in the as-built parts; the most relevant engineering materials used; the main deposition strategies adopted to minimize residual stresses and the effect of post-processing heat treatments to improve the mechanical properties of the parts. An important aspect that still hinders this technology is certification and nondestructive testing of the parts, and this is discussed. Finally, a general perspective of future advancements is presented.",Social Inequalities in Environmental Resources of Green and Blue Spaces: A Review of Evidence in the WHO European Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987381,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 09,"Residential green and blue spaces and their potential health benefits have received increasing attention in the context of environmental health inequalities, because an unequal social distribution of these resources may contribute to inequalities in health outcomes. This systematic review synthesised evidence of environmental inequalities, focusing on availability and accessibility measures of green and blue spaces. Studies in the World Health Organisation (WHO) European Region published between 2010 and 2017 were considered for the review. In total, 14 studies were identified, where most of them (n = 12) analysed inequalities of green spaces. The majority had an ecological study design that mostly applied deprivation indices on the small area level, whereas cross-sectional studies on the individual level mostly applied single social measures. Ecological studies consistently showed that deprived areas had lower green space availability than more affluent areas, whereas mixed associations were found for single social dimensions in cross-sectional studies on the individual level. In order to gain more insights into how various social dimensions are linked to the distribution of environmental resources within the WHO European Region, more studies are needed that apply comparable methods and study designs for analysing social inequalities in environmental resources.","Combined Targeting of Estrogen Receptor Alpha and XPO1 Prevent Akt Activation, Remodel Metabolic Pathways and Induce Autophagy to Overcome Tamoxifen Resistance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987380,Cancers,2019 06 10,"A majority of breast cancer specific deaths in women with ERα (+) tumors occur due to metastases that are resistant to endocrine therapy. There is a critical need for novel therapeutic approaches to resensitize recurrent ERα (+) tumors to endocrine therapies. The objective of this study was to elucidate mechanisms of improved effectiveness of combined targeting of ERα and the nuclear transport protein XPO1 in overcoming endocrine resistance. Selinexor (SEL), an XPO1 antagonist, has been evaluated in multiple late stage clinical trials in patients with relapsed and /or refractory hematological and solid tumor malignancies. Our transcriptomics analysis showed that 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), SEL alone or their combination induced differential Akt signaling- and metabolism-associated gene expression profiles. Western blot analysis in endocrine resistant cell lines and xenograft models validated differential Akt phosphorylation. Using the Seahorse metabolic profiler, we showed that ERα-XPO1 targeting changed the metabolic phenotype of TAM-resistant breast cancer cells from an energetic to a quiescent profile. This finding demonstrated that combined targeting of XPO1 and ERα rewired the metabolic pathways and shut down both glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways that would eventually lead to autophagy. Remodeling metabolic pathways to regenerate new vulnerabilities in endocrine resistant breast tumors is novel, and given the need for better strategies to improve therapy response in relapsed ERα (+) tumors, our findings show great promise for uncovering the role that ERα-XPO1 crosstalk plays in reducing cancer recurrences.",Characteristics of Instrumental Methods to Describe and Assess the Recrystallization Process in Ice Cream Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987379,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Methods of testing and describing the recrystallization process in ice cream systems were characterized.

Hesperidin has demonstrated its antioxidant activity, but few studies focus on its influence on intensive training. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of hesperidin on the oxidant/antioxidant status of lymphoid tissues after an intensive training program. Wistar rats were trained for five weeks (five days per week), including two exhaustion tests plus three trainings per week. During this period, animals were orally administrated with 200 mg/kg of hesperidin or vehicle (three days per week). The oxidative status was determined before, immediately after and 24 h after an additional exhaustion test. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by peritoneal macrophages, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities in spleen, thymus and liver, and hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity (GPx) were assessed. Hesperidin prevented an increase in ROS production induced by the additional exhaustion test. Likewise, hesperidin avoided a decrease in SOD and catalase activities in the thymus and spleen that was found after the additional exhaustion test. The antioxidant effects of hesperidin were associated with a higher performance in the assessed training model. These results suggest that hesperidin, acting as an antioxidant, can prevent oxidative stress induced by exercise and improve exercise performance.",Dynamic TMT-Based Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of Critical Initiation Process of Totipotency during Cotton Somatic Embryogenesis Transdifferentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987365,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"The somatic embryogenesis (SE) process of plants, as one of the typical responses to abiotic stresses with hormone, occurs through the dynamic expression of different proteins that constitute a complex regulatory network in biological activities and promotes plant totipotency. Plant SE includes two critical stages: primary embryogenic calli redifferentiation and somatic embryos development initiation, which leads to totipotency. The isobaric labels tandem mass tags (TMT) large-scale and quantitative proteomics technique was used to identify the dynamic protein expression changes in nonembryogenic calli (NEC), primary embryogenic calli (PEC) and globular embryos (GEs) of cotton. A total of 9369 proteins (6730 quantified) were identified; 805, 295 and 1242 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) were identified in PEC versus NEC, GEs versus PEC and GEs versus NEC, respectively. Eight hundred and five differentially abundant proteins were identified, 309 of which were upregulated and 496 down regulated in PEC compared with NEC. Of the 295 DAPs identified between GEs and PEC, 174 and 121 proteins were up- and down regulated, respectively. Of 1242 differentially abundant proteins, 584 and 658 proteins were up- and down regulated, respectively, in GEs versus NEC. We have also complemented the authenticity and accuracy of the proteomic analysis. Systematic analysis indicated that peroxidase, photosynthesis, environment stresses response processes, nitrogen metabolism, phytohormone response/signal transduction, transcription/posttranscription and modification were involved in somatic embryogenesis. The results generated in this study demonstrate a proteomic molecular basis and provide a valuable foundation for further investigation of the roles of DAPs in the process of SE transdifferentiation during cotton totipotency.",Management of Congenital Heart Disease: State of the Art-Part II-Cyanotic Heart Defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987364,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this review management of the most common cyanotic congenital heart defects (CHDs) was discussed; the management of acyanotic CHD was reviewed in Part I of this series. While the need for intervention in acyanotic CHD is by and large determined by the severity of the lesion, most cyanotic CHDs require intervention, mostly by surgery. Different types of tetralogy of Fallot require different types of total surgical corrective procedures, and some may require initial palliation, mainly by modified Blalock-Taussig shunts. Babies with transposition of the great arteries with an intact ventricular septum as well as those with ventricular septal defects (VSD) need an arterial switch (Jatene) procedure while those with both VSD and pulmonary stenosis should be addressed by Rastelli procedure. These procedures may need to be preceded by prostaglandin infusion and/or balloon atrial septostomy in some babies. Infants with tricuspid atresia require initial palliation either with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or banding of the pulmonary artery and subsequent staged Fontan (bidirectional Glenn and fenestrated Fontan with extra-cardiac conduit). Neonates with total anomalous pulmonary venous connection are managed by anastomosis of the common pulmonary vein with the left atrium either electively in non-obstructed types or as an emergency procedure in the obstructed types. Babies with truncus arteriosus are treated by surgical closure of VSD along with right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit. The other defects, namely, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, double-outlet right ventricle, double-inlet left ventricle and univentricular hearts largely require multistage surgical correction. The currently existing medical, trans-catheter and surgical techniques to manage cyanotic CHD are safe and effective and can be performed at a relatively low risk.",Genomic Analyses of Bifidobacterium moukalabense Reveal Adaptations to Frugivore/Folivore Feeding Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987363,Microorganisms,2019 06 10,"Despite the essential role of Bifidobacterium in health-promoting gut bacteria in humans, little is known about their functions in wild animals, especially non-human primates. It is difficult to determine in vivo the function of Bifidobacterium in wild animals due to the limited accessibility of studying target animals in natural conditions. However, the genomic characteristics of Bifidobacterium obtained from the feces of wild animals can provide insight into their functionality in the gut. Here, we analyzed the whole genomes of 12 B. moukalabense strains isolated from seven feces samples of wild western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), three samples of wild central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and two samples of wild forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) in Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, Gabon. In addition, we analyzed the fecal bacterial communities of six wild western lowland gorillas by meta 16S rRNA gene analyses with next generation sequencing. Although the abundance of the genus Bifidobacterium was as low as 0.2% in the total reads, a whole genome analysis of B. moukalabense suggested its contribution digestion of food and nutrition of frugivore/folivore animals. Specifically, the whole genome analysis indicated the involvement of B. moukalabense in hemicellulose degradation for short chain fatty acid production and nucleic acid utilization as nitrogen resources. In comparison with human-associated Bifidobacterium spp., genes for carbohydrate transport and metabolism are not conserved in these wild species. In particular the glycosidases, which are found in all 12 strains of B. moukalabense, were variably detected, or not detected, in human-associated species.",Exosomal miRNAs as Novel Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers for Cancer Chemopreventive Agent Early Stage Treatments in Chemically Induced Mouse Model of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987362,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Chemopreventive agent (CPA) treatment is one of the main preventive options for lung cancer.

This study sought to investigate the association between health factors and undiagnosed hypertension among hypertensive Chinese and to assess the urban-rural disparity. A total of 6455 diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertensive adults were included. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to examine the association between health factors and undiagnosed hypertension. The urban-rural disparity was investigated through stratified analysis. Undiagnosed hypertension was prevalent (28.8%), and rural residents were more likely to have undiagnosed hypertension compared to their urban counterparts (30.1% versus 24.7%). Physical examination, healthcare service utilization, body mass index, chronic diseases, headache, and self-rated health status were found to be significantly associated with undiagnosed hypertension. In addition, healthcare service utilization, underweight in body mass index, headache, and self-rating health status were associated with undiagnosed hypertension among the rural sample but not in the urban sample. Undiagnosed hypertension was significantly related to health factors among hypertensive Chinese. The findings provided implications for future hypertension prevention programs. The use of physical examination (e.g., blood pressure measurements) is recommended; special attention may be given to those who are underweight and self-rate their health as good and fair, as they are more likely to be neglected.",Tomato Twisted Leaf Virus: A Novel Indigenous New World Monopartite Begomovirus Infecting Tomato in Venezuela.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987360,Viruses,2019 06 10,"Begomoviruses are one of the major groups of plant viruses with an important economic impact on crop production in tropical and subtropical regions. The global spread of its polyphagous vector, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, has contributed to the emergence and diversification of species within this genus. In this study, we found a putative novel begomovirus infecting tomato plants in Venezuela without a cognate DNA-B component. This begomovirus was genetically characterized and compared with related species. Furthermore, its infectivity was demonstrated by agroinoculation of infectious clones in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The name Tomato twisted leaf virus (ToTLV) is proposed. ToTLV showed the typical genome organization of the DNA-A component of New World bipartite begomoviruses. However, the single DNA component of ToTLV was able to develop systemic infection in tomato and N. benthamiana plants, suggesting a monopartite nature of its genome. Interestingly, an additional open reading frame ORF was observed in ToTLV encompassing the intergenic region and the coat protein gene, which is not present in other closely related begomoviruses. A putative transcript from this region was amplified by strand-specific reverse transcription-PCR. Along with recent studies, our results showed that the diversity of monopartite begomoviruses from the New World is greater than previously thought.",Plasma Malondialdehyde and Risk of New-Onset Diabetes after Transplantation in Renal Transplant Recipients: A Prospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987358,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a frequent complication in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Although oxidative stress has been associated with diabetes mellitus, data regarding NODAT are limited. We aimed to prospectively investigate the long-term association between the oxidative stress biomarker malondialdehyde (measured by high-performance liquid chromatography) and NODAT in an extensively phenotyped cohort of non-diabetic RTR with a functioning graft ≥1 year. We included 516 RTR (51 ± 13 years-old, 57% male). Median plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was 2.55 (IQR, 1.92-3.66) µmol/L. During a median follow-up of 5.3 (IQR, 4.6-6.0) years, 56 (11%) RTR developed NODAT. In Cox proportional-hazards regression analyses, MDA was inversely associated with NODAT, independent of immunosuppressive therapy, transplant-specific covariates, lifestyle, inflammation, and metabolism parameters (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.83 per 1-SD increase; p < 0.01). Dietary antioxidants intake (e.g., vitamin E, α-lipoic acid, and linoleic acid) were effect-modifiers of the association between MDA and NODAT, with particularly strong inverse associations within the subgroup of RTR with relatively higher dietary antioxidants intake. In conclusion, plasma MDA concentration is inversely and independently associated with long-term risk of NODAT in RTR. Our findings support a potential underrecognized role of oxidative stress in post-transplantation glucose homeostasis.",The Effect of Maternal Intact Protein- and Amino Acid-Based Diets on Development of Food Intake Regulatory Systems and Body Weight in Dams and Male Offspring of Wistar Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987357,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"The objective of this study is to examine the effect of maternal and weaning intact protein- and amino acid-based diets on regulation of food intake, intake regulatory hormones, and body weight in dams and their male offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were allocated to two groups (n = 12) and were fed either an intact protein diet (IPD) or mixed amino acid diet (AAD) from day 3 of gestation throughout gestation and lactation. Male offspring were weaned to either an IPD or AAD for 18 weeks. Food intake (FI) and body weight (BW) were measured weekly. Results: In dams, the AAD group had lower FI and BW in the post-partum period compared with the IPD group. In pups born to AAD dams, birth weight and BW were lower. However, the percentage of fat and lean mass were not affected. Food intake was influenced by maternal diet and was higher in pups born to IPD dams throughout post-weaning. Short-term FI in response to protein preloads was lower in pups born to AAD dams in 1 h. Fasting plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, and ghrelin were not influenced by either maternal or weaning diet. However, peptide YY (PYY) was higher in pups born to IPD dams at weaning. Conclusions: The physicochemical properties of proteins fed during pregnancy and lactation had determining effects on the body weight and development of food intake regulatory systems in offspring. Maternal AAD resulted in lower BW in dams and lower birth weight and post-weaning BWs in pups compared with maternal IPD which was consistent with their lower FI.",Faecal Microbiota Are Related to Insulin Sensitivity and Secretion in Overweight or Obese Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987356,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"Emerging evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiota in glucose metabolism and diabetes. Few studies have examined the associations between the faecal microbiome and insulin sensitivity and secretion using gold-standard methods in high-risk populations prior to diabetes onset. We investigated the relationships between faecal microbiota composition (16S rRNA sequencing) and gold-standard measures of insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp) and insulin secretion (intravenous glucose tolerance test) in 38 overweight or obese otherwise healthy individuals. Genus Clostridium was positively associated with insulin sensitivity, and genera Dialister and Phascolarctobacterium were related to both insulin sensitivity and secretion. Insulin sensitivity was associated with a higher abundance of Phascolarctobacterium and lower abundance of Dialister. Those with higher insulin secretion had a higher abundance of Dialister and lower abundance of Bifidobacterium, compared to those with lower insulin secretion. Body mass index (BMI) was positively correlated with Streptococcus abundance whereas Coprococcus abundance was negatively correlated to BMI and percent body fat. These results suggest that faecal microbiota is related to insulin sensitivity and secretion in overweight or obese adults. These correlations are distinct although partially overlapping, suggesting different pathophysiological pathways. Our findings can inform future trials aiming to manipulate gut microbiome to improve insulin sensitivity and secretion and prevent type 2 diabetes."
