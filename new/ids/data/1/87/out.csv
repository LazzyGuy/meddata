About 70% of the world's 1.4 billion people who are extremely poor live in rural areas. The problem is that the majority of healthcare providers prefer to serve in urban areas. Only a comprehensive and systematic approach can address these inequities. India, the largest democratic republic in the world, possesses 2.4% of the world's land area and supports 16% of the world's population. According to census 2011, 68.84% of population resides in rural areas. Nearly 86% of all the medical visits in India are made by rural inhabitants with a majority still traveling more than 100 km to avail healthcare facility, of which 70%-80% is born out of pocket landing them in poverty. A country's approach must systematically and simultaneously address legal coverage and rights, health worker shortages, extension of healthcare protection, and quality of care. Only then can equitable access for all be fully achieved. Those living in rural areas have access to health protection and services that meet the criteria of availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality. Family medicine as a broad specialty has its role from womb till tomb. Family medicine is defined as a specialty of medicine which is concerned with providing comprehensive care to individuals and families by integrating biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences. As an academic discipline, it includes comprehensive healthcare services, education, and research. A family doctor provides primary and continuing care to the entire family within the communities; addresses physical, psychological, and social problems; and coordinates comprehensive healthcare services with other specialists, as needed. The practitioners in family medicine can play an important role in providing healthcare services to the suffering humanity. The general practitioner's responsibility in Medicare includes management of emergencies, treatment of problems relating to various medical and surgical specialties, care of entire family in its environment, appropriate referrals, and follow-up. He or she is the first-level contact for the patients and his or her family. Family medicine is the ideal solution to growing rural healthcare challenges.

We established the 9-site N-carbamylglutamate Consortium (NCGC) in order to conduct two randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of NCG in acute hyperammonemia of PA, MMA, CPSD and OTCD. Conducting clinical trials is challenging in any disease, but poses unique barriers and risks in the ultra-rare disorders.

The ruling marked the next round of the dispute around agricultural genetic engineering in Europe. Many of the pros and cons presented in this dispute are familiar from the debate around the first generation of genetic engineering techniques. The current wave of enthusiasm for the new genetic engineering methods, with its claim to make good on the failed promises of the previous wave, seems to point more to an admission of failure of the last generation of genetic engineering than to a true change of paradigm. Regulation is being portrayed as a ban on research and use, which is factually incorrect, and the judges of the European Court of Justice are being defamed as espousing ""pseudoscience"". Furthermore, this highly polarised position dominates the media reporting of the new techniques and the court's ruling. Advocates of the new genetic engineering techniques appear to believe that their benefits are so clear that furnishing reliable scientific evidence is unnecessary. Meanwhile, critics who believe that the institution of science is in a serious crisis are on the increase not just due to the cases of obvious documented scientific misconduct by companies and scientists, but also due to the approach of dividing the world into those categorically for or against genetic engineering. In this construct of irreconcilable opposites, differentiations fall by the wayside. This article is a response to this one-sided and biased reporting, which often has the appearance of spin and lacks journalistic ethics that require journalists to report on different positions in a balanced and factual manner instead of taking positions and becoming undeclared advocates themselves.",A unified approach for including non-extractable residues (NER) of chemicals and pesticides in the assessment of persistence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613459,Environmental sciences Europe,2019 01 09,"All chemicals form non-extractable residues (NER) to various extents in environmental media like soil, sediment, plants and animals. NER can be quantified in environmental fate studies using isotope-labeled (such as 14C or 13C) tracer compounds. Previous NER definitions have led to a mismatch of legislation and state of knowledge in research: the residues are assumed to be either irreversibly bound degradation products or at least parts of these residues can be released. In the latter assumption, soils and sediments are a long-term source of slowly released residues. We here present a conceptual experimental and modeling approach to characterize non-extractable residues and provide guidance how they should be considered in the persistence assessment of chemicals and pesticides. Three types of NER can be experimentally discriminated: sequestered and entrapped residues (type I), containing either the parent substance or xenobiotic transformation products or both and having the potential to be released, which has indeed been observed. Type II NER are residues that are covalently bound to organic matter in soils or sediments or to biological tissue in organisms and that are considered being strongly bound with very low remobilization rates like that of humic matter degradation rates. Type III NER comprises biogenic NER (bioNER) after degradation of the xenobiotic chemical and anabolic formation of natural biomolecules like amino acids and phospholipids, and other biomass compounds. We developed the microbial turnover to biomass (MTB) model to predict the formation of bioNER based on the structural properties of chemicals. Further, we proposed an extraction sequence to obtain a matrix containing only NER. Finally, we summarized experimental methods to distinguish the three NER types. Type I NER and type II NER should be considered as potentially remobilizable residues in persistence assessment but the probability of type II release is much lower than that of type I NER, i.e., type II NER in soil are ""operationally spoken"" irreversibly bound and can be released only in minute amounts and at very slow rates, if at all. The potential of remobilization can be evaluated by chemical, physical and biological methods. BioNER are of no environmental concern and, therefore, can be assessed as such in persistence assessment. The general concept presented is to consider the total amount of NER minus potential bioNER as the amount of xenoNER, type I + II. If a clear differentiation of type I and type II is possible, for the calculation of half-life type I NER are considered as not degraded parent substance or transformation product(s). On the contrary, type II NER may generally be considered as (at least temporarily) removed. Providing proof for type II NER is the most critical issue in NER assessment and requires additional research. If no characterization and additional information on NER are available, it is recommended to assess the total amount as potentially remobilizable. We propose our unified approach of NER characterization and evaluation to be implemented into the persistence and environmental hazard assessment strategies for REACH chemicals and biocides, human and veterinary pharmaceuticals, and pesticides, irrespective of the different regulatory frameworks.",Inflammatory Markers and Severity of Intracerebral Hemorrhage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613458,Cureus,2019 01 09,"Background and purpose The pathogenesis of brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage is thought to be due to mechanical damage followed by ischemic, cytotoxic, and inflammatory changes in the underlying and surrounding tissue.In recent years, there has been a greater research interest into the various inflammatory biomarkers and growth factors that are secreted during intracerebral hemorrhage. The biomarkers investigated in this study are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP), homocysteine (Hcy), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The aim of this study was to further investigate the effects of these biomarkers in predicting the acute severity outcome of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients with spontaneous ICH with TNF alpha, CRP, VEGF, and Hcy levels drawn on admission. Forty-two patients with spontaneous ICH with at least one of the above labs were included in the study. Primary outcomes included death, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission, early neurologic decline (END), and hemorrhage size. Secondary outcomes included GCS on discharge, ICH score, functional outcome risk stratification scale of intracerebral hemorrhage (FUNC score), change in hemorrhage size, need for surgical intervention, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Results Forty-two patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were analyzed, 12 patients (28.5%) required surgical intervention, and four patients (9.5%) died. Only low VEGF serum values were found to predict mortality. TNF alpha, CRP, Hcy, and VEGF levels in our patients with ICH were not found to predict early neurologic decline and were not correlated with GCS on admission, initial hemorrhage size, change in hemorrhage size, need for surgical intervention, ICH score, FUNC score, midline shift, and length of ICU stay. CRP and Hcy were elevated in 58% and 31% of patients tested, respectively. GCS on admission and ICH score were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion After careful statistical review of the data obtained from this patient population, only low VEGF values were found to be a significant predictor of mortality. However, elevated CRP and Hcy levels were associated with a non-significant trend in hemorrhage size and mortality suggesting that CRP and Hcy-lowering therapies may decrease hemorrhagic stroke risk and severity.",Quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment Versus Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome Criteria for Predicting Organ Dysfunction and Mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613455,Cureus,2019 01 09,"The International Consensus Definition for Sepsis and Septic Shock Task Force has recently developed new methods to determine whether a patient is at risk for end organ failure after he has been suspected to have sepsis. One of the newest measures developed is a quick Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and it is used to identify patients who are at risk of sepsis outside the intensive care unit. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) score has previously been the standard for determining a patient's sepsis risk and prognosis for future mortality. With the development of these new tools, it is imperative to compare qSOFA to SIRS in order to determine which method is best and under which circumstances. We conclude that according to evidence currently available, qSOFA has limited use for patients in the intensive care unit at the time of evaluation for predicting mortality and organ dysfunction. Furthermore, qSOFA outranks SIRS for patients in the emergency department except for SIRS delivering positive results more quickly.",Risk Factors for Dysphagia Following a Cervical Fusion in a Trauma Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613451,Cureus,2019 01 09,"Background Dysphagia following a cervical fusion is a known complication; however, this has not been examined in the trauma population. We sought to identify risk factors that can be optimized in this population. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review on consecutive trauma patients who underwent a cervical fusion from 2014 to 2017 at a single institution with multiple surgeons. We included patients more than 18-years-old who were admitted through the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute cervical injury and underwent a cervical fusion during the same admission. We excluded patients who remained intubated postoperatively or underwent a tracheostomy. The primary outcome was dysphagia as evaluated by a bedside swallow test on postoperative day one by the nursing staff. This was followed by a standardized assessment performed by a speech therapist on postoperative day two in some cases. Variables of interest included sex, age, mechanism of injury, surgical approach, cervical levels, and Charlson comorbidity index. Univariate analysis was also utilized. Results Sixty patients met the study criteria. Nineteen patients (31.7%) developed dysphagia postoperatively. Mechanical falls were the most common injury mechanism (80%) and most surgical procedures were performed on the subaxial cervical spine (68.3%). Comparing the dysphagia groups, there was no significant difference among the confounding variables. Patients with dysphagia had an increased length of stay (10.6 ± 6.7 vs. 7.4 ± 3.1, p = 0.056) and were more likely to have had an anterior vs. posterior cervical fusion (63.2% vs. 34.1%, p = 0.056). Conclusions We found no statistically significant risk factors leading to postoperative dysphagia. The objective of this pilot is to find the baseline dysphagia rate and the potential modifiable factors in this unique patient population undergoing cervical fusion procedures.",Medical Ultrasound in the Evaluation of the Carpal Tunnel: A Critical Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613449,Cureus,2019 01 09,"The use of medical ultrasound as an imaging modality in the evaluation of the carpal tunnel syndrome has been growing. Technical progress and the introduction of new, high-quality devices and ultra-high frequency transducers with smaller dimensions have led to a better quality of acquired images and the development of new examination methodologies. The sonographic method has a number of advantages: available, non-invasive, cheaper, and allows an easier and faster evaluation and diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, along with the possibility to assess various parameters of the median nerve, including its size, blood flow, and mobility. In addition, medical ultrasound may be used to detect anatomical variations and space-occupying lesions in the carpal tunnel to monitor the therapeutic response in patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome and to evaluate median nerve injuries.

Immunotherapy has shown remarkable potential in induction of sustained remission in refractory malignancies. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a newer treatment methodology approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The chimeric pairing of an antigen receptor with the T-cell receptor (TCR) intracellular signaling domain allows cluster of designation 8 (CD8) cytotoxic T-cells to target cell surface makers independent of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) activation. Another essential feature which contributes to the broad applicability of CARs and expanding their potential targets is their ability to bind not only to proteins but also to carbohydrate and glycolipid structures. Their antigen-specific and targeted immune responses have shown promising outcomes in clinical trials particularly involving B-cell malignancies and solid tumors. High remission rates and low percentages of relapses have caused a paradigm shift in the treatment of relapsed or refractory cancers. Challenges include side effects such as cytokine release syndrome, on-target off-tumor toxicities, and replication of its success in treating solid tumors. The burden of side effects and hefty cost of treatment are major obstacles which could hinder its progress globally. Nevertheless, ongoing research would only result in a maximized therapeutic potential in addition to more patient- and cost-friendly treatment. In this review, we aim to provide the readers an overview of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, a relatively new advancement in the world of immuno-oncology and thereby also discussing its advantages, side effects and future challenges.","Structured, Small-group Hands-on Teaching Sessions Improve Pre-clerk Knowledge and Confidence in Point-of-care Ultrasound Use and Interpretation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613446,Cureus,2019 01 09,"Introduction Many undergraduate medical education (UME) programs have begun adopting point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) curricula, reflecting the increasing ubiquity of this technique across medical specialties. The structures of international PoCUS curricula have been extensively studied. However, the efficacy of these curricula to increase knowledge and confidence in PoCUS is less well-studied. We investigated whether a structured, small-group PoCUS teaching session consisting of pre-defined learning objectives, an introductory presentation, and a mandatory hands-on scanning component would increase pre-clerk knowledge of and confidence in PoCUS theory, use, and interpretation. Methods A pre-post study was designed to assess changes in pre-clerk knowledge and confidence in PoCUS theory, use, and interpretation. Pre-clerks were recruited from the Hamilton campus of the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster University. Pre-clerks were organized into four groups, with an average group size of seven learners. Two preceptors each taught two groups. Sessions included an introductory PowerPoint presentation and one-on-one preceptor-guided practice in identifying abdominal and genitourinary structures using PoCUS. Student responses on pre- and post-intervention surveys were analyzed to identify changes in knowledge and confidence. Student satisfaction with the teaching session was assessed from self-reported levels of agreement with satisfaction statements. The strengths and areas of improvement for the teaching sessions were identified from open-ended survey responses. Results Data from 27 students indicated a significant improvement in knowledge test scores (p < .05), with no significant differences between groups (F(3,23) = 0.64, p = n.s.) or between students with different preceptors (p = n.s.). Students' confidence in PoCUS use and interpretation improved significantly (p < .05 for both), with no significant differences between groups (F(3,23) = 0.70, p = n.s. and F(3,23) = 0.32, p = n.s., respectively) or between students with different preceptors (p = n.s. for both). Improvements in knowledge of and confidence in PoCUS use were significantly correlated (r = .44, p < .05). All of the students agreed that they liked the instruction, content, and structure of the teaching session. The most frequently cited strengths of the teaching sessions were the mandatory individual practice time per student, individualized instruction from and interactions with preceptors, and the small group structure of the sessions. Conclusion This study provides novel evidence that a structured, small-group teaching session featuring a didactic presentation, defined learning objectives, and mandatory hands-on learning can effectively teach introductory PoCUS knowledge and skills to pre-clerks and increase student confidence. Future studies will investigate the retention and application of PoCUS knowledge and skill throughout clerkship and early residency training to determine if this teaching model can facilitate longitudinal PoCUS learning and competency as well as improved diagnostic capabilities as students advance through undergraduate medical training.","""Irritable Hip"": Diagnosis in the Emergency Department. A Descriptive Study Over One Year.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613443,Cureus,2019 01 09,"Background A 'limping child' commonly presents to the emergency department (ED), often without a history of trauma. It is important that serious underlying pathology is ruled out before a diagnosis of benign irritable hip (IH). The aetiology of IH is not well understood and there may be geographical and seasonal variation. The aim of this study was to determine the basic epidemiology of IH in the Glasgow Population. Methods A retrospective analysis was carried out of all children discharged from the Glasgow Children's Emergency Department from January to December 2016. Relevant discharge codes were determined and patient records screened. Any patient who did not have a discharge code had their presenting complaint and medical record screened. Results A total of 354 patients were diagnosed with IH, of which 319 and 189 were in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde and City of Glasgow catchment areas, respectively. The majority of these patients (n = 254) were diagnosed clinically. The incidence of IH was 177.7 per 100,000 children with a boy:girl ratio of 1.9:1 (209:110). The mean age of presentation was 3.5 years and the recurrence rate was 5.9% (n = 18). There was an increased incidence in spring (n = 111), especially in March (n = 42) and April (n = 40). There was no incidence variation or influence discernible by social deprivation. Conclusion In this population, IH has: (i) an atypical age profile (age distribution shift to younger), (ii) no marked association with social deprivation (in contrast to other studies), and (iii) a 'spring preponderance'. We suggest that most cases can safely be managed in the ED without recourse to further investigations or speciality referral.",Biochemical and growth responses of silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) to sodium chloride and calcium chloride.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613440,PeerJ,2019 01 09,"The present research investigated the response of silver maple (Acer saccharinum L.) to salt treatment. The short- and long-term effects of NaCl and CaCl2 treatments on plant fitness characteristics (growth parameters, leaf chlorophyll content) and biochemical stress-coping mechanisms (proline accumulation as well as enzymatic activities) were examined. We found that the silver maple response to salt stress strictly depended on salt type and dose-calcium chloride was less toxic than sodium chloride, but high concentrations of both salts negatively influenced plant growth. The accumulation of proline, slight changes in the activity of superoxide dismutase and marked changes in catalase and peroxidase activities in the roots and leaves indicated complexity of the plant response. It was also shown that after one year, enzymatic parameters were restabilized, which indicates plant recovery, but the reduced mass of seedlings suggests that one year is not enough to cope with the prolonged cyclic salt stress, both resulting from NaCl and CaCl2 application. Therefore, seedlings of silver maple should be considered as moderately susceptible to salinity. Hence, it is recommended to use silver maple on non-de-iced urban areas, while planting on often de-iced roads should be avoided."

How do we manage more than 4,000 improvement teams globally? The leaders of our improvement programs manage such efforts as though they are second-nature, without pointing to the specific skills and strategies needed to manage thousands of teams. This paper was developed to capture the lessons, considerations, and insights shared in discussions with leaders on the USAID ASSIST Project, including country Chiefs of Party and Regional Directors. More specifically, this paper seeks to describe what is involved in scaling up and managing large numbers of improvement teams. Through focus group discussions and individual interviews, participants discussed the key skills, strategies, and lessons needed to successfully manage large numbers of teams on the USAID ASSIST Project. We concluded that the six key components in managing large numbers of teams are 1) leadership; 2) management structures and capacities; 3) clear and open communication; 4) shared learning, collaboration, and support; 5) ownership, engagement, and empowerment; and 6) partnerships. We further analyzed these six components as being interrelated to one another based on the relationship between culture, strategy, and technique in implementing quality improvement activities.",Neuraxial anesthesia for postpartum tubal ligation at an academic medical center.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613393,F1000Research,2019 05 21,"Background: Use of an in situ epidural catheter has been suggested to be efficient to provide anesthesia for postpartum tubal ligation (PPTL). Reported epidural reactivation success rates vary from 74% to 92%. Predictors for reactivation failure include poor patient satisfaction with labor analgesia, increased delivery-to-reactivation time and the need for top-ups during labor. Some have suggested that this high failure rate precludes leaving the catheter in situ after delivery for subsequent reactivation attempts. In this study, we sought to evaluate the success rate of neuraxial techniques for PPTL and to determine if predictors of failure can be identified. Methods: After obtaining IRB approval, a retrospective chart review of patients undergoing PPTL after vaginal delivery from July 2010 to July 2016 was conducted using CPT codes, yielding 93 records for analysis. Demographic, obstetric and anesthetic data (labor analgesia administration, length of epidural catheter in epidural space, top-up requirements, time of catheter reactivation, final anesthetic technique and corresponding doses for spinal and epidural anesthesia) were obtained. Results: A total of 70 patients received labor neuraxial analgesia. Reactivation was attempted in 33 with a success rate of 66.7%. Patient height, epidural volume of local anesthetic and administered fentanyl dose were lower in the group that failed reactivation. Overall, spinal anesthesia was performed in 60 patients, with a success rate of 80%. Conclusions: Our observed rate of successful postpartum epidural reactivation for tubal ligation was lower than the range reported in the literature. Our success rates for both spinal anesthesia and epidural reactivation for PPTL were lower than the generally accepted rates of successful epidural and spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery. This gap may reflect a lower level of motivation on behalf of both the patients and anesthesia providers to tolerate ""imperfect"" neuraxial anesthesia once fetal considerations are removed.",Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors of children: new genetic entities and new ancillary testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613391,F1000Research,2019 03 06,"Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors comprise a morphologically diverse and biologically variable group of neoplasms that affect a wide age range.

This led Benditt to propose that the atherosclerotic lesion was a smooth muscle neoplasm, similar to the leiomyomata seen in the uterus of most women. Although the observation of clonality has been confirmed many times, interest in the idea that atherosclerosis might be a form of neoplasia waned because of the clinical success of treatments for hyperlipemia and because animal models have made great progress in understanding how lipid accumulates in the plaque and may lead to plaque rupture. Four advances have made it important to reconsider Benditt's observations. First, we now know that clonality is a property of normal tissue development. Second, this is even true in the vessel wall, where we now know that formation of clonal patches in that wall is part of the development of smooth muscle cells that make up the tunica media of arteries. Third, we know that the intima, the ""soil"" for development of the human atherosclerotic lesion, develops before the fatty lesions appear. Fourth, while the cells comprising this intima have been called ""smooth muscle cells"", we do not have a clear definition of cell type nor do we know if the initial accumulation is clonal. As a result, Benditt's hypothesis needs to be revisited in terms of changes in how we define smooth muscle cells and the quite distinct developmental origins of the cells that comprise the muscular coats of all arterial walls. Finally, since clonality of the lesions is real, the obvious questions are do these human tumors precede the development of atherosclerosis, how do the clones develop, what cell type gives rise to the clones, and in what ways do the clones provide the soil for development and natural history of atherosclerosis?",Beyond transcription factors: roles of mRNA decay in regulating gene expression in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613385,F1000Research,2019 03 06,"Gene expression is typically quantified as RNA abundance, which is influenced by both synthesis (transcription) and decay. Cytoplasmic decay typically initiates by deadenylation, after which decay can occur through any of three cytoplasmic decay pathways. Recent advances reveal several mechanisms by which RNA decay is regulated to control RNA abundance. mRNA can be post-transcriptionally modified, either indirectly through secondary structure or through direct modifications to the transcript itself, sometimes resulting in subsequent changes in mRNA decay rates. mRNA abundances can also be modified by tapping into pathways normally used for RNA quality control. Regulated mRNA decay can also come about through post-translational modification of decapping complex subunits. Likewise, mRNAs can undergo changes in subcellular localization (for example, the deposition of specific mRNAs into processing bodies, or P-bodies, where stabilization and destabilization occur in a transcript- and context-dependent manner). Additionally, specialized functions of mRNA decay pathways were implicated in a genome-wide mRNA decay analysis in Arabidopsis. Advances made using plants are emphasized in this review, but relevant studies from other model systems that highlight RNA decay mechanisms that may also be conserved in plants are discussed."

Local examination showed multiple erythematous nodules and plaques with discharge in the right leg, and active sinus was not determined.",Rapidly progressive neurologic decline and morbilliform rash presenting in a patient with lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613373,Clinics and practice,2019 01 09,"A 67-year-old male with past medical history of mantle cell lymphoma and atrial fibrillation presented with a truncal rash, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and confusion. Within three days of presentation, his condition rapidly deteriorated with the onset of diffuse flaccid paralysis, aphasia, and severe alteration in mental status. Initial results from serum studies, lumbar puncture, magnetic resonance imaging, and electroencephalogram were not diagnostic. However, on the ninth day after initial presentation, the West Nile Virus (WNV) immunoglobulin M antibody returned positive from the cerebrospinal fluid. West Nile Virus encephalitis is endemic worldwide, and is the most common viral encephalitis in the United States. WNV presents in a variety of ways, and the recognition by physicians is crucial due to the estimated 2-12% mortality rate and significant longterm morbidity of neuroinvasive disease. The initial management and long term prognosis are points of ongoing research. This case represents a particularly profound example of neuroinvasive WNV. Our patient made a significant recovery after his initial presentation with aggressive supportive care, however still suffers from bilateral lower extremity weakness more than a year later.",Free-field evoked auditory brainstem responses in cochlear implant users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613372,Audiology research,2019 01 09,"The importance of binaural cues in auditory stream formation and sound source segregation is widely accepted. When treating one ear with a cochlear implant (CI) the peripheral auditory system gets partially replaced and processing delays get added potentially, thus important interaural time differences get altered. However, these effects are not fully understood, leaving a lack of systematic binaural fitting strategies with respect to an optimal binaural fusion. To get new insights into such alterations, we suggest a novel method of free-field auditory brainstem evoked responses (ABRs) analysis in CI users. This method does not bypass the technically induced intrinsic delays of the sound processor while leaving the whole electrode array active, thus the most natural way of stimulation is provided. We compared the ABRs collected of 12 CI users and 12 normal hearing listeners using two different stimuli (chirp, click) at four different intensities each. We analyzed the ABRs using the average of 2000 trials as well as a single trial analysis and found consistent results in the ABRs' amplitudes and latencies, as well as in single trial relationships between both groups. This method provides a new perspective into the natural CI users' ABRs and can be useful in future research regarding binaural interaction and fusion.","FISH-based karyotyping of Pelmatohydraoligactis (Pallas, 1766), Hydraoxycnida Schulze, 1914, and H.magnipapillata Itô, 1947 (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613371,Comparative cytogenetics,2019 01 09,"An account is given of the karyotypes of Hydramagnipapillata Itô, 1947, H.oxycnida Schulze, 1914, and Pelmatohydraoligactis (Pallas, 1766) (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa, Hydridae). A number of different techniques were used: conventional karyotype characterization by standard staining, DAPI-banding and C-banding was complemented by the physical mapping of the ribosomal RNA (18S rDNA probe) and H3 histone genes, and the telomeric (TTAGGG)

This is the first chromosomal mapping of H3 in hydras.",Tubulin couples death receptor 5 to regulate apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613368,Oncotarget,2019 01 09,"Activation of death receptor 5 (DR5) to induce apoptosis in cancer cells is an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. However, many tumor cell lines and primary tumors are resistant to DR5 targeted agents including recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and anti-DR5 agonistic antibodies. Here we identify tubulin proteins - primarily consisting of α and β subunits folded into microtubule polymers - as a crucial modulator of DR5 mediated apoptosis. Using affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry, we found that DR5 interacts with both α- and β-tubulin proteins in cancer cells. Pharmacological disruption of microtubules increased DR5 protein expression and subsequently sensitized the cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Similar results were observed by selectively silencing tubulin transcript using small RNA interference. We also demonstrate that tubulin/microtubule blockade augments TRAIL induced apoptosis by stabilizing DR5 protein. Together, our results link the tubulin/microtubule network to the stringent regulation of DR5 mediated apoptosis, which could lead to potential therapeutic strategies to enhance cancer therapy efficacy.",Target sequencing of cancer-related genes in early esophageal squamous neoplasia resected by endoscopic resection in Japanese patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613367,Oncotarget,2019 01 09,"Next generation sequencing (NGS) has revealed a great deal about cancer-related somatic changes in esophageal squamous cell neoplasia; however, the changes in the very early stages remain unclear.",Targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human osteosarcoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613366,Oncotarget,2019 01 09,"Aberrant activation of Wnt signaling has been implicated in human osteosarcoma, which may provide a genetic vulnerability that can be targeted in osteosarcoma treatment. To test whether Wnt activation is necessary for osteosarcoma growth, colony formation, invasion, and metastasis, we treated human osteosarcoma cells with a small molecule inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin, PRI-724, which suppresses Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription. We found increased protein levels of endogenous active-β-catenin in five human osteosarcoma cell lines. Treatment with PRI-724 was sufficient to inhibit human osteosarcoma 143B and SJSA-1 cell proliferation. Suppressed Wnt signaling was confirmed by decreased protein levels of the Wnt target Cyclin D1. Furthermore, we revealed significant inhibitory effects on cell migration, invasion, and colony formation in the human osteosarcoma cells. Using deposited data from next generation sequencing studies, we analyzed somatic mutations and gene expression of components in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We found somatic mutations and upregulated gene expression of many components in the Wnt/ β-catenin pathway, indicating activated Wnt signaling. Taken together, our results illustrate the critical role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in human osteosarcoma pathogenesis and growth, as well as the therapeutic potential of Wnt inhibitors in the treatment of human osteosarcoma.",POU4F2/Brn-3b transcription factor is associated with survival and drug resistance in human ovarian cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613365,Oncotarget,2019 02 16,"The development of drug resistance following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin (cis) and paclitaxel (pax) contributes to high morbidity and mortality in ovarian cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such changes are not well understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the Brn-3b transcription factor was increased in different ovarian cancer cells including SKOV3 and A2780 following treatment with cis and pax. Furthermore, sustained increases in Brn-3b were associated with survival in drug resistant cells and correlated with elevated HSP27 expression. In contrast, targeting Brn-3b for reduction using short interfering RNA (siRNA) also resulted in attenuated HSP27 expression. Importantly, blocking Brn-3b expression with siRNA in SKOV3 cells was associated with reduced cell numbers at baseline but also increased cell death after further treatment, indicating sensitization of cells. Similar results were obtained in the metastatic IP1 cell line derived from ascites of mice bearing SKOV3 tumours. These findings suggest that increased Brn-3b may confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in ovarian cancer cells by regulating key target genes such as HSP27 and that targeting Brn-3b may provide a novel mechanism for treatment of drug resistant ovarian cancers.",ZNF350 promoter methylation accelerates colon cancer cell migration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613364,Oncotarget,2019 01 09,"Diversification of transcriptomic and epigenomic states may occur during the expansion of colorectal cancers. Certain cancer cells lose their epithelial characters and gain mesenchymal properties, known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and they aggressively migrate into the non-tumorigenic extracellular matrix. In this study, we isolated a subpopulation with accelerated baseline motility (MG cells) and an immotile one (non-MG cells) from a colon cancer cell line (HCT116). Gene expression signatures of the MG cells indicated that this subpopulation was likely an EMT hybrid. The MG cells substantially lost their migratory properties after treatment with a methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, suggesting a role of DNA methylation in this process. Global transcriptome assays of both types of cells with or without 5-azacytidine treatment identified 640 genes, whose expression might be methylation-dependently down-regulated in the MG cells. Global methylation analysis revealed that 35 out of the 640 genes were hyper-methylated in the MG cells. Among them, we focused on the anti-oncogene ZNF350, which encodes a zinc-finger and BRCA1-interacting protein. Notably, ZNF350 knockdown accelerated migration of the non-MG cells, while overexpression of ZNF350 in the MG cells significantly impaired their migration. Finally, pyrosequence analysis together with dual luciferase assays of serially truncated fragments of the ZNF350 promoter (-268 to +49 bp) indicated that three hyper-methylated sites were possibly responsible for the basal promoter activity of ZNF350. Taken together, our results suggest that hyper-methylation of the ZNF350 proximal promoter may be one of the crucial determinants for acquiring increased migratory capabilities in colon cancer cells.",Expression and potential role of cellular retinol binding protein I in psoriasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613363,Oncotarget,2019 01 09,"Psoriasis is a diffuse chronic skin disorder characterized from accelerated epidermal turnover and inflammatory cell infiltrate. Retinoids influence keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation as well as inflammatory response. Cellular retinol binding protein (CRBPI) regulates intracellular vitamin A bioavailability and contributes to maintain skin homeostasis. The aim of present study was to investigate the expression of CRBPI and its role in the pathogenesis of skin psoriasis. Immunohistochemistry revealed more diffuse and increased CRBPI expression in all epidermal layers of human psoriatic lesions except in the stratum corneum. An imiquimod-induced psoriatic-like model documented the increase of skin lesional area and severity index score as well as of the severity of microscopic features as parakeratosis, papillomatosis and spongiosis in CRBPI-knockout compared to wild-type mice, associated to the increased keratinocyte CK17 and Ki-67 expression and the reduction of CK1, CRABPII and RXRα. Gene array of imiquimod-induced psoriatic skin documented the greater up-regulation of EGF/PDGF-related genes and down-regulation of EGR1 and pro-inflammatory IL-related genes in CRBPI-knockout compared to wild-type mice. Finally, CRBPI transfection in HaCaT cells increased AKT and NF-κB-related genes and proteins and down-regulated IL-2, IL-6 and IL-8 pro-inflammatory signalling. Although not recognized as a psoriatic susceptibility gene in our cohort of patients, the present data strongly supported the potential role of CRBPI to sustain keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation and to counteract pro-inflammatory genes expression in psoriatic lesions."

Here we show that MCoTI-II, a 34-amino acid cyclic peptide found in the seeds of red gac (Momordica cochinchinensis), is an inhibitor of KLK4. By grafting a preferred KLK4 cleavage sequence into MCoTI-II, we produced a highly potent KLK4 inhibitor (Ki = 0.1 nM) that displayed 100,000-fold selectivity over related KLKs and the ability to penetrate cells. Additionally, by substituting positively charged noncontact residues in this compound, we produced a potent and selective KLK4 inhibitor that does not penetrate cells. The inhibitors were shown to be nontoxic to human cells and stable in human serum. These KLK4 inhibitors provide useful chemical tools to further define the role(s) of both intracellular and extracellular KLK4 in prostate cancer cell lines and disease models.",NQO1-Selective Activated Prodrug of Triptolide: Synthesis and Antihepatocellular Carcinoma Activity Evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613335,ACS medicinal chemistry letters,2019 01 09,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. Due to its poor response to conventional chemotherapy drugs, the prognosis for its survival is the worst. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is an attractive anticancer target due to its overexpression in HCC. Although triptolide (TP) possesses potent antitumor activity, its clinical practice is greatly limited due to its general toxicities and narrow therapeutic window. Herein, we develop an NQO1-selective activated TP analog, named CX-23, which exhibited antiproliferation of HepG2 over normal hepatocytes in vitro. In vivo study shows that CX-23 can not only prevent the hepatocellular carcinoma progression but also migrate the liver and kidney toxicity. These findings indicate that NQO1 may serve as a targeted delivery system to release an antitumor reagent and that CX-23 may be a promising lead for developing targeted antihepatocellular carcinoma drugs.",Adaptable Small Ligand of CYP1 Enzymes for Use in Understanding the Structural Features Determining Isoform Selectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613334,ACS medicinal chemistry letters,2019 01 09,"Although several families of compounds have been identified as scaffolds for inhibitors of the CYP1 family, the isoform selectivity determining structural features has not been fully clarified at the molecular interaction level.

Remarkably, human O-GlcNAcase (hOGA) and human β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (HsHex) possess the same catalytic mechanism but play different physiological actions in vivo. In this Letter, we aim to improve the inhibitory potency and selectivity of previously reported thioglycosyl-naphthalimides against hOGA. The rational compound design led to the synthesis of 13r bearing a 4-piperidylnaphthalimide moiety as a highly potent hOGA inhibitor (Ki = 0.6 μM against hOGA) with good selectivity (Ki > 100 μM against HsHexB). Furthermore, to investigate the basis for the potency and selectivity of 13r against hOGA, the possible inhibitory mechanisms of selected inhibitors (15b, 13b, and 13r) against hOGA and HsHexB were studied using molecular docking and MD simulations.

We designed and synthesized hybrid inhibitors with two structural types in a single molecule, which are effective against both wild-type and multiple mutants of P. falciparum through their selective target binding, as demonstrated by X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, the hybrid inhibitors can forestall the emergence of new resistant mutants, as shown by selection of mutants resistant to hybrid compound BT1 from a diverse PfDHFR random mutant library expressed in a surrogate bacterial system.

In these compounds, where both molecular weight (MW >579) and TPSA (>110 Å2) were high, attenuation of polar surface area together with weakening of hydrogen bond acceptor strength of the molecule provided a higher intrinsic membrane permeability and more desirable Caco-2 parameters, as demonstrated by trifluoroacetamide 11 and the benchmark N-ethylamino analog 12. In addition, the tendency of these inhibitors to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds potentially contributes favorably to the improved membrane permeability and absorption. The functional group minimization that resolved the efflux problem simultaneously maintained potent inhibitory activity toward a gt-2 HCV replicon due to a switching of the role of substituents in interacting with the Gln414 binding pocket, as observed in gt-2a NS5B/inhibitor complex cocrystal structures, thus increasing the efficiency of the optimization. Noteworthy, a novel intermolecular S=O···C=O n → π* type interaction between the ligand sulfonamide oxygen atom and the carbonyl moiety of the side chain of Gln414 was observed. The insights from these structure-property studies and crystallography information provided a direction for optimization in a campaign to identify second generation pan-genotypic NS5B inhibitors."

In most cases, the high mortality rate from cancer correlates with a lack of clear symptoms, which results in late diagnosis for patients, and consequently, advanced tumor disease with poor probabilities for cure, since many patients will show chemo- and radio-resistance. Several mechanisms have been studied to explain chemo- and radio-resistance to anti-tumor therapies, including cell signaling pathways, anti-apoptotic mechanisms, stemness, metabolism, and cellular phenotypes. Interestingly, the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are a subset of cells within the tumors, has been related to therapy resistance. In this review, we focus on evaluating the presence of CSCs in different tumors such as breast cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and hematological neoplasias, highlighting studies where CSCs were identified in patient samples. It is evident that there has been a great drive to identify the cell surface phenotypes of CSCs so that they can be used as a tool for anti-tumor therapy treatment design. We also review the potential effect of nanoparticles, drugs, natural compounds, aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitors, cell signaling inhibitors, and antibodies to treat CSCs from specific tumors. Taken together, we present an overview of the role of CSCs in tumorigenesis and how research is advancing to target these highly tumorigenic cells to improve oncology patient outcomes.","Composite GaN-C-Ga (""GaCN"") Layers with Tunable Refractive Index.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613311,"The journal of physical chemistry. C, Nanomaterials and interfaces",2019 01 09,"This article describes novel composite thin films consisting of GaN, C, and Ga (termed ""GaCN"", as an analogue to BCN and other carbonitrides) as a prospective material for future optical applications. This is due to their tunable refractive index that depends on the carbon content. The composites are prepared by introducing alternating pulses of trimethylgallium (TMG) and ammonia (NH3) on silicon substrates to mimic an atomic layer deposition process. Because the GaCN material is hardly reported to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive characterization is performed to investigate into its chemical nature, primarily to determine whether or not it exists as a single-phase material. It is revealed that GaCN is a composite, consisting of phase-segregated, nanoscale clusters of wurtzitic GaN polycrystals, in addition to inclusions of carbon, nitrogen, and gallium, which are chemically bonded into several forms, but not belonging to the GaN crystals itself. By varying the deposition temperature between 400 and 600 °C and the NH3 partial pressure between 0.7 × 10-3 and 7.25 mbar, layers with a wide compositional range of Ga, C, and N are prepared. The role of carbon on the GaCN optical properties is significant: an increase of the refractive index from 2.19 at 1500 nm (for carbon-free polycrystalline GaN) to 2.46 (for GaCN) is achieved by merely 10 at. % of carbon addition. The presence of sp2-hybridized C=N clusters and carbon at the interface of the GaN polycrystals are proposed to determine their optical properties. Furthermore, the formation of the GaN polycrystals in the composite occurs through a TMG:NH3 surface-adduct assisted pathway, whereas the inclusions of carbon, nitrogen, and gallium are formed by the thermal decomposition of the chemisorbed TMG species.",A nutrigenetic approach for investigating the chemopreventive effects of black raspberries during the development of preneoplastic esophagi in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613310,Journal of berry research,2019 01 10,Large epidemiological studies have shown that diets high in fruits reduce the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).,Non-Destructive Chemical Analysis of a Garcinia mangostana L.

We present herein a non-destructive method to analyze the metabolites of herbarium voucher specimens with the droplet-liquid microjunction-surface sampling probe (droplet probe) coupled to ultra-performance liquid chromatography and highresolution mass spectrometry. As proof of concept, a herbarium voucher specimen of Garcinia mangostana (mangosteen) was utilized due to the well-characterized xanthones biosynthesized by this plant, which are of interest as potential anticancer agents. Also, the juice of the fruits of this plant is used widely in the United States and in other countries as a botanical dietary supplement. Metabolite profiles of the sampled surfaces were compared to a subset of xanthone standards.

The first and second cohorts were from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (n=130,856) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (n=1,055) for analyzing survival outcomes and endocrine responsiveness. The third cohort was from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n=630) for multiomic analysis and endocrine-resistant subgroup exploration. The fourth cohort, from the MD Anderson database (n=92), was employed to assist gene selection. The fifth cohort was a prospective observational cohort from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (n=245) that was utilized to validate the gene-defined subgroup by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Clinically, ER+PR-HER2- tumors showed lower endocrine responsiveness than did ER+PR+HER2- tumors. Genomically, copy number loss or promoter methylation of PR genes occurred in 75% of ER+PR-HER2- tumors, collectively explaining PR loss. ER+PR-HER2- tumors had higher TP53 (30.3% vs. 17.0%) and lower PIK3CA mutation rates (25.8% vs. 42.7%) and exhibited more ZNF703 (21.5% vs. 13.6%) and RPS6KB1 (18.5% vs. 7.8%) amplification events than ER+PR+HER2- tumors. Among ER+PR-HER2- tumors, nearly 20% were of the PAM50-defined non-luminal-like subgroup and manifested lower endocrine sensitivity scores and enriched biosynthesis, metabolism and DNA replication pathways. We further identified the non-luminal-like subgroup using three IHC markers, GATA3, CK5, and EGFR. These IHC-defined non-luminal-like (GATA3-negative, CK5-positive and/or EGFR-positive) tumors received limited benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy. Conclusion: ER+PR-HER2- breast cancer consists of clinically and genomically distinct groups that may require different treatment strategies. The non-luminal-like subgroup was associated with reduced benefit from endocrine therapy.",Therapeutic Fluorescent Hybrid Nanoparticles for Traceable Delivery of Glucocorticoids to Inflammatory Sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613305,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Treatment of inflammatory disorders with glucocorticoids (GCs) is often accompanied by severe adverse effects. Application of GCs via nanoparticles (NPs), especially those using simple formulations, could possibly improve their delivery to sites of inflammation and therefore their efficacy, minimising the required dose and thus reducing side effects. Here, we present the evaluation of NPs composed of GC betamethasone phosphate (BMP) and the fluorescent dye DY-647 (BMP-IOH-NPs) for improved treatment of inflammation with simultaneous in vivo monitoring of NP delivery. Methods: BMP-IOH-NP uptake by MH-S macrophages was analysed by fluorescence and electron microscopy. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells were treated for 48 h with BMP-IOH-NPs (1×10-5-1×10-9 M), BMP or dexamethasone (Dexa). Drug efficacy was assessed by measurement of interleukin 6. Mice with Zymosan-A-induced paw inflammation were intraperitoneally treated with BMP-IOH-NPs (10 mg/kg) and mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation (AAI) were treated intranasally with BMP-IOH-NPs, BMP or Dexa (each 2.5 mg/kg). Efficacy was assessed in vivo by paw volume measurements with µCT and ex vivo by measurement of paw weight for Zymosan-A-treated mice, or in the AAI model by in vivo x-ray-based lung function assessment and by cell counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and histology. Delivery of BMP-IOH-NPs to the lungs of AAI mice was monitored by in vivo optical imaging and by fluorescence microscopy. Results: Uptake of BMP-IOH-NPs by MH-S cells was observed during the first 10 min of incubation, with the NP load increasing over time. The anti-inflammatory effect of BMP-IOH-NPs in vitro was dose dependent and higher than that of Dexa or free BMP, confirming efficient release of the drug. In vivo, Zymosan-A-induced paw inflammation was significantly reduced in mice treated with BMP-IOH-NPs. AAI mice that received BMP-IOH-NPs or Dexa but not BMP revealed significantly decreased eosinophil numbers in BALs and reduced immune cell infiltration in lungs. Correspondingly, lung function parameters, which were strongly affected in non-treated AAI mice, were unaffected in AAI mice treated with BMP-IOH-NPs and resembled those of healthy animals. Accumulation of BMP-IOH-NPs within the lungs of AAI mice was detectable by optical imaging for at least 4 h in vivo, where they were preferentially taken up by peribronchial and alveolar M2 macrophages. Conclusion: Our results show that BMP-IOH-NPs can effectively be applied in therapy of inflammatory diseases with at least equal efficacy as the gold standard Dexa, while their delivery can be simultaneously tracked in vivo by fluorescence imaging. BMP-IOH-NPs thus have the potential to reach clinical applications.",Contrast-Enhanced µCT for Visualizing and Evaluating Murine Intestinal Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613304,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Rationale: To develop a simple and fast protocol for the assessment of acute and chronic experimental intestinal inflammation using contrast-enhanced µCT. Methods: For the imaging studies, an acute 2% and 3% dextran sodium sulfate (n = 15, female, 8-12 weeks) and a chronic adoptive transfer colitis model (n = 10, female, 8-9 weeks) were established over 9 days or 6 weeks, respectively. Throughout the experiments, longitudinal measurement of murine intestinal wall thickness and time dependent perfusion was performed on a small animal µCT system (90 kV, 160 μA, FOV: 60 mm, scan time: 17 s, image size: 512x512, layer thickness: 118 µm) between 0.5 and 30 min after intravenous bolus injection of an iodine contrast agent. Weight development, small animal endoscopy, and histological ex vivo analysis were compared to contrast-enhanced µCT imaging findings. Results: Murine intestinal wall thickness was significantly increased in inflamed colons of acute colitis at day 9 in comparison to pre-inflamed state. Perfusion analysis revealed a late contrast enhancement in acute inflamed colons and the renal medulla at day 9 compared to control mice. An increasing intestinal wall thickness was monitored 3, 5 and 6 weeks after on-set of chronic colitis in comparison to controls. A good correlation with endoscopic (r = 0.75, p < 0.0001) and histologic degree of inflammation (r = 0.83, p = 0.04) was found. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced µCT is a simple and fast method to assess acute intestinal inflammation and to monitor disease progression in experimental models of chronic colitis. According to our findings, one single contrast-enhanced µCT-scan is a valid non-invasive modality to quantify the degree of inflammation in the entire digestive tract in murine inflammatory models.",Erratum: MicroRNA-647 targets SRF-MYH9 axis to suppress invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer: Erratum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613301,Theranostics,2019 06 12,[This corrects the article DOI: 10.7150/thno.20512.].

However, the role of exosomal miRNA in the protective effect of hypoxia-conditioned BM-MSCs-derived Exo (Hypo-Exo) remains largely uncharacterized and the poor specificity of tissue targeting of Exo limits their clinical applications. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of miRNA in Hypo-Exo on the repair of ischemic myocardium and its underlying mechanisms. We further developed modified Hypo-Exo with high specificity to the myocardium and evaluate its therapeutic effects. Methods: Murine BM-MSCs were subjected to hypoxia or normoxia culture and Exo were subsequently collected. Hypo-Exo or normoxia-conditioned BM-MSC-derived Exo (Nor-Exo) were administered to mice with permanent condition of myocardial infarction (MI). After 28 days, to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Hypo-Exo, infarction area and cardio output in Hypo-Exo and Nor-Exo treated MI mice were compared through Masson's trichrome staining and echocardiography respectively. We utilized the miRNA array to identify the significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between Nor-Exo and Hypo-Exo. One of the most enriched miRNA in Hypo-Exo was knockdown by applying antimiR in Hypoxia-conditioned BM-MSCs. Then we performed intramyocardial injection of candidate miRNA-knockdown-Hypo-Exo in a murine MI model, changes in the candidate miRNA's targets expression of cardiomyocytes and the cardiac function were characterized. We conjugated Hypo-Exo with an ischemic myocardium-targeted (IMT) peptide by bio-orthogonal chemistry, and tested its targeting specificity and therapeutic efficiency via systemic administration in the MI mice. Results: The miRNA array revealed significant enrichment of miR-125b-5p in Hypo-Exo compared with Nor-Exo. Administration of miR-125b knockdown Hypo-Exo significantly increased the infarction area and suppressed cardiomyocyte survival post-MI. Mechanistically, miR-125b knockdown Hypo-Exo lost the capability to suppress the expression of the proapoptotic genes p53 and BAK1 in cardiomyocytes. Intravenous administration of IMT-conjugated Hypo-Exo (IMT-Exo) showed specific targeting to the ischemic lesions in the injured heart and exerted a marked cardioprotective function post-MI. Conclusion: Our results illustrate a new mechanism by which Hypo-Exo-derived miR125b-5p facilitates ischemic cardiac repair by ameliorating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, our IMT- Exo may serve as a novel drug carrier that enhances the specificity of drug delivery for ischemic disease.",Iron oxide nanozyme suppresses intracellular Salmonella Enteritidis growth and alleviates infection in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613289,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Rational:Salmonella Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) is a globally significant zoonotic foodborne pathogen which has led to large numbers of deaths in humans and caused economic losses in animal husbandry. S. Enteritidis invades host cells and survives within the cells, causing resistance to antibiotic treatment. Effective methods of elimination and eradication of intracellular S. Enteritidis are still very limited. Here we evaluated whether a new intracellular antibacterial strategy using iron oxide nanozymes (IONzymes) exerted highly antibacterial efficacy via its intrinsic peroxidase-like activity in vitro and in vivo.Methods: The antibacterial activities of IONzymes against planktonic S. Enteritidis, intracellular S. Enteritidis in Leghorn Male Hepatoma-derived cells (LMH), and liver from specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks were investigated by spread-plate colony count method and cell viability assay. Changes in levels of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), a widely used marker for autophagosomes, were analyzed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was also assessed in vitro. High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to investigate the effects of IONzymes on liver transcriptome of S. Enteritidis-infected chicks. Results: We demonstrated that IONzymes had high biocompatibility with cultured LMH cells and chickens, which significantly inhibited intracellular S. Enteritidis survival in vitro and in vivo. In addition, co-localization of IONzymes with S. Enteritidis were observed in autophagic vacuoles of LMH cells and liver of chickens infected by S. Enteritidis, indicating that IONzymes mediated antibacterial reaction of S. Enteritidis with autophagic pathway. We found ROS level was significantly increased in infected LMH cells treated with IONzymes, which might enhance the autophagic elimination of intracellular S. Enteritidis. Moreover, orally administered IONzymes decreased S. Enteritidis organ invasion of the liver and prevented pathological lesions in a chicken-infection model. Non-target transcriptomic profiling also discovered IONzymes could change hepatic oxidation-reduction and autophagy related gene expressions in the S. Enteritidis infected chickens. Conclusion: These data suggest that IONzymes can increase ROS levels to promote the antibacterial effects of acid autophagic vacuoles, and thus suppress the establishment and survival of invading intracellular S. Enteritidis. As a result, IONzymes may be a novel alternative to current antibiotics for the control of intractable S. Enteritidis infections.",Development of a smartphone-based rapid dual fluorescent diagnostic system for the simultaneous detection of influenza A and H5 subtype in avian influenza A-infected patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613288,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Accurate and rapid diagnosis of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 is of critical importance for the effective clinical management of patients. Here, we developed a rapid and simultaneous detection toolkit for influenza A H5 subtype viruses in human samples based on a bioconjugate of quantum dots (QDs) assembly and a smartphone-based rapid dual fluorescent diagnostic system (SRDFDS). Methods: Two types of QDs were assembled on a latex bead to enhance the detection sensitivity and specificity of influenza A infection (QD580) and H5 subtype (QD650). The dual signals of influenza A and H5 subtype of H5N1-infected patients were detected simultaneously and quantified separately by SRDFDS equipped with two emission filters. Results: Our results showed a high sensitivity of 92.86% (13/14) and 78.57% (11/14), and a specificity of 100% (38/38, P < 0.0001) and 97.37% (37/38) for influenza A and H5 subtype detection, respectively. Conclusion: Therefore, our multiplex QD bioconjugates and SRDFDS-based influenza virus detection toolkit potentially provide accurate and meaningful diagnosis information with improved detection accuracies and sensitivities for H5N1 patients.",High performance immunochromatographic assay for simultaneous quantitative detection of multiplex cardiac markers based on magnetic nanobeads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613287,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"The detection of cardiac markers is critical to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, and immunochromatographic assays are a common tool for point-of-care analysis. Methods: We report a multiplexed lateral flow test strip for simultaneous quantitative detection of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CKMB), and myoglobin (Myo). Hydrophilic, monodisperse, stable, and carboxyl-modified (COOH-) magnetic nanobeads (MNBs) were used to construct immunomagnetic probes specific to the three cardiac markers. The detection area of the sandwich-style complexes contained three test lines for cTnI, CKMB, and Myo. The magnetic signal intensity of the detection area in the nitrocellulose membrane was measured via a magnetic immunochromatography reader developed in house. Results: To optimize the assay, a modified working buffer was also investigated to improve the detection sensitivity, decrease the background noise, and shorten the detection time. The MNB-based immunochromatography test (MICT) strip offers a wide linear dynamic detection range, rapid detection, high sensitivity, and specificity. The limit of detection was 0.0089 ng/mL for cTnI, 0.063 ng/mL for CKMB, and 0.05 ng/mL for Myo with minimal cross-reactivity. There were 110 clinical human serum samples that were used to evaluate this platform with high correlation. Conclusion: MICT shows great potential as a supplemental method for in vitro diagnostics in the laboratory or in other point-of-care testing (POCT) applications.",Photoacoustic microscopy reveals the hemodynamic basis of sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced neuroprotection against ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613286,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Rationale: Emerging evidence has suggested that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive metabolite of sphingolipids, may play an important role in the pathophysiological processes of cerebral hypoxia and ischemia. However, the influence of S1P on cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism remains unclear. Material and Methods: Uniquely capable of high-resolution, label-free, and comprehensive imaging of hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism in the mouse brain without the influence of general anesthesia, our newly developed head-restrained multi-parametric photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) is well suited for this mechanistic study. Here, combining the cutting-edge PAM and a selective inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) that can increase the blood S1P level, we investigated the role of S1P in cerebral oxygen supply-demand and its neuroprotective effects on global brain hypoxia induced by nitrogen gas inhalation and focal brain ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Results: Inhibition of SphK2, which increased the blood S1P, resulted in the elevation of both arterial and venous sO2 in the hypoxic mouse brain, while the cerebral blood flow remained unchanged. As a result, it gradually and significantly reduced the metabolic rate of oxygen. Furthermore, pre-treatment of the mice subject to tMCAO with the SphK2 inhibitor led to decreased infarct volume, improved motor function, and reduced neurological deficit, compared to the control treatment with a less potent R-enantiomer. In contrast, post-treatment with the inhibitor showed no improvement in the stroke outcomes. The failure for the post-treatment to induce neuroprotection was likely due to the relatively slow hemodynamic responses to the SphK2 inhibitor-evoked S1P intervention, which did not take effect before the brain injury was induced. Conclusions: Our results reveal that elevated blood S1P significantly changes cerebral hemodynamics and oxygen metabolism under hypoxia but not normoxia. The improved blood oxygenation and reduced oxygen demand in the hypoxic brain may underlie the neuroprotective effect of S1P against ischemic stroke.",Liver segment imaging using monocyte sequestration: a potential tool for fluorescence-guided liver surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613285,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Background: The accurate determination of liver segment anatomy is essential to perform liver resection without complications and to ensure long-term outcomes after this operation. There are several perioperative methods for segment identification and surgical navigation, such as intraoperative ultrasound, indigo carmine and near-infrared imaging with indocyanine green. The present study experimentally analyzed the usefulness of monocyte sequestration for liver segment labeling and imaging. Methods: Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood and directly or indirectly labeled with calcein or IRDye 800CW. Potential toxicity, labeling stability, and adhesion to ICAM-1 were analyzed in vitro. Monocyte sequestration in the liver microvasculature and liver segment labeling and boundary demarcation were studied using isolated mouse and pig liver perfusion and via intraportal injection in mouse liver tumor models. Results: The highest monocyte labeling efficiency was achieved using direct labeling with IRDye 800CW. Labeling was stable and did not influence cell viability. The labeled monocytes were highly sequestrated in the liver microvasculature, both after ex vivo perfusion and after injection in vivo , resulting in excellent labeling of selected liver segments and strong segment boundary demarcation. In contrast to results to a normal liver, monocyte sequestration was very low in tumor-associated blood vessels. Conclusions: The present experimental study shows that sequestration of labeled monocytes after superselective application demarcates the selected liver segment. These results illustrate potential of this technique for surgical navigation during liver surgery.","The theranostic promise for Neuroendocrine Tumors in the late 2010s - Where do we stand, where do we go?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613284,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"More than 25 years after the first peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the concept of somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-directed imaging and therapy for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is seeing rapidly increasing use. To maximize the full potential of its theranostic promise, efforts in recent years have expanded recommendations in current guidelines and included the evaluation of novel theranostic radiotracers for imaging and treatment of NET. Moreover, the introduction of standardized reporting framework systems may harmonize PET reading, address pitfalls in interpreting SSTR-PET/CT scans and guide the treating physician in selecting PRRT candidates. Notably, the concept of PRRT has also been applied beyond oncology, e.g. for treatment of inflammatory conditions like sarcoidosis. Future perspectives may include the efficacy evaluation of PRRT compared to other common treatment options for NET, novel strategies for closer monitoring of potential side effects, the introduction of novel radiotracers with beneficial pharmacodynamic and kinetic properties or the use of supervised machine learning approaches for outcome prediction. This article reviews how the SSTR-directed theranostic concept is currently applied and also reflects on recent developments that hold promise for the future of theranostics in this context.",T-cell functionality testing is highly relevant to developing novel immuno-tracers monitoring T cells in the context of immunotherapies and revealed CD7 as an attractive target.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613283,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Cancer immunotherapy has proven high efficacy in treating diverse cancer entities by immune checkpoint modulation and adoptive T-cell transfer. However, patterns of treatment response differ substantially from conventional therapies, and reliable surrogate markers are missing for early detection of responders versus non-responders. Current imaging techniques using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron-emmission-tomograpy (18F-FDG-PET) cannot discriminate, at early treatment times, between tumor progression and inflammation. Therefore, direct imaging of T cells at the tumor site represents a highly attractive tool to evaluate effective tumor rejection or evasion. Moreover, such markers may be suitable for theranostic imaging. Methods: We mainly investigated the potential of two novel pan T-cell markers, CD2 and CD7, for T-cell tracking by immuno-PET imaging. Respective antibody- and F(ab´)2 fragment-based tracers were produced and characterized, focusing on functional in vitro and in vivo T-cell analyses to exclude any impact of T-cell targeting on cell survival and antitumor efficacy. Results: T cells incubated with anti-CD2 and anti-CD7 F(ab´)2 showed no major modulation of functionality in vitro, and PET imaging provided a distinct and strong signal at the tumor site using the respective zirconium-89-labeled radiotracers. However, while T-cell tracking by anti-CD7 F(ab´)2 had no long-term impact on T-cell functionality in vivo, anti-CD2 F(ab´)2 caused severe T-cell depletion and failure of tumor rejection. Conclusion: This study stresses the importance of extended functional T-cell assays for T-cell tracer development in cancer immunotherapy imaging and proposes CD7 as a highly suitable target for T-cell immuno-PET imaging.",MicroCT imaging reveals differential 3D micro-scale remodelling of the murine aorta in ageing and Marfan syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613281,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Aortic wall remodelling is a key feature of both ageing and genetic connective tissue diseases, which are associated with vasculopathies such as Marfan syndrome (MFS). Although the aorta is a 3D structure, little attention has been paid to volumetric assessment, primarily due to the limitations of conventional imaging techniques. Phase-contrast microCT is an emerging imaging technique, which is able to resolve the 3D micro-scale structure of large samples without the need for staining or sectioning. Methods: Here, we have used synchrotron-based phase-contrast microCT to image aortae of wild type (WT) and MFS Fbn1C1039G/+ mice aged 3, 6 and 9 months old (n=5). We have also developed a new computational approach to automatically measure key histological parameters. Results: This analysis revealed that WT mice undergo age-dependent aortic remodelling characterised by increases in ascending aorta diameter, tunica media thickness and cross-sectional area. The MFS aortic wall was subject to comparable remodelling, but the magnitudes of the changes were significantly exacerbated, particularly in 9 month-old MFS mice with ascending aorta wall dilations. Moreover, this morphological remodelling in MFS aorta included internal elastic lamina surface breaks that extended throughout the MFS ascending aorta and were already evident in animals who had not yet developed aneurysms. Conclusions: Our 3D microCT study of the sub-micron wall structure of whole, intact aorta reveals that histological remodelling of the tunica media in MFS could be viewed as an accelerated ageing process, and that phase-contrast microCT combined with computational image analysis allows the visualisation and quantification of 3D morphological remodelling in large volumes of unstained vascular tissues.",Hypoxia-triggered single molecule probe for high-contrast NIR II/PA tumor imaging and robust photothermal therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613279,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Hypoxia is a common characteristic of solid tumors. This important feature is associated with resistance to radio-chemotherapy, which results in poor prognosis and probability of tumor recurrence. Taking advantage of background-free NIR II fluorescence imaging and deeper-penetrating photoacoustic (PA) imaging, we developed a hypoxia-triggered and nitroreductase (NTR) enzyme-responsive single molecule probe for high-contrast NIR II/PA tumor imaging and hypoxia-activated photothermal therapy (PTT), which will overcome cellular resistance during hypoxia. Methods: The single molecule probe IR1048-MZ was synthesized by conjugating a nitro imidazole group as a specific hypoxia trigger with an IR-1048 dye as a NIR II/PA signal reporter. We investigated the NIR II fluorescence, NIR absorbance and photothermal effect in different hypoxia conditions in vitro, and performed NIR II/PA tumor imaging and hypoxia-activated photothermal therapy in mice. Results: This versatile molecular probe IR1048-MZ not only realized high-contrast tumor visualization with a clear boundary by NIR II fluorescence imaging, but also afforded deep-tissue penetration at the centimeter level by 3D PA imaging. Moreover, after being activated by NTR that is overexpressed in hypoxic tumors, the probe exhibited a significant photothermal effect for curative tumor ablation with no recurrence. Conclusions: We have developed the first hypoxia-triggered and NTR enzyme-responsive single molecule probe for high-contrast NIR II/PA tumor imaging and hypoxia-activated photothermal therapy. By tracing the activity of NTR, IR1048-MZ may be a promising contrast agent and theranostic formulation for other hypoxia-related diseases (such as cancer, inflammation, stroke, and cardiac ischemia)."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a newly discovered class of RNAs, constitute a substantial fraction of the mammalian transcriptome and are abundantly expressed in the cardiovascular system. However, the regulatory functions of these circRNAs in ischemic cardiac disease remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of a circRNA transcribed from the sodium/calcium exchanger 1 (ncx1) gene, named circNCX1, in oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis during ischemic myocardial injury. Methods: Divergent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to amplify the circRNA. The circular structure of circNCX1 was verified by Sanger sequencing and RNase R digestion. The subcellular localization of circNCX1 was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To test the expression pattern and function of circNCX1 during oxidative stress, H9c2 cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with H2O2 or hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R). Mechanistically, the interaction of circNCX1 with miRNA was examined by AGO2-IP and RNA pull-down assays. The regulatory role of circNCX1 in target gene expression was tested by western blot and luciferase reporter assays. At the animal level, we constructed a myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) mouse model to analyze the effect of circNCX1 on heart function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac remodeling. Results: circNCX1 was increased in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis by acting as an endogenous miR-133a-3p sponge. Due to competitive binding of circNCX1 to miR-133a-3p, the suppressive activity of pro-apoptotic gene cell death-inducing protein (CDIP1) by miR-133a-3p was reduced. Knockdown of circNCX1 in murine cardiomyocytes and heart tissues reduced the levels of CDIP1 and attenuated the apoptosis and I/R injury. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a novel regulatory pathway that comprises circNCX1, miR-133a-3p and CDIP1, that is involved in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. This pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic avenue for ischemic heart diseases.",Arg1 expression defines immunosuppressive subsets of tumor-associated macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613266,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) have attracted attention as they can modulate key cancer-related activities, yet TAM represent a heterogenous group of cells that remain incompletely characterized. In growing tumors, TAM are often referred to as M2-like macrophages, which are cells that display immunosuppressive and tumorigenic functions and express the enzyme arginase 1 (Arg1). Methods: Here we combined high resolution intravital imaging with single cell RNA seq to uncover the topography and molecular profiles of immunosuppressive macrophages in mice. We further assessed how immunotherapeutic interventions impact these cells directly in vivo. Results: We show that: i) Arg1+ macrophages are more abundant in tumors compared to other organs; ii) there exist two morphologically distinct subsets of Arg1 TAM defined by previously unknown markers (Gbp2b, Bst1, Sgk1, Pmepa1, Ms4a7); iii) anti-Programmed Cell Death-1 (aPD-1) therapy decreases the number of Arg1+ TAM while increasing Arg1- TAM; iv) accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of arginase 1 does not synergize with aPD-1 therapy. Conclusion: Overall, this research shows how powerful complementary single cell analytical approaches can be used to improve our understanding of drug action in vivo.",Remote loading of liposomes with a 124I-radioiodinated compound and their in vivo evaluation by PET/CT in a murine tumor model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613265,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Long circulating liposomes entrapping iodinated and radioiodinated compounds offer a highly versatile theranostic platform. Here we report a new methodology for efficient and high-yield loading of such compounds into liposomes, enabling CT/SPECT/PET imaging and 131I-radiotherapy. Methods: The CT contrast agent diatrizoate was synthetically functionalized with a primary amine, which enabled its remote loading into PEGylated liposomes by either an ammonium sulfate- or a citrate-based pH transmembrane gradient. Further, the amino-diatrizoate was radiolabeled with either 124I (t1/2 = 4.18 days) for PET or 125I (t1/2 = 59.5 days) for SPECT, through an aromatic Finkelstein reaction. Results: Quantitative loading efficiencies (>99%) were achieved at optimized conditions. The 124I-labeled compound was remote-loaded into liposomes, with an overall radiolabeling efficiency of 77 ± 1%, and imaged in vivo in a CT26 murine colon cancer tumor model by PET/CT. A prolonged blood circulation half-life of 19.5 h was observed for the radiolabeled liposomes, whereas injections of the free compound were rapidly cleared. Lower accumulation was observed in the spleen, liver, kidney and tumor than what is usually seen for long-circulating liposomes. Conclusion: The lower accumulation was interpreted as release of the tracer from the liposomes within these organs after accumulation. These results may guide the design of systems for controlled release of remote loadable drugs from liposomes.",A heparan sulfate-based matrix therapy reduces brain damage and enhances functional recovery following stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613264,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Alteration of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is one of the major events in the pathogenesis of brain lesions following ischemic stroke. Heparan sulfate mimetics (HSm) are synthetic pharmacologically active polysaccharides that promote ECM remodeling and tissue regeneration in various types of lesions. HSm bind to growth factors, protect them from enzymatic degradation and increase their bioavailability, which promotes tissue repair. As the ECM is altered during stroke and HSm have been shown to restore the ECM, we investigated the potential of HSm4131 (also named RGTA-4131®) to protect brain tissue and promote regeneration and plasticity after a stroke. Methods: Ischemic stroke was induced in rats using transient (1 h) intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Animals were assigned to the treatment (HSm4131; 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, or 5 mg/kg) or vehicle control (saline) groups at different times (1, 2.5 or 6 h) after MCAo. Brain damage was assessed by MRI for the acute (2 days) and chronic (14 days) phases post-occlusion. Functional deficits were evaluated with a battery of sensorimotor behavioral tests. HSm4131-99mTc biodistribution in the ischemic brain was analyzed between 5 min and 3 h following middle cerebral artery reperfusion. Heparan sulfate distribution and cellular reactions, including angiogenesis and neurogenesis, were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and growth factor gene expression (VEGF-A, Ang-2) was quantified by RT-PCR. Results: HSm4131, administered intravenously after stroke induction, located and remained in the ischemic hemisphere. HSm4131 conferred long-lasting neuroprotection, and significantly reduced functional deficits with no alteration of physiological parameters. It also restored the ECM, and increased brain plasticity processes, i.e., angiogenesis and neurogenesis, in the affected brain hemisphere. Conclusion: HSm represent a promising ECM-based therapeutic strategy to protect and repair the brain after a stroke and favor functional recovery.",miR-200c/141 Regulates Breast Cancer Stem Cell Heterogeneity via Targeting HIPK1/β-Catenin Axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613263,Theranostics,2019 06 12,"Increasing evidence demonstrates the existence of two inter-convertible states of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) with distinct behaviors in proliferation and mobility, and the BCSC heterogeneity is accurately regulated by sophisticated mechanisms including microRNAs. The microRNA-200 family including miR-200c/141 cluster was reported to affect cancer cell invasion and metastasis by regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the effect of miR-200 family on BCSC heterogeneity is uncertain. Thus, we investigated whether the miR-200c/141 cluster had different effects on breast tumor growth and metastasis by switching the two states of BCSC. Methods: The spontaneous mammary tumor mouse model with miR-200c/141 conditional knockout was utilized for analyzing the role of miR-200c/141 cluster in vivo. The effect of miR-200c/141 cluster on BCSCs was performed by CD24/CD29 staining and ALDEFLUOR assay. miR-200c/141 target expression and EMT-related marker expression were verified in tumor sections, primary cells and breast cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR or western blotting. Statistical analysis was determined using two-way ANOVA and Student's t-test. All values were presented as the mean ± s.e.m. Results: The deletion of miR-200c/141 cluster regulated BCSC heterogeneity and promoted the EMT-like BCSC generation, which resulted in increased tumor metastasis and inhibited tumor growth by directly upregulating the target gene homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) and sequential β-catenin activation. Conclusions: Our results indicated that miR-200c/141 played biphasic roles in breast tumor progression via affecting the BCSC heterogeneity, suggesting targeting BCSC heterogeneity to simultaneously restrict breast cancer initiation and metastasis could be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.",Maintaining reading experience continuity across e-book revisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613262,Research and practice in technology enhanced learning,2019 01 09,"E-book reader supports users to create digital learning footprints in many forms like highlighting sentences or taking memos. Nowadays, it also allows an instructor to update their e-books in the e-book reader. However, e-book users often face problems when trying to find learning footprints they made in a new version e-book. Thus, users' reading experience continuity across e-book revisions is hard to be maintained and seems to become a shortcoming within the e-book system. In this paper, in order to maintain users' reading experience continuity, we deal with the transfer of learning footprints such as a marker, memo, and bookmark across e-book revisions on an e-book reader in a coursework scenario. We first give introduction and related works to demonstrate how researchers dedicated on the problem mentioned in this paper and page similarity comparison. Then, we compare three page similarity comparison methods using similarity computing models to compute page pairwise similarity in image level, text level, and image & text level. In the analysis, for each level, we analyze the performance of transferring learning footprint across e-book revisions and also the optimal threshold for similar page determination. After that, we give the analysis results to show the performances of three methods in image level, text level, and image & text level, and then, the error analysis is presented to specify the error types that occur in the results. We then propose page image & text similarity comparison as the optimal method to automatically transfer learning footprints across e-book revisions based on the analysis results and error analysis among three compared methods.

In this paper, we present PyKinetic, a mobile tutor we developed for Python programming, aimed to serve as a supplement to traditional courses. The overarching goal of our work is to design coding activities that maximize learning. As we work towards our goal, we first focus on the learning effectiveness of the activities within PyKinetic, rather than evaluating the effectiveness of PyKinetic as a supplement resource for an introductory programming course. The version of PyKinetic (PyKinetic_DbgOut) used in the study contains five types of learning activities aimed at supporting debugging, code-tracing, and code writing skills. We evaluated PyKinetic in a controlled lab study with quantitative and qualitative results to address the following research questions: (R1) Is the combination of coding activities effective for learning programming? (R2) How do the activities affect the skills of students with lower prior knowledge (novices) compared to those who had higher prior knowledge (advanced)? (R3) How can we improve the usability of PyKinetic? Results revealed that PyKinetic_DbgOut was more beneficial for advanced students. Furthermore, we found how coding skills are interrelated differently for novices compared to advanced learners. Lastly, we acquired sufficient feedback from the participants to improve the tutor.","Trends in hepatitis B and hepatitis C seroprevalence among blood donors - Haiti, 2005-2014.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613210,ISBT science series,2019 05 01,"Data on the seroprevalence of viral hepatitis are limited in Haiti; consequently, the epidemiology is poorly described.

This behavior violates the conventional theory of superconductivity, and its origin has posed a long-standing puzzle. Here we report systematic measurements of the critical magnetic field and current on amorphous indium oxide films with various levels of disorder. Surprisingly, our measurements show that the Bc2 anomaly is accompanied by mean-field-like scaling of the critical current. Based on a comprehensive theoretical study we argue that these observations are a consequence of the vortex-glass ground state and its thermal fluctuations. Our theory further predicts that the linear-temperature anomaly occurs more generally in both films and disordered bulk superconductors, with a slope that depends on the normal-state sheet resistance, which we confirm experimentally."

In premixed turbulent combustion however, thin flame-like structures arise in the solution of the Stochastic Fields equations that require grid spacing much finer than the filter scale used for the Large Eddy Simulation. The conventional approach of using grid spacing equal to the filter scale yields substantial numerical error, whereas using grid spacing much finer than the filter length scale is computationally-unaffordable for most industrially-relevant combustion systems. A Thickened Stochastic Fields approach is developed in this study in order to provide physically-accurate and numerically-converged solutions of the Stochastic Fields equations with reduced compute time. The Thickened Stochastic Fields formulation bridges between the conventional Stochastic Fields and conventional Thickened-Flame approaches depending on the numerical grid spacing utilised. One-dimensional Stochastic Fields simulations of freely-propagating turbulent premixed flames are used in order to obtain criteria for the thickening factor required, as a function of relevant physical and numerical parameters, and to obtain a model for an efficiency function that accounts for the loss of resolved flame surface area caused by applying the thickening transformation to the Stochastic Fields equations. The Thickened Stochastic Fields formulation is tested by performing LES of a laboratory premixed Bunsen flame. The results demonstrate that the Thickened Stochastic Fields method produces accurate predictions even when using a grid spacing equal to the filter scale. The present development therefore facilitates the accurate application of the Stochastic Fields approach to industrially-relevant combustion systems.",Resolution Requirements in Stochastic Field Simulation of Turbulent Premixed Flames.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613189,"Flow, turbulence and combustion",2019 01 09,"The spatial resolution requirements of the Stochastic Fields probability density function approach are investigated in the context of turbulent premixed combustion simulation. The Stochastic Fields approach is an attractive way to implement a transported Probability Density Function modelling framework into Large Eddy Simulations of turbulent combustion. In premixed combustion LES, the numerical grid should resolve flame-like structures that arise from solution of the Stochastic Fields equation. Through analysis of Stochastic Fields simulations of a freely-propagating planar turbulent premixed flame, it is shown that the flame-like structures in the Stochastic Fields simulations can be orders of magnitude narrower than the LES filter length scale. The under-resolution is worst for low Karlovitz number combustion, where the thickness of the Stochastic Fields flame structures is on the order of the laminar flame thickness. The effect of resolution on LES predictions is then assessed by performing LES of a laboratory Bunsen flame and comparing the effect of refining the grid spacing and filter length scale independently. The usual practice of setting the LES filter length scale equal to grid spacing leads to severe under-resolution and numerical thickening of the flame, and to substantial error in the turbulent flame speed. The numerical resolution required for accurate solution of the Stochastic Fields equations is prohibitive for many practical applications involving high-pressure premixed combustion. This motivates development of a Thickened Stochastic Fields approach (Picciani et al. Flow Turbul. Combust.

This configuration is relevant to scavenged pre-chamber natural-gas engines, where the turbulent jet ejected from the pre-chamber may be quenched or may be composed of fully-burnt products. The degree of reaction in the jet fluid is described by a progress variable c (c = taking values 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0) and the mixing by a mixture fraction ξ (ξ = 1 in the jet fluid and 0 in the CH4-air mixture to be ignited). At high scalar dissipation rates, N0, ignition does not occur and a chemically-frozen steady-state condition emerges at long times. At scalar dissipation rates below a critical value, ignition occurs at a time that increases with N0. The flame reaches the ξ = 0 boundary at a finite time that decreases with N0. The results help identify overall timescales of the jet-ignition problem and suggest a methodology by which estimates of ignition times in real engines may be made.",Direct Numerical Simulation of Head-On Quenching of Statistically Planar Turbulent Premixed Methane-Air Flames Using a Detailed Chemical Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613187,"Flow, turbulence and combustion",2019 01 07,"A three-dimensional compressible Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) analysis has been carried out for head-on quenching of a statistically planar stoichiometric methane-air flame by an isothermal inert wall.

In order to perform an in-depth comparison between simple and detailed chemistry DNS results, a corresponding simulation has been carried out for the same turbulence parameters for a representative single-step Arrhenius type irreversible chemical mechanism. In the corresponding simple chemistry simulation, heat release rate vanishes once the flame reaches a threshold distance from the wall. The distributions of reaction progress variable c and non-dimensional temperature T are found to be identical to each other away from the wall for the simple chemistry simulation but this equality does not hold during head-on quenching. The inequality between c (defined based on

The current paper presents the use of a 3D-CFD model using both the RANS and LES turbulence modelling approaches, and a Lagrangian DDM to model an early fuel injection event, to evaluate the regimes of combustion in a gasoline direct-injection engine. The velocity fluctuations were investigated as an average value across the cylinder and in the region between the spark plug electrodes. The velocity fluctuations near the spark plug electrodes were seen to be of lower magnitude than the globally averaged fluctuations but exhibited higher levels of cyclic variation due to the influence of the spark plug electrode and the pent-roof geometry on the in-cylinder flow field. Differences in the predicted flame structure due to differences in the predicted velocity fluctuations between RANS and LES modelling approaches were seen as a consequence of the inherently higher dissipation levels present in the RANS methodology. The increased cyclic variation in velocity fluctuations near the spark plug electrodes in the LES predictions suggested significant variation in the relative strength of the in-cylinder turbulence and that may subsequently result in a thickening of the propagating flame front from cycle-to-cycle in this region.

Typical targets for behaviour change interventions include diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption, sometimes described as 'lifestyle behaviours.' In this paper, I discuss how efforts to raise awareness of the impact of lifestyles on health, in seeking to communicate the (perceived) need for people to change their behaviour, can contribute to a climate of 'healthism' and promote the moralisation of people's lifestyles. I begin by summarising recent trends in health promotion and introducing the notion of healthism, as described by Robert Crawford in the 1980s. One aspect of healthism is moralisation, which I outline (alongside the related term moralism) and suggest is facilitated by efforts to promote health via information provision and educational strategies. I propose that perceived responsibility plays a role in mediating the tendency to moralise about health and behaviour. Since I argue that states ought to avoid direct and indirect moralisation of people's health-related behaviour, this suggests states must be cautious with regard to the use of responsibility-indicating interventions (including informational and educational campaigns) to promote health.","Gliophorusglutinosus sp. nov.

Simulating compatibility-based learning in a network of networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613126,Journal of evolutionary economics,2019 01 09,"In this article, we develop a new way to capture knowledge diffusion and assimilation in innovation networks by means of an agent-based simulation model. The model incorporates three essential characteristics of knowledge that have not been covered entirely by previous diffusion models: the network character of knowledge, compatibility of new knowledge with already existing knowledge, and the fact that transmission of knowledge requires some form of attention. We employ a network-of- networks approach, where agents are located within an innovation network and each agent itself contains another network composed of knowledge units (KUs). Since social learning is a path-dependent process, in our model, KUs are exchanged among agents and integrated into their respective knowledge networks depending on the received KUs' compatibility with the currently focused ones. Thereby, we are also able to endogenize attributes such as absorptive capacity that have been treated as an exogenous parameter in some of the previous diffusion models. We use our model to simulate and analyze various scenarios, including cases for different degrees of knowledge diversity and cognitive distance among agents as well as knowledge exploitation vs. exploration strategies. Here, the model is able to distinguish between two levels of knowledge diversity: heterogeneity within and between agents. Additionally, our simulation results give fresh impetus to debates about the interplay of innovation network structure and knowledge diffusion. In summary, our article proposes a novel way of modeling knowledge diffusion, thereby contributing to an advancement of the economics of innovation and knowledge.",Relating business model innovations and innovation cascades: the case of biotechnology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613125,Journal of evolutionary economics,2019 01 09,"This article conceptualizes innovation as a process, where the scientific and industrial application of technological knowledge nurtures new routines and institutions, in order to relate changing business model innovations to innovation cascades.

These cascades involve a long series of interlinked radical innovations, which can be traced through various scientific and technological indicators like patents and publications. Innovation cascades are relevant to industry, because they make the future less predictable. They are particularly interesting because these changes also enable the testing an abundance of new business models. Innovation cascades have a major impact on the number and sustainability of business models and on strategy. Business model innovations are visible not only in the existing organizations that undergo change, but also new organizational models appear.

Most research has focused on hunting and fishing activities, overlooking berry picking as an important socio-cultural activity and contributor to the diversity of food systems. We examined the vulnerability of cloudberry (referred to as 'bakeapple' consistent with local terminology) picking to environmental changes in the community of Cartwright, Labrador using semi-structured interviews (n = 18), field surveys, and satellite imagery. We identified the components of vulnerability including: the environmental changes affecting the abundance, quality, and ripening time of bakeapples (i.e., exposure), the characteristics of the community that affect how these changes have local impacts (i.e., sensitivity), and the ways in which the community is responding to environmental changes (i.e., adaptive capacity). Our results confirm that environmental changes related to permafrost, vegetation, and water have occurred at the bakeapple picking grounds with observed impacts on bakeapples. It is becoming increasingly difficult for bakeapple pickers to respond to variable growth as in the past because of changes in summer settlement patterns that place families farther from their bakeapple patches. We conclude that harvesters in Cartwright have high adaptive capacity to respond to environmental changes due to their knowledge of their bakeapple patches, and at present, socioeconomic changes have had a greater impact than environmental changes on their harvesting capacity.",A Co-Wife for the Cow: Gender Dimensions of Land Change and Livelihood Shift among Loita Maasai of Southern Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613122,Human ecology: an interdisciplinary journal,2019 01 09,"Gender dimensions are fundamental to human/environment systems.

Left-truncated data arise when there is delayed entry into a study, such that subjects are included only if their event time exceeds some other time. Quasi-independence of truncation and failure refers to factorization of their joint density in the observable region. Under quasi-independence, standard methods for survival data such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox regression can be applied after simple adjustments to the risk sets. Unlike the requisite assumption of independent censoring, quasi-independence can be tested, e.g., using a conditional Kendall's tau test. Current methods for testing for quasi-independence are powerful for monotone alternatives. Nonetheless, it is essential to detect any kind of deviation from quasi-independence so as not to report a biased Kaplan-Meier estimator or regression effect, which would arise from applying the simple risk set adjustment when dependence holds. Nonparametric, minimum p-value tests that are powerful against non-monotone alternatives are developed to offer protection against erroneous assumptions of quasi-independence. The use of conditional and unconditional methods of permutation for evaluation of the proposed tests are investigated in simulation studies. The proposed tests are applied to a study on the cognitive and functional decline in aging.","Emotion regulation in action: Use, selection, and success of emotion regulation in adolescents' daily lives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613118,International journal of behavioral development,2019 01 09,"Successful emotion regulation (ER) is a central aspect of psychosocial functioning and mental health and is thought to improve and be refined in adolescence. Past research on ER has mainly focused on one-time measurements of habitual ER. Linking regulatory strategies to emotions in daily lives is key to understanding adolescents' emotional lives. Using an Experience Sampling Method with 78 adolescents (Mage = 13.91, SDage = .95, 66% girls), we investigated the use, selection, and success in down-regulating negative emotions of eight ER strategies across 44 assessments. Acceptance was the strategy employed most often followed by problem-solving, rumination, distraction, avoidance, reappraisal, social support, and suppression. Interestingly, negativity of the event influenced the use of ER strategies: With low intensity negative emotions, acceptance was more likely to be used, and with high intensity negative emotions, suppression, problem-solving, distraction, avoidance, social support, and rumination were more likely to be used. With regard to success, multilevel models revealed that problem-solving, reappraisal, and acceptance were more successful in down-regulating negative emotions than rumination. Further, among girls, no relations between the momentary use of ER strategies and depressive symptoms was found. Among boys, a negative relation between acceptance and depressive symptoms emerged. Results from this study suggest that there is a reciprocal relationship between the intensity of negative emotions and ER strategies and that gender differences may exist. Taken together, this study showed which ER strategies are used by a healthy adolescent sample, and these results are discussed with regard to their theoretical and practical importance.",Food-Offering Calls in Wild Golden Lion Tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia): Evidence for Teaching Behavior?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613117,International journal of primatology,2019 01 19,"Many animals emit calls in the presence of food, but researchers do not always know the function of these calls. Evidence suggests that adult golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) use food-offering calls to teach juveniles which substrate (i.e., microhabitat) to forage on, or in, for food. However, we do not yet know whether juveniles learn from this aspect of the adults' behavior. Here we examine whether juveniles learn to associate food-offering calls with a foraging substrate, as a step toward assessing whether these calls qualify as teaching behavior. We compared the performance of four wild juvenile golden lion tamarins that were introduced to a novel substrate while exposed to playbacks of food-offering calls (experimental condition) to the performance of three juveniles that were exposed to the novel substrate without the presence of food-offering playbacks (control condition). We varied the location of the novel substrate between trials. We found that food-offering calls had an immediate effect on juveniles' interactions with the novel substrate, whether they inserted their hands into the substrate and their eating behavior, and a long-term effect on eating behavior at the substrate. The findings imply that juvenile golden lion tamarins can learn through food-offering calls about the availability of food at a substrate, which is consistent with (but does not prove) teaching in golden lion tamarins through stimulus enhancement. Our findings support the hypothesis that teaching might be more likely to evolve in cooperatively breeding species with complex ecological niches.","The Effects of Climate Seasonality on Behavior and Sleeping Site Choice in Sahamalaza Sportive Lemurs, Lepilemur sahamalaza.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613116,International journal of primatology,2019 01 09,"Temperature, rainfall, and resource availability may vary greatly within a single year in primate habitats. Many primate species show behavioral and physiological adaptations to this environmental seasonality, including changes to their diets and activity. Sahamalaza sportive lemurs (Lepilemur sahamalaza) inhabit the northwest of Madagascar and have been studied only during the dry, colder period of the year. We investigated potential effects of climate seasonality on this species by collecting behavioral data between October 2015 and August 2016, encompassing both the warmer wet and the colder dry seasons. We collected 773.15 hours of behavioral data on 14 individual sportive lemurs to investigate year-round activity budgets, ranging behavior, and sleeping site locations. Additionally we recorded temperature and rainfall data at our study site to describe the environmental conditions during the study period. The study individuals significantly decreased their time spent traveling and increased their time spent resting in the dry season compared to the wet season. Although home range size and path lengths did not differ over the study period, sleeping locations were significantly different between seasons as the lemurs focused on more confined areas in colder periods. Overall, the results indicate that Sahamalaza sportive lemur behavior varies with season, in line with reports for other primates."

The patient presented with a persistent head tilt and limited head rotation. Non-contrast-enhanced three-dimensional computed tomography of the cervical spine revealed several malformations including a bone cleft in the right pars interarticularis, a bone defect in both C5 lamina and the transverse foramen at C2-C3, agenesis of the right articular process of C5, bony fusion of C4-C5, and subluxation of the craniocervical joints. Several deformities of the cervical spine seen in this patient have not been associated with the 5q deletion. A review of 5q-related mutations suggests that abnormalities associated with MSX2 gene might cause cervical spine abnormalities."

The therapy ""worked"" in the context of a particularly grim life expectancy in the early 1950s and in the setting of a comprehensive therapeutic program that began in Cleveland in 1957. Although clinical studies published in the 1970s provided evidence that mist tents were ineffective or even harmful, these later studies were not necessarily more robust than earlier studies that provided evidence of mist tent efficacy, suggesting that other factors may have also contributed to mist tent abandonment. In fact, the unpalatable nature of mist tent therapy, which was described by one doctor as akin to incarceration, and studies that questioned the theoretical underpinnings of the therapy also played important roles in the eventual abandonment of mist tents.",Gender and Cortisone: Clinical Practice and Transatlantic Exchange in the Medical Management of Intersex in the 1950s.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613045,Bulletin of the history of medicine,2019 04 03,"This article complicates the history of the standardization of intersex case management developed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s by focusing on clinical practices and logics and the transatlantic circulation of knowledge. Using patient records and published studies, I follow the exchanges between pediatric endocrinologists Lawson Wilkins (Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic, Baltimore) and Andrea Prader (University Children's Hospital, Zürich) on cortisone treatment for children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), on psychosexuality and gender role, on choosing and changing the sex of intersex children, and on genital surgery. I argue that a focus on the transatlantic exchanges between these two clinics illuminates a more complex genealogy of modern intersex case management. It also provides insight into how physicians understood their clinical practice and sheds light on the messiness and pragmatic contingencies of what only in retrospect appears to have been a consistent treatment regime.",John Houghton and Medical Practice in London c. 1700.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613044,Bulletin of the history of medicine,2019 04 03,"This article considers the evidence for medical practice in London c. 1700 provided by A Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade (1692-1703) by the apothecary and Fellow of the Royal Society, John Houghton (1645-1705). Houghton discusses how products are used medicinally, as well as the necessary qualifications for a physician, and reports his own experiments and health experiences. His advertisements reveal the range of (largely medical) products he could himself supply, but he also offered an information service, often for medical practitioners, throwing light on both the supply and demand for medical practitioners in different communities and the desirable attributes of shops. Whereas most sources used to uncover medical practice highlight conflict and competition, Houghton's approach emphasizes consensus and cooperation, partly for his own ideological and commercial reasons, and partly reflecting the emergence of new forms of medical practice supported by the new science and by genteel consumer demand.",Infertility Comics and Graphic Medicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613042,Perspectives in biology and medicine,2019 01 18,"Cultures around the world are replete with images of women as the epitome of love, kindness, patience, and similar virtues, owing to their ability to give birth. Consequently, those who cannot give birth due to medical conditions are stigmatized and made to feel inadequate and deviant. Although infertility is a gender-neutral health predicament, it is women who encounter severe abjuration. Cultural scripts that glorify childbearing and stigmatize infertility impact the afflicted adversely as they destabilize their identity and aggravate their suffering as a patient. Graphic medical narratives on infertility, such as Paula Knight's The Facts of Life (2017), Emily Steinberg's Broken Eggs (2014), and Phoebe Potts's Good Eggs (2010), reflect on these issues and, in the process, illuminate how infertility fractures women's identity in a pronatalist society. This essay explores three graphic pathographies on infertility through three major themes: pronatalism and the social construction of motherhood, the absolutism of science, and alternatives to motherhood. The essay argues that the use of comics and graphic medicine, by combining visual and conceptual modes, presents the social, personal, and medical features of infertility with new force and urgency.","What-If Anything-Sets Limits to the Clinical Ethics Consultant's ""Expertise""?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613041,Perspectives in biology and medicine,2019 01 18,"The inability to reach agreement on what clinical ethics consultants' expertise consists of has generated a theoretical crisis for this field of practice. After briefly examining some recent articles on this subject, this essay focuses on the recent work of a Swedish political scientist, Maria Hedlund, who has addressed herself specifically to the political issues that claims of ethics expertise pose to democratic deliberations, and to how epistocratic claims of ethics expertise can coexist with democratic beliefs about moral expertise. Following Hedlund's lead, I conclude that at least two additional problems remain: (1) identifying ethics experts; and (2) reconciling the practice of clinical ethics consultation with philosophical issues about moral testimony.",Public Funding for Genomics and the Return on Investment: A Public Health Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613039,Perspectives in biology and medicine,2019 01 18,"This article traces the emergence of lean principles in genomics research and connects this new way of doing science with many of the current pitfalls of precision medicine in its attempts at improving population health outcomes. Precision medicine has a history of public funding, yet the benefits in clinical settings are very slowly being realized due to a variety of factors, such as uncertainty regarding relevant treatments after identifying disease risk, lack of cost-effectiveness studies for general population-level interventions, and letting a culture of ""over promise and under deliver"" permeate some areas of genomics research. The article concludes with insights into the challenges and opportunities that will need careful consideration and consultation with the wider society in order to decide whether to turn off the ""tap"" for investment of public funds in research on genomics and other ""omics.""

Hype can be described as an inappropriate exaggeration of the significance or potential value of a particular study or area of science. Evidence tells us that this spin happens throughout the science translation process. There is hype in research grants, peer-reviewed publications, scientific abstracts, institutional press releases, media representations, and, of course, in the associated marketing of a new product. There is also evidence that it has played a particularly significant role in the area of genetic research. Science hype is a complex phenomenon that involves many actors. And it is, at least to some degree, the result of systemic pressures imbedded in the current incentives associated with biomedical research.

Stroke had long been a common cause of death, however a much more virulent form of vascular disease involving the coronary arteries was now recognized as a major public health challenge. By the late 1950s, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) accounted for almost two-thirds of deaths in the US. Within 10 years, the key causal factors underlying CVD had been fully defined, and by the mid-1960s, prevention trials, policy changes, and subsequent population-wide risk factor improvement and targeted high-risk medical therapy led to a rapid and sustained decline in both coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. By the turn of the century, CVD had declined over 80%, transforming health for adults and providing the main driver of lengthening life expectancy. This transformative process has now reached every country in the world. Epidemiologic, nutritional and clinical research, along with changes in social norms, public health education, smoke-free indoor air regulations, drug development, and clinical trials have led to the astounding success of the CVD control movement. The broad pattern pursued in the control of CVD provides a template for similar control efforts aimed at cancer, diabetes, renal disease, and other common chronic diseases.",Human Molecular Genetics Has Not Yet Contributed to Measurable Public Health Advances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613036,Perspectives in biology and medicine,2019 01 18,"For more than half a century, we have lived in a world dominated by the idea that the gene is the central and primary agent in biology, an era some have called the ""Genetic Age."" Each decade since the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA in 1953 has seen scientific advances in genetics, discoveries that have led to at least 17 Nobel Prizes. Although the time span occupied by the Genetic Age has also been a time of great public health advances, no advance in human molecular genetics can be shown to have had any measurable effect on any public health parameter of importance. It is hard to think of another field of biomedical research in which such massive public fund investments have had less public health impact to date than human molecular genetics. The only arena in which precision medicine, with its reliance on human genomic information, is likely to be helpful, is selected inherited diseases. To measurably alter the health of the population, the focus of biomedical research should be on the molecular, cellular, clinical, and population effects of the external agents and exposures that drive the incidence of most health conditions.",Precision Medicine Approaches and the Health of Populations: Study Design Concerns and Considerations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613035,Perspectives in biology and medicine,2019 01 18,"Biomedical advances in the past decade have aimed to capitalize on two movements that have dominated the research conversation: precision medicine and the ascent of big data. These emerging shifts have resulted in growing confidence that we can better characterize health, predict who will get ill and with what, develop new treatments which exploit genetic, metabolic, and other vulnerabilities in cancers and infectious agents, and tailor some of these treatments to match characteristics of the individual patient and their specific disease. However, we suggest that there are important cautions. Weaknesses in the data and the methods used to study them raise three potential concerns. First, any data collected, and analysis attempted, will have limited utility absent internal validity, unless fundamental issues of accurate and consistent measurement can be addressed. Second, lack of attention to external validity limits generalizability beyond the narrow (even if large) samples in hand, so that the utility of inference that can emerge from these approaches remains limited. Third, the proposed approaches seldom include consideration of ubiquitous forces that can determine whether observed associations are truly attributable to the innovation or to other, unmeasured forces. This essay discusses these limitations and explores how they can influence inference drawn from big data precision medicine science."

However, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors, loss of EZH2 expression and increased CDKN1A oppose cell-cycle transit. Moreover, A-to-I editing of both the MDM2 regulatory microRNA and its binding site within the 3' UTR region stabilizes MDM2 transcripts, thereby enhancing blast crisis progenitor propagation. These data reveal a dual mechanism governing malignant transformation of progenitors that is predicated on hyper-editing of cell-cycle-regulatory miRNAs and the 3' UTR binding site of tumor suppressor miRNAs.",The Atypical MAP Kinase ErkB Transmits Distinct Chemotactic Signals through a Core Signaling Module.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612939,Developmental cell,2019 03 29,"Signaling from chemoattractant receptors activates the cytoskeleton of crawling cells for chemotaxis. We show using phosphoproteomics that different chemoattractants cause phosphorylation of the same core set of around 80 proteins in Dictyostelium cells. Strikingly, the majority of these are phosphorylated at an [S/T]PR motif by the atypical MAP kinase ErkB. Unlike most chemotactic responses, ErkB phosphorylations are persistent and do not adapt to sustained stimulation with chemoattractant. ErkB integrates dynamic autophosphorylation with chemotactic signaling through G-protein-coupled receptors. Downstream, our phosphoproteomics data define a broad panel of regulators of chemotaxis. Surprisingly, targets are almost exclusively other signaling proteins, rather than cytoskeletal components, revealing ErkB as a regulator of regulators rather than acting directly on the motility machinery. ErkB null cells migrate slowly and orientate poorly over broad dynamic ranges of chemoattractant. Our data indicate a central role for ErkB and its substrates in directing chemotaxis.",Brain processing of pictures of children in men with pedophilic disorder: A positron emission tomography study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612938,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 05 28,"Although structural and functional neuroimaging techniques have recently been used to investigate the mechanisms of sexual attraction to children, a hallmark of pedophilic disorder, the differences in the processing of child sexual stimuli between men attracted to children and those attracted to adults remain unclear. Here, our purpose was to identify through positron emission tomography the brain responses of 15 male outpatients with pedophilic disorder to validated visual sexual stimuli depicting children (VSSc) and to compare them with 15 male healthy controls matched for sexual orientation (to female or male adults), age, and handedness. The patients' sample comprised both offenders and non-offenders. In response to VSSc, the between-groups analysis showed that activation in the right inferior temporal cortex [Brodmann area (BA) 20] was lower in patients than in controls. Moreover, in patients but not in controls, the presentation of VSSc induced an activation in a more caudal region of the right inferior temporal gyrus (BA 37) and in the left middle occipital gyrus (BA 19). In addition, in patients the level of activation in the caudal right inferior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with ratings of sexual arousal elicited by VSSc, whereas this correlation was negative in BA 20. These results implicate the right inferior temporal gyrus as a possible candidate area mediating sexual arousal in patients with pedophilic disorder and suggest that two of its areas play opposite, i.e., activating and inhibitory, roles.",Neurocognitive decision-making processes of casual methamphetamine users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612937,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 05 28,"Neuroadaptations caused by chronic methamphetamine (MA) use are likely major contributors to high relapse rate following treatment. Thus, focusing intervention efforts at pre-empting addiction in vulnerable populations, thereby preventing MA-use-induced neurological changes that make recovery so challenging, may prove more effective than targeting chronic users. One approach is studying casual/recreational users, not diagnosed with substance use disorder. This group may be at high risk for addiction due to their experience with MA. On the other hand, they may be resilient against addiction since they were able to maintain casual use over the years and not become addicted. Understanding their neuro-cognitive characteristics during decision-making and risk-taking would help solve this dilemma and, may help identify intervention strategies. Unfortunately, research on neuro-cognitive characteristics of casual MA users is currently lacking. In this work we begin to address this deficit. This study was part of a larger investigation of neural correlates of risky sexual decision-making in men who have sex with men. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, 31 casual MA users and 66 non-users performed the CUPS task, in which they decided to accept or refuse a series of mixed gambles. Convergent results from whole brain, region of interest and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses are presented. Whole brain analysis identified an amygdala-striatal cluster with weaker activation in casual MA users compared to non-users during decision-making. Activity in that cluster inversely correlated with decisions to gamble: lower activation corresponded to higher risk taking. Using this cluster as a seed in PPI analyses, we identified a wide range of neural network differences between casual MA users and non-users. Parametric whole brain analyses identified clusters in the ventral striatum, posterior insula and precuneus where activations modulated by risk and reward were significantly weaker in casual MA users than in non-users. The striatal cluster identified in these analyses overlapped with the amygdala-striatal cluster. This work identified neural differences in casual MA users' reward processing and outcome learning systems which may underlie their increased real-world risk-taking. It suggests that while making decisions casual MA users focus primarily on potential gain unlike non-users who also take the riskiness of the choice into consideration.",Patient-reported Outcomes in Metastatic Castration-sensitive Prostate Cancer in the Adjuvant Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612936,European urology focus,2019 04 29,"We review the importance of quality of life (QOL) data from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) among men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) or localized prostate cancer treated with adjuvant therapy. This information is important for patients as they make treatment choices and for regulatory agencies approving drug therapies. Studies of treatments for mCSPC suggest that the improvements in survival associated with more intensive systemic treatment are accompanied by improvements in QOL. ADT prolongs survival among men with intermediate- or high-risk localized disease in combination with radiation, but the optimal duration is still being defined. For men with biochemical recurrence, starting ADT earlier rather than later had minimal adverse effects on QOL but may not prolong survival. We conclude that rigorous assessment of QOL with validated PROMs must be a priority for clinical trials of novel and more intensive approaches to treatment with ADT.

New antidepressants drugs (agomelatine, tianeptine, vortioxetine) are providing data that give rise to pathophysiological hypotheses of depression that differ from the classic monoaminergic theory. In this sense, tianeptina, an atypical drug by its mechanism of differential action, contributes to clarify that in depression there is more than monoamines. Thus, tianeptine does not modify the rate of extracellular serotonin, so it does not increase or decrease the reuptake of serotonin. Chronic administration of tianeptine does not alter the density or affinity of more than a hundred classical receptors related to depression. Recently, a weak action of tianeptine on Mu opioid receptors has been described that could explain the release of dopamine in the limbic system and its participation in the modulation of glutamatergic mechanisms. These mechanisms support the hypothesis of the possible mechanism of action of this antidepressant. Tianeptine is an antidepressant, with anxiolytic properties, that can improve somatic symptoms. Tianeptine as a glutamatergic modulator, among other mechanisms, allows us to approach depression from a different point of view than other antidepressants."

Robust neurotransmission depends on the replenishment of synaptic components in a spatially precise manner. Using live-cell microscopy and single-molecule reconstitution assays, we find that the delivery of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) to en passant synapses in hippocampal neurons is specified by an interplay between the kinesin-3 KIF1A motor and presynaptic microtubules. Presynaptic sites are hotspots of dynamic microtubules rich in GTP-tubulin. KIF1A binds more weakly to GTP-tubulin than GDP-tubulin and competes with end-binding (EB) proteins for binding to the microtubule plus end. A disease-causing mutation within KIF1A that reduces preferential binding to GDP- versus GTP-rich microtubules disrupts SVP delivery and reduces presynaptic release upon neuronal stimulation. Thus, the localized enrichment of dynamic microtubules along the axon specifies a localized unloading zone that ensures the accurate delivery of SVPs, controlling presynaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.",Diminished Jak/STAT Signaling Causes Early-Onset Aging Defects in Stem Cell Cytokinesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612906,Current biology : CB,2019 03 29,"Tissue renewal becomes compromised with age. Although defects in niche and stem cell behavior have been implicated in promoting age-related decline, the causes of early-onset aging defects are unknown. We have identified an early consequence of aging in germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila testis. Aging disrupts the unique program of GSC cytokinesis, with GSCs failing to abscise from their daughter cells. Abscission failure significantly disrupts both self-renewal and the generation of differentiating germ cells. Extensive live imaging and genetic analyses show that abscission failure is due to inappropriate retention of F-actin at the intercellular bridges between GSC-daughter cells. Furthermore, F-actin is regulated by the Jak/STAT pathway-increasing or decreasing pathway activity can rescue or exacerbate the age-induced abscission defect, respectively. Even subtle decreases to STAT activity are sufficient to precociously age young GSCs and induce abscission failure. Thus, this work has identified the earliest age-related defect in GSCs and has revealed a unique role for an established niche signaling pathway in controlling stem cell cytokinesis and in regulating stem cell behavior with age.",Photogeometric Cues to Perceived Surface Shading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612905,Current biology : CB,2019 01 22,"The human visual system is remarkably adept at extracting the three-dimensional (3D) shape of surfaces from images of smoothly shaded surfaces (shape from shading). Most research into this remarkable perceptual ability has focused on understanding how the visual system derives a specific representation of 3D shape when it is known (or assumed) that shading and self-occluding contours are the sole causes of image structure [1-11]. But there is an even more fundamental problem that must be solved before any such analysis can take place: how does the visual system determine when it's viewing a shaded surface? Here, we present theoretical analyses showing that there is statistically reliable information generated along the bounding contours of smoothly curved surfaces that the visual system uses to identify surface shading. This information can be captured by two photogeometric constraints that link the shape of bounding contours to the distributions of shading intensity along the contours: one that links shading intensity to the local orientations along bounding contours and a second that links shading intensity to bounding contour curvature. We show that these constraints predict the perception of shading for surfaces with smooth self-occluding contours and a widely studied class of bounding contours (planar cuts). The results provide new insights into the information that the visual system exploits to distinguish surface shading from other sources of image structure and offer a coherent explanation of the influence of bounding contours on the perception of surface shading and 3D shape.",Bidirectional Propagation of Signals and Nutrients in Fungal Networks via Specialized Hyphae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612903,Current biology : CB,2019 01 22,"Intercellular distribution of nutrients and coordination of responses to internal and external cues via endogenous signaling molecules are hallmarks of multicellular organisms. Vegetative mycelia of multicellular fungi are syncytial networks of interconnected hyphae resulting from hyphal tip growth, branching, and fusion. Such mycelia can reach considerable dimensions and, thus, different parts can be exposed to quite different environmental conditions. Our knowledge about the mechanisms by which fungal mycelia can adjust nutrient gradients or coordinate their defense response to fungivores is scarce, in part due to limitations in technologies currently available for examining different parts of a mycelium over longer time periods at the microscopic level. Here, we combined a tailor-made microfluidic platform with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to visualize the dynamic response of the vegetative mycelium of a basidiomycete to two different stimuli. The microfluidic platform allows simultaneous monitoring at both the colony and single-hypha level. We followed the dynamics of the distribution of a locally administered nutrient analog and the defense response to spatially confined predation by a fungivorous nematode. Although both responses of the mycelium were constrained locally, we observed long-distance propagation for both the nutrient analog and defense response in a subset of hyphae. This propagation along hyphae occurred in both acropetal and basipetal directions and, intriguingly, the direction was found to alternate every 3 hr in an individual hypha. These results suggest that multicellular fungi have, as of yet, undescribed mechanisms to coordinate the distribution of nutrients and their behavioral response upon attack by fungivores.",Characteristics of professionalism of specialists and advantages of multidisciplinary teams in thyroid cancer: results of a national opinion survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612901,"Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2019 01 28,The opinion of professionals about multidisciplinary teams (MDT) in thyroid cancer has not been studied in Spain.

To investigate the role of senescence in obesity-related neuropsychiatric dysfunction, we used the INK-ATTAC mouse model, from which p16Ink4a-expressing senescent cells can be eliminated, and senolytic drugs dasatinib and quercetin. We found that obesity results in the accumulation of senescent glial cells in proximity to the lateral ventricle, a region in which adult neurogenesis occurs.

GPCRs mediate many central physiological processes, making them important targets for modern drug discovery. Here, we focus on the most recent breakthroughs in finding new binding sites and binding modes of GPCRs and their potentials for the development of new medicines.",ExtraCorporeal life support for Cardiac ARrest in patients with post cardiac arrest syndrome: The ECCAR study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612896,Archives of cardiovascular diseases,2019 06 13,Post cardiac arrest shock (PCAS) occurring after resuscitated cardiac arrest (CA) is a main cause of early death.

Here, we show that multisite phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) alters target selection. Agonist-inducible phosphorylation of glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase (EPRS) by S6K1 in monocytes and adipocytes requires not only canonical phosphorylation at Thr389 by mTORC1 but also phosphorylation at Ser424 and Ser429 in the C terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). S6K1 phosphorylation at these additional sites induces a conformational switch and is essential for high-affinity binding and phosphorylation of EPRS, but not canonical S6K1 targets, e.g., ribosomal protein S6. Unbiased proteomic analysis identified additional targets phosphorylated by multisite phosphorylated S6K1 in insulin-stimulated adipocytes-namely, coenzyme A synthase, lipocalin 2, and cortactin. Thus, embedded within S6K1 is a target-selective kinase phospho-code that integrates signals from mTORC1 and Cdk5 to direct an insulin-stimulated, post-translational metabolon determining adipocyte lipid metabolism.",The Crohn's Disease Risk Factor IRGM Limits NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation by Impeding Its Assembly and by Mediating Its Selective Autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612879,Molecular cell,2019 05 30,"Several large-scale genome-wide association studies genetically linked IRGM to Crohn's disease and other inflammatory disorders in which the IRGM appears to have a protective function. However, the mechanism by which IRGM accomplishes this anti-inflammatory role remains unclear. Here, we reveal that IRGM/Irgm1 is a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that IRGM expression, which is increased by PAMPs, DAMPs, and microbes, can suppress the pro-inflammatory responses provoked by the same stimuli. IRGM/Irgm1 negatively regulates IL-1β maturation by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, we show that IRGM interacts with NLRP3 and ASC and hinders inflammasome assembly by blocking their oligomerization. Further, IRGM mediates selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3 and ASC. By suppressing inflammasome activation, IRGM/Irgm1 protects from pyroptosis and gut inflammation in a Crohn's disease experimental mouse model. This study for the first time identifies the mechanism by which IRGM is protective against inflammatory disorders.",Biomonitoring of metals and trace elements in urine of central Ethiopian populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612877,International journal of hygiene and environmental health,2019 04 02,"Biomonitoring of chemical concentrations in humans is important for detecting, monitoring, and addressing a wide range of health threats. However, it is virtually absent across many African nations, including Ethiopia. This study aims to determine urinary concentrations for metals and trace elements in populations living in the central Ethiopian Rift Valley. The region is unindustralized, rural, and characterized by unique geologic rifting and volcanic activities that have produced vast pyroclastic materials, forming its aquifer and fertile agricultural soils. Millions of people in the region rely on wells for drinking water and are engaged in cereal-based subsistence agriculture. We enrolled a total of 386 residents aged 10-50 years old (201 females and 185 males). The levels of 23 elements except F─ were quantified in water and urine samples by ICP-MS. Mean concentrations of B, F─, Ca, and Mg were measured in mg/L levels, while concentrations of Mo, Zn, Sr, Rb, and Li ranged between 100 and 700 μg/L. Mean concentrations between 5 and 15 μg/L were found for Ni, Cu, and Mn, while Ag, Be, Cd, Co, Pb, Sb, Th, TI, and U were all below 5 μg/L. Arsenic and Al had mean concentrations between 30 and 50 μg/L. Mean urinary concentrations of Ca, Cu, Mg, Pb, Sr, and Zn were significantly higher in males than females, whereas Co and Mn were higher in females. Finally, younger individuals (10-30 years) had significantly higher mean concentrations of B, Cd, Co, Mg, Mo, and Pb than those between 31 and 50 years, whereas only Ca was higher in the older age group. The concentration ranges of B, Mo, Mn, TI, Li, Zn, and in particular F─ (0.44-44.6 mg/L) and As (2.2-164 μg/L) in urine were higher than the reference ranges reported in healthy unexposed North American and European populations, while those for the remaining 16 elements were comparable to published reference ranges from such settings. The established concentration ranges are important to monitor future changes in exposure, and risk factors for disease, that might stem from the economic growth and industrialization that is currently underway in the region.",Unstable Ankle Fracture Fixation Using Locked Fibular Intramedullary Nail in High-Risk Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612876,The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,2019 03 09,"Open reduction internal fixation is the gold standard for unstable ankle fracture fixation; however, complications in patients with multiple medical comorbidities are common. Intramedullary nail fixation of the fibula can help to mitigate these difficulties. A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients who underwent fixation for unstable ankle fracture between January 2015 and March 2016 at our level I trauma center. Comorbidities in the patient sample included were one or several of diabetes, renal disease, hypertension, advanced age with osteoporosis, hemorrhagic blisters, and alcoholism. The primary outcomes studied were wound complications, infections, and hardware failure or failure of fixation. Eighteen patients with a mean age of 61 years underwent fibular intramedullary nail fixation, all of whom were considered at high risk for postoperative complications. Patients presented with Weber B or C fracture patterns. All patients had syndesmotic fixation through the nail by one or two 3.5-mm tricortical screws. A medial malleolus was added if needed for stability. The average follow-up time was 291.1 (range 9 to 14 months) days. The prescribed range of time to weightbearing was 2 to 6 weeks. All patients maintained reduction of the fracture and had no wound complications. No syndesmotic screws broke postoperatively, although most patients to failed comply with the postoperative non-weightbearing restrictions. Intramedullary nailing of the fibula with syndesmotic intranail fixation is minimally invasive, quick, and provides adequate fixation strength. It offers a viable treatment option for patients at high risk for complications or who are suspected to have difficulty with follow-up or compliance.","Chlorhexidine 0.5%/70% Alcohol and Iodine 1%/70% Alcohol Both Reduce Bacterial Load in Clean Foot Surgery: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612875,The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,2019 03 09,"No consensus exists regarding which cleansing technique, solution, and concentration should be used in orthopedic surgery. The aim of this randomized, controlled trial was to compare the effect of chlorhexidine 0.5%/70% alcohol with iodine 1%/70% alcohol on lowering positive cultures before elective foot surgery and to study any wound complications, infections and allergic reactions. Consecutive patients ≥18 years of age scheduled for a hallux valgus correction or arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint were included. Swabs were taken from 2 sites before and twice after preparing the skin and were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The study group consisted of 49 patients with a mean age of 52.3 ± 14.4 (range 22 to 75) years of whom 42 (86%) were female. No significant differences were observed for positive cultures between the chlorhexidine (73%, 2%, and 12%) and iodine (68%, 7%, and 9%) group at any time point. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most commonly isolated micro-organisms found after skin preparation. Occasionally, Bacillus spp and Corynebacterium spp were cultured. The complication rate 2 weeks postoperatively was 0% in the chlorhexidine group versus 8.7% (n = 2) in the iodine group (delayed wound healing; p = .215). The complication rate at 6 weeks postoperatively was, respectively, 3.8% (n = 1) versus 4.3% (n = 1; both showed swelling and redness; p > .999).

This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes after intralesional epidermal growth factor injections in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Thirty-six feet of 34 patients (n = 34) with diabetic foot ulcers were included. Patient demographics, Wagner classifications, recurrence and amputation rates, Foot Function Index, Short Form 36, and American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons Foot and Ankle Module scores were evaluated at the final follow-up examination. The mean age was 61.000 ± 13.743 years. The mean duration of wounds was 240.200 ± 146.385 days. A mean of 18.125 ± 4.494 (range 9 to 24) doses were applied. Wound closure was achieved in 33 of the 36 (91.7%) lesions. A complete response (granulation tissue >75% or wound closure) was observed in 29 (87.9%) lesions. The mean time to wound closure was 52.08 ± 10.65 (range 25 to 72) days. At the 5-year follow-up, 4 patients were lost to follow-up because of exitus owing to diabetic complications.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a hindfoot arthrodesis nail with an internal pseudoelastic nitinol compression element. Patients who had undergone tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis from 2013 to 2016 were identified at 2 tertiary referral centers (12-week follow-up minimum). Patients managed with a tibiotalocalcaneal nail with an internal nitinol compression element were identified for review. Sagittal computed tomographic scan reformats were reviewed to calculate a percentage of joint surface bony union. Intraoperative and postoperative radiographs were compared to calculate postoperative screw position change generated by the nitinol element, a surrogate for postoperative unloading of compressive forces. Thirty-three patients were included in analysis and 81% of patients had successful union of both tibiotalar and subtalar joints. Overall, 90% of all arthrodesis surfaces united. The union rate of arthrodesis surfaces among patients without Charcot osteoarthropathy was 94%. A history of Charcot was identified as a risk factor for subtalar nonunion (p = .04) and was associated with less complete computed tomography-based tibiotalar union: 94% versus 71% (p < .01). The posterior-to-anterior screw translated an average of 3.9 mm proximally relative to the rigid portion of the nail from intraoperative to initial postoperative radiographs (p < .0001). High rates of computed tomography-confirmed union were demonstrated in the face of challenging clinical scenarios. Shortening of the pseudoelastic nitinol element occurs early in the postoperative period, indicating continued unloading of the nitinol compression element through the arthrodesis sites after initial implantation."

Here, we delineate a heterogeneous group of trimeric membrane-anchored proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotic organelles with a characteristic head-neck-stalk-anchor architecture, in which a membrane-anchored coiled-coil stalk projects an N-terminal head domain via a β-layer neck. Based on sequence analysis, we identify different types of head domains and determine crystal structures of two representatives, the archaeal protein Kcr-0859 and the human CCDC90B, which possesses the most widespread head type. Using mitochondrial calcium uniporter regulator 1 (MCUR1), the functionally characterized paralog of CCDC90B, we study the role of individual domains, and find that the head interacts directly with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and is destabilized upon Ca2+ binding. Our data provide structural details of a class of membrane-bound coiled-coil proteins and identify the conserved head domain of the most widespread type as a mediator of their function.","Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Multiple Doses of the Novel Oxytocin Receptor Antagonist Cligosiban in Development for Premature Ejaculation: Two Randomized Clinical Trials in Healthy Subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612858,The journal of sexual medicine,2019 02 16,Cligosiban (formerly IX-01) is a selective oxytocin receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE).,NF-kB signaling in myeloid cells mediates the pathogenesis of immune-mediated nephritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612857,Journal of autoimmunity,2019 04 01,"Immune-mediated glomerulonephritis is a serious end organ pathology that commonly affects patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A classic murine model used to study lupus nephritis (LN) is nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTN), in which mice are passively transferred nephrotoxic antibodies. We have previously shown that macrophages are important in the pathogenesis of LN. To further investigate the mechanism by which macrophages contribute to the pathogenic process, and to determine if this contribution is mediated by NF-κB signaling, we created B6 mice which had RelA knocked out in myeloid cells, thus inhibiting classical NF-κB signaling in this cell lineage. We induced NTN in this strain to assess the importance of macrophage derived NF-κB signaling in contributing to disease progression. Myeloid cell RelA knock out (KO) mice injected with nephrotoxic serum had significantly attenuated proteinuria, lower BUN levels, and improved renal histopathology compared to control injected wildtype B6 mice (WT). Inhibiting myeloid NF-κB signaling also decreased inflammatory modulators within the kidneys. We found significant decreases of IL-1a, IFNg, and IL-6 in kidneys from KO mice, but higher IL-10 expression. Flow cytometry revealed decreased numbers of kidney infiltrating classically activated macrophages in KO mice as well. Our results indicate that macrophage NF-κB signaling is instrumental in the contribution of this cell type to the pathogenesis of NTN. While approaches which decrease macrophage numbers can be effective in immune mediated nephritis, more targeted treatments directed at modulating macrophage signaling and/or function could be beneficial, at least in the early stages of disease.","""Prehabilitation"" in degenerative spine surgery: A literature review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612856,"Neurocirugia (Asturias, Spain)",2019 04 30,"Surgery for lumbar degenerative pathology, although effective, results in suboptimal outcome and degrees of disability in a relevant proportion of patients. Postoperative rehabilitation has failed to demonstrate efficacy in the mid and long term. So-called ""prehabilitation"" (physiotherapy and/or cognitive-behavioral therapy) focuses in augmenting patients' functional capacities before surgery by improving their physical condition and their perception of pain, surgical experience or its consequences. Several studies suggest that prehabilitation improves postoperative outcome, shortens hospital stay and may reduce costs compared to classic postoperative rehabilitation. However, its true effect seems to be influenced by factors like obesity, co-morbidity and, especially, by a wrong perception of the natural history of this pathology in terms of catastrophising and kinesiphobia. In this paper we describe the concept of prehabilitation, review the literature, and discuss the role of some clinical conditionings involved.","A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of lamotrigine for prescription corticosteroid effects on the human hippocampus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612854,European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 04 29,"In animals, stress and corticosteroid excess are associated with decreases in memory performance and hippocampal volume that may be prevented with agents that decrease glutamate release.

A total of 54 outpatient adults (n = 28 women) receiving chronic (≥ 6 months) oral corticosteroid therapy were randomized to lamotrigine or placebo for 48 weeks. Declarative memory was assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT); structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (1HMRS) focused on hippocampus were obtained at baseline and week 48.

The present study aimed to investigate the occurrence of Prototheca and persistence of Prototheca zopfii strains in Korean dairy herds. A total of 187 (7.5%) P. zopfii strains were isolated from 2,508 quarter milk samples collected from 50 dairy farms throughout Korea from 2015 to 2017. Prototheca zopfii was isolated from one farm among the 50 farms over the 3-yr period. The P. zopfii isolates belonged to genotype 2. Overall, Prototheca-positive quarter milk samples showed high somatic cell counts with an average value of log 6.48 ± 6.54 cells/mL. Prototheca zopfii was found to be persistent in an infected farm over a 2-yr period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence and persistence of protothecal mastitis caused by P. zopfii genotype 2 in a Korean dairy herd. This disease leads to a significant increase in somatic cell counts in milk, which persists for more than 1 yr in the affected cow udder. These results suggest that P. zopfii could pose a serious risk to dairy herds. Thus, strict surveillance for protothecal mastitis is urgently needed and sanitary conditions regarding the environment and milk collection are essential because of the lack of effective treatment options.",Reducing methane production with corn oil and calcium sulfate: Responses on whole-animal energy and nitrogen balance in dairy cattle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612805,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 04,"The addition of fat and calcium sulfate to diets fed to ruminants has resulted in a reduction in methane production, but the effects on energy balance have not been studied. A study using indirect calorimetry and 16 multiparous (8 Holstein and 8 Jersey; 78 ± 15 d in milk; mean ± standard deviation) lactating dairy cows was conducted to determine how mitigating methane production by adding corn oil or calcium sulfate to diets containing reduced-fat distillers grains affects energy and nitrogen balance. A replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 35-d periods (28 d of adaption and 4 d of collections) was used to compare 4 different dietary treatments. Treatments were composed of a control (CON) diet, which did not contain reduced-fat distillers grain and solubles (DDGS), and treatment diets containing 20% (dry matter basis) DDGS (DG), 20% DDGS with 1.38% (dry matter basis) added corn oil (CO), and 20% DDGS with 0.93% (dry matter basis) added calcium sulfate (CaS). Compared with CON, dry matter intake was not affected by treatment, averaging 29.6 ± 0.67 kg/d. Milk production was increased for diets containing DDGS compared with CON (26.3 vs. 27.8 ± 0.47 kg/d for CON vs. DDGS, respectively), likely supported by increased energy intake. Compared with CON, energy-corrected milk was greater in DG and CO (30.1 vs. 31.4, 31.7, and 31.0 ± 0.67 kg/d for CON, DG, CO, and CaS, respectively). Compared with CON, the addition of calcium sulfate and corn oil to diets containing DDGS reduced methane production per kg of dry matter intake (22.3, 19.9, and 19.6 ± 0.75 L/kg per d for CON, CO, and CaS, respectively). Similarly, methane production per kilogram of energy-corrected milk was reduced with the addition of calcium sulfate and corn oil to diets containing DDGS (14.2, 12.5, and 12.4 ± 0.50 L/kg per d for CON, CO, and CaS, respectively). Compared with CON and CaS, the intake of digestible energy was greater for DG and CO treatments (57.7, 62.1, 62.0, and 59.0 ± 1.38 Mcal/d for CON, DG, CO, and CaS, respectively). Intake of metabolizable energy was greater in all treatments containing DDGS compared with CON (50.5 vs. 54.0 ± 1.08 Mcal/d for CON vs. DDGS, respectively). Net balance (milk plus tissue energy) per unit of dry matter was greater in CO (containing DDGS and oil) than CON (1.55 vs. 1.35 ± 0.06 Mcal/kg for CO vs. CON, respectively). Tissue energy was greater in DG and CO compared with CON (6.08, 7.04, and 3.16 ± 0.99 Mcal/d for DG, CO, and CON, respectively. Results of this study suggest that the addition of oil and calcium sulfate to diets containing DDGS may be a viable option to reduce methane production and in the case of oil also improve net energy balance in lactating dairy cows.",Increasing the concentration of linolenic acid in diets fed to Jersey cows in late lactation does not affect methane production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612804,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 08,"Although the inclusion of fat has reduced methane production in ruminants, relatively little research has been conducted comparing the effects of source and profile of fatty acids on methane production in lactating dairy cows. A study using 8 multiparous (325 ± 17 DIM; mean ± SD) lactating Jersey cows was conducted to determine effects of feeding canola meal and lard versus extruded byproduct containing flaxseed as a high-C18:3 fat source on methane production and diet digestibility in late-lactation dairy cows. A crossover design with 32-d periods (28-d adaptation and 4-d collections) was used to compare 2 different fat sources. Diets contained approximately 50% forage mixture of corn silage, alfalfa hay, and brome hay; the concentrate mixture changed between diets to include either (1) a conventional diet of corn, soybean meal, and canola meal with lard (control) or (2) a conventional diet of corn and soybean meal with an extruded byproduct containing flaxseed (EXF) as the fat source. Diets were balanced to decrease corn, lard, and canola meal and replace them with soybean mean and EXF to increase the concentration of C18:3 (0.14 vs. 1.20% of DM). Methane production was measured using headbox-style indirect calorimeters. Cattle were restricted to 95% ad libitum feed intake during collections. Milk production (17.4 ± 1.04 kg/d) and dry matter intake (15.4 ± 0.71 kg/d) were similar among treatments. Milk fat (5.88 ± 0.25%) and protein (4.08 ± 0.14%) were not affected by treatment. For methane production, no difference was observed for total production (352.0 vs. 349.8 ± 16.43 L/d for control vs. EXF, respectively). Methane production per unit of dry matter intake was not affected and averaged 23.1 ± 0.57 L/kg. Similarly, methane production per unit of energy-corrected milk was not affected by fat source and averaged 15.5 ± 0.68 L/kg. Heat production was similar, averaging 21.1 ± 1.02 Mcal/d. Digestibility of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and crude protein was not affected by diet and averaged 69.9, 53.6, and 73.3%, respectively. Results indicated that increasing C18:3 may not affect methane production or digestibility of the diet in lactating dairy cows.",Dairy farmers' perspectives on antibiotic use: A qualitative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612802,Journal of dairy science,2019 03 25,"An important step in limiting the development of antibiotic resistance is reducing use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. Much research in this area has focused on individual farmer behavior, aiming to better align actual use with medical recommendations. However, farmers' practices and reasoning around their antibiotic use do not reflect solely that farmer as an individual. Rather, practices and worldviews are guided by context (e.g., veterinary advice, peer pressure, regulation, and interactions with farm animals). Studies that jointly embrace farmer agency and the wider structures for this agency, however, remain scarce. This paper draws on theories of behavior as socially constructed, and in particular on the concept of the ""good farmer,"" to interpret findings from a study of 7 Swedish dairy farms. The results show that all farmers have close daily contact with their animals, have strong emotional ties, and place emphasis on the importance of being able to judge animal health status by eye. Half of the farms use an automatic milking system, and for these farmers automation means better monitoring of animal health without losing contact with the cows. The local veterinarian is considered a positive and important authority whose advice is valued. Despite comparatively strict antibiotic use regulations in Sweden, the farmers do not report lack of access to antibiotics when needed. However, they report feeling disadvantaged in international trade and poorly treated by the Swedish government, which allows imports of cheaper meat and dairy products produced under less strict regulations. The farmers are well informed about how to prevent and treat common diseases. In cases where they do not follow recommendations, we found that economic and labor constraints are the reason rather than lack of knowledge. We concluded that structural limitations faced by farmers, rather than lack of information, impose constraints to further limiting antibiotic use in Sweden. Overall stricter and more uniform global regulations on antibiotic use in animal farming could be an effective measure for reducing antibiotic use.",Meta-analysis of the effects of prepartum dietary cation-anion difference on performance and health of dairy cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612801,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 08,"The objectives were to use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of changes in dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) prepartum on productive performance and health of dairy cows. The literature was systematically reviewed, searching randomized experiments with transition cows that manipulated the prepartum DCAD or experiments with acidogenic diets in which dietary Ca, P, or Mg was manipulated. Forty-two experiments, including 134 treatment means and 1,803 cows, were included in the meta-analysis. Of those, 5 experiments with 15 treatment means reported responses for 151 nulliparous cows. Data collected included the mineral composition of prepartum diets, parity group prepartum, breed, days on treatment, and means and respective measure of variance for urine pH, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight, body condition, productive performance, concentrations of minerals and metabolites in blood, and incidence of diseases. Mixed effects meta-analyses were conducted weighting by the inverse of standard error of the means squared to account for the precision of each experiment. Models include the effects of DCAD, parity group prepartum, interaction between DCAD and parity group, and other covariates that showed significance in univariable analysis. Final models were selected based on parsimony and model fit. Reducing the prepartum DCAD reduced intake prepartum but improved intake postpartum in both parity groups. Interactions between DCAD and parity group occurred for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk (FCM), fat, and protein because reducing the DCAD improved those responses in parous cows; however, reducing the DCAD either had no effect on yields of milk and protein or reduced the yield of FCM and fat in nulliparous cows. The resulting equations from the statistical models predicted that reducing the DCAD from +200 to -100 mEq/kg would increase blood total Ca on the day of calving from 1.86 to 2.04 ± 0.05 mM, DMI postpartum 1.0 kg/d, and milk yield 1.7 kg/d in parous cows. The increased concentrations of blood total Ca at calving and postpartum explained the marked reduction in risk of milk fever in parous cows with a reduction in DCAD. As the DCAD decreased, the risk of retained placenta and metritis also decreased, resulting in fewer disease events per cow in both nulliparous and parous cows. Dietary concentrations of Ca, P, or Mg prepartum had no effect on DMI or yields of milk and FCM; however, increasing dietary Ca within the study range of 0.16 to 1.98% of dry matter tended to increase the risk of milk fever in parous cows regardless of DCAD fed. Collectively, results support the recommendation of prepartum acidogenic diets to result in a negative DCAD to parous cows with improvements in lactation performance and reduced risk of diseases; however, the range of DCAD fed did not allow for detection of an optimum value for postpartum performance. On the other hand, despite improvements in blood concentrations of Ca and reduction in uterine diseases with a reduction in DCAD fed to nulliparous cows, productive performance was either depressed or unaffected and the limited number of experiments did not provide sufficient evidence for a recommended DCAD for this group of cows.",Milk production of Holstein-Friesian cows of divergent Economic Breeding Index evaluated under seasonal pasture-based management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612799,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 11,"The objective of this study was to validate the effect of genetic improvement using the Irish genetic merit index, the Economic Breeding Index (EBI), on total lactation performance and lactation profiles for milk yield, milk solids yield (fat plus protein; kg), and milk fat, protein, and lactose content within 3 pasture-based feeding treatments (FT) and to investigate whether an interaction exists between genetic group (GG) of Holstein-Friesian and pasture-based FT. The 2 GG were (1) extremely high EBI representative of the top 5% nationally (referred to as the elite group) and (2) representative of the national average EBI (referred to as the NA group). Cows from each GG were randomly allocated each year to 1 of 3 pasture-based FT: control, lower grass allowance, and high concentrate. The effects of GG, FT, year, parity, and the interaction between GG and FT adjusted for calving day of year on milk and milk solids (fat plus protein; kg) production across lactation were studied using mixed models. Cow was nested within GG to account for repeated cow records across years. The overall and stage of lactation-specific responses to concentrate supplementation (high concentrate vs. control) and reduced pasture allowance (lower grass allowance vs. control) were tested. Profiles of daily milk yield, milk solids yield, and milk fat, protein, and lactose content for each week of lactation for the elite and NA groups within each FT and for each parity group within the elite and NA groups were generated. Phenotypic performance was regressed against individual cow genetic potential based on predicted transmitting ability. The NA cows produced the highest milk yield. Milk fat and protein content was higher for the elite group and consequently yield of solids-corrected milk was similar, whereas yield of milk solids tended to be higher for the elite group compared with the NA group. Milk lactose content did not differ between GG. Responses to concentrate supplementation or reduced pasture allowance did not differ between GG. Milk production profiles illustrated that elite cows maintained higher production but with lower persistency than NA cows. Regression of phenotypic performance against predicted transmitting ability illustrated that performance was broadly in line with expectation. The results illustrate that the superiority of high-EBI cattle is consistent across diverse pasture-based FT. The results also highlight the success of the EBI to deliver production performance in line with the national breeding objective: lower milk volume with higher fat and protein content.",Evaluation of powdered 0.5% chlorhexidine acetate-based postmilking teat dip compared with a foamed 1% iodine-based postmilking teat dip under cold weather conditions in northern New York.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612797,Journal of dairy science,2019 04 10,"The objective of this trial was to compare a powdered 0.5% chlorhexidine acetate-based postmilking teat dip with a foamed 1% iodine-based postmilk teat dip during winter on clinical mastitis, subclinical mastitis (somatic cell count ≥200,000 cells/mL), linear score, teat skin condition, teat end score for hyperkeratosis, and risk of developing a new intramammary infection (IMI). Holstein cows (n = 331) housed in freestall and tiestall barns on one farm were blocked by pen, parity, lactation stage, and lactation performance. They were assigned randomly to a powdered chlorhexidine postmilking teat dip (PD; Derma Soft n' Dry, IBA Inc., Millbury, MA) or a foamed iodine-based postmilking teat dip (ID; FS-103, IBA Inc.). Treatments were applied for 6 wk starting January 4, 2016, for 3 milkings per day. Milk samples were collected from each quarter at the beginning and end of the trial and analyzed for aerobic culture and somatic cell count. Cows that had a clinical mastitis event during the trial were quarter sampled for aerobic culture at the time of clinical event. Teat skin condition and teat end score for hyperkeratosis were evaluated at the beginning, middle, and end of the trial based on a 3- and 5-point scale, respectively. No treatment difference was observed for linear score or teat skin condition. Teat end score was greater for ID cows compared with PD cows (2.72 vs. 2.77) at the conclusion of the trial. At the beginning of trial 102 PD quarters and 129 ID quarters had an IMI identified on aerobic culture, 402 PD and 457 ID quarters cultured negative, and 109 PD and 125 ID samples were classified as ""no significant growth."" At the conclusion of the trial, 129 PD and 101 ID quarters had an IMI. Use of PD resulted in a greater risk for developing a new IMI, based on bacteriological culture, at the conclusion of the trial as compared with ID (relative risk = 1.51; confidence interval: 1.10-2.07). Additionally, use of PD resulted in a greater risk as compared with ID of coagulase-negative staphylococci (relative risk = 1.5; confidence interval: 1.10-2.25) and Staphylococccus aureus (relative risk = 2.30; confidence interval: 1.04-5.07) to be present at the conclusion of the trial. In conclusion, use of PD led to a lower teat end score, an increase in new IMI, and an increased risk of coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staph. aureus compared with ID after 6 wk of product use."

A point mutation (R100W) in the NGFB gene was found in patients with Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy type V (HSAN V), which leads to pain insensitivity. In a previous work it has been shown that the mutation provokes a reduced secretion of mature NGF. In this study we generated and analyzed homozygous NGFR100W/R100W mice to understand whether the reduced NGF bioavailability can contribute to the clinical phenotype of the homozygous condition. We found that the majority of NGFR100W/R100W mice were born normal but failed to reach the first month of age. This early lethality was rescued by daily treatment with wild type NGF. In addition, we found that the density of cholinergic neurons of homozygous mice was unaffected in the medial septum and in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, whereas, suprisingly, it was increased specifically in the striatum. Due to the known action of the striatal cholinergic tone in modulating pain, our findings support the hypothesis that a central mechanism, linked to the NGFR100W-dependent increase of the striatal cholinergic tone, can contribute to the pain insensitivity observed in HSAN V patients.",MicroRNA expression profiling of adult hippocampal neural stem cells upon cell death reveals an autophagic cell death-like pattern.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612732,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 20,"Adult hippocampal neural (HCN) stem cells promptly undergo irreversible autophagic cell death (ACD) if deprived of insulin in culture. Small, non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) play an important role in regulating biological processes, including proliferation and cell death. However, there have been no reports thus far regarding miRNA involvement in the induction of adult HCN stem cell death under insulin-deprived conditions, for which we performed a microarray-based analysis to examine the expression signature of miRNAs in adult rat HCN stem cells. Three independent specimens per culture condition either with or without insulin were prepared and a miRNA microarray analysis carried out. A total of 12 exhibited significantly altered expression levels upon cell death due to the absence of insulin when compared to HCN stem cells cultured with insulin present (cut-off limit; p < 0.05 and fold-change >1.3) The resulting volcano plot showed that, among these miRNAs, seven were upregulated and five were downregulated. The upregulated miRNAs were capable of modulating HCN stem cell death. Caspase-3 activity analysis, LC3 conversion, and TEM of autophagosome formation consistently suggested that ACD, not apoptosis, was most likely the mechanism affecting HCN cell death. As such, we have come to term these miRNAs, ""HCN stem cell-specific autophagic cell death regulators."" Taken together, our data suggest that the miRNA expression profile of HCN stem cells is altered during ACD occurring due to insulin deprivation and that differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in HCN stem cell viability. Detailed explorations of the underlying mechanisms regarding HCN stem cell viability modulation by these miRNAs would be beneficial in further understanding the physiological features of adult HCN stem cells and are currently being investigated.",The Mitral Valve 16 Months After Operative Insertion of the Alfieri Stitch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612728,The American journal of cardiology,2019 01 28,We describe considerable fibrous thickening of the mitral leaflets 16 months after insertion of an Alfieri stitch in a previously anatomically normal but functionally regurgitant mitral valve.

We investigated the influence of DM status (insulin-treated [ITDM], non-insulin treated [NITDM], and no diabetes [non-DM]) at baseline on time to development of the primary end point, a composite of cardiovascular (CV) mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and aborted cardiac arrest. Secondary end points included the individual components of the primary end point, myocardial infarction, stroke, all-cause mortality, hyperkalemia, and worsened renal function. Due to marked regional differences in characteristics and outcomes of the TOPCAT patients, with much lower events in patients enrolled in Russia/Georgia, we restricted our analyses on findings from patients enrolled from the Americas. Compared to patients without DM, patients with ITDM had approximately 2-fold increased risk for the primary end point, heart failure hospitalization, and myocardial infarction (hazard ratios: 1.80, 1.97, and 2.27, respectively) and approximately 50% increases in all-cause and CV mortality. The risks for these outcomes were also increased in patients with ITDM in comparison to patients with NITDM as well (hazard ratios: 1.63, 1.65, and 2.73, respectively, and approximately 40% increases in all-cause and CV mortality). Patients with NITDM had similar risks for the primary end point and all secondary end points as patients without DM. In conclusion, the apparent increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and ITDM merits future research to improve the prognosis of these high-risk patients.",Protein-Energy Malnutrition and Outcomes of Hospitalizations for Heart Failure in the USA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612726,The American journal of cardiology,2019 03 01,"Chronically elevated cytokines from un-abating low-grade inflammation in heart failure (HF) results in Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM). However, the impact of PEM on clinical outcomes of admissions for HF exacerbations has not been evaluated in a national data. From the 2012 to 2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) patient's discharge records for primary HF admissions, we identified patients with concomitant PEM, and their demographic and comorbid factors. We propensity-matched PEM cohorts (32,771) to no-PEM controls (1:1) using a greedy algorithm-based methodology and estimated the effect of different clinical outcomes (SAS 9.4). There were 32,771 (∼163,885) cases of PEM among the 541,679 (∼2,708,395) primary admissions for HF between 2012 and 2014 in the US. PEM cases were older (PEM:76 vs no-PEM:72 years), Whites (70.75% vs 67.30%), and had higher comorbid burden, with Deyo-comorbidity index >3 (31.61% vs 26.30%). However, PEM cases had lower rates of obesity, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. After propensity-matching, PEM was associated with higher mortality (AOR:2.48 [2.31 to 2.66]), cardiogenic shock (3.11[2.79 to 3.46]), cardiac arrest (2.30[1.96 to 2.70]), acute kidney failure (1.49[1.44 to 1.54]), acute respiratory failure (1.57[1.51 to 1.64]), mechanical ventilation (2.72[2.50 to 2.97]). PEM also resulted in higher non-routine discharges (2.24[2.17 to 2.31]), hospital cost ($80,534[78,496 to 82,625] vs $43,226[42,376 to 44,093]) and longer duration of admission (8.6[8.5 to 8.7] vs 5.3[5.2 to 5.3] days). In conclusion, PEM is a prevailing comorbidity among hospitalized HF subjects, and results in devastating health outcomes. Early identification and prevention of PEM in HF subjects during clinic visits and prompt treatment of PEM both in the clinic and during hospitalization are essential to decrease the excess burden of PEM.",Hazards of Mitral Valve Replacement for Mitral Stenosis Caused by Massive Mitral Annular Calcium With or Without Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612725,The American journal of cardiology,2019 01 28,"Mitral annular calcium (MAC) is common in older adults in the Western World and if extensive may cause mitral stenosis .

A total of 12 patients with massive MAC causing mitral stenosis and receiving mitral valve replacement with or without aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis were observed in 2013 to 2015. Of the 12 patients, 7 died from 5 to 44 days (mean 19) after the valve operation and all had ""stormy"" postoperative courses; one survived 150 days and another, 600 days; the remaining 3 were improved by the operation and are alive 22, 27, and 59 months postoperatively.

The PARIS (patterns of nonadherence to antiplatelet regimens in stented patients) registry was a multicenter study of 5,018 patients who underwent PCI. DAPT cessation was categorized as physician-recommended discontinuation, interruption, or disruption. Overall rates of 2-year DAPT discontinuation did not differ between non-ACS and ACS patients (38.8% vs 37.2%, p = 0.252). ACS patients were less likely to interrupt DAPT (8.5% vs 10.7% p<0.001), but were more likely to disrupt DAPT (16.4% vs 11.9%, p<0001). Adverse events after DAPT cessation were highest after disruption, intermediate with discontinuation, and lowest with interruption across both groups. Disruption of DAPT predicted MACE in both ACS patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.89 [1.88 to 4.45; p<0.001]) and non-ACS patients (HR 2.08 [1.29 to 3.35; p = 0.002]). Interruption of DAPT predicated MACE in ACS patients (HR 2.72 [1.35 to 5.48]) but not in non-ACS patients (HR 0.44 [0.14 to 1.40]; pinteraction≤0.01). In conclusion, the incidence of DAPT cessation mode differs by presentation with or without ACS. Physician guided DAPT discontinuation was the most common mode of DAPT cessation and appears to be safe across both groups. There were higher rates of adverse events associated with the interruption of DAPT in ACS patients.",Nodule bacteria from the cultured legume Phaseolus dumosus (belonging to the Phaseolus vulgaris cross-inoculation group) with common tropici phenotypic characteristics and symbiovar but distinctive phylogenomic position and chromid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612723,Systematic and applied microbiology,2019 05 26,"Phaseolus dumosus is an endemic species from mountain tops in Mexico that was found in traditional agriculture areas in Veracruz, Mexico. P. dumosus plants were identified by ITS sequences and their nodules were collected from agricultural fields or from trap plant experiments in the laboratory.

We obtained complete closed genomes from two P. dumosus isolates CCGE531 and CCGE532 that were phylogenetically placed within the tropici group but with a distinctive phylogenomic position and low average nucleotide identity (ANI). CCGE531 and CCGE532 had common phenotypic characteristics with tropici type B rhizobial symbionts. Genome synteny analysis and ANI showed that P. dumosus isolates had different chromids and our analysis suggests that chromids have independently evolved in different lineages of the Rhizobium genus. Finally, we considered that P. dumosus and Phaseolus vulgaris plants belong to the same cross-inoculation group since they have conserved symbiotic affinites for rhizobia.",Chronic kidney disease in liver transplantation: Evaluation of kidney function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612722,Revista de gastroenterologia de Mexico,2019 06 13,"Chronic kidney disease is one of the main comorbidities affecting liver transplant recipients. Most of those patients have some degree of acute or chronic kidney dysfunction at the time of transplantation, moreover they can also develop de novo chronic kidney disease once transplanted. An important increase in the incidence of chronic kidney disease in the «MELD era» has been observed. This phenomenon has partially been attributed to the weight that kidney function carries for organ allocation. In addition, the generalized use of calcineurin inhibitors has also been a contributing factor. It is of the utmost importance for us to be familiar with the current methods for evaluating kidney function before and after a liver transplantation. The two main biomarkers available today for that purpose are serum creatinine and cystatin C. Several equations have been derived from those biomarkers and have been tested in that context with mixed results, due to their biologic variability and the lack of standardization in their measurement. The gold standard continues to be the direct determination of the glomerular filtration rate through different methods; however, that is only done for research purposes. It is also essential to know the current classification of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease in order to make early diagnosis.

Here we report the case of an aortoiliac bypass, performed simultaneously with renal transplantation using venous grafts obtained from the deceased donor. The recipient was a 68-year-old woman with significant stenosis of the aortoiliac axis. We performed an aortobisiliac bypass using donor's femoral veins because presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was detected on donor hemoculture and contraindicated a prosthetic implant on the recipient. KT was then carried out using standard technique. Operative time amounted to 330 minutes and cold ischemia time of the renal graft was 900 minutes. Delayed graft function was observed until postoperative day 12, but the patient showed a good urine output and a serum creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL at discharge. AOD is not an absolute contraindication to renal transplantation, and simultaneous surgical repair of aortoiliac lesions with KT seems feasible. The patient's return to function after initial delayed graft function suggests that such interventions may allow transplantation to be offered to those patients who otherwise may be excluded for severe vascular comorbidities. Homologous vascular grafts are an excellent choice because prosthetic vascular replacement during immunosuppression must be avoided as long as possible, especially in patients with coexisting infective risk.",The efficacy of dietary intervention on gastrointestinal involvement in systemic sclerosis: A systematic literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612705,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,2019 01 07,Gastrointestinal involvement in systemic sclerosis is common and a major cause of disease-related morbidity.

However, evidence from these same cases includes puzzling details that question explanations based on isolated deficits to a specialized storage system. We highlight consistent findings from patients with deficient auditory short-term memory that warrant further investigation and may challenge the specialized store account, including that short-term recognition memory performance appears to be much stronger than recall, and not so obviously impaired. We also describe the substantial problems for the broader memory system caused by assuming that the patients' deficits are focused in a specialized module. We suggest that a sensory-motor integration account of the patient cases may adequately explain these patterns, and therefore presents a path toward incorporating into the embedded processes framework greater clarity about how domain-specific phenomena in immediate memory tasks arise. We further contend that applying ideas about sensory-motor recruitment could improve working memory theory.","Effects of morphological family on word recognition in normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612700,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,2019 06 08,"Reading a word activates morphologically related words in the mental lexicon. People with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often have difficulty retrieving words, though the source of this problem is not well understood. To better understand the word recognition process in aging and in neurodegenerative disorders such as MCI and AD, we investigated the nature of the activation of morphologically related family members in 22 Finnish speakers with AD, 24 with MCI, and 17 cognitively healthy elderly. We presented Finnish monomorphemic (base form) nouns in a single-word lexical decision experiment to measure the speed of word recognition and its relation to morphological and lexical variables. Morphological variables included morphological family size (separate for compounds and derived words) and pseudo-morphological family size (including the set of words that have a partially overlapping form but that do not share an actual morpheme, e.g., pet and carpet, or corn and corner). Pseudo-morphological family size was included to examine the influence of words with orthographic (or phonological) overlap that are not semantically related to the target words. Our analyses revealed that younger and elderly controls and individuals with MCI or AD were influenced by true morphological overlap (overlapping forms that also share meaning), as well as by the word's pseudo-morphological family. However, elderly controls and individuals with MCI or AD seemed to rely more on form overlap than young adults. This demonstrates that an increased reliance on form-based aspects of language processing in Alzheimer's disease is not necessarily due to a partial loss of access to semantics, but might be explained in part by a common age-related change of processes in written word recognition.",Common Dysfunction of Large-Scale Neurocognitive Networks Across Psychiatric Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612699,Biological psychiatry,2019 02 08,"Cognitive dysfunction is one of the most prominent characteristics of psychiatric disorders.

The de novo variants comprise six missense variants, three of which are recurrent, and three truncating variants. Brain anomalies such as perisylvian polymicrogyria, cerebral or cerebellar atrophy, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum were consistent among individuals harboring recurrent de novo missense variants. MAPK8IP3 has been shown to be involved in the retrograde axonal-transport machinery, but many of its specific functions are yet to be elucidated. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to target six conserved amino acid positions in Caenorhabditis elegans, we found that two of the six investigated human alterations led to a significantly elevated density of axonal lysosomes, and five variants were associated with adverse locomotion. Reverse-engineering normalized the observed adverse effects back to wild-type levels. Combining genetic, phenotypic, and functional findings, as well as the significant enrichment of de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 within our total cohort of 27,232 individuals who underwent exome sequencing, we implicate de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 as a cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability and variable brain anomalies.",Life-stage related responses to combined effects of acclimation temperature and humidity on the thermal tolerance of Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612691,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"Adaptive thermal plasticity plays a key role in mitigating the effects of seasonal and diurnal thermal fluctuations among ectotherms at various life-stages. While the role of thermal history in conferring such plasticity is widely documented, its interaction with relative humidity (RH), another important driver of ectotherm survival and activity, is relatively underexplored. Yet the potential responses to these combinational stressors across ontogeny remain largely neglected. Against this background, we used a full-factorial design to test the combined acclimation effects of RH (45%, 65% and 85%) and temperature (23, 28 and 33 °C) on various indices of thermal sensitivity of laboratory reared spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) following acclimation beginning at larval, pupal and adult life-stages. Traits measured included critical thermal limits (CTLs), supercooling points (SCPs), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat knockdown time (HKDT). Larval acclimation at 23 °C; 85% RH recorded the lowest critical thermal minima (CTmin) whereas adult acclimation at 28 °C; 45% RH recorded the highest critical thermal maxima (CTmax).

Similarly, commencing acclimation at larval, pupal and adult stages at 28 °C; 85% RH improved HKDT whereas larval and pupal acclimations at 33 °C; 45% RH impaired it. Our results indicate that combinational interactions of temperature and RH have significant thermal fitness costs and benefits and are dependent on the life-stage acclimation timing. Results also imply that both the vulnerability and adaptive potential of C. partellus populations under rapid climate variability varies with ontogeny. This therefore calls for the consideration of the role of ontogeny and multi-factors in better understanding the impact of environmental stress on ectotherms."

Moreover, we investigated the effects of temperature on the basal humoral immunity of the two target insects; particularly, phenoloxidase (PO) and lysozyme activity. Our results show that G. mellonella is susceptible to all bio-insecticides at all the examined temperatures, except when infected at 10 °C with S. carpocapsae and at 30 °C with S. feltiae and B. thuringiensis. S. africa is more susceptible at 30 °C to all bioinsecticides; whereas, when infected at 10 and 20 °C, H. bacteriophora is the most efficient. Temperature modulates PO activity of both G. mellonella and S. africa, otherwise variations in lysozyme activity is observed only in G. mellonella. Except for a possible correlation between the increased lysozyme activity and the delayed Bt efficacy recorded on G. mellonella at 30 °C, a different resistance to bio-insecticides at different temperatures does not seem to be associated to variations of the host basal immunity, probably due to immunoevasive and immunodepressive strategies of these entomopathogens.",The heat is on: A device that reduces cold stress-induced tachycardia in laboratory mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612675,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"Mouse vivaria are typically maintained at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 20-26 °C which is comfortable for human researchers. However, as this Ta is well below the mouse thermoneutral zone (TNZ) of 30-32 °C, typical vivarium temperatures result in cold stress for mice. Recently, a cage has been developed that provides variable cage floor heating, allowing mice to behaviorally regulate body temperature through thermotaxis. A hand warmer provides supplemental heat, elevating cage floor surface temperature for 13 + hours up to 30 °C. This provides a heated surface for the entirety of the light phase. Here, we test the ability of these local heat sources to remove physiological signs of cold stress in mice housed at room temperature by analyzing heart rate (HR), activity, and body temperature in three experimental conditions: 23 °C, 23 °C + heated surface, or 30 °C. The location of C57Bl/6 J mice within the cage was recorded using an infrared camera. In the presence of supplemental heat at a Ta of 23 °C, mice resided atop of the area of the heated surface 85 ± 3% of the 12-h light phase, as compared to 7 ± 2% in the absence of supplemental heat. Further, addition of supplemental heat lowered light phase HR and activity to that seen at a Ta of 30 °C. These results indicate that provision of a local heat source is successful in reducing cold-induced tachycardia in mice housed at typical vivarium temperatures without increasing the ambient temperature of the entire laboratory and subjecting researchers to heat stress.",Effects of evening partial body cryostimulation on the skin and core temperatures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612674,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"Cryostimulation is widely used to treat inflammation, rheumatism, acute soft tissue injuries, and neurodegeneration. It helps prevent injury and promotes recovery. This study aimed to examine the duration of the effects of evening partial body cryostimulation (PBC) on core and skin temperatures. Seven male athletes participated in this study. On the day of PBC, at 18:00, each athlete was exposed to PBC (approx. -180 °C) in a specially designed cabin for 3 min. On the control day, at 18:00, the participants sat still on a sofa for 10 min. On both days, bedtime was at around 23:00. Wrist and abdominal skin temperatures, except during PBC, were recorded with Thermochron thermistors after 17:30. Core temperatures were monitored with an ingestible and telemetric core body temperature sensor and a data recorder. The circadian rhythm of the core temperature was observed on both days. The core temperature at 22:30 was found to be lower on the PBC day. Wrist and abdominal skin temperatures recovered after PBC; however, the residual effects on both were different. The abdominal skin temperature at 22:30 was lower on the PBC day. Subjective sleep quality and next morning sleepiness did not differ between the conditions. These results suggested that the effects of a 3-min evening PBC session on the core and skin temperatures lasted for several hours. However, these differences did not affect the subjective sleep quality.",Interactions between thermoregulatory behavior and physiological acclimatization in a wild lizard population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612673,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"Although the importance of thermoregulation and plasticity as compensatory mechanisms for climate change has long been recognized, they have largely been studied independently. Thus, we know comparatively little about how they interact to shape physiological variation in natural populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that behavioral thermoregulation and thermal acclimatization interact to shape physiological phenotypes in a natural population of the diurnal lizard, Sceloporus torquatus. Every month for one year we examined thermoregulatory effectiveness and changes in the population mean in three physiological parameters: cold tolerance (Ctmin), heat tolerance (Ctmax), and the preferred body temperature (Tpref), to indirectly assess thermal acclimatization in population means. We discovered that S. torquatus is an active thermoregulator throughout the year, with body temperature varying little despite strong seasonal temperature shifts. Although we did not observe a strong signal of acclimatization in Ctmax, we did find that Ctmin shifts in parallel with nighttime temperatures throughout the year. This likely occurs, at least in part, because thermoregulation is substantially less effective at buffering organisms from selection on lower physiological limits than upper physiological limits. Active thermoregulation is effective at limiting exposure to extreme temperatures during the day, but is less effective at night, potentially contributing to greater plasticity in Ctmin than Ctmax. Importantly, however, Tpref tracked seasonal changes in temperature, which is one the factors contributing to highly effective thermoregulation throughout the year. Thus, behavior and physiological plasticity do not always operate independently, which could impact how organisms can respond to rising temperatures.",Stress biomarkers and proteomics alteration to thermal stress in ruminants: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612672,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"Heat stress may adversely affect physiochemical and immune responses of livestock and alter biological functions. The comfort or thermoneutral zone for livestock, which has long been a subject of research, mainly depends on species, breed, and health. Heat stress is associated with impaired livestock productivity due to reductions in feed intake, growth rates and immunity and changes in blood constituents and biological pathways. In ruminants, elevated temperatures have deleterious consequences on protein synthesis. Exposure of ruminant animals to elevated temperatures may induce release of heat shock proteins (HSPs); HSPs usually enter the blood circulation during tissue damage and causes cell necrosis or death. Additionally, hyperthermia is associated with augmented production of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause protein degradation and further decrease protein synthesis by preventing protein translation. Moreover, it has been suggested that high environmental temperatures lead to increased inflammatory signalling in tissues via activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) pathways as well as via alteration of skin colour gene (melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) and premelanosome protein (PMEL)) expression. Previous proteomics analyses have suggested that heat stress can reduce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, alter gluconeogenesis precursor supply, and induce lipid accumulation in the liver with subsequent disturbance of liver structure. This review focuses on the scientific evidence regarding the impact of heat stress on immune and inflammatory responses, antioxidant status, stress biomarkers, skin colour gene (PMEL and MC1R) expression and proteomic profiles in ruminants.",Curcumin inhibits heat-induced oxidative stress by activating the MAPK-Nrf2 / ARE signaling pathway in chicken fibroblasts cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612671,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"Curcumin is a natural phenolic component of yellow curry spice, exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study we investigated whether curcumin suppresses heat-induced apoptosis in chicken embryonic fibroblast cells (CEF) and the underlying mechanism. CEF cells line was divided into 6 groups (4 repetitions per group) including normal temperature group (NC), high temperature control group (H) and 4 experimental groups (H1(5 μmol/L), H2(10 μmol/L), H3(20 μmol/L) and H4(40 μmol/L)). Control groups were cultured in basic medium without Curcumin, while, the experimental groups were supplemented with 5, 10, 20 and 40 μmol/L, respectively. The experimental groups and H control group were cultured at 43 ℃ (95% air/5% CO2), whereas NC group cells were cultured at 37 °C. After 6, 12 and 24 h of culture, cells were collected for viability, proliferation, apoptosis, antioxidant status and gene expression analysis. Results showed that heat stress trigged the ROS production and induced the apoptosis, leading to decrease the cell viability and proliferation. The enzymatic activities of antioxidants (SOD, CAT, and GPX) were down-regulated. The expression of antioxidant enzyme (CAT, SOD1, SOD2, GSTO1, GSTT1 and GSTA3) and MAPK-Nrf2 pathway genes (Nrf2, Jnk, Erk and P38) were down-regulated under heats stress condition. While, the Curcumin treated groups had decreased ROS and MDA content. Down-regulation of the activity and expression of antioxidant enzyme induced by heat were also reversed by curcumin. Furthermore the up-regulation in expression of Nrf2, Jnk, Erk and P38 in supplemented groups revealed the involvement of MAPK-Nrf2 signaling pathway to alleviate oxidative stress induced by heat stress. This study demonstrates that curcumin has the ability to ease the oxidative damage through activating the MAPK-Nrf2 signaling pathway in CEF cells.",Animal thermal comfort indexes in silvopastoral systems with different tree arrangements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612670,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"This study aimed to assess solar radiation transmission and animal thermal comfort indexes in two silvopastoral systems established with different tree arrangements in a tropical region. This study was conducted between 2014 and 2017 in two silvopastoral systems, one composed by an established Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) decumbens pasture with Brazilian native trees planted in triple rows spaced 17 m apart, and another by an established Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) brizantha (Hochst ex A. Rich.) Stapf 'BRS Piatã' pasture with Eucalyptus urograndis (clone GG100) trees arranged in single rows spaced 15 m apart. In these systems and in a full-sun pasture, photosynthetically active radiation transmission, air temperature, relative humidity, black globe temperature, and wind speed were measured. These variables were used to calculate black globe temperature and humidity index (BGHI) and radiant thermal load (RTL). Higher animal thermal comfort was observed in the silvopastoral systems due to changes in the microclimate induced by the trees; notably, a decrease in solar radiation transmission. Fewer hours of potential animal thermal stress (BGHI>79) were observed in the silvopastoral systems than under the full-sun conditions, with differences up to 3 h per day. The silvopastoral systems presented lower radiant thermal load than the full-sun pasture with differences up to 22% achieved. The assessed silvopastoral systems may help livestock adapt to climate change, since they achieved the limit of BGHI considered to cause stress to animals following an increase of 2.2 °C in air temperature, compared with full-sun pastures.",Effects of alternating exposure to cold and heat for 14 days on cold tolerance in winter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612669,Journal of thermal biology,2019 01 21,"People are exposed to heat regularly due to their jobs or daily habits in cold winter, but few studies have reported whether parallel heat and cold exposure and diminish cold acclimation. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of alternating exposure to cold and heat on cold tolerance in eight young males. A daily acclimation program to cold and heat, which consisted of 2-h sitting at 10 °C air in the morning and 2-h running and rest at 30 °C air in the afternoon, was conducted for 14 consecutive days. Eight male subjects participated in a cold tolerance test (10 °C [ ± 0.3], 40%RH[ ± 3]) before (PRE) and after (POST) completing the alternating exposure program. During the cold tolerance test, subjects remained sitting upright on a chair for 60 min. Rectal temperature (Tre) was lower in POST than in PRE during the 60-min cold tolerance test (P = 0.027). During the cold tolerance test, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures in POST were lower than those in PRE (P = 0.006, P = 0.005, and P = 0.004). No significant differences in skin temperatures between PRE and POST were found for the cold tolerance test. There were no significant differences in energy expenditure during cold exposure between PRE and POST. Subjects felt less cold in POST than in PRE (P = 0.013) whereas there was no significant difference in overall thermal comfort between PRE and POST. These results suggest that cold adaptation can still occur in the presence of heat stress.",Insights into atopic dermatitis gained from genetically defined mouse models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612664,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2019 01 07,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by severe pruritus and recurrent eczema with a chronic disease course.

Mouse models are a powerful tool to analyze such intricate pathophysiology of AD, with a caution that anatomy and immunology of the skin differ between human subjects and mice. Here we review recent understanding of AD etiology obtained using mouse models, which address the epidermal barrier, skin microbiome, TH2 immune response, and pruritus.",Atopic dermatitis endotypes and implications for targeted therapeutics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612663,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2019 01 07,"Recent research advancements indicate that atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease characterized by different subtypes/phenotypes based on age, disease chronicity, ethnicity, filaggrin and IgE status, and underlying molecular mechanisms/endotypes. This heterogeneity advocates against the traditional ""one-size-fits-all"" therapeutic approaches still used to manage AD. Precision medicine approaches, striving for targeted, tailored, endotype-driven disease prevention and treatment, rely on detailed definitions of the disease's variability across different phenotypes. Studies have shown that AD harbors different endotypes across different age groups and ethnicities and according to IgE levels and filaggrin mutation status. These include European American versus Asian patients, children versus adults, intrinsic versus extrinsic (IgE status) disease, and patients with and without filaggrin mutations. Therapies targeting different cytokine axes and other mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis, which are currently being tested for patients with AD across the disease spectrum, will expand our ability to dissect the relative contribution of each of these pathways to disease perpetuation."

This work describes an update and validation of a method of selective hydride generation (HG) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for high-throughput screening of iAs content in seafood samples after microwave-assisted extraction with diluted nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. High concentration of HCl (8 M) for HG along with hydrogen peroxide in samples of a same concentration as used for extraction leads to a selective conversion of iAs to volatile arsine that is released and transported to the detector. A minor contribution from methylarsonate (≈20% to iAs) was found, while HG from dimethylarsinate, trimethylarsine oxide is substantially suppressed (less than 1% to iAs). Methodology was applied to Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) TORT-3, DORM-3, DORM-4, DOLT-4, DOLT-5, PRON-1, SQID-1 and ERM-CE278k, in some of them iAs has been determined for the first time, and to various seaweed samples from a local store. The results were always compared with a reference method and selectivity of iAs determination was evaluated. An inter-laboratory reproducibility was tested by comparative analyses of six fish and four seaweed samples in three European laboratories, with good agreement of the results. The method of HG-ICP-MS is sensitive (limit of detection 2 μg kg-1 iAs), well suited for screening of large number of samples and selective at iAs concentration levels at which maximum limits are expected to be set into EU legislation for marine samples.",Novel thiophene-based colorimetric and fluorescent turn-on sensor for highly sensitive and selective simultaneous detection of Al3+ and Zn2+ in water and food samples and its application in bioimaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612651,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 05,"A novel bifunctional thiophene-based Schiff base TS as a colorimetric and fluorescent turn-on sensor for rapid and simultaneous detection of Al3+ and Zn2+ ions with high selectivity and sensitivity has been developed.

SnO2-SiC hollow sphere nanochains with high surface area and gold nanoparticles with good electroconductivity were fabricated onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode pre-coated with chitosan. The coating antigen (AA-4-mercaptophenylacetic acid-ovalbumin conjugate, AA-4-MPA-OVA) was immobilized on the electrode. Polyclonal antibody specific for AA-4-MPA was conjugated to gold nanorod (AuNR) as primary antibody (AuNR-Ab1). Horseradish peroxidase labelled anti-rabbit antibody produced in goat was conjugated to AuNR as secondary antibody (HRP-AuNR-Ab2). For detection, the analyte (AA-4-MPA) in sample competed with coating antigen for binding with AuNR-Ab1. After washing, HRP-AuNR-Ab2 was added to capture the AuNR-Ab1, and the electrical signal was obtained by addition of hydroquinone and H2O2. After investigation of the binding ability on nanomaterials and optimization of competitive immunoassay conditions, the proposed immunosensor exhibited a sensitive response to AA with a detection limit of 45.9 ± 2.7 ng kg-1, and working range of 187 ± 12.3 ng kg-1 to 104 ± 8.2 μg kg-1 for drinking water samples.

Thiocyanate is a potential goitrogen, thus an accurate determination may help to identify lactating mothers with high thiocyanate dosage, thereby preventing the transport of excess SCN- to infants. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy has become a versatile and reliable technique to detect SCN- in different media. However, the conventional surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates used to detect SCN- are often discarded after use. The frequent disposal of such metal nanoparticles is detrimental to the environment and makes the SERS-based detection of SCN- uneconomical. In this study, we present fabrication of a new, ultrasensitive and recyclable SERS substrate, based on an AuSiO2@Ag wire (W) superstructure, to detect SCN- in different media. The hierarchical AuSiO2@AgW substrate was obtained by forming nano-sized patches of SiO2 on micron-sized AgW and anchoring 30 nm-sized gold nanoparticles on the patches with mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. This ultrasensitive substrate could detect SCN- at a low concentration of 0.001 μM in water, and 0.01 μM in urine and human serum. In addition, a facile procedure to regenerate and recycle the SCN- bound AuSiO2@AgW platform in different media has been demonstrated. The insight gained in the present study can serve as a promising and powerful method for fabrication of active and recyclable substrates for SERS-based detection of SCN-.",Superhydrophobic SERS substrates based on silver dendrite-decorated filter paper for trace detection of nitenpyram.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612648,Analytica chimica acta,2019 01 07,"In the present work, highly sensitive Raman detection of nitenpyram using superhydrophobic filter paper as substrates is introduced.

Slight changes to chemical structures, e.g. shifting the position of functional groups such as methyl groups or halogens on the aromatic ring, may not be distinguished using traditional methods. NMR is a powerful tool used to elucidate distinctive structural information needed to differentiate regioisomers. However, the cost, size, and cryogen maintenance of superconducting NMR spectrometers can be impractical for some forensic laboratories. Recent studies have shown potential applications of low-field NMR as an alternative in forensic drug analysis. These benchtop, semi-portable instruments are less costly, have a smaller footprint, do not use cryogens, and require little maintenance. In this study, we show that 65 fentanyl and related substances, including various types of positional isomers, were readily differentiated using low-field (62 MHz) 1H NMR spectroscopy. In addition, the use of quantum mechanical spin system analysis was investigated for the purposes of translating experimentally observed high-field 1H spectra to lower field strengths. Spin system analysis of 600 MHz NMR spectra was conducted on a subset (15) of the reference materials analyzed. The results were used to calculate 62 MHz spectra for comparison purposes with the experimental spectra. This was successfully demonstrated, showing that field-strength independent 1H NMR spectral libraries are feasible and can facilitate reference material data dissemination across forensic drug laboratories.",A ratiometric time-gated luminescence probe for hydrogen sulfide based on copper(II)-coupled lanthanide complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612646,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 05,"Time-gated luminescence (TGL) bioassay technique using luminescent lanthanide complexes as probes has exhibited excellent practicability in detection of various analytes in autofluorescence-rich biosamples. Herein, a novel copper(II)-coupled lanthanide complex-based luminescence probe has been developed for the ratiometric TGL detection of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in vitro and in vivo. The probe is constructed based on a dual-functional ligand that was synthesized by conjugating di(2-picolyl)amine with terpyridine polyacid (DATP) using the ""click chemistry"" method. The as-prepared ligand can coordinate to Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions with its terpyridine polyacid moiety to display long-lived emissions of Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions, while the further coordination of its di(2-picolyl)amino moiety to Cu2+ induces to the luminescence quenching of the Eu3+ complexes, which allows the probe consisting of the heterometallic Cu2+-DATP-Eu3+/Tb3+ complexes to be constructed. After the probe was reacted with H2S to lead to the release of Cu2+ from the complexes, the emission of Eu3+ at 610 nm was remarkably enhanced, while that of Tb3+ at 540 nm was changed slightly. This luminescence response feature allowed the probe to be conveniently applied for the ratiometric TGL determination of H2S with I610/I540 as the signal. The applicability of the probe for quantitative detection of H2S in human sera as well as for imaging of H2S in living cells and zebrafish were evaluated. All of the results proved the potential of the probe for in vitro and in vivo applications.","Targeted quantification and untargeted screening of alkylphenols, bisphenol A and phthalates in aquatic matrices using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612645,Analytica chimica acta,2019 01 07,"Plasticizers and other plastics additives have been extensively used as ingredients of plastics and are as a result thereof easily released in the aquatic environment, due to different physical diffusion processes. In this context, a dedicated method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of 27 known and a virtually unlimited number of unknown alkylphenols, Bisphenol A and phthalates in 2 aquatic matrices, i.e. sea- and freshwater. To this extent, a novel instrumental HESI-UHPLC-HRMS (heated electro-spray ionization ultra-high performance liquid chromatographic high resolution mass spectrometric) method was devised for the simultaneous analysis of 7 phenols (i.e. 6 alkylphenols and Bisphenol A) and 20 phthalates within 10 min. Thereafter, a solid-phase extraction protocol was statistically (95% confidence interval, p > 0.05) optimized based on experimental designs. The method was proven fit-for-purpose through a successful validation at environmentally relevant nanomolar concentrations. Analytical precautions were taken for minimizing false-positive results to suppress in-house contamination. The method demonstrated an excellent analytical performance across all known plasticizers and plastics additives for sea- and freshwater, revealing good linearity (R2 > 0.99, n = 39), stable recoveries (98.5-105.8%), satisfactory repeatability (RSD < 8%, n = 54) and reproducibility (RSD < 10%, n = 36). Subsequently, a novel analytical strategy was devised for the tentative identification of unknown plasticizers and plastics additives using specific in-house determined fragments incorporated in a Python code. The applicability of the analytical platform was demonstrated by measuring 24 seawater samples. Interestingly, 16 out of 27 known plasticizers, plastics additives and primary metabolites could be quantified while the untargeted analysis uncovered 1042 compounds, whereof 5% (n = 46) could be assigned a plasticizer-plastics additive chemical identity, providing evidence for the severe plastic contamination status of our marine environment.",Carbon fiber ionization mass spectrometry coupled with solid phase microextraction for analysis of Benzo[a]pyrene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612644,Analytica chimica acta,2019 01 07,"Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) is an effective technique that can be used to selectively enrich trace analytes of interest from complex samples. Owing to its high sensitivity and high selectivity, mass spectrometry (MS) has been widely used as the detection tool to confirm the analytes enriched on SPME fibers. Generally, thermal desorption or solvent desorption is used to desorb analytes from SPME fibers for MS analysis. A straightforward ionization method called carbon fiber ionization (CFI), which uses a single carbon fiber (diameter: ∼10 μm) as ionization emitter in MS, has been demonstrated lately. Analytes adsorbed on the carbon fiber, which is placed close (∼5 mm) to the inlet of a mass spectrometer, can be readily ionized through corona discharge and detected by the mass spectrometer. One unique feature regarding this approach over other existing ambient ionization methods is that no additional electric contact is applied directly on the carbon fiber. Nevertheless, on the basis of the electric field provided by the mass spectrometer, corona discharge can readily occur for ionizing analytes on the carbon fiber. Carbon fiber has high affinity toward polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons due to its graphite-like surface structure. We herein explore a hyphenated-technique by combining carbon-fiber based SPME with CFI-MS for extraction of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a carcinogen, from aqueous samples. After BaP are adsorbed on a carbon fiber through SPME, the SPME carbon fiber can be readily placed in front of the mass spectrometer for MS analysis. The ions at m/z 252 derived from BaP adsorbed on the carbon fiber can be immediately acquired by the mass spectrometer without the requirement of applying heating or solvent. The limit of detection of BaP using the developed method was as low as ∼60 pM. It is also feasible to detect BaP from complex serum sample. The feasibility of using the approach for quantitative analysis of BaP was also demonstrated. The linear dynamic range toward BaP was 0.2-5 nM. The extraction efficiency using this approach for aqueous samples was ∼91%.",Determination of 21 perfluoroalkyl substances and organophosphorus compounds in breast milk by liquid chromatography coupled to orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612643,Analytica chimica acta,2019 03 05,"The human exposure to perfluoroalkyl (PFASs) and organophosphorus (OPs) compounds is a cause of concern and its determination in biological matrices, including human milk, is an emergent approach for evaluate their exposure. A comprehensive strategy for the quantitative determination of 21 PFASs and OPs compounds in breast milk was developed. The proposed method includes an extraction and clean-up procedure based on the QuEChERs methodology followed by an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) determination. The full-scan mass data were acquired with a resolution of 50000 FWHM and a mass accuracy better than 5 ppm. Method validation was performed in terms of recovery, repeatability, linearity and limit of quantification. The obtained recoveries varied between 70 and 120% with a precision (RSD) lower than 25%. The limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged between 1.9 and 19.0 ng g-1 lipid weight for OPs, and between 0.066 ng mL-1 and 0.666 ng mL-1 for PFASs. A breast milk reference material was used in order to check the validated method. The developed analytical strategy was applied to 20 breast milk samples collected from mothers living in the Valencian Region (Spain). All of the OPs analyzed except tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were detected in at least one sample. In all samples, perfluoro-n-pentanoic acid (PFPeA), perfluoro-n-octanoic acid (PFOA) and sodium perfluoro-1-octanesulfonate (PFOS) were the most frequently detected analytes. Concentration of total OPs (∑OPs) and total PFASs (∑PFASs) ranged from 1.9 to 37.7 ng g-1 lipid weight and from 0.066 to 0.356 ng mL-1, respectively."

Embryos of almost all flowering plants share common characteristics, including an asymmetric first division of the zygote, and multiple rounds of cell divisions that generate the major tissue types of the adult plant, usually within a few days of fertilization. This review focuses on early embryogenesis, including fertilization, the contributions of maternal and paternal genomes to the zygote and early embryo, cell fate decisions that create the apical and basal lineages, establishment of the shoot and root meristems, and formation of the other major tissue types in the adult plant. Because most genetic and molecular research on embryogenesis in plants has been conducted on the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, we highlight work on this species as well as research with Zea mays (maize) and Oryza sativa (rice).",Friend or foe: Signaling mechanisms during double fertilization in flowering seed plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612627,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 04 11,"Since the first description of double fertilization 120 years ago, the processes of pollen tube growth and guidance, sperm cell release inside the receptive synergid cell, as well as fusion of two sperm cells to the female gametes (egg and central cell) have been well documented in many flowering plants. Especially microscopic techniques, including live cell imaging, were used to visualize these processes. Molecular as well as genetic methods were applied to identify key players involved. However, compared to the first 11 decades since its discovery, the past decade has seen a tremendous advancement in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating angiosperm fertilization. Whole signaling networks were elucidated including secreted ligands, corresponding receptors, intracellular interaction partners, and further downstream signaling events involved in the cross-talk between pollen tubes and their cargo with female reproductive cells. Biochemical and structural biological approaches are now increasingly contributing to our understanding of the different signaling processes required to distinguish between compatible and incompatible interaction partners. Here, we review the current knowledge about signaling mechanisms during above processes with a focus on the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Zea mays (maize). The analogy that many of the identified ""reproductive signaling mechanisms"" also act partly or fully in defense responses and/or cell death is also discussed.",Self-incompatibility in the Brassicaceae: Regulation and mechanism of self-recognition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612626,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 04 11,"Self-incompatibility is one of the most common mechanisms used by plants to prevent self-fertilization. In the Brassicaceae, the inhibition of self-pollen is triggered right at the stigma surface by interaction of two highly polymorphic self-recognition proteins that are encoded by tightly linked genes of the S-locus haplotype: a receptor protein kinase displayed at the surface of stigma epidermal cells and its small diffusible ligand that is localized in the outer coat of pollen grains. It is the specific interaction between receptor and ligand encoded in the same S haplotype that determines specificity in the rejection of self-pollen. The chapter reviews recent results that have shed light on the genetic control, cell biology, and regulation of the self-recognition molecules, as well as the structural basis of ligand recognition. Models that aim to explain how diversification of the self-recognition repertoire can occur in this two-gene self-recognition system are discussed.",Development and function of the flowering plant female gametophyte.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612625,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 04 11,"Flowering plants constitute an indispensable basis for the existence of most organisms, including humans. In a world characterized by rapid population growth and climate changes, understanding plant reproduction becomes increasingly important in order to respond to the resource shortage associated with this development. New technologies enabling powerful forward genetic approaches, comprehensive genome and transcriptome analyses, and sophisticated cell isolation and imaging have advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying gamete formation and fertilization. In addition, these techniques have allowed us to explore the fascinating cellular crosstalk, which coordinates the intra- and interorganismic interactions that secure reproductive success. Here we review the basic principles underlying development of the germ cell-harboring female gametophyte in flowering plants. We start with the selection of the founder cells and end with the formation of a few-celled, highly specialized structure that operates on the basis of division of labor in order to generate the next generation.",Development and evolution of the unique ovules of flowering plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612624,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 04 11,"Ovules are the precursors to seeds and as such are critical to plant propagation and food production. Mutant studies have led to the identification of numerous genes regulating ovule development. Genes encoding transcription factors have been shown to direct ovule spacing, ovule identity and integument formation. Particular co-regulators have now been associated with activities of some of these transcription factors, and other protein families including cell surface receptors have been shown to regulate ovule development. Hormone levels and transport, especially of auxin, have also been shown to play critical roles in ovule emergence and morphogenesis and to interact with the transcriptional regulators. Ovule diversification has been studied using orthologs of regulatory genes in divergent angiosperm groups.

A key innovation of land plants is a life cycle with an alternation of generations, with both haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte generations having complex multicellular bodies. The origins of the developmental genetic programs patterning these bodies, whether inherited from an algal ancestor or evolved de novo, and whether programs were co-opted between generations, are largely open questions.

Major challenges in developing such structures include establishment of polarity along three axes (apical-basal, medio-lateral, and dorso-ventral/abaxial-adaxial), specification of tissue types and their coordinated growth, and maintenance of communication between the organ and the entire organism. The gynoecium of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana embodies the female reproductive organ and has proven an excellent model system for studying organ establishment and development, given its division into different regions with distinct symmetries and highly diverse tissue types. Upon pollination, the gynoecium undergoes dramatic changes in morphology and developmental programming to form the seed-containing fruit. In this review, we wish to provide a detailed overview of the molecular and genetic mechanisms that are known to guide gynoecium and fruit development in A. thaliana. We describe networks of key genetic regulators and their interactions with hormonal dynamics in driving these developmental processes. The discoveries made to date clearly demonstrate that conclusions drawn from studying gynoecium and fruit development in flowering plants can be used to further our general understanding of organ formation across the plant kingdom.

Pollen performance traits mediate the timing of the fertilization process, often in competition with other pollen, via the speed of pollen germination, sperm development, and pollen tube growth. Studies of pollen development rarely address the issue of performance or its evolution, which involves linking variation in developmental rates to relative fitness within populations or to adaptations on a macroevolutionary scale. Modifications to the pollen tube pathway and changes in the intensity of pollen competition affect the direction and strength of selection on pollen performance. Hence, pollen developmental evolution is always contextual-it involves both the population biology of pollen reaching stigmas and the co-evolution of sporophytic traits, such as the pollen tube pathway and mating system. For most species, performance evolution generally reflects a wandering history of periods of directional selection and relaxed selection, channeled by developmental limitations, a pattern that favors the accumulation of diversity and redundancy in developmental mechanisms and the genetic machinery. Developmental biologists are focused on finding universal mechanisms that underlie pollen function, and these are largely mechanisms that have evolved through their effects on performance. Here, we suggest ways in which studies of pollen performance or function could progress by cross-fertilization between the ""evo"" and ""devo"" fields.",The evolution and patterning of male gametophyte development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612620,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 04 11,"The reproductive adaptations of land plants have played a key role in their terrestrial colonization and radiation.

The production of small motile male gametes and larger immotile female gametes (oogamy) in specialized multicellular gametangia evolved in the charophyte algae, the closest extant relatives of land plants. Reliance on water and motile male gametes for sexual reproduction was retained by bryophytes and basal vascular plants, but was overcome in seed plants by the dispersal of pollen and the guided delivery of non-motile sperm to the female gametes. Here we discuss the evolutionary history of male gametogenesis in streptophytes (green plants) and the underlying developmental biology, including recent advances in bryophyte and angiosperm models. We conclude with a perspective on research trends that promise to deliver a deeper understanding of the evolutionary and developmental mechanisms of male gametogenesis in plants.",Pre-meiotic anther development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612619,Current topics in developmental biology,2019 04 11,"Most genetic and molecular analyses of anther development utilize Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice), and Zea mays (maize). Especially in maize, early stages of anther development are easy to study because: (1) Maize has unisex flowers. (2) Compared to rice or A. thaliana, maize anthers are relatively large, making dissection for molecular and biochemical analyses easy. (3) Anther developmental stage is strongly correlated with maize anther length. Besides these technical advantages, understanding anther and pollen development in maize is of significant agricultural importance. Today maize is a worldwide cereal crop: approximately 25% of all consumed food contains maize. Yield stability or even increases depend on maintenance of hybrid vigor, and production of hybrid seed requires manual detasseling or genetic control of pollen development. Knowledge of pollen development can also be used to manage transgene containment. In the first section of this chapter, we will describe the current model for sequential cell fate specification in maize anther lobes, with reference to rice and A. thaliana to point out similarities and differences. In the second section of this chapter, we will review what is known about the individual cell types in anther lobes. The diversity of anther organization is addressed to a limited extent by cytological studies of anthers, often directed to clarify taxonomic relationships. In the third section, we will comment on how new lines of investigation could clarify questions remaining in our current appreciation of anther development."

It has been long-established that tumor cells and stromal cells produce tumor resident proteases (TRPs) to remodel the surrounding tumor microenvironment in support of tumor progression. In fact, proteolytic products of TRPs have been shown to correlate with malignant behavior. Being of low molecular weight, these unique peptides can pass through the endothelial barrier of the vasculature into the bloodstream. As such, the cancer peptidome has increasingly become a focus for biomarker discovery.

The adoption of an appropriate medical and environmental prophylaxis is critical for long-term management of hemophilia because it will considerably reduce the number of both mild and severe bleeding episodes. Among the many therapeutic options that have become available over the past decades, ACE910 (also known as emicizumab) is a bispecific immunoglobulin G antibody characterized by its unique ability to bind FIX or FIXa on one arm and FX on the other, thus abrogating FVIII activity in vivo. Several phase I to III clinical trials have now been published, confirming the clinical efficacy and relative safety of this new agent for long-term prophylaxis of hemophilia A, especially those patients having FVIII inhibitors. The recent regulatory clearance of ACE910 in many countries will hence impose additional challenges to clinical laboratories because the panel of available tests will need to address the emerging issue of monitoring patients treated with this novel anti-hemophilic agent by using conventional as well as innovative approaches.

The present study shows an evaluation of pathological and protracted behavioral alterations following neonatal exposure to aerosolized diesel exhaust particles (NIST SRM 1650b). The particular behavioral focus was on temporal control learning, a broad and fundamental cognitive domain in which reward delivery is contingent on a fixed interval schedule. For this purpose, C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to aerosolized NIST SRM 1650b, a well-characterized diesel particulate material, from postnatal days 4-7 and 10-13, for four hours per day.

These symptoms exact a significant toll on stroke survivors. Clinical and research efforts in stroke recovery focus on motor disability, speech and language deficits, and cognitive dysfunction while largely neglecting psychological stressors. Evidence suggests mind-body interventions in other chronic illness populations decrease symptoms of depression, regulate immune responses, and promote resilience, yet similar studies are lacking in stroke populations. This review aims to synthesize evidence of the effects of mind-body interventions on psychological stressors, quality of life, and biological outcomes for stroke survivors. Methods- A systematic search of PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted from database inception to November 2017. Results- Eight studies were included in the review, with a total of 292 participants. Mind-body interventions included yoga or tai chi. Of the 5 included randomized controlled trials, most were pilot or feasibility studies with small sample sizes. Psychological stressors, including poststroke depression and anxiety, along with the quality of life, improved over time, but statistically significant between-group differences were largely absent. The 3 included studies with a qualitative design reported themes reflecting improvement in psychological stressors and quality of life. No included studies reported biological outcomes. Conclusions- Studies of mind-body interventions suggest a possible benefit on psychological stressors and quality of life; however, rigorously designed, sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials with mixed-methods design are warranted to delineate specific treatment effects of these interventions. Studies with both biological and psychological stressors as outcomes would provide evidence about interaction effects of these factors on stroke-survivor responses to mind-body interventions.",Impact of Visceral Adipose Tissue on Clinical Outcomes After Acute Ischemic Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612535,Stroke,2019 01 28,"Background and Purpose- The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between adiposity using adipose tissue imaging and stroke outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Methods- A total of 127 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis who underwent abdominal computed tomography on admission were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Patients were grouped according to their visceral adipose tissue (VAT) proportion tertile. The primary outcome was measured using the modified Rankin Scale 3 months after symptom onset. Favorable and excellent outcomes were defined as modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2 and 0 to 1, respectively. Results- As VAT proportion tertile increased, the number of patients exhibiting a favorable or excellent outcome decreased. In the final multivariable analysis after adjustments for confounders, patients in the highest VAT proportion tertile showed a decreased probability of a favorable and excellent outcome compared with those in the lowest tertile (odds ratio=0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.60; P=0.005 and odds ratio=0.13; 95% CI, 0.02-0.64; P=0.012, respectively). Obese patients (body mass index ≥25) also showed an excellent outcome compared with nonobese patients (odds ratio=4.88; 95% CI, 1.47-7.85; P=0.011). Among obese patients, those with an excellent outcome presented a significantly lower VAT proportion than those without (38.2% versus 46.1%, P=0.006). Conclusions- Results of this study indicate that low visceral abdominal fat proportion is associated with a favorable and excellent outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Better clinical outcomes in obese patients were also associated with a lower proportion of VAT.",Vertebral Artery Patency and Thrombectomy in Basilar Artery Occlusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612534,Stroke,2019 01 28,"Background and Purpose- Factors influencing recanalization success in basilar artery occlusions are largely unknown. Preliminary evidence has suggested that flow arrest in the vertebral artery contralateral to the catheter bearing vertebral artery may facilitate recanalization. The aim of this analysis was to assess the impact of anatomic variations and flow conditions on recanalization success in basilar artery occlusion treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Methods- Consecutive basilar artery occlusions treated with second-generation thrombectomy devices at a single-center were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline patients' characteristics, occlusion length, collateral circulation, underlying stenosis, incomplete occlusions, and patency of the vertebral arteries were analyzed with regards to recanalization success. Aplastic or hypoplastic vertebral artery contralateral to the catheter position was defined as contralateral low flow condition. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between anatomic variations and flow conditions in relation to complete recanalization and the modified Rankin Scale score while controlling for several potentially confounding variables. Clinical impact was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3. Results- One hundred fifteen patients were included (mean age 71.5±12.8, m:f=2:1, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale =15, interquartile range =10-22). Complete recanalization was more often observed in patients with contralateral low flow conditions (80.6% versus 50.0%), which remained an independent predictor of complete recanalization in multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio, 5.81; 95% CI, 1.97-17.19). Patients with complete posterior recanalization had lower in-hospital mortality (16.4% versus 41.7%) and more often achieved modified Rankin Scale score of ≤3 (49.4% versus 8.3%), even after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 15.93; 95% CI, 1.42-179.00). Conclusions- Contralateral low flow condition (vertebral artery aplasia or hypoplasia) seems to be an independent factor for fewer distal emboli and complete recanalization in basilar artery occlusion patients treated by modern endovascular devices. Complete recanalization reflecting the absence of peri-interventional clot fragmentation brings clear clinical benefit. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the need for contralateral flow modulation or ipsilateral balloon guide catheter during posterior circulation thrombectomy in patients with bilaterally patent vertebral arteries.",Assessment of HER2 Expression in Canine Urothelial Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612533,Veterinary pathology,2019 06 13,"Canine urothelial carcinoma (UC) has a poor prognosis and high metastatic rate. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell proliferation and differentiation regulation, has been attracting interest as a therapeutic target molecule for human breast cancer. This study investigated expression of the canine homolog of HER2 (ERBB2) in canine UC, and its association with clinical factors. Since it has been controversial whether commercial anti-human HER2 antibody (Dako A0485) correctly recognizes the canine homolog of HER2, an application of the antibody using a canine UC cell line was validated first. By Western blot, a single band at the appropriate size for canine HER2 (185 kDa) was recognized. Immunohistochemistry for HER2 was performed on 23 samples of UC, 8 samples of polypoid cystitis, and 8 samples of normal urinary bladder, and the results were scored as either 0, 1+, 2+, or 3+ with reference to the evaluation method for human UC. Intense membranous HER2 immunoreactivity was frequently observed in neoplastic cells, especially in grade 2 UC. Minor HER2 expression was found in the epithelial cells of polypoid cystitis and normal bladder. The incidence of HER2 positivity (scores of 2+ or 3+) was 14 of 23 (60.9%) in UC, 3 of 8 (37.5%) in polypoid cystitis, and 0 of 8 (0%) in normal bladder. There was no significant correlation between HER2 positivity and clinical factors. While increased HER2 expression was observed in a subset of urothelial carcinomas, further mechanistic studies are needed to determine its role in the pathogenesis and targeted therapy of this cancer.","Self-Compassion, Health Outcomes, and Family Carers of Older Adults: An Integrative Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612532,Clinical gerontologist,2019 01 07,"This review sought to synthesize published evidence about the role of self-compassion on health outcomes for family carers of older adults, to describe the current state of knowledge.",Comparative study of trait emotional intelligence and executive functioning among youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612531,The Journal of general psychology,2019 04 03,"This study investigated the relationship between trait emotional intelligence (TEI) and executive skills (ESs), and the differences between TEI and ESs among Malaysian and Iranian youths.

Fifty mothers and 38 fathers of adolescents suffering from anorexia nervosa and hospitalized for the first time participated in this study. They completed the Experience of Caregiving Inventory, a measure of the negative and positive aspects of the caregiving experience, and the Family Questionnaire, which measured the different dimensions of expressed emotion, namely emotional over-involvement and critical comments. Results showed that caregiving experience is significantly and positively correlated to expressed emotion. Among the negative aspects of caregiving, sense of loss contributed most to emotional over-involvement, while difficult behaviours contributed most to critical comments. The results suggest that parents' perceptions of their child and child's future are strongly related to their tendency to be over-involved. The perception of disruptive behaviours in their child could be one of the principal triggers or exacerbating factors of parents' critical attitudes.",Examining long-acting reversible contraception non-use among Australian women in their 20s: findings from a qualitative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612512,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 06 04,"Australian women use less effective, short-term methods of contraception more often than any other method, despite the availability of much more effective long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Although research examining the low uptake of LARC among Australian women has increased over the past few years, we still know little about the factors influencing this phenomenon. Using data from semi-structured telephone interviews with 15 Australian women in their 20s, this paper explores contraceptive experience to better understand the non-use of LARC. Findings highlight the ubiquity of the use of the oral contraceptive pill and perceptions of LARC as a more serious contraceptive choice. Among participants, the intrauterine device (IUD) was viewed particularly unfavourably. Furthermore, LARC was shown to be only considered for use after dissatisfaction with shorter-term methods (usually the Pill) if at all. Overall, these findings suggest further education in dispelling myths and discomfort around LARC use, while simultaneously recognising and respecting women's decisions to not use LARC methods.",The Effect of Reminiscence Therapy With Internet-Based Videos on Cognitive Status and Apathy of Older People With Mild Dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612511,Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,2019 02 06,"This study was carried out to assess the effects of reminiscence therapy that was supported with internet-based videos on the cognitive condition and apathy levels of older people with mild dementia living in nursing homes.

These changes, which have been recognized for more than a century, are ascribed to alterations in mechanical loading. While these adaptive responses have been well characterized, the molecular, cellular, and mechanical mechanisms underlying the changes have not. Here, we implicate Wnt signaling in the pathoetiology of PDL responses to underloading. We show that Wnt-responsive cells and their progeny in the PDL space exhibit a burst in proliferation in response to mastication. If an animal is fed a soft diet from the time of weaning, then this burst in Wnt-responsive cell proliferation is quelled; as a consequence, both the PDL and the surrounding alveolar bone undergo atrophy. Returning these animals to a hard food diet restores the Wnt signaling in PDL. These data provide, for the first time, a molecular mechanism underlying the adaptive response of the PDL to loading.",Adjusting hormones and constructing desires: new materialisations of female sexuality in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612507,"Culture, health & sexuality",2019 01 07,"This paper presents the findings from a study conducted in Brazil among doctors specialised in the treatment of sexual problems. Its focus is on medical treatments and approaches related to female sexuality. According to the accounts provided by professionals, the most common 'problem' they encountered among women was lack of sexual desire in the period around menopause. In line with current principles of sexual medicine, they concurred that this issue resulted from declining hormone production. This paper discusses how pharmaceutical treatments have facilitated the materialisation of female desire in terms of the presence or absence of testosterone, paradoxically the hormone most commonly associated with masculinity.",Association Between Wait Time for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Early Postprocedural Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612506,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 03 29,"Background Rapid growth in transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) demand has translated to inadequate access, reflected by prolonged wait times. Increasing wait times are associated with important adverse outcomes while on the wait-list; however, it is unknown if prolonged wait times influence postprocedural outcomes. Our objective was to determine the association between TAVR wait times and postprocedural outcomes. Methods and Results In this population-based study in Ontario, Canada, we identified all TAVR procedures between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2016. Wait time was defined as the number of days between initial referral and the procedure. Primary outcomes of interest were 30-day all-cause mortality and all-cause readmission. Multivariable regression models incorporated wait time as a nonlinear variable, using cubic splines. The study cohort included 2170 TAVR procedures, of which 1741 cases were elective and 429 were urgent. There was a significant, nonlinear relationship between TAVR wait time and post- TAVR 30-day mortality, as well as 30-day readmission. We observed an increased hazard associated with shorter wait times that diminished as wait times increased. This statistically significant nonlinear relationship was seen in the unadjusted model as well as after adjusting for clinical variables. However, after adjusting for case urgency status, there was no relationship between wait times and postprocedural outcomes. In sensitivity analyses restricted to either only elective or only urgent cases, there was no relationship between wait times and postprocedural outcomes. Conclusions Wait time has a complex relationship with postprocedural outcomes that is mediated entirely by urgency status. This suggests that further research should elucidate factors that predict hospitalization requiring urgent TAVR while on the wait list.",Early and Long-Term Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery Following Iatrogenic Injuries During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612504,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 03 29,"Background Iatrogenic coronary artery injuries during percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCI ) often require emergent surgical management. Our study evaluated the early and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing surgical treatment of iatrogenic PCI complications and identified the predictors of operative and long-term mortality. Methods and Results Pre-, intra- and post-operative data and hospital outcomes of 168 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures for iatrogenic complications following PCI between December 1999 and July 2015, were prospectively collected in our computerized database. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to identify the independent predictors of operative and long-term mortality. The mean age was 68.5±10.2 years and 35.7% were females. PCI complications included left anterior descending (38.7%), right coronary (29.2%), circumflex (13.1%), left main coronary artery injuries (19.0%), and acute myocardial infarction (66.7%), Type A aortic dissection (7.7%), cardiac tamponade (17.9%), and cardiogenic shock ( CS ) (46.4%). Operative mortality for corrective surgery was 20.8% and was independently predicted by critical preoperative state (odds ratio: 3.5; P=0.01). The 5- and 10-year survival for all patients was 63.9±4.0% and 49.6±5.0%, which improved remarkably in hospital survivors (79.0±4.0% and 64.0±6.0%). Risk factors for long-term mortality were critical preoperative state (hazard ratio: 3.5; P<0.0001) and coronary artery occlusion during PCI (hazard ratio: 2.6; P=0.002). The 5- and 10-year freedom from major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events was 59.7±4.0% and 41.9±5.0%. Conclusions Iatrogenic injuries after PCI or coronary angiography requiring surgical correction are associated with a high operative and long-term mortality. Patients developing acute coronary artery occlusion have a more guarded long-term prognosis. Hospital survivors, however, have a superior long-term survival.",Pediatric Behavioral Health-Related EMS Encounters: A Statewide Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612501,Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,2019 02 08,"Pediatric behavioral health disorders and related emergency department visits are increasing, but effects on emergency medical services (EMS) are unknown.

Age, on the other hand, has been shown to be an independent risk factor for deteriorating sexual function, with all aspects of the sexual function (i.e. desire, arousal, penetration, and orgasm) being affected. When combined with surgical correction of prolapse or incontinence there is potential for further worsening of sexual function, and hence this should be assessed before any pelvic floor surgery and patient expectations established.

Methods: 120 women aged 45-60 years were assigned to four groups: premenopause (Pre-M), perimenopause (Peri-M), early postmenopause (Post-EM), and late postmenopause (Post-LM). The menopausal symptoms were assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale. VMS was determined using the vaginal maturation index (VMI) and pH value. Sexual activity including sexual frequency and distress was measured using self-administered questionnaires. Results: A high proportion (48.2%) of Post-LM women reported low sexual frequency, and a high proportion (24.2%) of Peri-M women reported sexual distress. Physical/mental exhaustion and sexual problems were the most prevalent symptoms, followed by sleeping problems and hot flushes/sweating rated as severe or very severe. Physical/mental exhaustion and sexual problems became more frequent as menopausal stages progressed (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Hot flushes/sweating was more prominent in women in the Peri-M and Post-EM groups. The Post-LM group exhibited lower VMI and higher pH values than the Pre-M and Peri-M groups (p < 0.017 and p < 0.001, respectively), and pH was positively correlated with sexual problems (r = 0.298, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Advancing menopausal status is associated with prevalent physical/mental exhaustion and sexual problems in middle-aged Chinese women. Hot flushes/sweating is among the most frequent menopausal symptoms rated as severe or very severe. In addition, urogenital symptoms are correlated with pH in these women.",Evaluation of the effect of antenatal betamethasone on neonatal respiratory morbidities in late preterm deliveries (34-37 weeks).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612482,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 01 07,"Since late preterm neonates (34-36 weeks) are more at risk of respiratory morbidities, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of antenatal betamethasone on neonatal respiratory morbidities in women with late preterm delivery.",Impact of a student-driven wellness program for individuals with disabilities on caregivers and family members.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612480,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 07,Few studies have addressed impact of participation in exercise programs on caregivers or family members of individuals with disabilities.,Dynamic Optical Coherence Tomography Is a New Technique for Imaging Skin Around Lower Extremity Wounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612479,The international journal of lower extremity wounds,2019 05 08,"Chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers invariably heal slowly and recur. In the case of venous leg ulcers, poor healing of chronic wounds is variously attributed to ambulatory hypertension, impaired perfusion and diffusion, presence of chronic inflammation at wound sites, lipodermatosclerosis, and senescence. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a new technique, optical coherence tomography (OCT), which permits imaging of blood capillaries in the peri-wound skin, can provide new insights into the pathology. OCT and its recent variant, dynamic OCT, permit rapid noninvasive depth-resolved imaging of the capillaries in the superficial dermis via a handheld probe, showing the morphology and density of vessels down to 20 µm in diameter. We used dynamic OCT to investigate 15 chronic wounds and assess characteristics of the vessels at the 4 poles around the wounds, the wound bed, adjacent dermatosclerosis, and unaffected skin. The results of the study show that both vessel morphology and density in the wound edges are dramatically different from that in healthy skin, showing clusters of glomuleri-like vessels (knot-like forms or clumps) and an absence of linear branching vessels, and also greater blood perfusion. Such vessel shapes are reported to be associated with tissue growth. The OCT imaging procedure was rapid and well tolerated by patients and provided new information not available from other devices. Thus, OCT appears to have great promise as a tool for the evaluation and study of chronic ulcers.",Community-Wide Dissemination of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Use Using a 45-Minute Chest Compression-Only Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Training.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612478,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 03 29,"Background Little is known about whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) training can increase bystander CPR in the community or the appropriate target number of CPR trainings. Herein, we aimed to demonstrate community-wide aggressive dissemination of CPR training and evaluate temporal trends in bystander CPR . Methods and Results We provided CPR training (45-minute chest compression-only CPR plus automated external defibrillator use training or the conventional CPR training), targeting 16% of residents. All emergency medical service-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrests of medical origin were included. Data on patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and bystander CPR quality were prospectively collected from September 2010 to December 2015. The primary outcome was the proportion of high-quality bystander CPR . During the study period, 57 173 residents (14.7%) completed the chest compression-only CPR training and 32 423 (8.3%) completed conventional CPR training. The proportion of bystander CPR performed did not change (from 43.3% in 2010 to 42.0% in 2015; P for trend=0.915), but the proportion of high-quality bystander CPR delivery increased from 11.7% in 2010 to 20.7% in 2015 ( P for trend=0.015). The 1-year increment was associated with high-quality bystander CPR (adjusted odds ratio, 1.461; 95% CI, 1.055-2.024). Bystanders who previously experienced CPR training were 3.432 times (95% CI, 1.170-10.071) more likely to perform high-quality CPR than those who did not. Conclusions We trained 23.0% of the residents in the medium-sized city of Osaka, Japan, and demonstrated that the proportion of high-quality CPR performed on the scene increased gradually, whereas that of bystander CPR delivered overall remained stable.",Impact of infertility and infertility treatments on quality of life and levels of anxiety and depression in women undergoing in vitro fertilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612477,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 05 13,"This study aims to evaluate levels of anxiety and depression in women, correlated with infertility per se and with infertility treatments, highlighting predictors of higher levels of distress. Two validated standardized questionnaires, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Fertility Quality of Life (FertiQoL), were administered to 89 women both before their first cycle of infertility treatment and again at the end of the ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). Women's levels of anxiety were significantly higher before the treatment than during the treatment itself. Stratifying the women in three groups based on principal cause of infertility (male infertility, female infertility, or both male and female), we found significantly higher levels of anxiety and general distress in patients under treatment for female infertility. Higher anxiety levels in our sample before the treatment are probably an effect of not knowing what they are expected to do to solve their problem. Moreover, when the cause of infertility is exclusively female, women experience higher levels of anxiety and general distress both before and during the treatment, probably correlated to a sense of guilt. These data help the treating physician to better counsel patients and to provide a more focused psychological support."

Influenza virus' high mutation rate has allowed the virus to rapidly and continuously evolve, as well as generate new strains that are resistant to the current commercially available antivirals. Thus, the increased resistance has compelled the scientific community to explore alternative compounds that have antiviral effects against influenza virus. In this paper, the authors systematically review numerous herbal extracts that were shown to have antiviral effects against the virus. Specifically, the herbal antiviral targets mainly include hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and matrix 2 proteins. In some instances, herbal extracts inhibited the replication of oseltamivir-resistant strains and certain pentacyclic triterpenes exhibited higher antiviral activity than oseltamivir. This paper also explores the possibility of targeting various host-cell signaling pathways that are utilized by the virus during its replication process. Infected cell pathways are hijacked by intracellular signaling cascades such as NF-kB signaling, PI3K/Akt pathway, MAPK pathway and PKC/PKR signaling cascades. Herbal antivirals have been shown to target these pathways by suppressing nuclear export of influenza vRNP and thus inhibiting the phosphorylation signaling cascade. In conclusion, copious amounts of herbal antivirals have been shown to inhibit influenza virus, however further studies are needed for these new compounds to be up to modern pharmacological standards.",Total Glycosides of Peony Protects Against Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Regulating IL-23/IL-17 Axis and Th17/Treg Balance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612460,The American journal of Chinese medicine,2019 03 15,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of autoimmune diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, characterized by nonspecific inflammation in the gut. Total glycoside of peony (TGP) has been widely used for treatment of autoimmune diseases because of its pharmacological effects. However, it is lack of depth in whether TGP regulate T helper 17 cell (Th17) / T regulatory cell (Treg) immune balance or interleukin 23 (IL-23) / IL-17 axis to achieve the goal of treating IBD. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of TGP on experimental colitis mice and the related mechanisms. In the present study, we demonstrated that administration of TGP effectively attenuates colonic inflammation of TNBS-induced colitis mice, mainly reflected in significantly improved clinical parameters, reduced inflammatory response and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, even stronger systemic immune ability and effective improvement of Th17/Treg immune disorders. In addition, there was a stronger immunosuppressive ability in a positive cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4

Importantly, high-dose TGP has similar therapeutic effects as salicylazosulfapyridine (SASP) on IBD treatment. The potential mechanisms might be, at least in part, related to the adjustment of imbalance of Th17/Treg cells and the inhibition of IL-23/IL17 inflammatory signal axis.","Rhein, An Anthraquinone Drug, Suppresses the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Macrophage Activation in Urate Crystal-Induced Gouty Inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612459,The American journal of Chinese medicine,2019 03 15,"Rhein, an anthraquinone drug, is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine.

Here, we investigated the hypotensive effects and mechanisms of puerarin in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The qPCR array technique was used to determine the expression of hypertension-related genes. Then, the differentially expressed genes were analyzed using the STRING database. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of rats decreased after the administration of puerarin for nine weeks. Puerarin, but not losartan, also slowed the heart rate of rats. NO and cGMP levels were improved by puerarin. Eighteen differentially expressed hypertension-related genes were identified by comparing the model group with the control group and the high-dose puerarin group with the model group. NO and cGMP levels were increased by high-dose puerarin. High-dose puerarin increased the levels of the phosphorylated eNOS protein and decreased AT1 and Cav1 levels. Based on our results, eNOS was a key target in the mechanism by which puerarin reduced blood pressure, and puerarin represents a potential antihypertensive agent.",Ferulic Acid Exerts Anti-apoptotic Effects against Ischemic Injury by Activating HSP70/Bcl-2- and HSP70/Autophagy-Mediated Signaling after Permanent Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612456,The American journal of Chinese medicine,2019 03 15,"This study assessed the anti-apoptotic effects of the administration of ferulic acid (FrA) in rats 30

Structural equation modeling was used to test these relationships in a group of older adults (65-98 years, N = 606) from the 2000 Wave Panel 3 of the Long Beach Longitudinal Study. Women outperformed men on OM, reporting less frequent memory failures. Dysphoria and openness predicted OM, yet not SM. Cognitive concerns, neuroticism, and conscientiousness predicted SM but not OM. The personality and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) factors relevant for SM differed from those for OM, with the GDS factors showing a stronger impact. Overall, discrepancies between SM and OM may be partially explained by the varying impact of the GDS and personality factors, as both provide differential utility in understanding SM and OM differences in older adulthood.",Middle-Aged Children's Coping Strategies With Tensions in the Aging Parent-Child Tie.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612442,International journal of aging & human development,2019 01 07,"Middle-aged children may cope in different ways with interpersonal tensions with their aging parents.

Middle-aged children ( N = 378) reported coping strategies when encountering interpersonal tensions with each of parents ( N = 482): engagement, acceptance, avoidance, and confrontation. Middle-aged children also indicated how guilty and worried they felt about each parent. Multilevel models indicated that middle-aged children were most likely to use engagement and acceptance strategies, followed by avoidance, and least likely to use confrontation. Results also revealed that middle-aged offspring were more likely to use engagement toward their parents who were older and acceptance toward parents with more disabilities. Furthermore, when middle-aged children had stronger feelings of guilt toward parents, they were more likely to be avoidant and less likely to engage with parents. Worries about parents were positively associated with the use of engagement strategies.",Pure Bipolar Plasma Vaporization of the Prostate: Results from a Prospective 3D Ultrasound Volumetry Study with Clinical Outcome After 3 Years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612441,Journal of endourology,2019 02 15,"Bipolar plasma vaporization (BPV) has been shown to be a low-morbidity alternative to conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

Several published cross-cultural studies have confirmed adequate psychometric performance in terms of reliability, validity, and measurement invariance. This study adds to this literature by applying the Rasch approach to estimate invariant comparison in a cross-cultural context, applied to both Australian and Portuguese high school students. Participants were an age- and gender-matched convenience sample of 1,040 adolescents (520 cases in each group, 51.54% male) who ranged in age from 12 to 18 years ( M = 14.25 years, SD = 1.71 years). It is found that both Portuguese and Australian data fit the Rasch measurement model, with excellent levels of reliability at a country level. However, when all of the data were combined, a slight misfit was found. This was resolved by removing some issues with item thresholds in standard of living among the Australian data and splitting the data by country on health. This allowed both Australian and Portuguese cases to differ on the health item. We conclude that the PWI-SC is unidimensional, with some evidence of mild, but acceptable local dependency. This study further supports the cross-cultural validity of the PWI-SC and the use of this measure in the Australian and Portuguese context but also indicates a potential direction that development of the PWI-SC might proceed.",Differences in Coping Strategies Between Young and Older Adults: The Role of Executive Functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612437,International journal of aging & human development,2019 01 07,"Executive functions (EFs) have been identified as processes in the ability to select and apply adaptive strategies for coping with stress. This study compares executive functioning, short-term memory, and coping in a sample of young and older adults with no prior diagnosis of depression and with normal cognitive function ( N = 216). The study collected measures of depression, EFs, short-term memory, and coping. Young participants scored higher than older adults on EFs and short-term memory. Moreover, in young adults, there was a prevalence of avoidance coping strategies. Scores on depressive symptomatology were found to be related to avoidant coping strategies. Older adults with higher score on inhibition used less avoidant coping. Thus, it seems that executive deficits might contribute to depression, as they affect processes for coping with stress. This finding may have implications for the role of EFs and coping in psychological well-being and successful adaptation of individuals to stressful situations.",Analysis of Antisense Oligonucleotides and Their Metabolites with the Use of Ion Pair Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Mass Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612436,Critical reviews in analytical chemistry,2019 05 21,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have been widely investigated as a potential drugs because of their ability to bind with the target DNA or RNA strands, which may lead to inhibition of translational processes.

By carefully controlling the supramolecular assembly processes resulting from the strong electrostatic interactions between negatively charged Yb complexes and Tb3+ cations in aqueous solutions, we engineered the formation of heteropolynuclear complexes of [(YbL)2Tb x] compositions ( x = 1 and 2). These edifices display a phenomenon of cooperative photosensitization UC with green emission of the Tb cations upon NIR excitation at 980 nm in the Yb absorption band. The photophysical properties of the complexes were carefully investigated by steady-state and time-resolved luminescence experiments in D2O, allowing one to quantify the impact of the composition and pD of the solution on the emission intensity as well as clarifying the exact cooperative photosensitization upconversion mechanism.

Enantiopure ligands, each containing H-bond donors and acceptors, form different structures, depending on the ratio in which they are combined: enantiopure components form M4L4 assemblies, whereas racemic mixtures form M3L3 stacks. Chiral amplification within M3L3 enantiomers was observed when a 2:1 ratio of R and S subcomponent enantiomers was employed. Simply switching the solvent (from MeCN to MeOH) or chelating unit (from bidentate to tridentate) increased the diversity of structures that can be generated from these building blocks, leading to the selective formation of novel M2L2 and M3L2 assemblies. The addition of achiral ligand building blocks resulted in the formation of further structures: When an achiral subcomponent was combined with its R and S chiral congeners, a three-layer heteroleptic architecture was generated, with the achiral unit sitting at the top of the stack. When combined with the S enantiomer only, however, the achiral unit assembled in the center of the structure, thus demonstrating the selective placement of achiral units within chiral systems. Further sorting experiments revealed that combining R and S stereocenters within a single ligand led to diastereoselective product generation. These results show how geometric complementarity between different ligands impacts upon the degree of hydrogen-bonding within the assembly, stabilizing specific low-symmetry architectures from among many possible structural outcomes."

Both plus- and minus-strands of the provirus are transcribed, respectively from the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats (LTR). Plus-strand expression is rapid and intense once activated, whereas the minus-strand is transcribed at a lower, more constant level. To identify how HTLV-1 transcription is regulated, we investigated the epigenetic modifications associated with the onset of spontaneous plus-strand expression and the potential impact of the host factor CTCF. Methods: Patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in vitro HTLV-1-infected T cell clones were examined. Cells were stained for the plus-strand-encoded viral protein Tax, and sorted into Tax + and Tax - populations. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation were performed to identify epigenetic modifications in the provirus. Bisulfite-treated DNA fragments from the HTLV-1 LTRs were sequenced. Single-molecule RNA-FISH was performed, targeting HTLV-1 transcripts, for the estimation of transcription kinetics. The CRISPR/Cas9 technique was applied to alter the CTCF-binding site in the provirus, to test the impact of CTCF on the epigenetic modifications. Results: Changes in the histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac were strongly correlated with plus-strand expression. DNA in the body of the provirus was largely methylated except for the pX and 3' LTR regions, regardless of Tax expression. The plus-strand promoter was hypomethylated when Tax was expressed. Removal of CTCF had no discernible impact on the viral transcription or epigenetic modifications. Conclusions: The histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac are highly dynamic in the HTLV-1 provirus: they show rapid change with the onset of Tax expression, and are reversible. The HTLV-1 provirus has an intrinsic pattern of epigenetic modifications that is independent of both the provirus insertion site and the chromatin architectural protein CTCF which binds to the HTLV-1 provirus.",The overlap between miscarriage and extreme preterm birth in a limited-resource setting on the Thailand-Myanmar border: a population cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30607368,Wellcome open research,2019 01 08,"Background: No universal  demarcation of gestational age  distinguishes miscarriage and stillbirth or extreme preterm birth (exPTB). This study provides a synopsis of outcome between 22 to <28 weeks gestation from a low resource setting. Methods: A retrospective record review of a population on the Thailand-Myanmar border was conducted. Outcomes were classified as miscarriage, late expulsion of products between 22 to < 28 weeks gestation with evidence of non-viability (mostly ultrasound absent fetal heart beat) prior to 22 weeks; or  exPTB (stillbirth/live born) between 22 to < 28 weeks gestation when the fetus was viable at ≥22 weeks. Termination of pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease were excluded. Results: From 1995-2015, 80.9% (50,046/ 61,829) of registered women had a known pregnancy outcome, of whom 99.8% (49,931) had a known gestational age. Delivery  between 22 to <28 weeks gestation included 0.9% (472/49,931) of pregnancies after removing 18 cases (3.8%) who met an exclusion criteria. Most  pregnancies had an ultrasound: 72.5% (n=329/454);  43.6% (n=197) were classified as  miscarriage and 56.4% (n=257) exPTB.  Individual record review of miscarriages estimated that fetal death had occurred at a median of 16 weeks, despite late expulsion between 22 to <28 weeks. With available data (n=252, 5 missing) the proportion of stillbirth was 47.6% (n=120), congenital abnormality 10.5% (24/228, 29 missing) and neonatal death was 98.5% (128/131, 1 missing). Introduction of ultrasound was associated with a 2-times higher odds of classification of outcome as exPTB rather than miscarriage. Conclusion: In this low resource setting few (<1%) pregnancy outcomes occurred in the 22 to <28 weeks gestational window; four in ten  were miscarriage (late expulsion) and neonatal mortality approached 100%.  In the scale-up to preventable newborns deaths (at least initially) greater benefits will be obtained by focusing on the viable newborns of ≥ 28 weeks gestation.",[Perianal swabs surveillance cultures of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae(CRE) can be hints for CRE bloodstream infection in patients with hematological diseases].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612405,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,2019 03 20,"Objective: To analyze the hints role of surveillance cultures of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) by perianal swabs in patients with hematological diseases, and seek risk factors of CRE bloodstream infection.

Methods: Immunocytochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the expression of PRDM1 and p-AKT in 10 EN-NK/T-NT tissue or 3 cell lines (PRDM1-positive YT cell line, PRDM1-negative NKL and NK92 cell lines). Nanostring gene expression profiling technique was used to detect the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway in normal nasal mucosa, PRDM1-negative and positive EN-NK/T-NT tissue. MTS was used to detect cell proliferation, and flow cytometry was used to detect cell cycle and apoptosis. Results: Nanostring gene expression profiling revealed that genes associated with PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (eg, IL-7, BRCA1, ITGA8, IL2RB, FASLG, CDK2, COL27A1, CSF3R, KITLG and IL-6) were highly expressed in EN-NK/T-NT cases (P<0.05). Also, we found that p-AKT was highly expressed in YT cell line, but lower or not expressed in NK92 and NKL cells. In addition, LY294002, a PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor, increased PRDM1 and PTEN expression in a dose dependent manner in YT cells.

This article, combined with relevant literature at home and abroad, reviews the application of digital medical intelligent diagnosis and treatment technologies in general surgery,such as three-dimensional visualization,three-dimentional printing, mixed reality, molecular fluorescence imaging, artificial intelligence-imaging omics, abdominal surgery navigation and photoacoustic imaging. Three-dimentional visualization has changed the traditional ""two-dimensional"" disease diagnosis and treatment mode; three-dimentional printing of three-dimentional images is a leap-forward transition to stereoscopic physical models; mixed reality has broken the boundary between the digital virtual world and the physical real world, bringing technological innovation to traditional surgery; Indocyanine green molecular fluorescence imaging has achieved tumor boundary definition, micro or metastatic lesion detection and intraoperative real-time navigation at the molecular and cellular level; artificial intelligence-imaging omics can improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis and predict risk and efficacy; abdominal surgical navigation can improve the accuracy and safety of the operation; high precision-cross-scale photoacoustic microscopy can define the tumor boundary from the molecular, cellular and microvascular levels to guide the precise resection of the tumor; finally, this paper looks forward to the new direction of general surgery diagnosis and treatment represented by digital medicine and artificial intelligence.",Multicolor fluorescence microscopy using static light sheets and a single-channel detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612379,Journal of biomedical optics,2019 05 21,"We present a multicolor fluorescence microscope system, under a selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) configuration, using three continuous wave-lasers and a single-channel-detection camera. The laser intensities are modulated with three time-delayed pulse trains that operate synchronously at one third of the camera frame rate, allowing a sequential excitation and an image acquisition of up to three different biomarkers. The feasibility of this imaging acquisition mode is demonstrated by acquiring single-plane multicolor images of living hyphae of Neurospora crassa. This allows visualizing simultaneously the localization and dynamics of different cellular components involved in apical growth in living hyphae. The configuration presented represents a noncommercial, cost-effective alternative microscopy system for the rapid and simultaneous acquisition of multifluorescent images and can be potentially useful for three-dimensional imaging of large biological samples.",Revisiting the social cost of carbon after INDC implementation in Malaysia: 2050.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612378,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 11,"This article projects the social cost of carbon (SCC) and other related consequences of climate change by using Malaysia's intended nationally determined contribution (INDC) and climate vision 2040 (CV2040) by 2050. It compares the projections derived from the Dynamic Integrated Model of the Climate and Economy (DICME) based on the respective INDC and CV2040 scenario. The results reveal that industrial emissions would incur a substantial increase every 5 years under the scenario CV2040, while Malaysia would experience lower industrial emissions in the coming years under the scenario INDC. Emission intensity in Malaysia will be 0.61 and 0.59 tons/capita in 2030 for scenario CV2040 and scenario INDC respectively. Malaysia would face climate damage of MYR456 billion and MYR 49 billion by 2050 under CV2040 and INDC scenario respectively. However, climate damage could be much lower if the INDC regime were adopted, as this scenario would decrease climatic impacts over time. The estimated SSC per ton of CO2 varies between MYR74 and MYR97 for scenario CV2040 and MYR44 and MYR62 for scenario INDC in 2030 and 2050 respectively. Considering different aspects, including industrial emissions, damage cost, and social cost of carbon, INDC is the best policy compared to CV2040. Thus, Malaysia could achieve its emissions reduction target by implementing INDC by 2050.","Adsorptive removal of anionic dye using calcined oyster shells: isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612377,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 11,"Oyster shells are a type of biogenic materials with excellent characteristics in surface area, porosity, sorption capacity, and high concentration of CaCO3 (up to 90 wt%), and can be easily converted into a calcium-based alkali adsorbent. In this research, oyster shells calcined at 900 °C were applied as an adsorbent for acid green 25 (AG25) removal from aqueous solutions. The adsorption performances were evaluated, and the FTIR, SEM, and BET techniques were employed to characterize this material. Results showed that AG25 removal performance depended on adsorbent dosage, pH, adsorption temperature, contact time, and initial concentration. Adsorption capacity was maximized at 34.1 mg g-1 at pH of 11.0, an adsorbent dosage of 2.0 g L-1, an AG25 concentration of 70 mg L-1, and adsorption temperature of 40 °C. Both the Ho-McKay model and the pseudo-second-order model correlated with the adsorption kinetics well with the values of R2 > 0.99 (closer to unity). The Langmuir isotherm showed an excellent correlation coefficient of R2 > 0.99 with the equilibrium data. The thermodynamics study indicates that the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic. These results demonstrate that the calcined oyster shells has the potential to be used as an eco-friendly and low-cost effective adsorbent for anionic dye removal from water.","Health risk assessment of heavy metals in the soil-water-rice system around the Xiazhuang uranium mine, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612376,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 11,"Heavy-metal pollutants in the soil and surface water of agricultural areas accumulate in rice and may have adverse effects on the health of consumers. In this study, we determined the levels of heavy-metal contamination in agricultural areas around the Xiazhuang uranium deposits in northern Guangdong Province, China, using equidistant sampling methods along a river near the mine tailings. The pH values of all the water samples were determined. The heavy-metal concentrations in water, bottom sludge, and rice were measured. The extent of contamination was evaluated by calculating Nemerow's pollution index, contamination factor, and hazard quotient. The result shows U transferred from mine to soil and rice with irrigation water. The main pollutants and their pollution indices in soil are U (6.31), Th (4.02), Pb (2.52), Cd (2.36), Zn (1.52), and Mn (1.39). The rice grain can hardly enrich U and Th but were susceptible to Cr and Ni. The contamination factors (CFs) of the pollutants in rice grain are Cr (1.98) and Ni (3.09). The hazard quotient (HQ) shows that Cu (HQ > 1) could pose potential risks for humans upon long-term consumption of the rice.","A comprehensive review on water-emulsified diesel fuel: chemistry, engine performance and exhaust emissions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612375,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 15,"Increasing environmental concern, human health and the continuous upgradation in the stringent standards of vehicular emissions have shown much interest in cleaner diesel fuels. Out of various strategies to mitigate the diesel engine emissions, use of water blended diesel in the form of emulsion has grabbed sufficient attention of the fuel research community. Various researches have shown that water-emulsified diesel has sufficient potential to improve the engine performance simultaneously with a significant reduction in the levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. Micro-explosion phenomenon of combustion in emulsion fuel helps to provide efficient and complete combustion which in turn improves brake thermal efficiency. The current study presents a comprehensive review of the usage of water-emulsified diesel fuel in CI engines. Focusing on the performance, combustion, and emission analysis, it also talks in detail about the principle and the chemistry involved in making of a stable and homogeneous water-diesel emulsion compatible for CI engine. The literature survey concludes two crucial points. First, the water-blended diesel emulsion serves as an economical, fuel efficient, and cleaner combustion technology. Second, the optimum blend ratio, emulsifier quantity, and proper process differs in almost all the research papers and hence needed to be standardized.",Several environmental endocrine disruptors in beverages from South China: occurrence and human exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612374,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 11,"Environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) in beverages may enter the human body by ingestion and thus may represent a potential health risk. In this study, phthalates, bisphenol A, and its analogues, parabens, benzophenone-type UV filters, and triclosan (TCS) were analyzed in beverage samples (n = 116) collected from local markets in Guangzhou, South China. Twelve of 30 target compounds were found in > 50% samples, and for the first time, TCS was found in a majority of beverages from China (~ 80%). Among all analytes, concentrations of total phthalates (median = 14.4 ng/mL) were generally two orders of magnitude higher than other target EEDs, and concentrations of total benzophenone-type UV filters (0.02 ng/mL) and TCS (0.01 ng/mL) were the lowest. Among all targets, phthalates were predominant, accounting for > 99% of the total EEDs, and dimethyl phthalate was frequently detected in beverages (> 60%). In addition, we estimated the daily intake (EDI) of EEDs for Chinese populations of different age groups based on the daily consumption of beverages. The EDIs of total EEDs were the highest for toddlers (mean = 14,200 ng/kg-bw/day) followed by children and teenagers (3420 ng/kg-bw/day), adults (1950 ng/kg-bw/day), the elderly (1740 ng/kg-bw/day), and infants (70 ng/kg-bw/day). Compared to all food categories, EEDs from beverage consumption accounted for ~ 0.1% (parabens) to 20% (phthalates) of total exposure from diet. However, intakes of phthalates, bisphenols, and TCS from beverages were comparable to those from other potential sources (food, dust, personal care products, cloth, and medicines). Furthermore, the cumulative risks of EEDs by beverage consumption were not high, which indicated that EEDs in beverages might not represent a potential human health risk for Chinese populations."

The occurrence and removal of micro-organic pollutants in EWWTPs were still not well known. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their typical derivatives (SPAHs) including the oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs), chlorinated PAHs (ClPAHs), and methyl PAHs (MPAHs) were investigated in an EWWTP in Guangdong Province, China. The concentrations of the Σ6 OPAHs (114-384 ng/L) were higher than the Σ16 PAHs (92-250 ng/L), and much higher than the Σ4 MPAHs (13-64 ng/L) and Σ9 ClPAHs (2-3 ng/L) in the EWWTP and the effluent receiving river. The total removal efficiencies of the PAHs, OPAHs, MPAHs, and ClPAHs in the EWWTP (43 ± 14%, 41 ± 7%, 55 ± 16%, and 18 ± 4%) were lower than the traditional WWTPs, probably due to the lower concentration of the sludge in the ecological treatment. The advanced treatment process (microfiltration and UV disinfection treatment) contributed much less (0-20%) to the whole removal efficiency than the ecological treatment (80-100%). The effluent from the EWWTP slightly reduced the PAHs and SPAHs concentrations in the receiving river. The high concentrations of the PAHs and SPAHs in the receiving river were similar to the influent of the EWWTP, indicating that some untreated wastewater was directly discharged to the river, especially in the upstream.",Impacts of leachate of landfill on the groundwater hydrochemistry and size distributions and heavy metal components of colloids: a case study in NE China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612360,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 10,"Colloids associated with heavy metals are ubiquitous in contaminated groundwater; waste accumulation at imperfectly sealed landfills can produce large amounts of leachate with colloids and heavy metal contaminants, which can pollute the downstream groundwater. In this study, three sites in a landfill were sampled to reveal heavy metal particle size distributions and their chemical compositions. The > 220 nm particle sizes were the predominant size in the downstream groundwater, while the < 10 nm particle sizes were the predominant size in the upstream groundwater. Total Fe increased from 35.5 μg/L in the upstream groundwater to 107 μg/L in the downstream groundwater. This increase was attributed to the enhanced migration and accumulation of colloids in the aqueous phase. The elements and the colloid size distribution in the landfill indirectly reflected the composition and degradation of the waste. Colloids played a key role in distribution of both solid particles and aqueous contaminants in the landfill. The results of this study will contribute to the knowledge of the effect of different contaminants in the vicinity of landfills without appropriate sealing systems.","Bioconcentration, behavioral, and biochemical effects of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac in Daphnia magna.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612359,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 10,"The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac is one of the most frequently studied as well as controversially discussed pharmaceutically active drug on the subject of its relevance to the environment. This study was conducted to assess the bioconcentration potential of diclofenac and its behavioral and biochemical effects in Daphnia magna. The bioconcentration factors of diclofenac determined after 48 h of aqueous exposure in Daphnia magna were 70.94 and 8.02 for the nominal exposure concentrations of 5 and 100 μg/L, respectively. Diclofenac exposure obviously decreased the filtration and ingestion rates of the daphnids. A significant increase of the acetylcholinesterase activity that was observed in this study indicates that diclofenac might not have neurobehavioral toxicity in Daphnia magna. Significant induction of malondialdehyde content is an indication of overproduction of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative damage in daphnids after diclofenac exposure. Moreover, significant inhibition of the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase activities implies that the antioxidant defense system of Daphnia magna was overwhelmed. Also, significant inhibition of glutathione s-transferase activity might point to the fact that the enzyme was not capable to detoxify diclofenac in Daphnia magna. These findings indicate that diclofenac can accumulate and consequently stimulate behavioral and biochemical disturbances in Daphnia magna.","Mercury chloride toxicity in human erythrocytes: enhanced generation of ROS and RNS, hemoglobin oxidation, impaired antioxidant power, and inhibition of plasma membrane redox system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612358,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 10,"Mercury is among the most toxic heavy metals and a widespread environmental pollutant. Mercury chloride (HgCl2) is an inorganic compound of mercury which is easily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and then enters the blood where it can interact with erythrocytes. In this study, the effect of HgCl2 on human erythrocytes was studied under in vitro conditions. Erythrocytes were treated with different concentrations of HgCl2 (1-100 μM) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared and assayed for several biochemical parameters. HgCl2 treatment resulted in oxidation of ferrous iron of hemoglobin to ferric form giving methemoglobin which is inactive as an oxygen transporter. However, the activity of methemoglobin reductase was increased. Hemoglobin oxidation was accompanied by heme degradation and the release of free iron. Protein oxidation was greatly increased with a simultaneous decrease in free amino and sulfhydryl groups and glutathione content. The antioxidant power of HgCl2-treated erythrocytes was impaired resulting in lowered metal reducing and free radical quenching ability of these cells. This suggests that HgCl2 induces oxidative stress in human erythrocytes. This was confirmed when superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, and nitric oxide generation were found to be dose-dependently increased in HgCl2-treated erythrocytes. Glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, the two major pathways of glucose metabolism in erythrocytes, were also inhibited. HgCl2 treatment also inhibited the plasma membrane redox system while the activities of AMP deaminase and glyoxalase-I were increased. These results show that HgCl2 induces oxidative and nitrosative stress, oxidizes hemoglobin, impairs the antioxidant defense mechanism, and alters metabolic pathways in human erythrocytes.",Bioaccumulation dynamics and gene regulation in a freshwater bivalve after aqueous and dietary exposures to gold nanoparticles and ionic gold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612357,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 01 06,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are being developed and produced for a wide variety of industrial and biomedical applications, which raises the concern about their release and potential effects in the environment. In this study, we aim to assess the effects of PEGylated AuNPs and ionic gold on the freshwater bivalve Corbicula fluminea. As NP bioavailability is conditioned by many factors of variability, we focused on the determination of biodynamic parameters which control AuNP uptake and elimination in bivalves. Three experiments were conducted: (1) a waterborne exposure (0-24 mg/L for AuNPs and 0-12 mg/L for ionic gold), (2) a dietborne exposure (0-48 mg/L for AuNPs and 0-24 mg/L for ionic gold), and (3) an elimination phase (after waterborne exposure to 12 mg/L for AuNPs and 24 mg/L for ionic gold), to calculate rate constants for uptake from water(kuw), from food (kuf), and for the physiological elimination (ke) for AuNPs and AuCl(OH)3-. Jointly, the relative expression of several genes was investigated in the hemolymph cells to relate AuNPs and gold ion exposures to detoxification, oxidative stress, immune, and apoptosis responses in C. fluminea. Results show that kuw and kuf were around 10 and 30 times higher for AuNPs compared to AuCl(OH)3-, respectively. The ke was also faster in clams exposed to AuNPs meaning that they also had greater excretion capacities in comparison to gold ions. Water seems to be the main exposure pathway for C. fluminea according to kuw and kuf values for AuNPs and AuCl(OH)3- (kuw = 0.28 and 0.03, kuf = 0.009 and 0.001, respectively). The gene analyses pointed out important responses against oxidative stress, strong activations of genes of the immunity, and apoptosis after the waterborne exposure to AuNPs and to a lesser extent after exposure to gold ions. Very few responses were observed after the dietary exposure to both forms of gold, probably due to valve closure in response to contamination. While some studies suggest that the toxicity of nanoparticles may come from the release of metal ions, our results showed that the AuNPs we used were very stable (less than 1% of ion release) and generated more effects at the gene level than ionic gold. Therefore these results highlight the strong potential of toxicity of AuNPs compared to ionic gold and raise new concerns about the toxicity inherent to NPs in the environment.","Occurrence, fate, and transport of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) in an alkaline rhizosphere soil-plant (Maize, Zea mays L.) system: the role of Bacillus subtilis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612356,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 09,"Utilization of microbes is one of the most promising methods to remediate potentially toxic metals (PTMs) from soil. In this study, a systematic investigation was conducted to study the influence of Bacillus subtilis on PTMs occurrence, fractionation, translocation, and accumulation in the rhizosphere soil of Maize (Zea mays L.) in pot experiments. B. subtilis showed strong effects on the fate and mobility of Pb, Sb, Ni, Zn, Cu, and Cr, and it also affected PTMs' distribution in the rhizosphere soil, maize growth, and microbial community structure. Results showed that it was easier for Zn to accumulate in maize roots than other PTMs. According to chemical fractionation, B. subtilis tended to immobilize Pb, Sb, Ni, Zn, and Cu in the rhizosphere soil. Compared with other PTMs, Cr tended to be more available and more mobile, which indicated a higher health risk to the eco-environment. These findings suggested that B. subtilis could be used as a geomicrobiological stabilizer to immobilize PTMs (Pb, Sb, Ni, Cu, Zn) in alkaline soils and decrease their uptake by plants, thus reducing the risks of a potential transfer into the food chain.","The potential modulatory role of herbal additives against Cd toxicity in human, animal, and poultry: a review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612355,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 04 15,"Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy and toxic metal and easily absorbed by animals and plants; subsequently, it is an environmental risk factor with several toxic effects in humans and animals. The main pathway of human or animal exposure to Cd is through its ingestion by water or food and by particles or fume inhalation during industrial processes. With continuous exposure to small levels of cadmium, it is being deposited in different tissues day after day, causing toxic effects on the liver, kidney, and testes. Long-term exposure to this toxic metal resulted in inflammatory infiltration, necrosis of hepatocytes, degenerative changes in testis tissues, reduction in spermatocytes, degeneration in renal tubules, and hypertrophy of renal epithelium. Therefore, we need an effective treatment to overcome cadmium poisoning. Thus, in the current review, we try to provide compiled reports and summarize information about the toxicological effects of Cd in human, animals, and poultry. This review also provides updated information about the protective actions of herbs and herbal extracts and their role as an effective strategy in reducing or preventing serious health problems and tissue damage in response to Cd toxicity.","Water pollution and observation of acquired antibiotic resistance in Bayou Lafourche, a major drinking water source in Southeast Louisiana, USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612354,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 01 06,"Antibiotics are known to enter the environment, not only by human excretion but also through livestock/aquaculture, healthcare facilities, and pharmaceutical industry waste. Once in the environment, antibiotics have the ability to provide a selective pressure in microbial communities thus selecting for resistance. Bayou Lafourche of Southeastern Louisiana serves as the raw source of drinking water for 300,000 people in the region and has previously been shown to receive high amounts of fecal contamination. Four sites along the bayou and one site from its input source on the Mississippi River were monitored for water chemistry, total and fecal coliform estimates, and presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) for a period of 1 year. Four waste-associated bacterial isolates were tested for resistance to antibiotics (tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, cefoxitin, meropenem, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin). Resistant bacteria were further examined with PCR/electrophoresis to confirm the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (Sul1, tet(A), tet(W), tet(X), IMP, KPC, and OXA-48). The bayou appears to meet the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) criteria for water chemistry, yet fecal coliforms were consistently higher than LDEQ thresholds, thus indicating fecal contamination. Enterobacteriaceae isolates showed 13.6%, 10.9%, and 19.8% resistant to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and cefoxitin, respectively, and 11 isolates were confirmed for presence of either tet(A) or Sul1 resistance genes. High fecal coliforms and presence of ARB/ARG may both indicate a presence of anthropogenic or agricultural source of fecal contamination.",Steady-state modeling of the biodegradation performance of a multistage moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) used for on-site greywater treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612353,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 01 06,"In this study, the Activated Sludge Model No. 3 (ASM3) was applied for the simulation of the removal of organics and nitrogen in a multistage moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) used for biological greywater treatment. The data related to the characterization of the greywater were collected over a period of 5 months to be investigated in the model. The reactor showed a high performance for the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), ammonia (NH4-N), and total nitrogen (TN) with a removal efficiency of 93%, 80.7%, 99%, 89%, and 77%, respectively. The results of modeling showed a good correlation between simulated and experimental concentrations of COD issued from different reactors of the MBBR system. The adaptability of the ASM3 model to fit other parameters such as TN, NH4-N, total suspended solids (TSS), and the dissolved oxygen (DO) was also investigated for two selected reactors: reactor (R1) and the reactor (R5). The simulation results showed an acceptable correlation regarding the evolution of the investigated parameters in R1 and R5 and in the effluent except for total nitrogen TN.

Simultaneous nitrate reduction and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal were achieved, and the effects of composite catalyst (CC) addition, AC addition, and initial pH were investigated. The reaction kinetics and reaction mechanisms were calculated and analyzed. The results showed that CC addition could enhance the reduction rate of nitrate and effectively inhibit the production of ammonia. Moreover, AC addition increased the adsorption capacity of biorefractory organic compounds (BROs) and enhanced the degradation of BRO. The reduction of NO3--N at different pH values was consistently greater than 96.9%, and NH4+-N was suppressed by high pH. The presence of CC ensured the reaction rate of IC-ME at high pH. The reaction kinetics orders and constants were calculated. Catalyzed iron scrap (IS)-AC showed much better nitrate reduction and BRO degradation performances than IS-AC and AC. The IC-ME showed great potential for application to nitrate and BRO reduction in reclaimed water."

However, it remains unknown whether an early brain structural compromise could be involved in this clinical association. Here, in a cohort of 120 cognitively preserved de novo PD patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database, we found a widespread reduction in cerebral gray matter volume (GMV) in patients harboring the Val/Val genotype. The atrophic pattern included fronto-subcortical and parieto-temporal territories. Importantly, the GMV at some of the identified regions was associated with cognitive decline in a 4-year follow-up period.

In this study, the FC of the PCC was characterized by using resting-state functional MRI and a seed-based whole-brain correlation method in 24 T2DM patients and compared with 24 well-matched healthy controls. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to determine the relationships between the FC of the PCC and cognitive dysfunction. T2DM was associated with a significantly decreased FC of the PCC to widespread brain regions (p < 0.05, corrected for AlphaSim). We also found that the FC of the PCC in these brain regions was positively correlated with several neuropsychological test scores, such as the FC to the right angular gyrus (AnG) and the bilateral middle temporal gyrus (MTG) with the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) and the FC to the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with the digit span test (DST). Moreover, the FCs of the PCC to the right superior parietal lobule (SPL), bilateral temporal lobes and left cerebrum were detected as negatively correlated with the Trail Making Test (TMT). No such correlations were detected in healthy controls. The present study provides useful information about the effect of the FC of the PCC on the underlying neuropathological process of T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction and may provide supporting evidence for further molecular biology studies.",Updated functional segregation of retinal ganglion cell projections in the tectum of a cyprinid fish-further elaboration based on microelectrode recordings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612338,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019 05 10,"Single-unit responses of retinal ganglion cells (GCs) were recorded extracellularly from their axonal terminals in the tectum opticum (TO) of the intact fish (goldfish, carp). The depths of retinal units consecutively recorded along the track of the microelectrode were measured. At the depth of around 50 μm, the responses of six types of direction-selective (DS) GCs were regularly recorded. Responses of two types of orientation-selective (OS) GCs and detectors of white and black spots occurred approximately 50 μm deeper. Responses of GCs with dark- and light-sustained activity were recorded deeper than all others, at about 200 μm. The receptive fields of consecutively recorded units overlap, so they analyze the same fragment of the visual scene, focused by eye optic on the photoreceptor raster. The responses of pairs of DS GCs (ON and OFF units that preferred same direction of stimulus movement) and OS GCs (detectors of vertical and horizontal lines) were often simultaneously recorded at one position of the microelectrode. (The paired recordings of certain units amounted about fourth part of all recordings.) This suggests that their axonal arborizations are located close to each other in the tectal retinorecipient layer. Electrophysiological method, thus, allows to indirectly clarify and make precise the morphology of the retino-tectal connections and to establish a morpho-physiological correspondence.",Expression analysis of And4 during fin regeneration in Misgurnus anguillicaudatus provides insights into its function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612337,Fish physiology and biochemistry,2019 01 06,"Identifying proteins that regulate fin injury is critical to our understanding of regeneration as it relates to both acute wound injury and tissue formation. We have cloned the full-length cDNA of the actinodin4 (and4) gene of Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (MaAnd4) by the RACE method (GenBank Accession No. MG385835). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis during fin regeneration indicated a sudden increase in MaAnd4 expression, with a peak at 3 days post amputation (dpa). In situ analysis showed that MaAnd4 is located in the distal blastema and cells lining the regions of actinotrichia formation at 3 dpa. The highest levels of MaAnd4 expression were observed in the adult testis as well as in the gastrulae during embryonic development. Southern blotting confirmed the existence of and4 in teleosts but not in tetrapods examined. The results show the expression of this gene in actinotrichia formation and its association with fin/limb regeneration ability in teleosts.",Amyloid Precursor Protein Mediates Neuronal Protection from Rotenone Toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612335,Molecular neurobiology,2019 01 06,"Mitochondrial complex I dysfunction is the most common respiratory chain defect in human disorders and a hotspot for neurodegenerative diseases. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its non-amyloidogenic processing products, in particular soluble APP α (sAPPα), have been shown to provide neuroprotection in models of neuronal injury; however, APP-mediated protection from acute mitochondrial injury has not been previously reported. Here, we use the plant-derived pesticide rotenone, a potent complex I-specific mitochondrial inhibitor, to discover neuroprotective effects of APP and sAPPα in vitro, in neuronal cell lines over-expressing APP, and in vivo, in a retinal neuronal rotenone toxicity mouse model. Our results show that APP over-expression is protective against rotenone toxicity in neurons via sAPPα through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism that involves the Pi3K/Akt pro-survival pathway. APP-/- mice exhibit greater susceptibility to retinal rotenone toxicity, while intravitreal delivery of sAPPα reduces inner retinal neuronal death in wild-type mice following rotenone challenge. We also show a significant decrease in human retinal expression of APP with age. These findings provide insights into the therapeutic potential of non-amyloidogenic processing of APP in complex I-related neurodegeneration.",In Vitro Seeding Activity of Glycoform-Deficient Prions from Variably Protease-Sensitive Prionopathy and Familial CJD Associated with PrPV180I Mutation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612334,Molecular neurobiology,2019 06 10,"Both sporadic variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr) and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease linked to the prion protein (PrP) V180I mutation (fCJDV180I) have been found to share a unique pathological prion protein (PrPSc) that lacks the protease-resistant PrPSc glycosylated at residue 181 because two of four PrP glycoforms are apparently not converted into the PrPSc from their cellular PrP (PrPC). To investigate the seeding activity of these unique PrPSc molecules, we conducted in vitro prion conversion experiments using serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays with different PrPC substrates. We observed that the seeding of PrPSc from VPSPr or fCJDV180I in the sPMCA reaction containing normal human or humanized transgenic (Tg) mouse brain homogenates generated PrPSc molecules that unexpectedly exhibited a dominant diglycosylated PrP isoform along with PrP monoglycosylated at residue 181. The efficiency of PrPSc amplification was significantly higher in non-CJDMM than in non-CJDVV human brain homogenate, whereas it was higher in normal TgVV than in TgMM mouse brain homogenate. PrPC from the mixture of normal TgMM and Tg mouse brain expressing PrPV180I mutation (Tg180) but not TgV180I alone was converted into PrPSc by seeding with the VPSPr or fCJDV180I. The RT-QuIC seeding activity of PrPSc from VPSPr and fCJDV180I was significantly lower than that of sCJD. Our results suggest that the formation of glycoform-selective prions may be associated with an unidentified factor in the affected brain and the glycoform-deficiency of PrPSc does not affect the glycoforms of in vitro newly amplified PrPSc.",The Role of Ceramide and Sphingosine-1-Phosphate in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612333,Molecular neurobiology,2019 01 06,"Bioactive sphingolipids-ceramide, sphingosine, and their respective 1-phosphates (C1P and S1P)-are signaling molecules serving as intracellular second messengers. Moreover, S1P acts through G protein-coupled receptors in the plasma membrane. Accumulating evidence points to sphingolipids' engagement in brain aging and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Metabolic alterations observed in the course of neurodegeneration favor ceramide-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling, while the levels of the neuroprotective S1P are reduced. These trends are observed early in the diseases' development, suggesting causal relationship. Mechanistic evidence has shown links between altered ceramide/S1P rheostat and the production, secretion, and aggregation of amyloid β/α-synuclein as well as signaling pathways of critical importance for the pathomechanism of protein conformation diseases. Sphingolipids influence multiple aspects of Akt/protein kinase B signaling, a pathway that regulates metabolism, stress response, and Bcl-2 family proteins. The cross-talk between sphingolipids and transcription factors including NF-κB, FOXOs, and AP-1 may be also important for immune regulation and cell survival/death. Sphingolipids regulate exosomes and other secretion mechanisms that can contribute to either the spread of neurotoxic proteins between brain cells, or their clearance. Recent discoveries also suggest the importance of intracellular and exosomal pools of small regulatory RNAs in the creation of disturbed signaling environment in the diseased brain. The identified interactions of bioactive sphingolipids urge for their evaluation as potential therapeutic targets. Moreover, the early disturbances in sphingolipid metabolism may deliver easily accessible biomarkers of neurodegenerative disorders.",The Retina as a Window or Mirror of the Brain Changes Detected in Alzheimer's Disease: Critical Aspects to Unravel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612332,Molecular neurobiology,2019 01 06,"Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent cause of dementia worldwide, representing a global health challenge, with a massive impact on the quality of life of Alzheimer's disease patients and their relatives. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease constitutes a real challenge, because the symptoms manifest years after the first degenerative changes occurring in the brain and the diagnosis is based on invasive and/or expensive techniques. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new reliable biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease at an early stage. Taking into account the evidence for visual deficits in Alzheimer's disease patients, sometimes even before the appearance of the first disease symptoms, and that the retina is an extension of the brain, the concept of the retina as a window to look into the brain or a mirror of the brain has received increasing interest in recent years. However, only a few studies have assessed the changes occurring in the retina and the brain at the same time points. Unlike previous reviews on this subject, which are mainly focused on brain changes, we organized this review by comprehensively summarizing findings related with structural, functional, cellular, and molecular parameters in the retina reported in both Alzheimer's disease patients and animal models. Moreover, we separated the studies that assessed only the retina, and those that assessed both the retina and brain, which are few but allow establishing correlations between the retina and brain. This review also highlights some inconsistent results in the literature as well as relevant missing gaps in this field.","Trends of climate change in the upper Indus basin region, Pakistan: implications for cryosphere.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612331,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 03 06,"The Indus River, the lifeline of Pakistan's economy and its tributaries, derives most of water flow from the upper Indus basin comprised of Karakorum, Himalaya, and Hindu Kush mountain ranges, thus making this area important in climate change studies. We analyzed the records of climatic variables including temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity (RH) from two weather stations (Gilgit and Skardu) of upper Indus basin region from 1953 to 2006. To observe the trends of climate change, the selected time was divided into two temporal half periods consisting of 27 years each (1953-1979 and 1980-2006). The overall mean temperature (OMT) was decreased by - 0.137 °C in Gilgit, while an increase of 0.63 °C was observed in Skardu during the later period compared to the previous one. The mean minimum temperature (MMT) was found to decrease while mean maximum temperature (MXT) showed non-significant changes during the summer at both locations. However, there was an evidence of spring and winter warming at both locations due to increase in the MXT. The precipitation data showed large interannual variation at both locations. Significant increases in the morning relative humidity (RH) were observed during summer and autumn months at Skardu and throughout the year at Gilgit, while the evening RH increased during the same seasons at both stations. Significant increase in MXT and OMT during spring and winter months at higher elevation (Skardu) may have serious implications for the deposition and melting of seasonal snowpack with impacts on local livelihoods and river flow.",Limited impact of clinician education on reducing inappropriate PF4 testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612329,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,2019 02 28,"A high frequency of PF4-ELISA testing in patients suspected to have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) despite low 4T scores has been observed in multiple medical centers. Education of clinicians has been suggested to reduce inappropriate testing. We determined trends of PF4-ELISA testing in our institution after the introduction of a HIT education program for clinicians. A HIT Program was developed that included ongoing education, individual feedback, and continuous clinical audit of PF4-ELISA utilization. To assess the impact of education on PF4-ELISA testing trends, we conducted a prospective cohort review of all adult patients who had a PF4-ELISA ordered over a 3 month period (the last quarter of the academic year). 72 PF4-ELISA tests were ordered during the study period. Prospectively calculated 4T scores by investigators revealed 60 low-risk (83.3%), 9 intermediate-risk (12.5%), and 3 high-risk (4.16%). We observed divergent 4T scores with the ordering clinician calculating a higher 4T score compared to the Hematology Quality Improvement (QI) team. The majority of PF4-ELISA testing was ordered by the intensive care units (ICUs) (n = 32, 44.44%). Our study revealed that the frequency of calculation of 4T scores remains poor with the majority inappropriately performed in the ICU setting, with ordering clinicians calculating higher 4T scores than the Hematology QI team. This suggests that clinician education alone is insufficient. Introducing mandatory 4T score calculation prior to PF4-ELISA testing may not be helpful as ordering clinicians can bypass the restriction through inaccurate 4T score calculation."

We analyzed cross-sectional data from female breast cancer patients scheduled to receive chemotherapy at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) clinical sites and a healthy comparison group. After reading a consent form related to biospecimens and consenting to participate in a clinical trial, participants' understanding of biospecimen collection was evaluated. Linear models were used to compare scores between non-minority and racial minority participants as well as cancer and non-cancer comparisons adjusting for possible confounding factors. A total of 650 participants provided evaluable data; 592 were non-minority (Caucasian) and 58 participants were a racial minority (71% Black and 29% other). There were 427 cancer patients and 223 comparisons. Non-minority participants scored higher than racial minorities on relevance-to-care items (diff. = 0.48, CI 0.13-0.80, p = 0.001).

This paper explores CES relationships in Switzerland using web-based participatory mapping. We identified the spatial relationships between CES, the drivers of negative change and solutions to mitigate it. Results indicated that CES tend to have positive spatial relationships, although not always significant. A proxy-based approach supported the findings that the provision of heritage and inspiration services decreased along the urban-rural gradient while others increased. Participants located more CES close to their residence, but acknowledged their presence in distant alpine regions. They reported that better planning and stricter implementation of policies were necessary to refrain CES loss. According to respondents, there might be a density threshold to ensure sustainable supply of CES. Although mitigation measures were specific enough at the national scale, they remained too broad to be applicable at the local scale.",EGFR Protein Expression of KRAS Wild-Type Colorectal Cancer: Predictive Value of the Sidedness for Efficacy of Anti-EGFR Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612313,Pathology oncology research : POR,2019 01 06,"Right- and left-sided colorectal cancers (RSCRC and LSCRC, respectively) are different developmentally, genetically and prognostically. Clinical data also indicate that they respond differently to anti-EGFR therapies. The role of EGFR protein expression in KRAS wild type colorectal cancer is also controversial. Here we have used a cohort of anti-EGFR antibody treated KRAS-wild type colorectal cancer patients (n = 97) to analyse the prognostic role of EGFR protein expression in relation to sidedness. In our cohort EGFR copy number, determined by FISH, was not associated with the level of EGFR protein, assessed by immunohistochemistry and measured by H-scoring. There was a significantly higher EGFR H-score detected in RSCRC as compared to LSCRC in primary tumors (p = 0.04). Furthermore, in a proportion of cases (n = 31) metastatic tissues were also available and their analysis also found a significantly higher EGFR H-score in metastases of RSCRC compared to LSCRC (p = 0.018). Kaplan Meyer survival analysis demonstrated that anti-EGFR antibody therapies were more effective in case of LSCRC compared to RSCRC. Although in case of progression-free survival data just indicated a trend (p = 0.065), in case of overall survival the difference was significant favouring LSCRC (p = 0.047). These data demonstrated for the first time that the EGFR protein expression is significantly higher in KRAS wild type RSLCL as compared to LSCRC. Meanwhile it is somewhat unexpected that the lower EGFR protein expression was found to be associated with better efficacy of anti-EGFR antibody therapies of colorectal cancer, the finding of which must be further validated.",The Involvement of NF-κB/Klotho Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Cell Survival and Invasion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612312,Pathology oncology research : POR,2019 01 06,"Lipopolysaccharide significantly increased invasion, cell proliferation, and phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IGF-1R protein, but decreased klotho protein expression, cell apoptosis, and the percentage of sub G0/G1 cells in SW480 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells. In contrast, NF-κB inhibitor exhibited a counteract effect of lipopolysaccharide. Transfection of Toll-like receptor 4 shRNA significantly decreased phospho-NF-κB p65 and phospho-IGF-1R protein levels, invasion, but significantly increased klotho protein expression, cell apoptosis, and the percentage of sub G0/G1 in SW480 and HT29 cells.

We studied four PARP inhibitors and three DNA-damaging agents, and their combinations using sulforhodamine B assay. Rucaparib demonstrated the greatest synergy with irinotecan, followed by olaparib and PJ34. Rucaparib and irinotecan was further subjected to detailed examination to determine combination index (CI) and underlying mechanism of action. Effectiveness and sequence dependence of this combination were assessed in microsatellite stable (MSS) and unstable (MSI) CRC and HCT116 isogenic cell lines. The degree of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis was determined by FACS. In vivo studies were performed to confirm efficacy of this combination. PAR levels in MSI and PARP expression in MSI and MSS cell lines were diminished upon combinatorial treatment. HCT116 isogenic cells revealed the importance of p21, p53 and PTEN in exerting synergy. In MSI cells, administration of rucaparib prior to irinotecan enhanced cytotoxicity compared to other strategies explored. FACS revealed S-phase arrest and increased late-stage apoptosis in MSS, and G2-M arrest and total and early-stage apoptosis in MSI cells. In in vivo murine xenograft models, a significant reduction in tumor volume and expression of Ki67, pancytokeratin and RPS6KB1, and increase in expression of caspase 3 were observed with the combination. In conclusion, among the various combinations studied, rucaparib plus irinotecan was the most synergistic one.

Over the past two decades, HuR has been extensively associated with multiple biological characteristics of tumors, including tumor development and progression, angiogenesis, invasion, migration and prognosis, since this protein regulates the stability of cancer-associated target mRNAs due to its posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. A recent investigation of the multiple functions of HuR has provided emerging evidence of its role in drug resistance in various tumors. Herein, we demonstrate the roles of HuR proteins in the development of drug resistance, examine their involvement in various mechanisms, including apoptosis, the ABC transporter family, the cell cycle and the DNA damage response, and provide insight into ongoing studies for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting this molecule in tumor cells.","Biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and radioimmunotherapy of 188Re-cetuximab in NCI-H292 human lung tumor-bearing nude mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612308,Investigational new drugs,2019 01 06,"Background Cetuximab is a fully humanized IgG1 subclass monoclonal that binds specifically to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although EGFR is expressed in normal cells, the overexpression of EGFR is detected in many human cancers, such as colon, rectum and lung tumors. In this study, cetuximab with a combination of radiotherapy nuclear 188Re achieved better therapeutic effect on lung cancer. Methods188Re-cetuximab administered by the i.v. route in human NCI-H292 lung tumor-bearing mice was investigated. NanoSPECT/CT images were taken to evaluate the distribution and tumor targeting of 188Re-cetuximab in mice. The anti-tumor effect of 188Re-cetuximab was assessed by the tumor growth inhibition, survival ratio. Results For nanoSPECT/CT imaging, a significant uptake in tumor was observed at 24 and 48 h following the injection of 188Re-cetuximab. The anti-tumor effect of 188Re-cetuximab was assessed by tumor growth inhibition and the survival ratio. The tumor-bearing mice treated with 188Re-cetuximab showed a better mean tumor growth inhibition rate (MGI = 0.049) and longer median survival time and lifespan (62.50 d; 70.07%) than those treated with 188Re-perrhenate and cetuximab only by single injection. A synergistic effect of tumor growth inhibition was observed with the combination index exceeding one for 188Re-cetuximab (CI = 6.135 and 9.276). Conclusion The tumor targeting and localization of 188Re-cetuximab were confirmed in this study. Synergistic therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated for the radioimmunotherapy of 188Re-cetuximab. The results of this study reveal the potential advantage and benefit obtained from 188Re-cetuximab for diagnosis and therapy of oncology applications in the future.",Cinnamic Acid Protects the Nigrostriatum in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease via Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptorα.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612307,Neurochemical research,2019 04 26,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common devastating human neurodegenerative disorder and despite intense investigation, no effective therapy is available for PD. Cinnamic acid, a naturally occurring aromatic fatty acid of low toxicity, is a precursor for the synthesis of a huge number of plant substances. This study highlights the neuroprotective effect of cinnamic acid in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Oral administration of cinnamic acid protected tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and TH fibers in the striatum of MPTP-insulted mice. Accordingly, oral cinnamic acid also normalized striatal neurotransmitters and improved locomotor activities in MPTP-intoxicated mice. While investigating mechanisms, we found that cinnamic acid induced the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), but not PPARβ, in primary mouse astrocytes. Cinnamic acid mediated protection of the nigrostriatal system and locomotor activities in WT and PPARβ (-/-), but not PPARα (-/-) mice from MPTP intoxication suggests that cinnamic acid requires the involvement of PPARα in protecting dopaminergic neurons in this model of PD. This study delineates a new function of cinnamic acid in protecting dopaminergic neurons via PPARα that could be beneficial for PD.","Blood, Sweat, and/or Tears: Comparing Nervios Symptom Descriptions in Honduras.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612305,"Culture, medicine and psychiatry",2019 05 16,"With the aim of advancing the cross-cultural investigation of the folk illness nervios, I conducted a dual-sited comparative study of symptom descriptions among two diverse research settings in Honduras. Baer et al. (Cult Med Psychiatry 27(3):315-337, 2003) used cultural consensus modeling (CCM) to confirm a core description of nervios among four Latino groups in the US, Mexico, and Guatemala, but observed that overall agreement and average competence in a shared illness model decreased along a gradient from presumably more-to-less economically developed sites. This has left unresolved whether such variation extends to other Latin American regions. This paper is an exploratory analysis of inter- and intracultural variation in nervios symptom descriptions by 50 Hondurans from the market town of Copán Ruinas (n = 25) and city of San Pedro Sula (n = 25). I performed CCM using a combination of free-listing, pile-sorting, and rating activities to establish if respondents across sites share a single model of nervios. I found consensus for the San Pedro Sula subsample, but not for Copán Ruinas or for the overall sample. Results suggest nervios is constitutive of differing forms of distress ranging from chronic illness to acute suffering, as well as anger- and panic-based manifestations that overlap with biomedical ideas about depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. This variation derives in part from demographic factors such as age, gender, and residence, but may also result from ethnic and regional diversity among subsamples. However, consensus only being present among San Pedro Sula respondents suggests their greater awareness of cultural distinctions between biomedical and folk medical knowledge, which is likely due to their exposure to manifold health frameworks in those settings."

The present study investigated the influence of child protective services in the pregnant woman's family of origin as a proxy of childhood social disadvantage. Methods The study population comprised all registered pregnancies in Denmark during the period from 2000 to 2009 that resulted in an induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or live birth (N = 786,054). Linear regression was used to analyze the associations between educational attainment and pregnancy outcomes in models with and without adjustment for age, parental educational attainment and child protective services in the family of origin. Further, it was tested whether child protective services in the pregnant woman's family of origin modified the associations between educational attainment and pregnancy outcomes. Results Women with low educational attainment had a higher risk of induced abortion, stillbirth and preterm delivery and a lower risk of spontaneous abortion. These associations were to some extent explained by child protective services in the family of origin. Further, child protective services in the pregnant woman's family of origin modified the association between educational attainment and risk of preterm delivery. Thus, women with high educational attainment were not found to differ in risk of preterm delivery according to child protective services in the family of origin Conclusions for Practice Information on childhood social disadvantage may enrich our understanding of the socioeconomic disparities in pregnancy outcomes.",A Longitudinal Investigation of Cognitive Self-schemas across Adolescent Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612293,Journal of youth and adolescence,2019 04 15,"Research in developmental psychology highlights youth's self-schemas as one possible pathway to improve adolescents' functioning and promote positive developmental outcomes.

Caregivers completed measures of parenting practices, maternal rumination and negative inferential style, and adolescents completed a computerized behavioral task assessing self-schemas (i.e., mental frameworks that guide attention, interpretation, and memory of one's experiences). Multilevel growth curve modeling results demonstrated a quadratic slope for negative self-schemas and no mean-level change for positive self-schemas. These trajectories did not vary by gender or racial group. However, parenting factors differentially influenced the trajectories. Specifically, higher levels of parental involvement at baseline, or an active interest and engagement in a child's experiences and activities, related to lower levels of negative self-schemas during adolescence. Additionally, higher levels of parental rumination and parental negative control at baseline related to lower levels of youth positive self-schemas at baseline. These findings contribute to models of youth cognitive development.",Neuroprotective activity of leukemia inhibitory factor is relayed through myeloid zinc finger-1 in a rat model of stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612292,Metabolic brain disease,2019 04 03,"The aim of this study was to determine whether leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) exerts its neuroprotective effects through signal transduction of the transcription factor myeloid zinc finger-1 (MZF-1). According to the hypothesis of this study, MZF-1 mediates LIF-induced neuroprotective signaling during ELVO through increased expression and transcriptional activity. To determine the in vivo role of MZF-1 in LIF-induced neuroprotection, we used Genomatix software was used to MZF-1 sites in the promoter region of the rat superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) gene. Stroke was induced via middle cerebral artery occlusion, and animals were administered PBS or 125 μg/kg LIF at 6, 24, and 48 h after the injury. MZF-1 binding activity was measured using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and its expression/localization were determined using western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. To determine whether MZF-1 relays LIF-induced neuroprotection in vitro, primary cultured neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) after treatment with PBS or LIF. MZF-1 expression was measured in vitro using real time PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Transfection with siRNA was used to determine whether LIF protected cultured neurons against OGD after silencing MZF-1 expression. Four MZF-1 binding sites were identified by Genomatix, and EMSA confirmed in vivo binding activity in brain after MCAO. LIF significantly increased MZF-1 protein levels compared to PBS treatment at 72 h post-MCAO. In vivo nuclear localization of MZF-1 as well as co-localization of SOD3 and MZF-1 was observed in the cortical neurons of LIF-treated rats. Primary cultured neurons treated with LIF had significantly higher levels of MZF-1 mRNA and protein after LIF treatment compared to neurons treated with PBS. Finally, knockdown MZF-1 using siRNA counteracted the neuroprotective effects of LIF in vitro. These data demonstrate that LIF-mediated neuroprotection is dependent upon MZF-1 activity. Furthermore, these findings identify a novel neuroprotective pathway that employs MZF-1, a transcription factor associated with hematopoietic gene expression.",Molecular detection and characterization of fowl adenovirus associated with inclusion body hepatitis from broiler chickens in Egypt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612291,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 20,"A case-control study was performed to assess prescence of inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) caused by fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) at Kafr EL-Shiekh Governorate, Egypt, during spring, 2017. The case group consisted of 100 liver and spleen samples collected from 10 broiler chickens flocks (10 samples from each flock) suspected to be infected with IBH depending on clinical manefestations and necropsy examination. Controls were randamly selected from chickens without clinical sings or evidence of the disease on postmortem examination. Molecular screening of the disease disease in collected samples based on the DNA polymerase gene of FAdVs was carried out. Furthermore, the DNA polymerase gene sequence was determined and analyzed with published reference sequences on GeneBank. Respectively, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to confirm existence of co-infection with chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) and/or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV in flocks involved in the study. Using PCR, FAdV genome was detected in seven flocks in the case group and one in the control group. FAdV identified in this study revealed close genetic relationship with FAdVs-D previously identified in UK and Canada, suggesting potential virus transmission from these countries. All tested serum samples from diseased chickens were positive for CIAV infection via ELISA while none of the collected bursa of Fabricius samples tested IBDV positive by RT-PCR. Therefore, results obtained from the current study highlighted the importance of implementation of control measures against FAdV and CIAV in Egyptian poultry flocks. This study opens the door for future work toward specific identification of FAdV serotypes circulating in Egyptian poultry farms and molecular characterization of the virus based on hexon gene or full genome sequencing for better understanding of genetic diversity among FAdVs in Egypt at higher reolution.",Inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway by astaxanthin supplementation for prevention of heat stress-induced inflammatory changes and apoptosis in Karan Fries heifers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612290,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 20,"Present study was conducted on 12 Karan Fries (Holstein Friesian X Tharparkar) heifers (10-12 months) to assess the effect of astaxanthin supplementation on heat stress amelioration and inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway for prevention of heat stress-induced inflammatory changes and apoptosis in the cell during the summer season. The heifers were randomly and equally divided into two groups, i.e., control (fed as per ICAR 2013) and treatment groups (additionally supplemented astaxanthin at a dose rate of 0.25 mg/kg BW/day/animal). Temperature humidity index used to assess the levels of summer stress during the experimental period. Blood samples were collected at the fortnightly interval for quantification of plasma cortisol and IL-12 from both the groups of the heifers and from collected blood samples, RNA was isolated and transcribed into cDNA for real time PCR, for genes expression of NF-κB, IL-2, caspase-3, and Bcl-2. Plasma cortisol, IL-12 levels, and expression pattern of NF-κB, IL-2, and caspase-3 were significantly (P ≤ 0.05) lower in treatment group of Karan Fries heifers than control group, whereas, Bcl-2 was higher (P ≤ 0.05) in astaxanthin supplemented group. The temperature humidity index had a positive correlation (P ≤ 0.05) with plasma cortisol and IL-12 and expression pattern of NF-κB, IL-2, and caspase-3. However, it was negatively correlated with Bcl-2. The supplementation of astaxanthin can ameliorate the impact of summer stress through NF-κB downregulation, might be due to the quenching of free radicals, which regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and apoptotic genes.","Optimal extent of resection for glioblastoma according to site, extension, and size: a population-based study in the temozolomide era.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612289,Neurosurgical review,2019 01 06,"The effect of the extent of resection (EOR) on prognosis in glioblastoma may differ depending on various conditions. We evaluated the prognostic impact of the EOR for glioblastoma according to the tumor site, extension, and size. Data from glioblastoma patients who underwent gross total resection (GTR), subtotal resection (STR), or open biopsy between 2005 and 2014 were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Univariate and multivariate analyses for overall survival (OS) were performed. Between 2005-2009 and 2010-2014, the proportion of GTR and STR performed increased from 41.4 to 42.3% and 33.0 to 37.1%, respectively. EOR only affected OS in the 3 years after diagnosis. Median survival in the GTR (n = 4155), STR (n = 3498), and open biopsy (n = 2258) groups was 17, 13, and 13 months, respectively (p < .001). STR showed no significant difference in OS from open biopsy (p = .33). GTR increased OS for midline-crossing tumors. Although STR was more frequently performed than GTR for tumors ≥ 6 cm in size, GTR significantly increased the OS rate relative to STR for tumors 6-8 cm in size (p = .001). For tumors ≥ 8 cm, STR was comparable to GTR (p = .61) and superior to open biopsy (p = .05). GTR needs to be performed more frequently for glioblastoma measuring ≥ 6 cm or that have crossed the midline to increase OS.

A Stern-Volmer constant (KSV) of 2.11 × 10-2 mM-1 was obtained, while a fluorescent quantum yield of 31% was calculated. The sensitivity of this assay towards fructose was confirmed by comparison with other sugars (such as glucose, sucrose and lactose). Finally, the validity of the proposed assays was further demonstrated by performing recovery assays in different matrixes.

Interestingly, O-acetylated forms of GD2, not expressed in human peripheral nerve fibers, are highly expressed in GD2+ tumor cells. Very little information is known regarding the expression of O-acetylated disialogangliosides in breast cancer (BC) cell lines. Here, we analyzed the expression of GD2, GD3 and their O-acetylated forms O-acetyl-GD2 (OAcGD2) and O-acetyl-GD3 (OAcGD3) in BC cells. We used Hs 578T and SUM159PT cell lines, as well as cell clones over-expressing GD3 synthase derived from MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry/confocal microscopy, we report that BC cells express b-series gangliosides GD3 and GD2, as well as significant amounts of OAcGD2. However, OAcGD3 expression was not detected in these cells. O-acetylation of gangliosides isolated from BC cells was examined by LC-MS analysis of sialic acid DMB-derivatives. We report that the main acetylated form of sialic acid expressed in BC gangliosides is 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). These results highlight a close interrelationship between Neu5,9Ac2 and OAcGD2 expression, and suggest that OAcGD2 is synthetized from GD2 and not from OAcGD3 in BC cells.",Insights into the effects of N-glycosylation on the characteristics of the VC1 domain of the human receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) secreted by Pichia pastoris.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612271,Glycoconjugate journal,2019 05 29,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and advanced lipoxidation end products (ALEs), resulting from non-enzymatic modifications of proteins, are potentially harmful to human health. They directly act on proteins, affecting structure and function, or through receptor-mediated mechanisms. RAGE, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was identified as a receptor for AGEs. RAGE is involved in chronic inflammation, oxidative stress-based diseases and ageing. The majority of RAGE ligands bind to the VC1 domain. This domain was successfully expressed and secreted by Pichia pastoris. Out of two N-glycosylation sites, one (Asn25) was fully occupied while the other (Asn81) was under-glycosylated, generating two VC1 variants, named p36 and p34. Analysis of N-glycans and of their influence on VC1 properties were here investigated. The highly sensitive procainamide labeling method coupled to ES-MS was used for N-glycan profiling. N-glycans released from VC1 ranged from Man9GlcNAc2- to Man15GlcNAc2- with major Man10GlcNAc2- and Man11GlcNAc2- species for p36 and p34, respectively. Circular dichroism spectra indicated that VC1 maintains the same conformation also after removal of N-glycans. Thermal denaturation curves showed that the carbohydrate moiety has a small stabilizing effect on VC1 protein conformation. The removal of the glycan moiety did not affect the binding of VC1 to sugar-derived AGE- or malondialdehyde-derived ALE-human serum albumin. Given the crucial role of RAGE in human pathologies, the features of VC1 from P. pastoris will prove useful in designing strategies for the enrichment of AGEs/ALEs from plasma, urine or tissues, and in characterizing the nature of the interaction.",Quantitation of Glycopeptides by ESI/MS - size of the peptide part strongly affects the relative proportions and allows discovery of new glycan compositions of Ceruloplasmin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612270,Glycoconjugate journal,2019 05 29,"Significant changes of glycan structures are observed in humans if diseases like cancer, arthritis or inflammation are present. Thus, interest in biomarkers based on glycan structures has rapidly emerged in recent years and monitoring disease specific changes of glycosylation and their quantification is of great interest. Mass spectrometry is most commonly used to characterize and quantify glycopeptides and glycans liberated from the glycoprotein of interest. However, ionization properties of glycopeptides can strongly depend on their composition and can therefore lead to intensities that do not reflect the actual proportions present in the intact glycoprotein. Here we show that an increase in the length of the peptide can lead to a more accurate determination and quantification of the glycans. The four glycosylation sites of human serum ceruloplasmin from 17 different individuals were analyzed using glycopeptides of varying peptide lengths, obtained by action of different proteases and by limited digestion. In most cases, highly sialylated compositions showed an increased relative abundance with increasing peptide length. We observed a relative increase of triantennary glycans of up to a factor of three and, even more, MS peaks corresponding to tetraantennary compositions on ceruloplasmin at glycosite 137N in all 17 samples, which we did not detect using a bottom up approach. The data presented here leads to the conclusion that a middle down - or when possible a top down - approach is favorable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the glycosylation of glycoproteins.",Clinical significance of multiple gene detection with a 22-gene panel in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of 207 colorectal cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612269,International journal of clinical oncology,2019 03 13,Simultaneous detection of multiple molecular biomarkers is helpful in the prediction of treatment response and prognosis for colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.,mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab to treat liver-only metastases of colorectal cancer that are unsuitable for upfront resection (TRICC0808): a multicenter phase II trial comprising the final analysis for survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612267,International journal of clinical oncology,2019 05 05,"The TRICC0808 trial is a phase II multi-institutional trial that investigated the efficacy of preoperative mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab (BV) therapy for liver-only metastasis that is unsuitable for upfront resection.

However, most RSVP studies only infer the involvement of WM. Other cognitive resources, such as cognitive control or vocabulary may also impact sentence comprehension and interact with RSVP. Further, sentence ambiguity is predicted to interact with RSVP and cognitive resources to impact sentence comprehension. To test these relationships, participants read ambiguous and unambiguous sentences using RSVP and Whole-Sentence presentation, followed by comprehension questions that were targeted to the ambiguous region of the sentences. Presentation type and ambiguity interacted to affect RT such that the effect of RSVP was exaggerated for ambiguous sentences. RT effects were moderated by WM and vocabulary. WM and cognitive control affected accuracy.

However, only the so-called carbonyl branch is shared by Archaea and Bacteria, while the methyl branch is different, both in the number of reactions and enzymes, which are not homologous among them. In this work we show that some parts of the methyl branch of archaeal Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (MBWL) are present in bacteria as well as in non-methanogen archaea, although the tangled evolutionary history of MBWL cannot be traced back to the Last Common Ancestor. We have also analyzed the different variants of methanogenesis (hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic and methylotrophic pathways), and concluded that each of these pathways, and every different enzyme or subunit (in the case of multimeric enzymes), has their own intricate evolutionary history. Our study supports the scenario of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis being older than the other variants, albeit not old enough to be present in the last archaeal common ancestor.",Thin wedge evaporation/condensation controlled by the vapor dynamics in the atmosphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612262,"The European physical journal. E, Soft matter",2019 01 10,"Evaporation or condensation in the vicinity of the immobile (pinned) contact line in an atmosphere of some inert (noncondensable) gas is considered here in a partial wetting configuration. Such a problem is relevant to many situations, in particular to a drop or a liquid film drying in open air. The thermal effects are not important and the mass exchange rate is controlled by the vapor dynamics in the gas. By following previous works, we account for the weak coupling between the diffusion in the gas and flow in the liquid through the Kelvin effect. Such a problem is nonlocal because of the diffusion in the gas. For generality, we consider a geometry of a liquid wedge posed on a flat and homogeneous substrate surrounded by a gas phase with a diffusion boundary layer of uniform thickness [Formula: see text]. Similarly to the moving contact line problem, the phase change leads to the hydrodynamic contact line singularity. The asymptotic analysis of this problem is carried out for the liquid wedge of the length [Formula: see text]. Three asymptotic regions are identified: the microscopic one (in which the singularity is relaxed, in the present case with the Kelvin effect) and two intermediate regions. The Kelvin effect alone turns to be sufficient to relax the singularity. The scaling laws for the interface slope and mass evaporation/condensation flux in each region are discussed. It is found that the difference of the apparent contact angle (i.e., interface slope in the second intermediate region) and the equilibrium contact angle is inversely proportional to the square root of [Formula: see text] and square root of the microscopic length, whatever is the singularity relaxation mechanism."

To understand the regional specificities of food allergies and develop effective therapeutic interventions, extensive regional epidemiological studies are necessary. While data regarding incidence, prevalence, regional variation, and treatment in food allergies are available for western countries, such studies may not be available in many Asian countries. China accounts for almost 20% of the world's population and has a vast ethnic diversity, but large-scale meta-analyses of epidemiological studies of food allergy in China are lacking. A literature search revealed 22 publications on the prevalence of food allergy in Chinese populations. A review of these studies showed that the prevalence of food allergies in China is comparable to that in western countries, even though the Chinese diet is vastly different from that of the West and may vary even greatly within China, and finally, specific antigenic triggers of food allergy vary between China and the West and also within China. Current clinical management of food allergy in China includes allergen-specific immunotherapy, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, and Western medicine.

The role of WDR45 has been implicated in BPAN almost exclusively in females possibly due to male lethality. Characterization of distinctive clinical manifestations and potentially the complex genetic determinants in rare male patients remain crucial for deciphering BPAN and other X-linked dominant diseases. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by segregation analysis and identified a novel nonsense and mosaic variant in WDR45, namely NM_007075.3:c.873C>G; p.(Tyr291*) in an affected male at the age of 34. His biphasic medical history was compatible with BPAN, which was characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, and progression into dystonia parkinsonism in his twenties. The variant had an apparently mosaic pattern both in whole exome and Sanger sequencing findings. In order to figure out if mosaicism was restricted to this variant or related to a chromosomal level mosaicism, we used our in-house WES data from 129 unrelated individuals to calculate the threshold values of male and female X chromosome heterozygosity (XcHet) in WES data for our pipeline. A background level of heterozygous variants on X chromosome excluding the pseudoautosomal loci is an observed phenomenon in WES analysis and this level has been used as a quality measure. Herein, we suggest utilization of this measure for detection of digital anomalies of the X chromosome in males by potentially observing a higher XcHet value than the threshold value. This approach has revealed a variant level mosaicism in the affected male, which was further supported with cytogenetic analyses.",Randomized clinical trial of class II restoration in permanent teeth comparing ART with composite resin after 12 months.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612246,Clinical oral investigations,2019 01 06,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of class II restorations, in permanent teeth, through the ART technique in comparison to composite resin.",Genotoxic effects in oral mucosal cells caused by the use of orthodontic fixed appliances in patients after short and long periods of treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30612244,Clinical oral investigations,2019 06 11,This study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic effects in the oral epithelial cells of patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment and to compare these to a control group without treatment.

Due to its high reactivity, this compound requires further upgrading to more stable products such as furfuryl alcohol, 2-methylfuran (MF), furan, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, and tetrahydrofuran. The thermochemical data and kinetic analysis of the reactions involved in the conversion of furfural were investigated by molecular modeling to guide experimental investigations in the process of designing efficient catalysts that allows the control of the reaction pathways in specific directions, towards the production of fuel precursors or chemicals. All calculations for reactants, intermediates, and products were performed using the long range corrected functional WB97XD, with the basis set 6-311+g(d,p), under the density functional theory framework. Thermochemistry results suggest that furfural hydrogenation to form furfuryl alcohol is spontaneous up to a temperature of 523 K, but beyond this temperature the reaction becomes a nonspontaneous process. By contrast, the decarbonylation of furfural was thermodynamically favored at temperatures greater than 523 K. Therefore, furan is a thermodynamically favored product, while furfuryl alcohol is kinetically preferred. Once furfuryl alcohol is formed, the hydrogenolysis path to produce methylfuran is favored kinetically and thermodynamically, compared to the ring-hydrogenation towards tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. Gas phase thermodynamic properties and rate constants of the reactions involved in the conversion of furfural were calculated and compared against existing experimental data. This study provides the basis for further vapor phase catalytic studies required for upgrading of furans/furfurals to value-added chemicals. Graphical abstract Furan is a thermodynamically favored product, while furfuryl alcohol is kinetically preferred."
