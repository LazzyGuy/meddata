Past work showed that host phylogenetic relatedness and geographical proximity can increase cross-species transmission, but further work is needed to examine the importance of host traits, and species interactions such as predation, in determining the degree to which parasites are shared between hosts. Here we consider the factors that predict patterns of parasite sharing across a diverse assemblage of 116 wild ungulates (i.e., hoofed mammals in the Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla) and nearly 900 species of micro- and macroparasites, controlling for differences in total parasite richness and host sampling effort. We also consider the effects of trophic links on parasite sharing between ungulates and carnivores. We tested for the relative influence of range overlap, phylogenetic distance, body mass, and ecological dissimilarity (i.e., the distance separating species in a Euclidean distance matrix based on standardized traits) on parasite sharing. We also tested for the effects of variation in study effort as a potential source of bias in our data, and tested whether carnivores reported to feed on ungulates have more ungulate parasites than those that use other resources. As in other groups, geographical range overlap and phylogenetic similarity predicted greater parasite community similarity in ungulates. Ecological dissimilarity showed a weak negative relationship with parasite sharing. Counter to our expectations, differences, not similarity, in host body mass predicted greater parasite sharing between pairs of ungulate hosts. Pairs of well-studied host species showed higher overlap than poorly studied species, although including sampling effort did not reduce the importance of biological traits in our models. Finally, carnivores that feed on ungulates harboured a greater richness of ungulate helminths. Overall, we show that the factors that predict parasite sharing in wild ungulates are similar to those known for other mammal groups, and demonstrate the importance of controlling for heterogeneity in host sampling effort in future analyses of parasite sharing. We also show that ecological interactions, in this case trophic links via predation, can allow sharing of some parasite species among distantly related host species.",Reflective Practice in Physical Therapy: A Scoping Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921467,Physical therapy,2019 03 28,"Many practitioners experience complex, uncertain, and unique clinical practice situations that can be navigated with reflection.

Current perioperative interventions, including education and rehabilitation, are not always effective in preventing prolonged or chronic postoperative pain and disability. Here, a shift in educational intervention from a biomedical towards a biopsychosocial approach for people scheduled for lumbar surgery is proposed. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) is such a biopsychosocial approach which aims at decreasing the threat value of pain by reconceptualizing pain and increasing the patient's knowledge about pain. This paper provides a clinical perspective for the provision of perioperative PNE, specifically developed for patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy. Besides the general goals of PNE, perioperative PNE aims to prepare the patient for post-surgical pain and how to cope with it.",Aquaporin PIP1;3 of rice and harpin Hpa1 of bacterial blight pathogen cooperate in a type III effector translocation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921464,Journal of experimental botany,2019 03 28,"Varieties of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens infect their eukaryotic hosts by deploying the type III translocon to deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells in which effectors execute their pathological functions. The translocon is hypothetically assembled by bacterial translocators in associations with the assumed receptors situated on eukaryotic plasma membranes. This hypothesis is partially verified in the present study with genetic, biochemical and pathological evidence for the role of a rice aquaporin, plasma membrane intrinsic protein PIP1;3, in the cytosolic import of transcription activator-like effector PthXo1 from the bacterial blight pathogen. PIP1;3 interacts with the bacterial translocator Hpa1 at rice plasma membranes to control PthXo1 translocation from cells of a well-characterized strain of the bacterial blight pathogen into the cytosol of cells of a susceptible rice variety. An extracellular loop sequence of PIP1;3 and the α-helix motif of Hpa1 determine both the molecular interaction and its consequences with respect to the effector translocation and the bacterial virulence on the susceptible rice variety. Overall, these results provide multiple experimental avenues to support the hypothesis that interactions between bacterial translocators and their interactors at target membrane are essential for bacterial effector translocation.","Widespread Pressure Pain Hypersensitivity, Health History, and Trigger Points in Patients with Chronic Neck Pain: A Preliminary Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921463,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2019 03 28,Pain sensitivity in chronic neck pain patients may be influenced by health conditions related to higher levels of widespread pressure pain hypersensitivity (sensitization).

Such knowledge structures have traditionally been associated with the default network (DN), which also shows reduced modulation with age. In the present study, we investigated whether DN activity and connectivity patterns could account for this age-related effect. Younger and older adults underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they learned realistic and unrealistic prices of common grocery items. Both groups showed greater activity in the DN during the encoding of realistic, relative to unrealistic, prices. Moreover, DN activity at encoding and retrieval and its connectivity with an attention control network at encoding were associated with enhanced memory for realistic prices. Finally, older adults showed overactivation of control regions during retrieval of realistic prices relative to younger adults. Our findings suggest that DN activity and connectivity patterns (traditionally viewed as indicators of cognitive failure with age), and additional recruitment of control regions, might underlie older adults' enhanced memory for meaningful associations.",The Influence of Glenohumeral Joint Posterior Capsule Tightness and Impingement Symptoms on Shoulder Impairments and Kinematics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921461,Physical therapy,2019 03 28,"Posterior capsule tightness (PCT) and shoulder impingement symptoms (SIS) are both associated with altered shoulder biomechanics and impairments.

One of the possible interventions is health education because students are potential health advocates and influencers to their communities through the knowledge transfers from their teachers. The competency of Filipino teachers on ZIKV Disease is yet to be described. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of public secondary school teachers on ZIKV Disease. A modified version of the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Survey Tool on Zika Virus Disease from the World Health Organization-Pan American Health Organization (WHO-PAHO) was used to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of teachers of eight public secondary schools in five villages in Quezon City, Philippines. Out of the 609 respondents, 87.3% reported that their main source of information about ZIKV is tri-media, which includes television, print, and radio. Majority of the respondents mentioned that ZIKV is transmitted through a mosquito bite (80.3%). However, only half of the participants identified vector control as a preventive strategy. Moreover, only 54% admitted to have cleaned their water containers or water sources within the last week. Only a few identified mother-to-child (23%) and sexual intercourse (8%) as other means of transmission. Half (49.8%) of the respondents felt that it is possible to acquire ZIKV in their community, while 90% perceived that a private doctor (90%) or a public hospital (88%) can effectively treat the disease. Perceived stigma is high at 50%. This study showed there was good knowledge among teachers on vector transmission of ZIKV but poor knowledge on other aspects of the disease. Also, there was a low level of perceived susceptibility and severity of ZIKV which can be explained by the absence of a personal encounter with a Zika patient and the low number of cases in the Philippines. Half of the respondents said that they cleaned the possible mosquito breeding sites within the last week, followed by those who cleaned their water source more than a week ago (19%). None of the socio-demographic characteristics is significantly associated with respondents' knowledge on Zika. Only income and location of residence were found to be significantly associated with attitudes towards Zika. These findings call for a comprehensive training program that includes development of teaching materials for public secondary school teachers on ZIKV Disease based from this study.",The influence of the 'good' patient ideal on engagement in HIV care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921440,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Research on patient engagement in health care shows that better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs are observed among highly engaged patients. Similar to other illnesses, high levels of patient engagement in HIV care are considered essential to maintaining optimal health, and patients who are on treatment and retained in HIV care are known to have better health outcomes. In this article, we draw on focus group discussion data with patients living with HIV in order to explain tacit expectations associated with engagement in care. The main objective of our research was to elicit an explanatory model of engagement in HIV care from the patients' perspective. We conducted focus group discussions with a sample of two distinct types of patients: those who regularly attended medical appointments and those who did not. In total, we conducted six focus group discussions (n = 43) across in three cities in the US; these included two focus group discussions with a well-engaged and less-well-engaged group in each location. Both types of patients assigned a moral dimension to engagement in care, in that well-engaged patients were considered to be 'good' patients. Aspiring to become a 'good' patient provided a meaningful goal for some and deepened vulnerabilities among patients that struggled to achieve this status. More vulnerable patients may feel less secure in health care interactions and these feelings may be amplified if patients have an unreasonable impression of what constitutes a 'good' patient; thereby leading to disengagement in care. Our findings can inform the development of patient-centered, tailored messages to better serve patients struggling to stay engaged in HIV care.",IntensityCheck - The light measuring app for microscope performance checks and consistent fluorescence imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921439,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Quantitative fluorescence imaging is an essential tool in biomedical research.

C. neoformans uses macrophages as a proliferative niche to increase infective burden and avoid immune surveillance. However, the specific mechanisms by which C. neoformans manipulates host immunity to promote its growth during infection remain ill-defined. Here we demonstrate that eicosanoid lipid mediators manipulated and/or produced by C. neoformans play a key role in regulating pathogenesis. C. neoformans is known to secrete several eicosanoids that are highly similar to those found in vertebrate hosts. Using eicosanoid deficient cryptococcal mutants Δplb1 and Δlac1, we demonstrate that prostaglandin E2 is required by C. neoformans for proliferation within macrophages and in vivo during infection. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of host PGE2 synthesis is not required for promotion of cryptococcal growth by eicosanoid production. We find that PGE2 must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE2 to promote fungal growth, a finding that implicated the host nuclear receptor PPAR-γ. C. neoformans infection of macrophages activates host PPAR-γ and its inhibition is sufficient to abrogate the effect of 15-keto-PGE2 in promoting fungal growth during infection. Thus, we describe the first mechanism of reliance on pathogen-derived eicosanoids in fungal pathogenesis and the specific role of 15-keto-PGE2 and host PPAR-γ in cryptococcosis.",Tenuivirus utilizes its glycoprotein as a helper component to overcome insect midgut barriers for its circulative and propagative transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921434,PLoS pathogens,2019 05 05,"Many persistent transmitted plant viruses, including rice stripe virus (RSV), cause serious damage to crop production worldwide. Although many reports have indicated that a successful insect-mediated virus transmission depends on a proper interaction between the virus and its insect vector, the mechanism(s) controlling this interaction remained poorly understood. In this study, we used RSV and its small brown planthopper (SBPH) vector as a working model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the entrance of RSV virions into SBPH midgut cells for virus circulative and propagative transmission. We have determined that this non-enveloped tenuivirus uses its non-structural glycoprotein NSvc2 as a helper component to overcome the midgut barrier(s) for RSV replication and transmission. In the absence of this glycoprotein, purified RSV virions were unable to enter SBPH midgut cells. In the RSV-infected cells, this glycoprotein was processed into two mature proteins: an amino-terminal protein (NSvc2-N) and a carboxyl-terminal protein (NSvc2-C). Both NSvc2-N and NSvc2-C interact with RSV virions. Our results showed that the NSvc2-N could bind directly to the surface of midgut lumen via its N-glycosylation sites. Upon recognition, the midgut cells underwent endocytosis followed by compartmentalization of RSV virions and NSvc2 into early and then late endosomes. The NSvc2-C triggered cell membrane fusion via its highly conserved fusion loop motifs under the acidic condition inside the late endosomes, leading to the release of RSV virions from endosomes into cytosol. In summary, our results showed for the first time that a rice tenuivirus utilized its glycoprotein NSvc2 as a helper component to ensure a proper interaction between its virions and SBPH midgut cells for its circulative and propagative transmission.",Characteristics of mental health recovery narratives: Systematic review and narrative synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921432,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Narratives of recovery from mental health distress have played a central role in the establishment of the recovery paradigm within mental health policy and practice.

During RNA isolation only repeated DNase treatment can effectively remove contaminating bacterial DNA from samples, but this compromises RNA quality. In this study we tested alternative methods to facilitate the removal of DNA and improve the quality of RNA obtained. Sputum samples obtained from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were processed with dithiothreitol and subjected to various RNA isolation methods, yet with modified protocols. Modifications included prolonged DNase treatment or vortexing of sputum cells in the presence of beads prior to RNA isolation. Bacterial DNA contamination was tested by PCR using universal bacterial primers, while RNA quality was assessed by real-time PCR using GAPDH primers for amplicons of different length. We found that the RNeasy Plus Mini kit equipped with the gDNA eliminator spin column was able to completely eliminate bacterial DNA, if sputum cells were lysed in the presence of bashing beads. Notably, compared with the standard protocol, the modified procedure yielded better quality RNA as well, as indicated by improved threshold profiles of qPCR. Bead vortexing of cells was less effective when combined with other RNA isolation methods, and the repeated DNase treatment needed to completely remove contaminating DNA from the samples reduced the quality of RNA markedly. Bead vortexing in combination with certain RNA extraction methods greatly facilitates the isolation of sputum RNA that is free of contaminating bacterial DNA, and is suitable for downstream applications.",Assessing the genetic diversity and characterizing genomic regions conferring Tan Spot resistance in cultivated rye.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921415,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Rye (Secale cereale L.) is known for its wide adaptation due to its ability to tolerate harsh environments in semiarid areas. To assess the diversity in rye we genotyped a panel of 178 geographically diverse accessions of four Secale sp. from U.S. National Small Grains Collection using 4,037 high-quality SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) developed by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). PCA and STRUCTURE analysis revealed three major clusters that separate S. cereale L. from S. strictum and S. sylvestre, however, genetic clusters did not correlate with geographic origins and growth habit (spring/winter). The panel was evaluated for response to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis race 5 (PTR race 5) and nearly 59% accessions showed resistance or moderate resistance. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on S. cereale subsp. cereale using the 4,037 high-quality SNPs. Two QTLs (QTs.sdsu-5R and QTs.sdsu-2R) on chromosomes 5R and 2R were identified conferring resistance to PTR race 5 (p < 0.001) that explained 13.1% and 11.6% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Comparative analysis showed a high degree of synteny between rye and wheat with known rearrangements as expected. QTs.sdsu-2R was mapped in the genomic region corresponding to wheat chromosome group 2 and QTs.sdsu-5R was mapped to a small terminal region on chromosome 4BL. Based on the genetic diversity, a set of 32 accessions was identified to represents more than 99% of the allelic diversity with polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.25.

A through-hole defect of 1 mm diameter was drilled into each distal femur of 12 week old rats. Forty-five rats were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) control group; (2) ADSC sheet group; or (3) osteogenic-induced ADSC sheet group. We evaluated each group by analysis of computerized tomography scans every week after the surgery, histological analysis, and DiI labeling (a method of membrane staining for post implant cell tracing). Radiological and histological evaluations showed that a part of the hole persisted in the control group at four weeks after surgery, whereas the hole was restored almost completely by new bone formation in both sheet groups. The mean value of bone density (in Houndsfield units) for the bone defect area was significantly higher in both sheet groups than that in the control group (p = 0.05) at four weeks postoperative. A large number of osteocalcin positive osteoblasts were observed at the area of bone defect, especially in the osteogenic-induced ADCS sheet group. DiI labeling in the newly formed bone showed that each sheet had differentiated into bone tissue at four weeks after surgery. The ADSC and the osteogenic-induced ADSC sheets promoted significantly quicker bone healing in the bone defect. Moreover, the osteogenic-induced ADSC sheet may be more advantageous for bone healing than the ADSC sheet because of the higher number of osteocalcin positive osteoblasts via the transplantation.",The setting of the rising sun?

We researched the application of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to the respiratory system and compared the pulmonary acinus mechanics and functions in healthy and IIP models.,Increased adherence to treatment guidelines in patients with urinary tract infection in primary care: A retrospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921411,PloS one,2019 04 14,Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in primary care and leads to a high number of antibiotic prescriptions. Antimicrobial resistance is a global health problem; better antimicrobial prescribing is one way to limit antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to describe the number of consultations for patients diagnosed with lower urinary tract infection (LUTI) and pyelonephritis and changes in prescribing of antibiotics to men and women with LUTI and pyelonephritis in Swedish PHC between the years 2008 and 2013.,Targeting ferroptosis: A novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of mitochondrial disease-related epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921410,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Mitochondrial disease is a family of genetic disorders characterized by defects in the generation and regulation of energy. Epilepsy is a common symptom of mitochondrial disease, and in the vast majority of cases, refractory to commonly used antiepileptic drugs. Ferroptosis is a recently-described form of iron- and lipid-dependent regulated cell death associated with glutathione depletion and production of lipid peroxides by lipoxygenase enzymes. Activation of the ferroptosis pathway has been implicated in a growing number of disorders, including epilepsy. Given that ferroptosis is regulated by balancing the activities of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) and 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), targeting these enzymes may provide a rational therapeutic strategy to modulate seizure. The clinical-stage therapeutic vatiquinone (EPI-743, α-tocotrienol quinone) was reported to reduce seizure frequency and associated morbidity in children with the mitochondrial disorder pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 6. We sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism of EPI-743 and explore the potential of targeting 15-LO to treat additional mitochondrial disease-associated epilepsies.",Preschool teachers' perspective on how high noise levels at preschool affect children's behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921409,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Early-age exposure to noise may have long-term health implications of which we have little knowledge of today. Age-specific hearing, learning inadequate coping strategies, and alterations in biological stress regulatory responses could play a role in the long-term health impacts. In Sweden about half a million children in the age between 1-5 years attend preschool. The noise exposure at preschools is intermittent and unpredictable and levels reach up to 84 dB LAeq (time indoors) with maximum levels of 118 dB LAF, mostly due to child activity. To increase the overall understanding of the possible implications of preschool noise environments for children, this paper describes children's behavioral and emotional reactions to and coping with their everyday sound environment from a teachers perspective. A postal questionnaire study performed in 2013-2014 with answers from 3,986 preschool teachers provided the data. Content analysis was combined with quantitative analysis. Eighty-two percent of the personnel considered that children's behavior was affected rather or very much by preschool noise. The most prevalent behaviors were categorized into: be heard, be distracted, show negative internal emotions, crowd, avoid, withdraw, be exhausted, and learning. The quantitative analyses confirmed an association between the perceived loudness and noise annoyance at preschool and affirmative reporting on noise affecting the children´s behavior. Age of the personnel, with the youngest age group reporting noise related behavior less often, and age distribution of the class, with 1-5 years old seeming less affected by noise, were also indicated, while pedagogic orientation was not a significant factor. Future studies should address the long-term health effects of these behaviors.","Characteristics of hospitalized adult patients with laboratory documented Influenza A, B and Respiratory Syncytial Virus - A single center retrospective observational study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921408,PloS one,2019 04 14,"The epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of hospitalized adult patients with Influenza A (FluA), Influenza B (FluB) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) have not been thoroughly compared.

In ASFGs, fingers simulate legs to represent actions such as jumping, spinning, climbing, etc. The question is to determine whether the common motor experience of one's own body is sufficient to produce adequate ASFGs or whether the possibility to see gestures from others are also necessary to do it. Three experiments were carried out to address this question. Experiment 1 examined in 74 sighted adults the recognition of 18 types of ASFGs produced by 20 blindfolded sighted adults. Results showed that rates of correct recognition were globally very high, but varied with the type of ASFG. Experiment 2 studied in 91 other sighted adults the recognition of ASFGs produced by 10 early blind and 7 late blind adults. Results also showed a high level of recognition with a similar order of recognizability by type of ASFG. However, ASFGs produced by early blind individuals were more poorly recognized than those produced by late blind individuals. In order to match data of recognition obtained with the form that gestures are produced by individuals, two independant judges evaluated prototypical and atypical attributes of ASFG produced by blindfolded sighted, early blind and late blind individuals in Experiment 3. Results revealed the occurrence of more atypical attributes in ASFG produced by blind individuals: their ASFGs transpose more body movements from a character-viewpoint in less agreement with visual rules. The practical interest of the study relates to the relevance of including ASFGs as a new exploratory procedure in tactile devices which are more apt to convey action concepts to blind users/readers.",Exploring the mechanism of crashes with automated vehicles using statistical modeling approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921396,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Autonomous Vehicles (AV) technology is emerging. Field tests on public roads have been on going in several states in the US as well as in Europe and Asia. During the US public road tests, crashes with AV involved happened, which becomes a concern to the public. Most previous studies on AV safety relied heavily on assessing drivers' performance and behaviors in a simulation environment and developing automated driving system performance in a closed field environment. However, contributing factors and the mechanism of AV-related crashes have not been comprehensively and quantitatively investigated due to the lack of field AV crash data. By harnessing California's Report of Traffic Collision Involving an Autonomous Vehicle Database, which includes the AV crash data from 2014 to 2018, this paper investigates by far the most current and complete AV crash database in the US using statistical modeling approaches that involve both ordinal logistic regression and CART classification tree. The quantitative analysis based on ordinal logistic regression and CART models has successfully explored the mechanism of AV-related crash, via both perspectives of crash severity and collision types. Particularly, the CART model reveals and visualize the hierarchical structure of the AV crash mechanism with knowledge of how these traffic, roadway, and environmental contributing factors can lead to crashes of various serveries and collision types. Statistical analysis results indicate that crash severity significantly increases if the AV is responsible for the crash. The highway is identified as the location where severe injuries are likely to happen. AV collision types are affected by whether the vehicle is on automated driving mode, whether the crashes involve pedestrians/cyclists, as well as the roadway environment. The method used in this research provides a proven approach to statistically analyze and understand AV safety issues. And this benefit is potential be even enhanced with an increasing sample size of AV-related crashes records in the future. The comprehensive knowledge obtained ultimately facilitates assessing and improving safety performance of automated vehicles.",Working memory loads differentially influence frame-induced bias and normative choice in risky decision making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921395,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Risky decision making can be biased by several types of contextual factors-in particular, framing of outcomes. A popular explanation for outcome framing effects is based on presumed affective reactions that contribute to accepting sure gains and avoiding sure losses. Other theories propose that selective weighting of information about gains and losses contributes to framing bias. Prior research on framing bias has focused on preferences rather than on decisions in which choices can be classified as advantageous (correct) or disadvantageous (incorrect) by a normative criterion. The current study used a novel hypothetical risky decision making task offering choices between a sure option and a gamble option. The gamble was advantageous or disadvantageous on different trials based on the normative criterion of expected value. Results showed risk avoidance with a gain frame and risk seeking with a loss frame, comparable to findings when choices involve preferences. We also examined the impact of working memory loads of either non-affective stimuli, most likely to interfere with acquisition of choice information, or affective stimuli, which might influence affective processes contributing to framing. The results were that non-affective working memory load produced the greatest framing magnitude, while affective load produced changes in framing magnitude across trials that varied by valence. In addition, only the non-affective load decreased advantageous choices and reduced the accuracy of answers to knowledge probe questions about the choices. The findings are consistent with the notion that framing effects may arise from cognitive non-engagement with the task, rather than arising by way of affective processes. Affective loads had a limited influence on framing and no reliable impact on choice accuracy or choice knowledge, suggesting that the affective loads influenced the weighting of choice information.","Multi-locus DNA sequence analysis, antifungal agent susceptibility, and fungal keratitis outcome in horses from Southeastern United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921394,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Morphological characterization and multi-locus DNA sequence analysis of fungal isolates obtained from 32 clinical cases of equine fungal keratitis (FK) was performed to identify species and determine associations with antifungal susceptibility, response to therapy and clinical outcome. Two species of Aspergillus (A. flavus and A. fumigatus) and three species of Fusarium (F. falciforme, F. keratoplasticum, and F. proliferatum) were the most common fungi isolated and identified from FK horses. Most (91%) equine FK Fusarium nested within the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) with nine genetically diverse strains/lineages, while 83% of equine FK Aspergillus nested within the A. flavus clade with three genetically diverse lineages. Fungal species and evolutionary lineage were not associated with clinical outcome. However, species of equine FK Fusarium were more likely (p = 0.045) to be associated with stromal keratitis. Species of Aspergillus were more susceptible to voriconazole and terbinafine than species of Fusarium, while species of Fusarium were more susceptible to thiabendazole than species of Aspergillus. At the species level, A. fumigatus and A. flavus were more susceptible to voriconazole and terbinafine than F. falciforme. Natamycin susceptibility was higher for F. falciforme and A. fumigatus compared to A. flavus. Furthermore, F. falciforme was more susceptible to thiabendazole than A. flavus and A. fumigatus. These observed associations of antifungal sensitivity to natamycin, terbinafine, and thiabendazole demonstrate the importance of fungal identification to the species rather than genus level. The results of this study suggest that treatment of equine FK with antifungal agents requires accurate fungal species identification.",More miles on the clock: Neighbourhood stressors are associated with telomere length in a longitudinal study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921393,PloS one,2019 04 14,"There is a substantial gap in health and longevity between more affluent and more deprived areas, and more knowledge of the determinants of this health divide is required.

By trenching roots of trees in deciduous and coniferous forests, we cut-off the input of root-derived resources and investigated the response of microorganisms using substrate-induced respiration and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. After one and three years, root trenching strongly decreased microbial biomass and concentrations of PLFAs by about 20%, but the microbial community structure was little affected and the effects were similar in deciduous and coniferous forests. However, the reduction in microbial biomass varied between regions and was more pronounced in forests on limestone soils (Hainich) than in those on sandy soils (Schorfheide). Trenching also reduced microbial biomass in the litter layer but only in the Hainich after one year, whereas fungal and bacterial marker PLFAs as well as the fungal-to-plant marker ratio in litter were reduced in the Schorfheide both after one and three years. The pronounced differences between forests of the two regions suggest that root-derived resources are more important in fueling soil microorganisms of base-rich forests characterized by mull humus than in forests poor in base cations characterized by moder soils. The reduction in microbial biomass and changes in microbial community characteristics in the litter layer suggests that litter microorganisms do not exclusively rely on resources from decomposing litter but also from roots, i.e. from resources based on labile recently fixed carbon. Our results suggest that both bacteria and fungi heavily depend on root-derived resources with both suffering to a similar extent to deprivation of these resources. Further, the results indicate that the community structure of microorganisms is remarkably resistant to changes in resource supply and adapts quickly to new conditions irrespective of tree species composition and forest management.",The kisspeptin analog C6 is a possible alternative to PMSG (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin) for triggering synchronized and fertile ovulations in the Alpine goat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921391,PloS one,2019 04 14,"In temperate regions goat's reproduction is seasonal. To obtain year-round breeding, hormonal treatments are currently applied. These treatments usually combine a progesterone analog with the pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). However, their use has significant ethical and environmental drawbacks. Therefore, alternative methods to manage reproduction are needed. The discovery that in mammals the neuropeptide kisspeptin is a major positive regulator of hypothalamo-pituitary gonadal axis offered an attractive alternative strategy to control reproduction. We have previously designed a kisspeptin analog, called C6, which offers pharmacological advantages over endogenous kisspeptin. These include a longer lasting effect and enhanced activity following intramuscular injection. In the present work, we evaluated C6 effect on LH and FSH plasma concentrations in the Alpine goat breed and tested whether C6 could replace PMSG to trigger ovulation. An intramuscular injection of C6 (15 nmol/doe) given 24 hours after the end of progestogen treatment induced a surge-like peak of both LH and FSH. This was followed by an increase of progesterone, a hallmark of ovulation induction and corpus luteus formation. These results were obtained at three different time of the year: during the breeding season, the non-breeding season and at the onset of the breeding season. Furthermore, we compared the efficacy of C6 and PMSG to induce fertile ovulations when these treatments are given at the onset of the breeding season and are followed by artificial insemination. The results of this first attempt were extremely promising with gestation rates of 45% and 64% for C6 and PMSG respectively. Pending optimization of the treatment procedure in order to improve efficacy, kisspeptin analogs could be the long sought-after alternative to PMSG.",Genetic variation in CCR2 and CXCL12 genes impacts on CD4 restoration in patients initiating cART with advanced immunesupression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921390,PloS one,2019 04 14,We investigated the association of genetic polymorphisms in chemokine and chemokine receptor genes with poor immunological recovery in HIV patients starting combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) with low CD4 T-cell counts.,Predicting individual-level income from Facebook profiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921389,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Information about a person's income can be useful in several business-related contexts, such as personalized advertising or salary negotiations.

It is present in numerous environments throughout the world and causes significant damage to many agricultural crops. Fragmentation and lack of gene flow between populations may lead to population sub-structure. Within discrete recombining populations, positive selection may lead to a 'selective sweep'. This is characterised by an increase in frequency of a favourable allele leading to reduction in genotypic diversity in a localised genomic region due to the phenomenon of genetic hitchhiking. We aimed to assess whether isolates of S. sclerotiorum from around the world formed genotypic clusters associated with geographical origin and to determine whether signatures of population-specific positive selection could be detected. To do this, we sequenced the genomes of 25 isolates of S. sclerotiorum collected from four different continents-Australia, Africa (north and south), Europe and North America (Canada and the northen United States) and conducted SNP based analyses of population structure and selective sweeps. Among the 25 isolates, there was evidence for two major population clusters. One of these consisted of 11 isolates from Canada, the USA and France (population 1), and the other consisted of nine isolates from Australia and one from Morocco (population 2). The rest of the isolates were genotypic outliers. We found that there was evidence of outcrossing in these two populations based on linkage disequilibrium decay. However, only a single candidate selective sweep was observed, and it was present in population 2. This sweep was close to a Major Facilitator Superfamily transporter gene, and we speculate that this gene may have a role in nutrient uptake from the host. The low abundance of selective sweeps in the S. sclerotiorum genome contrasts the numerous examples in the genomes of other fungal pathogens. This may be a result of its slow rate of evolution and low effective recombination rate due to self-fertilisation and vegetative reproduction.",Assessment of the static upright balance index and brain blood oxygen levels as parameters to evaluate pilot workload.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921375,PloS one,2019 04 14,To investigate the potential for static upright balance function and brain-blood oxygen parameters to evaluate pilot workload.,Theoretical research without projects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921374,PloS one,2019 04 14,"We propose a funding scheme for theoretical research that does not rely on project proposals, but on recent past scientific productivity.

We present numerical simulations showing evidence that these schemes would also perform well in the presence of statistical noise in the scientific productivity and/or its evaluation. Finally, we prove that one of our policies cannot be cheated by individual research units.

Questions remain, however, about the biological mechanisms of such treatments and the inconsistencies in the methods used in research efforts. Here, we aimed to clarify the inflammatory response to intraperitoneal (IP) injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats, while analyzing corresponding effects of electrical stimulation to subdiaphragmatic branches (anterior gastric, accessory celiac, and hepatic) of the left vagus nerve. We accomplished an in-depth characterization of the time-varying cytokine cascade response in the serum of 58 rats to an acute IP LPS challenge over a 330-minute period by utilizing curve-fitting and starting point-alignment methods. We then explored the post-LPS neuromodulation effects of electrically stimulating individually cuffed subdiaphragmatic branches. Through our analysis, we found there to be a consistent order of IP LPS cytokine response (IL-10, TNF-α, GM-CSF, IL-17F, IL-6, IL-22, INF-γ). Apart from IL-10, the IP cytokine cascade was more variable in starting time and occurred later than in previously recorded intravenous (IV) challenges. We also found distinct regulatory effects on multiple cytokine levels by each of the three subdiaphragmatic stimulation subsets. While the time-variability of IP LPS use in rats complicates its utility, we have shown it to be a practical, arguably more physiologically relevant method than IV in rats when our methods are used. More importantly, we have shown that selective subdiaphragmatic neurostimulation can be utilized to selectively induce specific effects on inflammation in the body.","The use of an 'acclimatisation' heatwave measure to compare temperature-related demand for emergency services in Australia, Botswana, Netherlands, Pakistan, and USA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921372,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Heatwaves have been linked to increased risk of mortality and morbidity and are projected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change.

In this study, a genome-wide association study for coronary artery calcification (CAC) was performed in a Korean population-based sample of 400 subjects without prior coronary artery disease and replicated in another of 1,288 subjects. CAC score, as assessed by multi-detector computed tomography, was evaluated in volunteers for screening purposes as part of a routine health examination. CAC score greater than the 90th percentile across the age in each sex group was considered severe CAC. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with severe CAC after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and diabetes were investigated using the additive model of logistic regression. One SNP (rs10757272 in the intronic region of the CDKN2B-AS1 gene in chromosome 9p21.3) met Bonferroni correction in the discovery set (p = 7.55E-08) and was also significant in the validation set by TaqMan assay (p = 0.036). Subjects with rs10757272 were found to have an increased odds ratio (OR) of having severe CAC in multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, and diabetes (adjusted OR 3.24 and 95% CI 2.11-4.97). In conclusion, SNP rs10757272 in chromosome 9p21.3 was associated with severe CAC based on age and sex in an asymptomatic community-based Korean population.

Four new lupeol esters (propionate, succinate, isonicotinate and acetylsalicylate) and lupeol acetate were obtained using an eco-friendly synthesis method. In the esterification process, the commonly used hazardous reagents in this type of synthesis were replaced by safe ones. This unconventional, eco-friendly, method is particularly important because the compounds obtained are potentially active substances in skin care formulations. Even trace amounts of hazardous reagents can have a toxic effect on damaged or irritated tissues. The molecular structure of the esters were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and IR spectroscopy methods. Their crystal structures were determined using XRD method. To complete the analysis of their characteristics, physicochemical properties (melting point, lipophilicity, water solubility) and biological activity of the lupeol derivatives were studied. Results of an irritant potential test, carried out on Reconstructed Human Epidermis (RHE), confirmed that the synthesized lupeol derivatives are not cytotoxic and they stimulate a process of human cell proliferation. The safety of use for tested compounds was determined in a cell viability test (cytotoxicity detection kit based on the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity) for keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The results obtained showed that the modification of lupeol structure improve its bioavailability and activity. All of the esters penetrate the stratum corneum and the upper layers of the dermis better than the maternal lupeol. Lupeol isonicotinate, acetate and propionate were the most effective compounds in a stimulation of the human skin cell proliferation process. This combination resulted in an increase in the concentration of cells of more than 30% in comparison to control samples. The results indicate that the chemical modification of lupeol allows to obtain promising active substances for treatment of skin damage, including thermal, chemical and radiation burns.",Assessing the factor structure of the Spanish language parent Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) in Honduras.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921369,PloS one,2019 04 14,"With worldwide prevalence rates between 10% and 20%, mental illness in children and adolescents is an issue for which culturally sensitive screening tools are needed. The Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a commonly used measure that has been translated into numerous languages, although some research suggests issues with cross-cultural validity. Only four other studies have tested the Spanish-language SDQ in Latin America. In this study, we aimed to help fill this gap by assessing the factor structure of the parent or teacher version of the Spanish-language SDQ (for children ages 4-17) with 967 parent or other caregiver respondents of primary school-aged children (ages 4 to 17) in the Department of Intibucá, Honduras. When unable to find a good fitting factor model previously identified in the literature, we conducted split sample exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), along with measurement invariance testing with the best fitting EFA-extracted model based on gender for caregiver respondent and child gender. Results showed that while many EFA models had a good fit, CFI and TLI was < .90 for all extracted models when confirmed in the second sample with CFA. We then modified the best fitting extracted three-factor, 24-item model, which dropped item 15, by allowing select item residuals to correlate, increasing CFI and TLI to > .90 for female child gender. This modified three-factor model was partially invariant for configural and scalar models between child genders. Configural and scalar models would not converge for adult genders. Of note, metric models were not produced in Mplus related to items' cross-loading on more than one factor. These findings suggest that the SDQ Spanish language parent or teacher version may not perform optimally cross-culturally in this area of Honduras. Future research should confirm these findings with other Honduran populations.",Conflict resolution in the Eriksen flanker task: Similarities and differences to the Simon task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921368,PloS one,2019 04 14,"In the Eriksen flanker task as well as in the Simon task irrelevant activation produces a response conflict that has to be resolved by mental control mechanisms. Despite these similarities, however, the tasks differ with respect to their delta functions, which express how the congruency effects develop with response time. The slope of the delta function is mostly positive for the flanker task, but negative for the Simon task. Much effort has been spent to explain this difference and to investigate whether it results from task-specific control. A prominent account is that the temporal overlap between irrelevant and relevant response activation is larger in the flanker task than in the Simon task. To test this hypothesis, we increased the temporal distance in a flanker task by presenting the flankers ahead of the target. This not only produced negatively sloped delta functions but also caused reversed congruency effects. We also conducted a Simon-task experiment in which we varied the proportion of congruent stimuli. As a result, the delta function was negatively sloped only if the proportion was low. These results demonstrate that a long temporal distance is necessary but not sufficient for observing negatively sloped delta functions. Finally, we modeled the data with drift-diffusion models. Together, our results show that differently sloped delta functions can be produced with both tasks. They further indicate that activation suppression is an important control mechanism that can be adapted rather flexibly to the control demands.",Second cancers and causes of death in patients with testicular cancer in Sweden.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921367,PloS one,2019 04 14,"While treatment for testicular cancer (TC) has become standardized after the 1980s with an associated significant improvement in patient survival, this has been accompanied by an increased risk of second primary cancers (SPCs).

Overall RR of SPCs (excluding second TC) was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.20-1.40), including high risks for seven solid cancers, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia. Second TC was the most common SPC and the RR of 17.19 (95%CI: 14.89-19.85) was the highest recorded. Cancers known to be fatal as first primary cancers were also fatal as SPC in TC patients. Survival at 30 years of follow-up was approximately 80% for TC patients without SPC but it decreased to 40% for patients with SPC. The unexpected finding that half of the identified SPCs were typical late onset cancers in the middle-aged population raises concerns that therapy may facilitate premature aging. The risks of SPC are clinically important for the long-term management of TC patients and the high-mortality calls for a future management strategy."

This study examined effects of Sfrp5 on (i) beta cell viability and proliferation, (ii) basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and (iii) canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways. We incubated rat INS-1E cells with 0.1, 1 or 5 μg/ml recombinant Sfrp5 for 24h. We measured basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at glucose concentrations of 2.5 and 20 mmol/l. Phosphorylated and total protein content as well as mRNA levels of markers of cell proliferation, canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling pathways were examined using Western blotting and real-time PCR. Differences between treatments were analysed by repeated measurement one-way ANOVA or Friedman's test followed by correction for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. At 5 μg/ml, Sfrp5 reduced mRNA levels of cyclin-B1 by 25% (p<0.05). At 1 and 5 μg/ml, Sfrp5 increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by 24% and by 34% (both p<0.05), respectively, but had no impact on basal insulin secretion. Sfrp5 reduced the phosphorylation of the splicing forms p46 and p54 of JNK by 39% (p<0.01) and 49% (p<0.05), respectively. In conclusion, Sfrp5 reduced markers of cell proliferation, but increased in parallel dose-dependently glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1E cells. This effect is likely mediated by reduced JNK activity, an important component of the non-canonical Wnt signalling pathway.",Phenotypic subgrouping and multi-omics analyses reveal reduced diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) protein levels in autism spectrum disorder with severe language impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921354,PloS one,2019 04 14,"The mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain unclear, and clinical biomarkers are not yet available for ASD.

Adult plant resistance (APR) is one of the most sustainable approaches to control leaf rust. In this study, field-testing was carried out across ten different locations, followed by molecular screening, to detect the presence of APR genes, Lr34+, Lr46+, Lr67+ and Lr68 in Indian wheat germplasm. In field screening, 190 wheat accessions were selected from 6,319 accessions based on leaf tip necrosis (LTN), disease severity and the average coefficient of infection. Molecular screening revealed that 73% of the accessions possessed known APR genes either as single or as a combination of two or three genes. The occurrence of increased LTN intensity, decreased leaf rust severity and greater expression of APR genes were more in relatively cooler locations. In 52 lines, although the presence of the APR genes was not detected, it still displayed high levels of resistance. Furthermore, 49 accessions possessing either two or three APR genes were evaluated for stability across locations for grain yield. It emerged that eight accessions had wider adaptability. Resistance based on APR genes, in the background of high yielding cultivars, is expected to provide a high level of race non-specific resistance, which is durable.",Mesothelin and TGF-α predict pancreatic cancer cell sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and effective combination treatment with trametinib.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921351,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Clinical trials of EGFR inhibitors in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have generated mixed results partially due to the poorly defined effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors in PDAC. Here, we studied a panel of PDAC cell lines to compare the IC50s of the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and cetuximab. We found that gefitinib induced biphasic inhibition in over 50% of PDAC cells, with the initial growth inhibition occurring at nanomolar concentrations and a second growth inhibition occurring outside the clinical range. In contrast to gefitinib, cetuximab produced a single phase growth inhibition in a subset of PDAC cells. Using this sensitivity data, we screened for correlations between cell morphology proteins and EGFR ligands to EGFR inhibitor sensitivity, and found that mesothelin and the EGFR ligand TGF-α have a strong correlation to gefitinib and cetuximab sensitivity. Analysis of downstream signaling pathways indicated that plc-γ1 and c-myc were consistently inhibited by EGFR inhibitor treatment in sensitive cell lines. While an inconsistent additive effect was observed with either cetuximab or gefitinib in combination with gemcitabine, the cell pathway data indicated consistent ERK activation, leading us to pursue EGFR inhibitors in combination with trametinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor. Both cetuximab and gefitinib in combination with trametinib produced an additive effect in all EGFR sensitive cell lines. Our results indicate that mesothelin and TGF-α can predict PDAC sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and a combination of EGFR inhibitors with trametinib could be a novel effective treatment for PDAC.",A theoretical analysis of single molecule protein sequencing via weak binding spectra.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921350,PloS one,2019 06 10,"We propose and theoretically study an approach to massively parallel single molecule peptide sequencing, based on single molecule measurement of the kinetics of probe binding (Havranek, et al., 2013) to the N-termini of immobilized peptides. Unlike previous proposals, this method is robust to both weak and non-specific probe-target affinities, which we demonstrate by applying the method to a range of randomized affinity matrices consisting of relatively low-quality binders. This suggests a novel principle for proteomic measurement whereby highly non-optimized sets of low-affinity binders could be applicable for protein sequencing, thus shifting the burden of amino acid identification from biomolecular design to readout. Measurement of probe occupancy times, or of time-averaged fluorescence, should allow high-accuracy determination of N-terminal amino acid identity for realistic probe sets. The time-averaged fluorescence method scales well to weakly-binding probes with dissociation constants of tens or hundreds of micromolar, and bypasses photobleaching limitations associated with other fluorescence-based approaches to protein sequencing. We argue that this method could lead to an approach with single amino acid resolution and the ability to distinguish many canonical and modified amino acids, even using highly non-optimized probe sets. This readout method should expand the design space for single molecule peptide sequencing by removing constraints on the properties of the fluorescent binding probes.",Mitochondrial genetic haplogroups and cardiovascular diseases: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921349,PloS one,2019 04 14,"Some case-control studies reported that mitochondrial haplogroups could be associated with the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but the literature regarding this topic is limited.

In humans, >140 KLF1 variants, causing different erythroid phenotypes, have been described. The KLF1 Nan variant, a single amino acid substitution (p.E339D) in the DNA binding domain, causes hemolytic anemia and is dominant over wildtype KLF1. Here we describe the effects of the KLF1 Nan variant during fetal development. We show that Nan embryos have defects in erythroid maturation. RNA-sequencing of the KLF1 Nan fetal liver cells revealed that Exportin 7 (Xpo7) was among the 782 deregulated genes. This nuclear exportin is implicated in terminal erythroid differentiation; in particular it is involved in nuclear condensation. Indeed, KLF1 Nan fetal liver cells had larger nuclei and reduced chromatin condensation. Knockdown of XPO7 in wildtype erythroid cells caused a similar phenotype. We propose that reduced expression of XPO7 is partially responsible for the erythroid defects observed in KLF1 Nan erythroid cells.",Personal genome testing on physicians improves attitudes on pharmacogenomic approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921347,PloS one,2019 04 14,"In this era of clinical genomics, the accumulation of knowledge of pharmacogenomics (PGx) is rising dramatically and attempts to utilize it in clinical practice are also increasing. However, this advanced knowledge and information have not yet been sufficiently utilized in the clinical field due to various barriers including physician factors. This study was conducted to evaluate the attitudes of physicians to PGx services by providing them their own genomic data analysis report focusing on PGx. We also tried to evaluate the clinical applicability of whole exome sequencing (WES)-based functional PGx test. In total 88 physicians participated in the study from September 2015 to August 2016. Physicians who agreed to participate in the study were asked to complete a pre-test survey evaluating their knowledge of and attitude toward clinical genomics including PGx. Only those who completed the pre-test survey proceeded to WES and were provided with a personal PGx analysis report in an offline group meeting. Physicians who received these PGx reports were asked to complete a follow-up survey within two weeks. We then analyzed changes in their knowledge and attitude after reviewing their own PGx analysis results through differences in their pre-test and post-test survey responses. In total, 70 physicians (79.5%) completed the pre-test and post-test surveys and attended an off-line seminar to review their personal PGx reports. After physicians reviewed the report, their perception of and attitude towards the PGx domain and genomics significantly changed. Physician' awareness of the likelihood of occurrence of adverse drug reactions and genetic contribution was also changed significantly. Overall, physicians were very positive about the value and potential of the PGx test but maintained a conservative stance on its actual clinical use. Results revealed that physicians' perception and attitude to the utility of PGx testing was significantly changed after reviewing their own WES results."

We conducted field and laboratory experiments to investigate bee health in response to field-relevant concentrations of this pesticide. Significant effects were observed in honey bee colony flight activity and thermoregulation after being exposed over 9 weeks to supplemental protein patty containing methoxyfenozide. Compared to bee colonies in the control group, colonies fed pollen patty with 200 ppb methoxyfenozide (as measured by residue analysis) had: 1) a significantly reduced rate of weight loss due to forager departure in the morning; and 2) higher temperature variability during the winter. Colonies in the 100 ppb (as measured by residue analysis) treatment group had values between the 200 ppb group and control for both response variables. The dusk break point, which is the time associated with the end of forager return, differed among all treatment groups but may have been confounded with direction the hives were facing. Bee colony metrics of adult bee mass and brood surface area, and measurements of bee head weight, newly-emerged bee weight, and hypopharyngeal gland size were not significantly affected by methoxyfenozide exposure, suggesting that there may be significant effects on honey bee colony behavior and health in the field that are difficult to detect using standard methods for assessing bee colonies and individuals. The second experiment was continued into the following spring, using the same treatment groups as in the fall. Fewer differences were observed among groups in the spring than the fall, possibly because of abundant spring forage and consequent reduced treatment patty consumption. Residue analyses showed that: 1) observed methoxyfenozide concentrations in treatment patty were about 18-60% lower than the calculated concentrations; 2) no residues were observed in wax in any treatment; and 3) methoxyfenozide was detected in bee bread only in the 200 ppb treatment group, at about 1-2.5% of the observed patty concentration.","Predicting the consequences of physical activity: An investigation into the relationship between anxiety sensitivity, interoceptive accuracy and action.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921331,PloS one,2019 04 14,"The ability to predict the consequences of our actions is imperative for the everyday success of our interactions. From negotiating an uneven surface, to mounting an immune response, we continually infer the limits of our body. The current investigation considered the impact that the inferred consequences of action has on the placement of limits. We hypothesised that the performance of individuals in a novel, sprint task would reflect both their ability to accurately detect changes in bodily arousal (Interoceptive Accuracy) and the inferred consequences associated with heightened arousal signals (Anxiety Sensitivity). We found that individuals who demonstrated accuracy associated with physiological arousal changes, and who showed a heightened fear of the consequences of arousal symptoms, modified their actions by decreasing their power output (mean Watts•kg-1) in a sprint task (ΔR2 = 0.19; F(1,34) = 19.87); p<0.001).

The Alternating Brightness Star (ABS) illusion, based on Vasarely's classic nested squares, further shows that the strength of these corner-folds depends on corner angle. Previous psychophysical studies showed the relationship between corner angle and perceived contrast in the ABS illusion to be linear, with sharp angles looking higher in contrast, and shallow angles lower in contrast. Center-surround difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) modeling did not replicate this linear relationship, however, suggesting that a full neural explanation of the nested squares and ABS illusions might be found in the visual cortex, rather than at subcortical stages. Here we recorded the responses from single area V1 neurons in the awake primate, during the presentation of visual stimuli containing illusory corner-folds of various angles. Our results showed stronger neural responses for illusory corner-folds made from sharper than from shallower corners, consistent with predictions from the previous psychophysical work. The relationship between corner angle and strength of the neuronal responses, albeit parametric, was apparently non-linear. This finding was in line with the previous DOG data, but not with the psychophysical data. Our combined results suggest that, whereas corner-fold illusions likely originate from center-surround retinogeniculate processes, their complete neural explanation may be found in extrastriate visual cortical areas.",Intra-athlete and inter-group comparisons: Running pace and step characteristics of elite athletes in the 400-m hurdles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921329,PloS one,2019 04 14,"The aim of this study was to investigate the running pace and step characteristics among various competitive-level 400-m hurdlers through inter-group and intra-athlete comparisons. We analysed spatiotemporal data involving the split time, mean step length (SL) and mean step frequency (SF) for 13 male world-class and 14 male national-level 400-m hurdlers. We analysed 16.5 ± 3.9 races for each world-class hurdler and 19.8 ± 6.0 races for each national-level hurdler (the total number of analysed runs was 491) using publicly available television and internet broadcasts. Inter-group comparisons showed that both first- and latter-halves split times of the world-class hurdlers were significantly shorter than those of the national-level hurdlers. In the latter-half phase, no significant differences of SL and SF were observed between the world-class and national level hurdlers. Intra-athlete comparisons showed that no athletes favoured only first-half phase in terms of running speed in short finish times. In contrast, finish times of all hurdlers were sensitive to running speed in the latter-half phase. In the latter half of the race, 18 of the 27 hurdlers were identified as being SF reliant during speed enhancements; running speed of the other 9 hurdlers were also sensitive to high SF. In conclusions, important findings regarding high performance in inter-group comparisons do not always corresponded with those in intra-athlete comparisons. All athletes and coaches should first prioritize maintaining high running speeds in the latter half of 400-m hurdles rather than in the first half of the race.",Synchrony is more than its top-down and climatic parts: interacting Moran effects on phytoplankton in British seas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921328,PLoS computational biology,2019 04 29,"Large-scale spatial synchrony is ubiquitous in ecology. We examined 56 years of data representing chlorophyll density in 26 areas in British seas monitored by the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We used wavelet methods to disaggregate synchronous fluctuations by timescale and determine that drivers of synchrony include both biotic and abiotic variables. We tested these drivers for statistical significance by comparison with spatially synchronous surrogate data. Identification of causes of synchrony is distinct from, and goes beyond, determining drivers of local population dynamics. We generated timescale-specific models, accounting for 61% of long-timescale (> 4yrs) synchrony in a chlorophyll density index, but only 3% of observed short-timescale (< 4yrs) synchrony. Thus synchrony and its causes are timescale-specific. The dominant source of long-timescale chlorophyll synchrony was closely related to sea surface temperature, through a climatic Moran effect, though likely via complex oceanographic mechanisms. The top-down action of Calanus finmarchicus predation enhances this environmental synchronising mechanism and interacts with it non-additively to produce more long-timescale synchrony than top-down and climatic drivers would produce independently. Our principal result is therefore a demonstration of interaction effects between Moran drivers of synchrony, a new mechanism for synchrony that may influence many ecosystems at large spatial scales.",A computational framework to assess genome-wide distribution of polymorphic human endogenous retrovirus-K In human populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921327,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 05,"Human Endogenous Retrovirus type K (HERV-K) is the only HERV known to be insertionally polymorphic; not all individuals have a retrovirus at a specific genomic location. It is possible that HERV-Ks contribute to human disease because people differ in both number and genomic location of these retroviruses. Indeed viral transcripts, proteins, and antibody against HERV-K are detected in cancers, auto-immune, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, attempts to link a polymorphic HERV-K with any disease have been frustrated in part because population prevalence of HERV-K provirus at each polymorphic site is lacking and it is challenging to identify closely related elements such as HERV-K from short read sequence data. We present an integrated and computationally robust approach that uses whole genome short read data to determine the occupation status at all sites reported to contain a HERV-K provirus. Our method estimates the proportion of fixed length genomic sequence (k-mers) from whole genome sequence data matching a reference set of k-mers unique to each HERV-K locus and applies mixture model-based clustering of these values to account for low depth sequence data. Our analysis of 1000 Genomes Project Data (KGP) reveals numerous differences among the five KGP super-populations in the prevalence of individual and co-occurring HERV-K proviruses; we provide a visualization tool to easily depict the proportion of the KGP populations with any combination of polymorphic HERV-K provirus. Further, because HERV-K is insertionally polymorphic, the genome burden of known polymorphic HERV-K is variable in humans; this burden is lowest in East Asian (EAS) individuals. Our study identifies population-specific sequence variation for HERV-K proviruses at several loci. We expect these resources will advance research on HERV-K contributions to human diseases."

The recommended public health response for cutaneous diphtheria is similar to that for respiratory diphtheria and includes treating the index patient with antibiotics, identifying close contacts and observing them for development of diphtheria, providing chemoprophylaxis to close contacts, testing patients and close contacts for C. diphtheriae carriage in the nose and throat, and providing diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine to incompletely immunized patients and close contacts. This report summarizes the patient clinical information and response efforts conducted by the Minnesota, Washington, and New Mexico state health departments and CDC and emphasizes that health care providers should consider cutaneous diphtheria as a diagnosis in travelers with wound infections who have returned from countries with endemic diphtheria.","Candida Bloodstream Infections Among Persons Who Inject Drugs - Denver Metropolitan Area, Colorado, 2017-2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921302,MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,2019 04 17,"Candidemia, a bloodstream infection caused by Candida species, is typically considered a health care-associated infection, with known risk factors including the presence of a central venous catheter, receipt of total parenteral nutrition or broad-spectrum antibiotics, recent abdominal surgery, admission to an intensive care unit, and prolonged hospitalization (1,2). Injection drug use (IDU) is not a common risk factor for candidemia; however, in the context of the ongoing opioid epidemic and corresponding IDU increases, IDU has been reported as an increasingly common condition associated with candidemia (3) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (4). Little is known about the epidemiology of candidemia among persons who inject drugs. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) conducts population-based surveillance for candidemia in the five-county Denver metropolitan area, encompassing 2.7 million persons, through CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP). As part of candidemia surveillance, CDPHE collected demographic, clinical, and IDU behavior information for persons with Candida-positive blood cultures during May 2017-August 2018. Among 203 candidemia cases reported, 23 (11%) occurred in 22 patients with a history of IDU in the year preceding their candidemia episode. Ten (43%) of the 23 cases were considered community-onset infections, and four (17%) cases were considered community-onset infections with recent health care exposures. Seven (32%) of the 22 patients had disseminated candidiasis with end-organ dysfunctions; four (18%) died during their hospitalization. In-hospital IDU was reported among six (27%) patients, revealing that IDU can be a risk factor in the hospital setting as well as in the community. In addition to community interventions, opportunities to intervene during health care encounters to decrease IDU and unsafe injection practices might prevent infections, including candidemia, among persons who inject drugs.","Enterovirus D68-Associated Acute Respiratory Illness - New Vaccine Surveillance Network, United States, July-October, 2017 and 2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921299,MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report,2019 04 26,"In the fall of 2014, an outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68)-associated acute respiratory illness (ARI) occurred in the United States (1,2); before 2014, EV-D68 was rarely reported to CDC (2,3). In the United States, reported EV-D68 detections typically peak during late summer and early fall (3). EV-D68 epidemiology is not fully understood because testing in clinical settings seldom has been available and detections are not notifiable to CDC. To better understand EV-D68 epidemiology, CDC recently established active, prospective EV-D68 surveillance among pediatric patients at seven U.S. medical centers through the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) (4). This report details a preliminary characterization of EV-D68 testing and detections among emergency department (ED) and hospitalized patients with ARI at all NVSN sites during July 1-October 31, 2017, and the same period in 2018. Among patients with ARI who were tested, EV-D68 was detected in two patients (0.8%) in 2017 and 358 (13.9%) in 2018. Continued active, prospective surveillance of EV-D68-associated ARI is needed to better understand EV-D68 epidemiology in the United States."

Part B,2019 05 28,"Odontoid synchondrosis fractures are the most common cervical fracture in young children, although their overall incidence is rare. Various strategies have been proposed in the management of injuries with significant displacement or angulation. In this report, we present the long-term functional and radiological outcomes following nonoperative treatment of such a fracture in a 5-year-old female. The patient was referred to our tertiary centre with radiological progression of angulation from 10° to 35° within 5 weeks of the injury, despite wearing a rigid collar. She had no neurological compromise. Although we examined the fracture under general anaesthetic, and subsequently applied halo traction, there was no effect on alignment. The halo device was removed after 11 days and a rigid collar was fitted again. The patient had no pain or neurological symptoms out of the collar at 12 weeks after injury (6 weeks after removal of halo), and a computed tomography scan at 15 weeks confirmed that the fracture had united in malalignment. However, serial radiographs and MRI subsequently have shown that the axis has remodelled completely. At 7 years follow-up, there has been no impact on the patient's functional range of movement or quality of life.

Part B,2019 03 28,"The aim of this case series study is to describe the orthopedic management of bladder exstrophy and to report on the intermediate-term outcomes following bilateral horizontal Salter osteotomies with anterior symphyseal closure using a nylon tape. This retrospective study included seven patients (five boys and two girls) who underwent bilateral horizontal osteotomies after reconstruction of the urogenital deformity using the Cantwell-Ransley technique and symphyseal closure by nylon tape number 2-5. the age range was between 7 months and 8 years (median age=17 months). Three patients had recurrent bladder exstrophy after they underwent ""ramotomy"" early in their life, whereas four were operated primarily. All patients were followed up over 2 years, with a mean follow-up duration of 3.27 years (2-5 years). Petrie cast was applied, with both legs abducted and internally rotated till bony union had been achieved. This allowed free handling of the wounds and catheters. Removal of k-wires was performed in an outpatient clinic after the complete union of bony osteotomies had been achieved (6-8 weeks). Satisfactory bladder closure was achieved in all patients. None of the patients had a bone infection or nonunion at the osteotomy sites. No postoperative wound dehiscence has occurred for up to 5 years. The foot progression angle improved from 37°-70° (median=45°) preoperatively to 0°-15° (median=5°) postoperatively.

In some cases of laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG), therefore, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) occurs. Robotic surgery, on the other hand, plays an essential role in ergonomics and offers advantages, such as motion scaling, less fatigue, tremor filtering, 7 degrees of motion in the robotic instruments assisted by the wrist-like instruments tips, and three-dimensional vision. Robotic gastrectomy (RG) may enable surgeons to overcome the drawbacks associated with laparoscopic surgery. This study compares the safety and feasibility of short-term surgical outcomes of RG and LG for patients with GC.This was a single-center retrospective study of 659 consecutive patients with GC who received minimally invasive surgery. LG (n = 639) was performed between 2013 and 2017 and RG (n = 20) was performed in 2017. Lymphadenectomy without touching the pancreas was basically performed during RG using assisting articulating forceps.Overall incidence of postoperative complications higher than Clavien-Dindo grade 2 was not significantly different (LG group 5.9%, RG group 5.0%). In RG group, POPF, intra-abdominal abscess, and anastomotic leakage were not found, but postoperative bleeding requiring interventional catheter embolization occurred in 1 patient. In LG, POPF was found in 4.7%. Amylase levels in drainage fluid on postoperative day 1 were significantly lower in the RG group (238.5 IU/L) than in the LG group (884.5 IU/L) (P = .028).Regarding short-term surgical outcomes, RG is feasible, safe, and ideal treatment procedure for GC.

Although it has been a significant clinical and economic impact associated with increased intensive care unit (ICU) utilization, length of hospital stay, and associated cost, it is unpredictable. Aims of this study were to identify the modifiable risk factors of postoperative acute lung injury (PALI) following lung cancer surgery.We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 354 cases of lung cancer surgery in the tertiary university hospital from January 2012 to December 2015. PALI was defined as bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltration on chest radiography, oxygenation failure (PaO2/FiO2 < 300), and absence of sign of left ventricular failure within a week from operation. We classified patients into either PALI group or non-PALI group and compared clinical characteristics of two groups. Logistic regression model was fitted to evaluate the risk factor of PALI.Among 354 cases of lung cancer surgeries, 287 lobectomies were analyzed. The overall incidence of PALI was 2.79% (8/287); four patients developed pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and four patients developed ALI without clinical infection sign. There was no difference in baseline characteristics between PALI group and non-PALI group, but in operative parameters, a larger amount of fluid infusion was observed in PALI group. Logistic regression model showed underlying ischemic heart disease (OR 7.67, 95% CI 1.21-47.44, P = .03), interstitial lung disease (OR 30.36, 95% CI 2.30-401.52, P = .01), intravascular crystalloid fluid during surgery (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.20, P = .04), and intraoperative transfusion (OR 56.4, 95% CI 3.53-901.39, P < .01) were risk factors of PALI. PALI increases ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilator, duration of hospital stay, and mortality.The clinical impact of PALI is marked.

The aim of this study was to compare both the short-and long-term outcomes of TRRH and robotic-assisted right hemicolectomy (RARH) for the treatment of colon cancer.We performed a 1:2 matched propensity score analysis. We then retrospectively analyzed all procedures (64 cases TRRH and 128 cases RARH) carried out by a single surgeon between December 4, 2014 and June 20, 2018 at a large center. Both short-and long-term surgical outcomes were compared between 2 different groups.Based on the propensity score matching, we selected 64 patients that had undergone TRRH treatment and 128 patients who had undergone RARH treatment. The preoperative clinical-pathological characteristics were well matched between the 2 groups. We observed no significant differences between the 2 groups in postoperative pathological outcomes. The mean operative time was found to be significantly longer in the TRRH group compared to the RARH group (168.2 ± 9.1 minutes vs 153.4 ± 7.4 minutes, P = .034). The mean operative incision length was found to be significantly longer in the TRRH group than in the RARH group (4.5 ± 0.6 cm vs 6.9 ± 1.1 cm, P = .023). Postoperative pain score (visual analog scale at day 1) was found to be significantly lower in the TRRH group than in the RARH group (2.9 ± 1.3 vs 4.1 ± 2.1, P = .005). The time to pass flatus was observed to be statistically lower in the TRRH group (P = .042).

Influential factors were further analyzed using multivariate linear regression analysis.The mean HBL was 303.5 (range 18.4-803.5) mL, accounting for 67.5% of total blood loss. It indicated that the amount of HBL was much higher than we expected. Multiple and stepwise regression analysis revealed that blood loss, preoperative activated partial prothrombin time (APPT), percentage of anterior and medium vertebral height restoration were positively correlated with HBL. The association between HBL and the influential factors was analyzed based on the regression model equation: HBL = [1 + e [216.737 + 0.627*blood loss + 10.817*APTT + 207.549*anterior height restoration + 20.002*medium height restoration]]-1.HBL during perioperative period accounted for a substantial portion of the total blood loss and was much larger than what we thought. The blood loss, preoperative APPT, percentage of anterior and medium vertebral height restoration were positively correlated with HBL. Therefore, more attention needs to be paid to HBL to ensure patients' safety.",Neuropeptide Y and dipeptidyl peptidase IV in normally cycling and postmenopausal women: A prospective pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921206,Medicine,2019 06 10,"The purpose was to investigate changes in neuropeptide Y (NPY) protein and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activity in the plasma and saliva in normally cycling women and women after menopause. We recruited 7 cycling women and 7 postmenopausal women for a cross-sectional, prospective pilot study. Blood via venipuncture and saliva samples were taken at each point in the menstrual cycle (premenopausal) or once per week (postmenopausal) for 2 months. Blood and saliva were analyzed for estrogen, NPY using ELISA and DPP-IV activity using a fluorometric assay. Plasma β-estradiol was an average of 96.45 ± 57.04 pg/mL over 2 cycles in the premenopausal group and 1.72 ± 0.35 pg/mL over 2 months in the postmenopausal group (P < .05). In the cycling group, there were no significant differences in saliva or plasma NPY or DPP-IV over the cycle. For the postmenopausal group, salivary NPY and DPP-IV did not change over 2 months. Plasma NPY was lowest in the middle 2 weeks (average: 0.52 ± 0.10 ng/mL) compared to the first and fourth weeks (average of week 1 and 4: 0.60 ± 0.14 ng/mL; P < .05). Plasma NPY in postmenopausal women was higher overall (0.56 ± 0.13 ng/mL) compared to cycling women (0.30 ± 0.11 ng/mL; P < .05). Plasma DPP-IV activity was unchanged by time in the postmenopausal group. Saliva DPP-IV and saliva NPY in the cycling group had a significant negative correlation (R = -0.95; P < .05). We found that saliva measures of NPY and DPP-IV activity appear to be poor estimates of plasma concentrations and activities, but a larger sample size is required to conform this. Differences in plasma NPY concentrations between the groups and the relationship between salivary NPY and DPP-IV suggests that there may be some unique differences between these groups.",Radical modular pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic head cancer using a combination of multiple artery-first approaches technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921205,Medicine,2019 06 10,"The aim of this study was to describe and assess the efficacy of a combination of multiple artery-first approaches (CMAFA) in pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) depending on the tumor location from an embryonic point of view.Between January 2011 and December 2016, seventy-nine consecutive patients with pancreatic head cancer (PHC) underwent PD with curative intent. Patients were classified into two groups according to the surgical procedure: CMAFA-PD group (n = 38) and conventional PD (Co-PD) group (n = 41). Clinicopathlogical variables and clinical outcomes were compared among the two groups.The CMAFA technique demonstrated an improved rate of R0 resection (89.5% vs. 70.7%, P = .038) and a higher median lymph node yield (24 vs.20, P = .034). The CMAFA-PD group was associated with reduced blood loss (450 vs. 600 ml, P = .049), lower rate of blood transfusion (23.7% vs. 46.3%, P = .035), and shorter length of hospital stay (19 vs. 26 days, P < .001). The rates of 90-day mortality, major morbidity, and readmission were comparable among the two groups.This study demonstrates that CMAFA is a feasible and efficient technique with acceptable perioperative and oncological outcomes in treating patients with PHC.",SCN1B and SCN2B gene variants analysis in dravet syndrome patients: Analysis of 22 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921204,Medicine,2019 06 10,"Previous research identified SCN1B variants in some cases of Dravet syndrome (DS). We investigated whether SCN1B and SCN2B variants are commonly happened in DS patients without SCN1A variants. A total of 22 DS patients without SCN1A variants and 100 healthy controls were enrolled in this genetic study. DNA from DS patients was sequenced by Sanger method in whole exons of SCN1B and SCN2B genes. We identified two exon variants (c.351C>T, p.G117G and c.467C>T, p.T156M), which were present both in 1000 egenomes database and in healthy controls with a frequency of 0.54% and 4%, 0.06% and 0%, respectively. Additionally, eight intron or 3 prime UTR variants showing benign clinical significance have also been identified. Our results suggest that variants of SCN1B and SCN2B may not be common causes of DS according to our data. Further large sample-size cohort studies are needed to confirm our conclusion.",Serum ATX as a novel biomarker for breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921203,Medicine,2019 06 10,"Recent accumulating evidence indicates the biological actions of Autotaxin-Lysophosphatidic acid (ATX-LPA) signaling axis in malignant tumors. However, the role of Autotaxin-Lysophosphatidic acid signaling axis in breast cancer has not been reported. The present study aims to examine the alterations of serum autotaxin in breast cancer and discuss whether serum autotaxin could be useful as a novel parameter of breast cancer.Serum autotaxin antigen was measured in 112 patients with breast cancer and 50 healthy volunteers by ELISA. The association of serum autotaxin antigen levels with clinicopathological parameters and outcomes of breast cancer was analyzed.Serum autotaxin antigen was significantly higher in breast cancer patients than healthy volunteers (291.32 ± 38.02 ng/ml vs 254.04 ± 21.03 ng/ml, respectively; P < .0001). Serum autotaxin measurement successfully discriminated breast cancer patients from normal and healthy controls (AUC = 0.798, 95% CI: 0.732-0.864) with an optimal cut-off value of 267.34 ng/ml (sensitivity = 0.741, specificity = 0.800). Increased serum autotaxin was associated with breast cancer nodal status (P = .007), Tumor-Node- Metastasis (TNM) stage (P = .009) and Ki-67 index (P = .004). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that elevated serum autotaxin showed an independent prognostic value for poor Disease-free survival.Our present study confirmed the elevation, potential diagnostic, and independent prognostic value of serum autotaxin for breast cancer. Serum autotaxin could serve as a reliable novel biomarker for breast cancer.",Comparison of laminectomy and fusion vs laminoplasty in the treatment of multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921202,Medicine,2019 06 10,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy between laminectomy and fusion (LF) versus laminoplasty (LP) for the treatment of multi-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).,Efficacy and safety of spironolactone in the heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921200,Medicine,2019 06 10,"Recent studies have shown the efficacy for using spironolactone to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but the efficacy of spironolactone for heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is unclear.

The aims of present study were to perform a noninvasive evaluation of cardiac function and to evaluate exercise performance in HBV related cirrhotic patients without typical symptoms of cardiac disease.Seventy-nine HBV related cirrhotic patients and 103 matched subjects without a previous history of cardiac involvement were recruited. Clinical examination and cardiac health evaluation were performed. The incidence, risk factors of cardiac dysfunction and exercise tolerance were investigated.A correlation between QTc interval and model for end-stage liver disease score (R = 0.239, P = .018) was detected, however, the connection between QTc prolongation and the severity of liver disease was uncertain. Patients with HBV related cirrhosis had a tendency toward left ventricular wall thickening (P = .007). Forty-one patients (51.90%) were in accordance with the definition of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, and a significant increase in the incidence of cardiac diastolic dysfunction (CDD) could be found with increasing Child-Pugh grade (P = .004). HBV related cirrhotic patients with CDD had a higher level of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (P = .025), international normalized ratio (P = .010) Child-Pugh score (P = .020), and a higher proportion of ascites (P < .001). The higher Child-Pugh score (odds ratio = 1.662, P = .010) was an independent diagnostic predictor of CDD. The cardiac depression and exercise tolerance also got worse with increasing Child-Pugh score (P < .001).Impaired cardiac health was common in HBV related cirrhotic patients. Cardiogenic factors must be carefully considered in the integral therapy of cirrhosis. Hepatology physicians should lay emphasis on exercise training in daily life."

Patients were divided into stenting group and standardized medical treatment group. All patients underwent transcranial Doppler (TCD) before and after treatment. Incidence of new cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack (TIA), improvement of clinical symptoms, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score were observed.A total of 98 patients were enrolled. Vertebral artery stenting implant was accepted by 43 patients. Two weeks after treatment, the NIHSS score in the stenting group decreased significantly compared to that in the standardized medical treatment group. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score in the stenting group at three months was significantly lower than that in the medical treatment group (P = .044). The extent of vascular stenosis in the stent group decreased significantly (76.5 ± 10.0% vs. 13.7 ± 5.9%, t = 35.878, P = .000). The adverse events occurred in 9 (16.4%) patients in the medical treatment group and 5 (11.6%) in the stenting group (P = .506). There was one case with new cerebral infarction in the stenting group, whereas the medical treatment group showed 1 case with TIA and three with new cerebral infarction during follow-up after 3 months. The peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), pulsatility index (PI) of stenosis vertebral artery, and PSV of basilar artery were significantly higher in the stent group than those in the standardized medical group (P < .05).Stenting for VAOS, rather than standardized medical treatment, can effectively relieve vascular stenosis, alter vertebral-basilar artery hemodynamics, and improve neurological function, with low perioperative complications.",Scalp acupuncture treatment for children's autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921186,Medicine,2019 06 10,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopment disorder without definitive cure.

Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is an effective and minimally invasive treatment strategy for atherosclerotic femoropopliteal artery stenosis/occlusion disease. Balloon angioplasty is a widely used technique in the management of occlusive disease in almost all arterial segments.We enrolled 111 diabetics with long femoropopliteal lesions, among which 54 received PTA with paclitaxel-coated balloon (the Paclitaxel group), and 57 with standard balloon catheters (the Control group).The primary outcome was set as angiographic late lumen loss (LLL) within 6 months; the secondary angiographic outcome was binary restenosis. Clinical outcomes included Rutherford clarification, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and rate of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR). Two groups had similar basal clinical features, angiographic and procedural characteristics. Compared to controls, the Paclitaxel group had a significantly lower 6-month LLL rate, 12-month binary restenosis rate, 12-month TLR, lower Rutherford grades at 3 and 6 months, and higher ABI at 3 months. For all factors which might influence outcomes, fasting blood glucose was negatively correlated with ABI; the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was positively related with the Rutherford clarification grades. In addition, the coronary heart disease (CHD) and smoking histories were positively correlated with residual stenosis after treatment.Collectively, the paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty can yield more favorable angiographic and clinical outcomes than standard uncoated balloon angioplasty, even in the more challenging lesions (the long and occlusive femoropopliteal lesions) in diabetics, when it had a similar safety profile to the traditional balloon. Blood glucose, BUN, CHD, and smoking imply poor curative effects.",The clinical significance of microRNA-122 in predicting the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis validated by the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30921182,Medicine,2019 06 10,"Although the prognostic value of microRNA-122 (miR-122) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients have been evaluated by numerous studies, the results of them were not completely consistent.

The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence of dental diseases in patients treated for digestive system cancers.The medical and dental records of patients treated for digestive system cancers were retrospectively reviewed, and the results obtained (decayed/filled/missing teeth [DMFT] indices and community periodontal index [CPI] codes) were compared with data from the national survey of dental diseases in order to investigate the relationship between oral health and digestive system cancers.DMFT, D, and F indices were significantly lower, while the M index was slightly higher in digestive system cancer patients than in the national survey. The proportions of individuals with more than 20 residual teeth and denture wearers were significantly lower in cancer patients than in the national survey. The prevalence of periodontitis (CPI codes 3 and 4) and severe periodontitis (CPI code 4) were significantly higher in cancer patients than in the national survey.The present results showed that digestive system cancers were closely associated with multi-tooth loss and/or a low denture-wearing rate.

Cervical smears were prepared and examined independently by 2 cytotechnologists and confirmed by a pathologist. Cervical lesions were classified according to the Bethesda System for cervical cytology 2001.Out of the 592 women for whom a Pap smear was available for evaluation, 555 (93.8%) were negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. Eight women (1.4%) showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 9 (1.4%) low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 2 (0.3%) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. A total of 15 (2.5%) smears were unsatisfactory for cervical cytology. Additionally, 3 women (0.5%) had squamous cell carcinoma, giving an overall rate of 3.7% for epithelial cell abnormalities.Cervical cancer and precursor epithelial cell abnormalities are common among women in Kumasi for a disease that can be prevented by early detection through routine screening and management.

Although Furlow palatoplasty offers the advantage of lengthening the palate, the most tenuous component of the oral mucosal repair is anterior transposition of the oral mucosal Z-plasty flap, with superficial separation of the oral mucosa observed in up to 53 percent of cases of secondary Furlow palatoplasty. To mitigate this problem, the authors prophylactically placed pedicled buccal fat pad flaps to provide an additional vascular layer to promote healing of the overlying oral mucosal Z-plasty flap. The authors report their experience comprising seven patients who underwent Furlow palatoplasty with buccal fat flap augmentation. Four of these patients had secondary Furlow palatoplasty procedures; one of them experienced oral mucosal separation that healed uneventfully. No patients developed an oronasal fistula.

On review of his last school testing, his cognitive abilities are found to be within the average range, with a relative vulnerability with his processing speed. He can speak in sentences to communicate and answer questions, but he rarely picks up on conversational bids. He has had difficulties developing friendships and often prefers to play by himself.Thomas has a long history of some features of anxiety and depression for which it was recommended that he establish care with a therapist, but his family has had a hard time finding a provider for him. At this visit, the mother reports that for the past several months he has been more anxious, sad, and easily overwhelmed. He seems irritable at home and school and cries often. His family has been advocating for him to receive increased school supports, as school is a source of anxiety for him, but there are no recent changes in school services. There is a family history of both anxiety and depression. Given his worsening mood functioning, Thomas was started on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication in addition to again recommending a therapist. Weekly phone call check-ins and an in-person clinic visit in 1 month are planned.About 1 month after starting the SSRI medication, he is still not showing any improvement in mood functioning, and his family reports he seems more ""sluggish"" than usual. There are no side effects reported with the medication, and the dose is increased to see whether it will help. However, about 2 weeks later, he is seen again in the clinic because there are increasing concerns. He continues to be ""sluggish."" During the clinic visit, he lies down on the examination table, sometimes holding his head off the edge of the table, which he has never done before. He responds very slowly to the questions and often says ""I don't know, I don't know,"" almost in an automatic way.

Plastic surgeons performed surgery under general anesthesia for the patient's nasal bone fractures. On the seventh day after admission, the patient's brain computed tomography showed an abscess in the frontal lobe. Antibiotic treatment was started, but the lesion deteriorated. Anterior skull base reconstruction was then performed using a pericranial flap with gelfoam compression. No complications, including leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, cerebral hemorrhage, necrosis of the pericranial flap, or frontal lobe herniation, were observed 1 year following surgery.

The epicenter has been West Virginia with the highest rates of overdoses accounting for 41.5 deaths per 100 000 people among the 33 091 deaths in 2015. The purpose of this research was to examine and analyze the cause of the opioid epidemic and subsequent responses to it in the state of West Virginia. This study conducted a literature review using 37 references that were published between the years 2009 and 2018, complemented with a semistructured interview. The number of people injecting drugs has increased from 36% in 2005 to 54% in 2015. The total US cost of prescription opioid abuse in 2011 has been estimated at $25 billion, and criminal justice system costs to $5.1 billion. The reasons for this opioid epidemic incidence in West Virginia have been a combination of sociocultural factors, a depressed economy, lack of education, and a high rate of prescribing and dispensing of prescription opioids.",Rethinking the Obvious: Time for New Ideas on Medical Malpractice Tort Reform.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920990,The health care manager,2019 04 22,"States have engaged in medical malpractice litigation reforms over the past 30 years to reduce malpractice insurance premiums, increase the supply of physicians, reduce the cost of health care, and increase efficiency. These reforms have included caps on noneconomic damages and legal procedural changes. Despite these reforms, health care costs in the United States remain among the highest in the world, provider shortages remain, and defensive medicine practices persist. The purpose of this study was to determine how successful traditional medical malpractice reforms have been at controlling medical costs, decreasing defensive medicine practices, lowering malpractice premiums, and reducing the frequency of medical malpractice litigation. Research has shown that direct reforms and aggressive damage caps have had the most significant impact on lowering malpractice premiums and increasing physician supply. Out of the metrics that were improved by malpractice reforms, similar improvements were shown because of quality reform measures. While traditional tort reforms have shown some targeted improvement, large-scale, system-wide change has not been realized, and thus it is time to consider alternative reforms.",The Role of Patient-Centered Medical Home Recognition in Addressing Public Health Priorities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920989,The health care manager,2019 04 22,"American Public Health Association's (APHA's) vision for creating the healthiest nation in one generation has been driven by clear priorities to rebuild the public health infrastructure, to ensure access to care, and to reduce health disparities. The journey toward APHA's vision has required and benefited from a variety of interventions including congressional acts, government regulations, public health policy changes, innovative ideas and technology, novel health care reimbursement strategies, and voluntary certifications. American Public Health Association's endorsement of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model of health care delivery as instrumental to its vision has been an impetus for several PCMH recognition standards. This review gathers evidence from academic and professional literature on how achieving accreditation as a PCMH advances APHA's public health priorities. The documentations of 3 national PCMH accreditation programs (Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, National Committee for Quality Assurance, and The Joint Commission) are reviewed, and their standard categories and performance measurement criteria checklists are mapped to both APHA priorities and the Joint Principles of PCMH. Further context for the importance of achieving each measurement criteria while identifying additional opportunities to address APHA priorities in each accreditation standard category is discussed.",APLNR promotes the progression of osteosarcoma by stimulating cell proliferation and invasion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920988,Anti-cancer drugs,2019 03 28,"Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone malignancies with a poor prognosis. In recent years, targeted therapy has shown great potential in the treatment of osteosarcoma, and more effective therapeutic targets for this disease need to be developed. APLNR is a seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor expressed widely in multiple tissues. As has been reported, APLNR is involved in various physiological and pathological processes. Although APLNR plays a role in the development and progression of multiple tumors, the potential role of APLNR in osteosarcoma, a highly malignant tumor, remains unclear. Here, we reported that APLNR expression was correlated positively with clinical features including tumor size and stage of osteosarcoma. We found that APLNR knockdown inhibited the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. In addition, APLNR could promote the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma in mice. Collectively, this study showed the potential link between APLNR and osteosarcoma and suggested APLNR as a novel therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.",Exposure to Vedolizumab in IBD Pregnant Women Appears of Low Risk for Mother and Neonate: A First Prospective Comparison Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920987,The American journal of gastroenterology,2019 06 10,"Despite encouraging data gathered in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients, Vedolizumabs' (VDZ) safety profile in pregnancy is not established.",Presbylaryngis: a state-of-the-art review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920986,Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,2019 05 02,"Presbylaryngis is the term used to describe changes in the larynx with ageing.

Different ER IHC assays may produce diverging results, because of different antibody clones, protocols, and stainer platforms. Objective tissue-based techniques to assess sensitivity and specificity of IHC assays are therefore needed. We tested the usability of ER mRNA-in situ hybridization (mRNA-ISH) in comparison with assays based on clones SP1 and 6F11. We selected 56 archival specimens according to their reported ER IHC positivity, representing a wide spectrum from negative to strongly positive cases. The specimens were used to prepare 4 TMAs with 112 cores. Serial sections of each TMA were stained for ER and pan-cytokeratin (PCK) by IHC and ESR1 (ER gene) by mRNA-ISH. Digital image analysis (DIA) was used to determine ER IHC H-score. ESR1 mRNA-ISH was scored both manually and by DIA. DIA showed a nonlinear correlation between IHC and ESR1 mRNA-ISH with R-values of 0.80 and 0.78 for the ER antibody clones SP1 and 6F11, respectively. Comparison of manual mRNA-ISH scoring categories and SP1 and 6F11 IHC H-scores showed a highly significant relationship (P<0.001). In conclusion, the study showed good correlation between mRNA-ISH and IHC, suggesting that mRNA-ISH can be a valuable tool in the assessment of the sensitivity and specificity of ER IHC assays.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

This method was developed to utilize the antigenicity of biotin on epoxy-embedded ultrathin sections that could readily be recovered by a previously established antigen retrieval method as most monoclonal antibodies failed to recognize their targets by immunoelectron microscopy following antigen retrieval. The biotin tagging method was composed of preembedding immunostaining, epoxy-embedding and sectioning, and postembedding immunostaining steps. The preembedding step utilized the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method for immunohistochemistry to tag every antigen with a biotin in 3-μm thick paraffin-embedded sections. Next, fixation and processing for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on sections on glass slides, and ultrathin sections were prepared in epoxy-embedded blocks. In the postembedding step, antigen retrieval was followed by serial incubations with an antibiotin monoclonal antibody and anti-mouse IgG-labeled gold particles. The results obtained using antibodies against a variety of intracellular targets were satisfactory; positive gold particles were observed corresponding to targeted intracellular structures. This study demonstrated that the biotin tagging method was a convenient approach for successful labeling of paraffin-embedded sections for TEM using monoclonal antibodies, although it has relatively poor subcellular labeling quality.",Screening for NTRK-rearranged Tumors Using Immunohistochemistry: Comparison of 2 Different pan-TRK Clones in Melanoma Samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920961,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,2019 03 28,"NTRK-rearranged tumors could be treated using promising anti-TRK-targeted therapies in patients with advanced cancers including melanomas.

In this technical study, we compared 2 pan-TRK IHC (using A7H6R and EPR17341 clones) in tumor samples of patients with advanced melanomas. IHC-positive cases were studied using NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 fluorescent in situ hybridization tests. Among 300 melanoma samples, 4 samples were positive using A7H6R IHC, but none using EPR17341. None of the 4 samples were NTRK-rearranged using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Different staining was also noted in nontumor kidney tissue, whereas an NTRK1-rearranged tumor used as positive control was strongly stained with both A7H6R and EPR17341 clones.

C, Journal of biosciences",2019 04 04,"Primer pheromones play a pivotal role in the biology and social organization of insect societies. Despite their importance, they have been less studied because of the complexity of the required bioassays and, consequently, only a few of them have been chemically identified to date. The major primer pheromones are that of the queen pheromones that regulate reproductive skew and maintain colony cohesion and function. From a theoretical viewpoint, several features regarding the chemistry of queen pheromones can be predicted. They should be generally nonvolatile in order to avoid saturation of the colony space, which might otherwise hamper their perception because of sensory habituation. Accordingly, they should be actively dispersed throughout the colony by workers. The queen pheromone should also be caste-specific, qualitatively different from any worker pheromone, and preferably multicomponent, to allow unequivocal identification of the queen. The bi-potency of the female larvae in social Hymenoptera to become queen or worker necessitates strict regulation over pheromone production. Indeed, in the honeybee, the biosynthetic pathways as well as the genomic expressions are completely disparate between queens and workers. Future advances in chemical analyses, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics will enrich our understanding of the chemistry, mechanisms, and crucial role that primer pheromones play in social evolution.","(3R,6E)-nerolidol, a fertility-related volatile secreted by the queens of higher termites (Termitidae: Syntermitinae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920958,"Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung. C, Journal of biosciences",2019 04 04,"The queens of advanced social insects maintain their reproductive monopoly by using exocrine chemicals. The chemistry of these ""queen pheromones"" in termites is poorly known. We show that primary queens of four higher termites from the subfamily Syntermitinae (Embiratermes neotenicus, Silvestritermes heyeri, Labiotermes labralis, and Cyrilliotermes angulariceps) emit significant amounts of the sesquiterpene alcohol (E)-nerolidol. It is the dominant analyte in queen body washes; it is present on the surface of eggs, but absent in kings, workers, and soldiers. In E. neotenicus, it is also produced by replacement neotenic queens, in quantities correlated with their fertility. Using newly synthesised (3R,6E)-nerolidol, we demonstrate that the queens of this species produce only the (R) enantiomer. It is distributed over the surface of their abdomen, in internal tissues, and in the haemolymph, as well as in the headspace of the queens. Both (R) and (S) enantiomers are perceived by the antennae of E. neotenicus workers. The naturally occurring (R) enantiomer elicited a significantly larger antennal response, but it did not show any behavioural effect. In spite of technical difficulties encountered in long-term experiments with the studied species, (3R,6E)-nerolidol remains among eventual candidates for the role in queen fertility signalling.",Development of a new bed-side-test assessing conditioned pain modulation: a test-retest reliability study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920956,Scandinavian journal of pain,2019 03 28,"Background and aims Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) is of considerable interest within pain research. Often CPM testing is conducted in experimental settings using complicated instrumentation, thus challenging the implementation in clinical settings. Being able to assess CPM in a fast and reliable way in clinical settings could lead to a new diagnostic tool allowing improved profiling of pain patients. Methods A test-retest reliability study and a methodological development study were conducted based on different populations. The reliability study included 22 healthy subjects, mean age 23.6 years (SD: 2.4) and the methodological study included 29 healthy subjects, mean age 21.5 years (SD: 1.6). As painful phasic test stimulus, a 6-10 kg handheld, spring-based pressure algometer was applied perpendicularly to the muscle belly of the tibialis anterior muscle for 10 s and as painful tonic conditioning stimulus, 1-2 standard clamps, inducing a force of 1.3 kg, were applied extra-segmentally at the ipsilateral earlobe for 60-120 s. Four different test protocols were evaluated, of which one protocol was investigated for reliability. Test protocol 1 used a 6 kg pressure algometer as painful phasic test stimulus and a single clamp applied for 60 s as painful tonic conditioning stimulus. Test protocol 2 used a 10 kg pressure algometer as painful phasic test stimulus, and two clamps applied for 60 s as painful tonic conditioning stimulus. Test protocol 3 used a 10 kg pressure algometer as painful phasic test stimulus and a single clamp applied for 120 s as painful tonic conditioning stimulus. Test protocol 4 used a 6 kg pressure algometer as painful phasic test stimulus and a single clamp applied for 120 s as painful tonic conditioning stimulus. Results None of the stimuli caused any adverse events, e.g. bruises. In the reliability study (test protocol (1), non-significant CPM effects of 0.3 (SD: 1.6) and 0.2 (SD: 1.0) were observed in session 1 and 2, respectively. The intra-class correlations were 0.67 and 0.72 (p = < 0.01) and limits of agreement (LoA) ranged from -2.76 to 3.31. Non-significant CPM effects of 0.2 (SD: 1.0), -0.1 (SD: 1.1), and 0.0 (SD: 1.2) were observed for test protocol 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Conclusions The bedside test developed for investigating CPM was feasible and easy to use in healthy volunteers. No significant CPM effects were measured and a large variation in CPM effect ranging from -0.14 to 0.32 was observed. Intra-class correlation (ICC) values for the pressure algometer were interpreted as ""good relative reliability"" (test protocol 1), and LoA revealed a somewhat low absolute reliability. Implications The pressure algometer provided reproducible measurements and was useful for inducing phasic test stimuli. Since no significant CPM effects were detected, no recommendations for the bedside test can yet be made. Further examinations will have to establish if the ""one size fits all"" application of both test and conditioning stimuli is useful. Future bedside studies involving patient populations are warranted to determine the usefulness of the method.",Expression of genes involved in inflammation and growth - does sampling site in human full-term placenta matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920955,Journal of perinatal medicine,2019 03 28,"Objective To investigate the placental gene expression of substances in the inflammatory cascade and growth factors at nine different well-defined sampling sites in full-term placentas from 12 normal weight healthy non-smoking women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy. Methods All placentas (six girls and six boys) were delivered vaginally. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze toll receptor-2 and -4, interleukin-6 and -8, tumor necrosis factor-α, leptin, ghrelin, insulin-like growth factor-1 and -2, hepatocyte growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor and insulin receptor (IR). Results The leptin gene and the IR gene showed higher expression in lateral regions near the chorionic plate compared to central regions near the basal plate (P = 0.028 and P = 0.041, respectively). Conclusion Our results suggest that the sampling site may influence the gene expression for leptin and IR in placental tissue obtained from full-term normal pregnancies. We speculate that this may be due to differences in placental structure and perfusion and may be important when future studies are designed.",Focused on the Objective: Experience of Male Combat Veterans in BSN Programs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920954,International journal of nursing education scholarship,2019 03 28,"Background Veterans may provide a recruitment source to increase the diversity of the nursing workforce and increase the percentage of baccalaureate-prepared nurses.

Retrospective reports of symptoms, triggers, and emotions are heavily used in both clinical and research settings, yet no study has investigated the correspondence for symptoms or triggers of personality disorders. A total of 257 participants, including 75 with BPD, completed overlapping daily, weekly, monthly, and semi-annual questionnaires. Retrospective reports showed: (1) systematic biases, reporting fewer symptom and situational trigger occurrences, and greater emotion intensities; but (2) little unsystematic error, largely reproducing bias-adjusted individual levels of symptoms, situational triggers, and emotions (rs generally .70-.80). People with BPD did not retrospectively misremember their symptoms, triggers, or emotions much more than others. Thus, retrospective reports of symptoms, triggers, and emotions should be adjusted for systematic bias, but after such adjustment can be taken as relatively faithful accounts of individuals' experiences.",A Plea for Preregistration in Personality Disorders Research: The Case of Psychopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920938,Journal of personality disorders,2019 03 28,"In response to a crisis of confidence, several methodological initiatives have been launched to improve the robustness of psychological science. Given its real-world implications, personality disorders research is all too important to not follow suit. The authors offer a plea for preregistration in personality disorders research, using psychopathic personality (psychopathy) as a prominent case example. To suit action to word, the authors report on a preregistered study and use it to help refute common misconceptions about preregistration as well as to illustrate that the key strength of preregistration: transparency outweighs its (perceived) disadvantages. Although preregistration will not conclusively settle the many debates roiling the field of psychopathy and other personality disorders, it can help to verify the robustness of empirical observations that inform such debates.","Interpersonal Problems in Borderline Personality Disorder: Associations with Mentalizing, Emotion Regulation, and Impulsiveness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920937,Journal of personality disorders,2019 03 28,"Interpersonal problems are a core symptom of borderline personality disorder (BPD). This study investigated the relationship between emotion dysregulation, impulsiveness, and impaired mentalizing in the context of predicting interpersonal problems in BPD. A total of 210 patients with BPD completed the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (RFQ), and Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP-32). The authors conducted three path models, with either mentalizing, emotion regulation, or impulsiveness as the exogenous variable. Emotion dysregulation and attentional impulsiveness predicted interpersonal problems directly, whereas hypomentalizing predicted interpersonal problems only indirectly throughout emotion dysregulation and attentional impulsiveness. The results suggest that these domains contribute significantly to interpersonal problems in BPD. Moreover, hypomentalizing might affect on interpersonal problems via its effect on impulsiveness and emotion regulation. The authors argue that focusing on emotion regulation and mentalizing in BPD treatments might have interlinked beneficial effects on interpersonal problems.",Risk Factors for Borderline Personality Disorder in Adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920936,Journal of personality disorders,2019 05 10,"The objective of this study was to assess the association between variables reflecting childhood adversity, protective childhood experiences, and the five-factor model of personality and BPD in adolescents. Two groups of adolescents were studied: 104 met criteria for BPD and 60 were psychiatrically healthy. Adverse and protective childhood experiences were assessed using a semistructured interview. The five-factor model of personality was assessed using the NEO-FFI. Eight of nine variables indicating severity of abuse and neglect, positive childhood relationships, childhood competence, and the personality factors studied were found to be significant bivariate risk factors for adolescent BPD. However, in a multivariate model, severity of neglect, higher levels of neuroticism, and lower levels of childhood competence were found to be the best risk factor model. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that all three types of risk factors studied are significantly associated with BPD in adolescents.",School Nurses on the Front Lines of Medicine: The Approach to a Student With Severe Traumatic Bleeding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920935,NASN school nurse (Print),2019 03 28,"With the continued threat of mass casualty incidents in schools and surrounding communities, it is essential for school nurses to be knowledgeable regarding the recognition of hemorrhagic shock due to massive bleeding and the acute management of these victims.

Among the 12 IFNα subtypes, IFNα1 has a uniquely low affinity for IFNAR2 (<100 × of the other IFNα subtypes) and commensurately weak antiviral activity, suggesting an undefined function distinct from suppression of viral infections. Also unique in IFNα1 is substitution of a serine for phenylalanine at position 27, a contact point that stabilizes the IFNα:IFNAR2 hydrophobic interface. To determine whether IFNα1-S27 contributes to the low affinity for IFNAR2, we created an IFNα1 mutein, IFNα1-S27F, and compared it to wild-type IFNα1 and IFNα2. Substitution of phenylalanine for serine increased affinity for IFNAR2 ∼4-fold and commensurately enhanced activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5, transcription of a subset of interferon stimulated genes, and restriction of vesicular stomatitis virus infection in vitro. Structural modeling suggests that S27 of IFNα1 disrupts the IFNα:IFNAR2 hydrophobic interface that is otherwise stabilized by F27 and that replacing S27 with phenylalanine partially restores the hydrophobic surface. Disruption of the hydrophobic IFNα:IFNAR2 interface by the unique S27 of IFN α1 contributes to its low affinity and weak antiviral activity.",Blood Pressure Measurement and Treatment Decisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920932,Circulation research,2019 03 28,"White-coat and masked hypertension are important hypertension phenotypes.

A further important factor favoring poor BP control is the limited use of combination drug treatment, despite evidence of its superior ability to control BP in patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension. In addition, combination treatment allows to achieve BP control more easily (and more quickly) as compared with monotherapy. This article, after briefly examining the main features of BP control, will review the importance in the treatment of hypertension of the drug combination strategy, based on the recommendations of the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines. Empahsis will be given to the drug combination treatment as first step of the antihypertensive therapeutic intervention. The potential drawbacks and barriers to combination drug treatment as initial therapeutic strategy will also be briefly discussed.",Neurovascular and Cognitive Dysfunction in Hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920929,Circulation research,2019 05 22,"Hypertension has emerged as a leading cause of age-related cognitive impairment. Long known to be associated with dementia caused by vascular factors, hypertension has more recently been linked also to Alzheimer disease-the major cause of dementia in older people. Thus, although midlife hypertension is a risk factor for late-life dementia, hypertension may also promote the neurodegenerative pathology underlying Alzheimer disease. The mechanistic bases of these harmful effects remain to be established. Hypertension is well known to alter in the structure and function of cerebral blood vessels, but how these cerebrovascular effects lead to cognitive impairment and promote Alzheimer disease pathology is not well understood. Furthermore, critical questions also concern whether treatment of hypertension prevents cognitive impairment, the blood pressure threshold for treatment, and the antihypertensive agents to be used. Recent advances in neurovascular biology, epidemiology, brain imaging, and biomarker development have started to provide new insights into these critical issues. In this review, we will examine the progress made to date, and, after a critical evaluation of the evidence, we will highlight questions still outstanding and seek to provide a path forward for future studies."

This study identifies predictors of utilization among 597 adults with IDD. Using a retrospective survey of medical charts, descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were conducted. Individual-level risk factors for ER utilization included age, number of chronic health conditions, a diagnosis of cerebral palsy or neurological disorder, mental illness, and polypharmacy. Environmental predictors included community-based supported living. Hospitalization predictors included age and number of chronic illnesses. People residing in group homes were less likely to be admitted. This study found risk factors unique to individuals with IDD that should be addressed with tailored interventions as states transition to Medicaid managed care.","Fiscal Stewardship, Choice, and Control: The Context of Self-Directed Services for People With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) in the United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920908,Intellectual and developmental disabilities,2019 03 28,"Self-directed home and community based services (HCBS) waiver services and supports for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) have become a viable and widely used method of service provision in the United States. Grounded in theories of self-determination, previous literature on self-direction has suggested high satisfaction and positive outcomes for people who use self-directed programs as well as cost savings for state IDD service systems. This study explored the ways in which state IDD service administrators think about how self-direction may be used as a method of achieving cost savings while providing opportunities for people with IDD and their families to exercise choice and control. Informed by 54 high-level IDD service administrators in 34 states, and guided by a thematic analysis approach to data interpretation, the study found evidence that administrators typically see strong potential for self-direction to have cost-savings benefits, while also fostering choice.

We aimed to investigate 30-day unplanned readmission after major abdominal surgery based on perioperative FB (%) on postoperative days (POD) 0 to 3. This retrospective cohort study analyzed medical records of patients who underwent elective major abdominal surgery (surgery time >2 hours, estimated blood loss >500 mL) at a single tertiary academic hospital from January 2010 to December 2017. Cumulative FB was calculated by total input fluid - output fluid in liters × weight (kg)-1 on admission × 100 during POD 0 (24 hours), 0 to 1 (48 hours), 0 to 2 (72 hours), and 0 to 3 (96 hours). Of the 3650 patients in the final analysis, 503 (13.8%) had unplanned readmission within 30 days. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, FB on POD 0 (24 hours), 0 to 1 (48 hours), 0 to 2 (72 hours), and 0 to 3 (96 hours) showed no significant association with 30-day unplanned readmission (all P > .05). However, an increase of 10 000 points in the total relative value unit scores was associated with 5% increase in 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.07; P = .001), and 1-hour increase in surgery time was associated with 10% increase in 30-day unplanned readmission (odds ratio = 1.10, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.15; P < .001). This study showed that perioperative FB is not associated with 30-day unplanned readmission rate after a major abdominal surgery.

The lack of belief of children's CSA reports is problematic, as this may affect the child's adjustment, the consequences for the alleged perpetrator, and the likelihood of other victims reporting abuse that they experienced. One plausible explanation for low credibility is the variable of social dominance orientation. In the current study, a diverse sample (N = 60) read a hypothetical vignette of a CSA allegation, rated the credibility of the child, and completed the Social Dominance Orientation-7 scale (SDO-7). Results supported that high social dominance orientation predicts low credibility ratings of the child's CSA allegation. Findings may impact how clinicians and investigators approach the assessment of credibility of CSA allegations, how they appraise the opinions of others about such credibility, and jury selection in the court system.",Key Push and Pull Factors Affecting Return to Work Identified by Patients With Long-Term Pain and General Practitioners in Sweden.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920899,Qualitative health research,2019 03 28,"Research shows that working is positive for people with long-term pain but that work-related support from health professionals is inadequate.

We analyzed the interviews with thematic analysis and a motivational push and pull framework to cover different motivational factors, societal and individual, that might push or pull patients from or toward work. Providers said that a difference between working and nonworking patients is their level of individual motivation, while the patients' stories showed that the main difference was the physical (non)ability to push themselves to work. We suggest that work-related support can be improved by addressing such differences in clinical practice.",Gastrointestinal Hormones Manipulation to Counteract Metabolic Syndrome Using Duodenal Targeted Embolization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920898,Surgical innovation,2019 05 15,Targeted embolization of gastrointestinal (GI) arteries can modify hormonal production.

A total of 150 patients were included in our study. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with sepsis and those with infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Development of septic shock and 28-day mortality were assessed. Endocan and thrombomodulin showed better discriminative power than procalcitonin for the presence of sepsis. Endocan showed good discriminative power for septic shock prediction. Addition of endocan significantly contributed to sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment score in logistic regression model. Conclusion: Endothelial biomarkers have a good diagnostic potential for sepsis. Endocan is useful as a predictor of the severity and fatality of sepsis.,Intestinal serine protease inhibition increases FGF21 and improves metabolism in obese mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920846,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 05 15,"Trypsin is the major serine protease responsible for intestinal protein digestion. An inhibitor, camostat (CS), reduced weight gain, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia in obese rats; however, the mechanisms for these are largely unknown. We reasoned that CS creates an apparent dietary protein restriction, which is known to increase hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Therefore, metabolic responses to CS and a gut-restricted CS metabolite, FOY-251, were measured in mice. Food intake, body weight, blood glucose, branched-chain amino acids (LC/MS), hormone levels (ELISA), liver pathology (histology), and transcriptional changes (qRT-PCR) were measured in ob/ob, lean and diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice. In ob/ob mice, CS in chow (9-69 mg/kg) or FOY-251 (46 mg/kg) reduced food intake and body weight gain to a similar extent as pair-fed mice. CS decreased blood glucose, liver weight, and lipidosis and increased FGF21 gene transcription and plasma levels. In lean mice, CS increased liver FGF21 mRNA and plasma levels. Relative to pair feeding, FOY-251 also increased plasma FGF21 and induced liver FGF21 and integrated stress response (ISR) transcription. In DIO mice, FOY-251 (100 mg/kg po) did not alter peak glucose levels but reduced the AUC of the glucose excursion in response to an oral glucose challenge. FOY-251 increased plasma FGF21 levels. In addition to previously reported satiety-dependent (cholecystokinin-mediated) actions, intestinal trypsin inhibition engages non-satiety-related pathways in both leptin-deficient and DIO mice. This novel mechanism improves metabolism by a liver-integrated stress response and increased FGF21 expression levels in mice. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Trypsin inhibitors, including plant-based consumer products, have long been associated with metabolic improvements. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s suggested this was due to satiety hormones and caloric wasting by loss of protein and fatty acids in feces. This work suggests an entirely new mechanism based on the lower amounts of digested protein available in the gut. This apparent protein reduction may cause beneficial metabolic adaptation by the intestinal-liver axis to perceived nutrient stress.",TCF21 inhibits tumor-associated angiogenesis and suppresses the growth of cholangiocarcinoma by targeting PI3K/Akt and ERK signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920845,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 06 07,"Tumor-associated angiogenesis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In this study, we examined the biological effects and molecular mechanisms of transcription factor 21 (TCF21) on CCA-associated angiogenesis. TCF21 expression was compared between 15 pairs of peritumor normal tissues and CCA tissues and also between normal bile duct epithelial cells and two CCA cell lines (QBC-939 and TFK-1) using real-time PCR and Western blot. With the use of both CCA cell lines as the model system, we stably expressed TCF21 by lentiviral transduction (Lv-TCF21). In vivo, we monitored xenograft growth from different CCA cells, measured tumor-associated angiogenesis by histological analysis, and determined the expressions and circulatory levels of VEGFA and PDGF-BB by immunohistochemistry and ELISA, respectively. In vitro, we assessed the effects of conditioned medium collected from different CCA cells on the viability, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells and explored the significance of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), as well as ERK1/2 signaling in this process. TCF21 was significantly downregulated in CCA tissues or cell lines. Ectopic expression of TCF21 in CCA cells inhibited xenograft growth or tumor-associated angiogenesis in vivo and targeted the expression and secretion of proangiogenic factors, VEGFA and PDGF-BB. In vitro, the conditioned medium collected from Lv-TCF21 CCA cells significantly reduced the viability, migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells. On the molecular level, the targeting of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling mediated the anti-angiogenic activity of TCF21. TCF21 presents growth-inhibitory and anti-angiogenic activities, and thus the elevation of TCF21 expression may provide therapeutic benefits for CCA. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transcription factor 21 (TCF21) is downregulated in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissues or cells. TCF21 inhibits the growth of xenografts derived from CCA cells. TCF21 suppresses in vivo tumor-associated angiogenesis. TCF21 targets expression and production of proangiogenic factors from CCA cells. The targeting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B and ERK1/2 signaling mediates the anti-angiogenesis of TCF21.",A Semi-Classical View on Epsilon-Near-Zero Resonant Tunneling Modes in Metal/Insulator/Metal Nanocavities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920844,Nano letters,2019 05 29,"Metal/Insulator/Metal nanocavities (MIMs) are highly versatile systems for nanometric light confinement and waveguiding, and their optical properties are mostly interpreted in terms of surface plasmon polaritons. Although classic electromagnetic theory accurately describes their behavior, it often lacks physical insight, leaving some fundamental aspects of light interaction with these structures unexplored. In this work, we elaborate a quantum mechanical description of the MIM cavity as a double barrier quantum well. We identify the square of the imaginary part κ of the refractive index ñ of the metal as the optical potential and find that MIM cavity resonances are suppressed if the ratio n/κ exceeds a certain limit, which shows that low n and high κ values are desired for strong and sharp cavity resonances. Interestingly, the spectral regions of cavity mode suppression correspond to the interband transitions of the metals, where the optical processes are intrinsically non-Hermitian. The quantum treatment allows to describe the tunnel effect for photons and reveals that the MIM cavity resonances can be excited by resonant tunneling via illumination through the metal, without the need of momentum matching techniques such as prisms or grating couplers. By combining this analysis with spectroscopic ellipsometry on experimental MIM structures and by developing a simple harmonic oscillator model of the MIM for the calculation of its effective permittivity, we show that the cavity eigenmodes coincide with low-loss zeros of the effective permittivity. Therefore, the MIM resonances correspond to epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) eigenmodes that can be excited via resonant tunneling. Our approach provides a toolbox for the engineering of ENZ resonances throughout the entire visible range, which we demonstrate experimentally and theoretically. In particular, we apply our quantum mechanical approach to asymmetric MIM superabsorbers and use it for configuring broadly tunable refractive index sensors. Our work elucidates the role of MIM cavities as photonic analogues to tunnel diodes and opens new perspectives for metamaterials with designed ENZ response.",Miniaturized Measurement of Drug-Polymer Interactions via Viscosity Increase for Polymer Selection in Amorphous Solid Dispersions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920843,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 05 06,"Drug-polymer interactions have a substantial impact on stability and performance of amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) but are difficult to analyze. Whereas there are many screening methods described for polymer selection based for example on glass forming ability, drug-polymer miscibility, supersaturation, or inhibition of recrystallization, the distinct detection of physico-chemical interactions mostly lacks miniaturized techniques. This work presents an interaction screening assessing the relative viscosity increase between highly concentrated polymer solutions with and without the model drug ketoconazole (KTZ). The fluorescent molecular rotor 9-(2-carboxy-2-cyanovinyl)julolidine was added to the solutions in a miniaturized setup in μL-scale. Due to its environment-sensitive emission behavior, the integrated fluorescence intensity can be used as a viscosity dye within this screening approach (FluViSc). Differences in relative viscosity increases through addition of KTZ were proposed to rank polymers regarding KTZ-polymer interactions. Absolute viscosities were measured with a cone-plate rheometer as a complimentary method and supported the results acquired by the FluViSc. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ss-NMR) relaxation time measurements and Raman spectroscopy were utilized to investigate drug-polymer interactions at a molecular level. Whereas Raman spectroscopy was not suited to reveal KTZ-polymer interactions, ss-NMR relaxation time measurements differentiated between the selected polymeric carriers hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) and polyvinylpyrrolidone vinyl acetate 60:40 (PVP-VA64). Interactions were detected for HPMCAS/KTZ ASD while there was no hint for interactions between KTZ and PVP-VA64. These results were in correlation with the FluViSc. The findings were correlated with the dissolution performance of ASD and found to be predictive for supersaturation and inhibition of precipitation during dissolution.","Nanowire Length, Density, and Crystalline Quality Retrieved from a Single Optical Spectrum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920842,Nano letters,2019 04 15,"We propose spectral domain attenuated reflectometry (SDAR) for fast characterization of nanomaterial growth. The method is demonstrated here for zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires (NWs) which are grown vertically in random forest fashion showing that it is not limited to well-ordered NWs. We show how SDAR can provide, on the basis of a single measured spectrum, simultaneous information on nanowire length, nanowire density (through nanowire/air filling ratio), and crystalline quality (through band gap). The robustness of the proposed method is assessed first through comparison with information obtained from SEM and XRD taken as reference. In SDAR, the process for fast extraction of NW thickness and filling ratio values  makes use of the interference pattern contrast and the spectral periodicity in the reflection response which involve a best fit of the measured spectra with simple theoretical modeling based on the effective medium approach, achieved with a mean square error down to 0.1%. The results also suggest the existence of either 2 or 3 layers of different effective refractive index, hence providing insight on possible growth mechanisms.",Regioselective C-H Amidation of (Alkyl)arenes by Iron(II) Catalysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920841,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"A nondirected amidation reaction of aromatic C-H bond was developed under iron(II) catalysis, using sulfonyl azides as the nitrogen source. The reaction displayed a broad substrate scope and good regioselectivities in the aspects of aromatic ring vs alkyl chain and different aromatic position of (alkyl)arenes. This method provided a new protocol for the synthesis of some aromatic amines, which were hard to achieve in a previous report.",Oxide Analogs of Halide Perovskites and the New Semiconductor Ba2AgIO6.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920840,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 04 26,"The past few years witnessed the rise of halide perovskites as prominent materials for a wide range of optoelectronic applications. However, oxide perovskites have a much longer history and are pivotal in many technological applications. As of today, a rational connection between these important materials is missing. Here, we explore this missing link and develop a novel concept of perovskite analogs, which led us to identify a new semiconductor, Ba2AgIO6. It exhibits an electronic band structure remarkably similar to that of our recently discovered halide double perovskite Cs2AgInCl6, but with a band gap in the visible range at 1.9 eV. We show that Ba2AgIO6 and Cs2AgInCl6 are analogs of the well-known transparent conductor BaSnO3. We synthesize Ba2AgIO6 following a low-temperature solution process, and we perform crystallographic and optical characterizations. Ba2AgIO6 is a cubic oxide double perovskite with a direct low gap, opening new opportunities in perovskite-based electronics optoelectronics and energy applications."

Although there have been significant advances in understanding and controlling the helical organization of enantiopure synthetic molecular systems, rationally dictating the assembly of mixtures of enantiomer (including racemates) is nontrivial. Here we demonstrate that a subtle change in molecular structure coupled with the understanding of assembly processes of enantiomers and racemates, in both dilute solution and concentrated gels, acts as a stepping stone to rationally control the organization in the solid-state. We have studied trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexanes as model systems with carboxamide, thioamide, and their combination as functional groups. On comparing the gelation propensity of individual enantiomers and racemates, we find that racemates of carboxamide, thioamide, and their combination adopt self-sorting, coassembly, and mixed organization, respectively. Remarkably, these modes of assembly of racemates were also retained in solid-state. These results point out that studying the solution-phase assembly is a key link for connecting molecular structure with the assembly in the solid-state, even for racemates.",Cluster-in-Molecule Local Correlation Approach for Periodic Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920828,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 05 15,"In this article, the cluster-in-molecule (CIM) local correlation approach for periodic systems with periodic boundary condition has been developed, which allows electron-correlation calculations of various crystals computationally tractable. In this approach, the correlation energy per unit cell of a periodic system can be evaluated as the summation of the correlation contributions from electron-correlation calculations on a series of finite-sized clusters. Each cluster is defined to contain a subset of localized Wannier functions (WFs) (for the occupied space) and projected atomic orbitals (for the virtual space), which can be derived from a periodic Hartree-Fock calculation. Electron-correlation calculations on clusters at second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) or coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) can be performed with well-established molecular quantum chemistry packages. We perform illustrative calculations at the MP2 and CCSD levels on several types of crystals (neon lattice, carbon monoxide and ammonia crystals, two ionic liquid crystals, and diamond). The results show that CIM is a powerful framework for accurate electron-correlation calculations of crystals.","Developing a Transferable Coarse-Grained Model for the Prediction of Thermodynamic, Structural, and Mechanical Properties of Polyimides at Different Thermodynamic State Points.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920827,Journal of chemical information and modeling,2019 05 28,"In the present work, we develop a coarse-grained (CG) model for polyimide (PI) at 800 K and 1 atm by applying iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) and the density correction method to derive the bonded and nonbonded interaction potentials. Although the CG force field is built at a single thermodynamic state point without any temperature correction, the CG model possesses a rather favorable temperature transferability in a wide temperature range of 300-800 K at P = 1 atm and a good pressure transferability to some extent in a certain pressure range from 0.1 to 30 MPa. In addition to the local conformation and local packing distribution functions, the thermodynamic properties such as the glass transition temperature and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion are predicted correctly by the CG model, and the isothermal compressibility coefficients calculated from both atomic and CG models are on the same order of magnitude. Additionally, the stress-strain behavior under compression or tension of the CG model shows a qualitative agreement with the atomistic results, and the corresponding values of the elastic modulus of the CG model at different temperatures roughly match with those of the atomistic model.",Theoretical Investigation of Steric Effect Influence on Reactivity of Substituted Butadienes with Bromocyclobutenone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920826,Journal of chemical information and modeling,2019 05 28,"The Diels-Alder reaction (DA) between various mono- and disubstituted 1,3-butadiene (Dn-1 to Dn-10) and 2-bromocyclobutenone (DPh) was carried out in gas phase using density functional theory (DFT) at the M06-2X/6-31+g** level. The reaction was found to proceed through a concerted asynchronous transition state. Further, the asynchronous and early nature of the transition state was clearly pinpointed with the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) and bond order index (BOI) analyses. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction along with steric encumbrance in the transition state were found to be the predominant factors in controlling the reactivity of the dienes. Among the investigated dienes, Dn-6 was found to be the most reactive diene which is attributed to its low activation barrier due to the presence of strong intermolecular H-bonding interactions. These factors were further supported by quantum mechanical calculations using global descriptor indexes, natural bond orbital analysis, and quantum theory of atoms in molecules analysis. These theoretical results were found to be in good agreement with the previous experimental findings.",NMR Metabolomics as an Effective Tool To Unravel the Effect of Light Intensity and Temperature on the Composition of the Marine Microalgae Isochrysis galbana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920825,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 19,"NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis techniques was applied to obtain meaningful information about nontargeted metabolic changes on  Isochrysis galbana upon acclimation to different environmental conditions at indoor lab-scale. The effects of temperature (from 15 to 30 °C) and incident irradiance (from 250 to 1600 μmol m-2 s-1) at a constant dilution rate of 0.3 h-1 were evaluated. High irradiances stimulated a decrease of chlorophyll a, fucoxanthin and amino acids content, and the conversion of polar fatty acids (PLs, GLs, DGDGs, SGDGs) to neutral fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated). High temperatures together with high irradiances decreased PUFAs concentration, including omega-3 fatty acids.

Subsequently, six GC-EAD-active compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These six compounds, along with some previously reported insect attractants, were selected for electroantennogram (EAG) assays. The four chemicals that elicited the strongest EAG responses, 1-octen-3-ol, nonanal, benzaldehyde, and ocimene, were selected for evaluation in olfactometer bioassays. Both benzaldehyde and 1-octen-3-ol exhibited dose-dependent responses at higher concentration. Our results provide insight into host location compounds used by adult M. cribraria.

The products are stable as solids but rapidly decompose in solution. A number of related phenylimidorhenium(V) complexes were synthesized starting from [Re(NPhF)Cl3(PPh3)2], where (NPhF)2- is a para-fluorinated phenylimido ligand.

The β-diketonates are coordinated in a meridional arrangement with the phenylimide. The formation of two isomers was detected for nonsymmetric β-diketones with a preference for the ""equatorial"" position for the more bulky substituents. Products with more than one chelating ligand were not obtained. The technetium complexes [Tc(NPhX)Cl3(PPh3)2] (X = p-F or p-CF3) were prepared from reactions of pertechnetate, PPh3, HCl, and substituted arylacetylhydrazines and isolated as green solids.

The investigated reaction network includes the mechanism for initiation (42 steps) and a representative part of the autocatalytic olefin cycle (63 steps). The simulations unravel the dominant initiation pathway for H-SSZ-13: dehydrogenation of methanol to CO is followed by CO-methylation leading to the formation of the first C-C bond in methyl acetate despite high barriers of >200 kJ/mol. Our multiscale approach is able to shed light on the reaction sequence that ultimately leads to olefin formation and strikingly demonstrates that only with a full reactor model that includes autocatalysis with olefins as cocatalysts is one able to understand the initiation mechanism on the atomic scale. Importantly, the model also shows that autocatalysis takes over long before significant amounts of olefins are formed, thus guiding the interpretation of experimental results.",Exploiting Designed Oxidase-Peroxygenase Mutual Benefit System for Asymmetric Cascade Reactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920820,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 10,"A unique P450 monooxygenase-peroxygenase mutual benefit system was designed as the core element in the construction of a biocatalytic cascade reaction sequence leading from 3-phenyl propionic acid to ( R)-phenyl glycol.

There have been various efforts to develop new functional frameworks, but chasing both advantages (functions and stability) is always challenging. Herein, we report a highly stable and porous 3D MOF having an imidazolium group. By adjusting counteranions of the imidazolium group, we could prepare two distinct MOFs. The 2D MOF constructed by applying bicarbonate anion inhibited three-dimensional growth and showed N2 adsorption with BET results of 330 m2/g. However, the 3D MOF (Imi-3D) formed by applying chloride anion on the imidazolium group evolved into a 4-fold interpenetrated cube structure. The Imi-3D has high porosity in spite of the folded nature of the structure, with BET results of 1400 m2/g. Interestingly, unlike the usual trend of unstable zinc carboxylate based MOFs, the multiple π-π interactions of the Imi-3D presents a unique tolerance toward various solvents, especially toward water, for 6 months and without decomposition or collapse of the framework. Moreover, since the porous 3D MOF consists of imidazolium groups, the MOF shows a cationic feature with strong adsorption toward anionic guests in aqueous media.",Heavy Neutral and Anionic Pnictogen Thiocyanates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920808,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,"When [PPN]SCN (1; PPN = [Ph3P-N-PPh3]) is treated with Me3Si-SCN in methanol, [PPN][H(NCS)2] (2), a hydrogen diisothiocyanate salt bearing the [H(NCS)2]- anion, was generated, isolated, and fully characterized. Pure heavy E(NCS)3 [E = Sb (3), Bi (4)] species were obtained from the reaction of EF3 and an excess of Me3Si-SCN, while the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvates E(NCS)3·THF were isolated when the product was recrystallized from THF.

The study evaluates also the impact of different plants (clover, grass, willow) on Cfree PAHs. The cumulative effect of treatments on nitrogen and available forms of phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium is also assessed. The direct addition of biochar to soil did not cause any immediate reduction of the sum of 16 Cfree PAHs, while AC resulted in a slight reduction of 5- and 6 ring compounds. The efficiency of binding of Cfree PAHs by biochar and AC increased with time. For biochar, the maximum reduction of 4-6-ring PAHs (18-67%) was achieved within 6 months. For 2- and 3-ring PAHs, a gradual decrease of Cfree was observed which reached 60-66% at 18 months. AC proved to be better in reducing Cfree PAHs than biochar, though for 2- and 3-ring PAHs, the differences in AC and biochar performances were smaller than those for 4-6-ring PAHs. After 18 months, a significantly lower content of Cfree PAHs was observed in the soil with plants compared to the unplanted soil.

This study investigated comparatively the kinetics of sulfamethazine (SMN) degradation by the UV/H2O2 process among three representative radiation sources, including low-pressure mercury UV (LPUV, monochromatic), medium-pressure mercury UV (MPUV, polychromatic), and vacuum UV(VUV)/UV (dual wavelengths causing different reaction mechanisms) lamps. Experiments were conducted with a newly developed mini-fluidic MPUV photoreaction system and a previously developed mini-fluidic VUV/UV photoreaction system. Measured and modeled results both indicate that the photon fluence-based SMN degradation rate constant ( kp') followed a descending order of VUV/UV/H2O2 > MPUV/H2O2 (200-300 nm) > LPUV/H2O2, and the kp' of the MPUV lamp was dependent on the wavelength range selected for photon fluence calculation. Analysis of potential errors revealed that a shorter effective path-length could have a lower error, and the maximum errors for the MPUV/H2O2 and LPUV/H2O2 processes in this study were 7.7% and 18.2%, respectively. This study has developed a new method for kinetic comparisons of micropollutant degradation by UV-AOPs among various radiation sources at bench-scale, which provides useful reference to practical applications.",Truncated G-Quadruplex Isomers Cross-Talk with the Transcription Factors To Maintain Homeostatic Equilibria in c-MYC Transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920805,Biochemistry,2019 04 16,"The nuclease hypersensitive element III1 (NHE III1) upstream c-MYC promoter harbors a transcription-silencing G-quadruplex (Pu27) element. Dynamic turnover of various transcription factors (TFs) across Pu27 to control c-MYC transcription homeostasis is enigmatic. Here, we reveal that native Pu27 evolves truncated G-quadruplex isomers (Pu19, Pu22, Pu24, and Pu25) in cells that are optimal intracellular targets of specific TFs in a sequence- and structure-dependent manner. Nuclear magnetic resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry envisaged that NM23-H2 (nucleoside diphosphate kinase) and nucleolin induce conformational fluctuations in Pu27 to sample specific conformationally restricted conformer(s). Structural investigations revealed that the flanking guanines at 5'-Pu27 control solvent exposure at G-quartets upon NM23-H2 and nucleolin binding driving Pu27 unfolding and folding, respectively. Transient chromatin immunoprecipitations confirmed that NM23-H2 drives the conformation switch to Pu24 that outcompetes nucleolin recruitment. Similarly, nucleolin arrests Pu27 in the Pu22 conformer minimizing NM23-H2 binding at Pu27. hnRNPK (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K) positively regulates NM23-H2 and nucleolin association at Pu27 despite their antagonism. On the basis of these results, we simulated the transcription kinetics in a feed-forward loop in which the transcription output responds to hnRNPK-induced early activation via NM23-H2 association, which favors Pu24 formation at NHE III1 reducing nucleolin occupancy and driving quadruplex unfolding to initiate transcription. NM23-H2 further promotes hnRNPK deposition across NHE III1 altering Pu27 plasticity that finally enriches the nucleolin abundance to drive Pu22 formation and weaken NM23-H2 binding to extinguish transcription. This mechanism involves three positive feedback loops (NM23-H2-hnRNPK, NM23-H2-CNBP, and hnRNPK-nucleolin) and one negative feedback loop (NM23-H2-nucleolin) controlling optimal turnover and residence time of TFs at Pu27 to homeostatically regulate c-MYC transcription.",Red Fluorescence Probe Targeted to Dipeptidylpeptidase-IV for Highly Sensitive Detection of Esophageal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920803,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 04 17,"We have developed an activatable red fluorescence probe for dipeptidylpeptidase-IV (DPP-IV) by precisely controlling the photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process of a red fluorescent scaffold, SiR600.

Polymers currently available for conjugation to proteins generally have limited chemical versatility for subsequent drug loading. Many polymers that do have chemical functionality useful for drug loading are often insoluble in water, making it difficult to synthesize functional protein-polymer conjugates for targeted drug delivery. In this work, we demonstrate that reactive, azlactone-functionalized polymers can be grafted to proteins, conjugated to a small-molecule fluorophore, and subsequently internalized into cells in a receptor-specific manner. Poly(2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone), synthesized using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, was modified post-polymerization with substoichiometric equivalents of triethylene glycol monomethyl ether to yield reactive water-soluble, azlactone-functionalized copolymers. These reactive polymers were then conjugated to proteins holo-transferrin and ovotransferrin. Protein gel analysis verified successful conjugation of proteins to polymer, and protein-polymer conjugates were subsequently purified from unreacted proteins and polymers using size exclusion chromatography. Internalization experiments using a breast cancer cell line that overexpresses the transferrin receptor on its surface showed that the holo-transferrin-polymer conjugate was successfully internalized by cells in a mechanism consistent with receptor-mediated endocytosis. Internalization of protein-polymer conjugate demonstrated that the protein ligand maintained its overall structure and function following conjugation to polymer. Our approach to protein-polymer conjugate synthesis offers a simple, tailorable strategy for preparing bioconjugates of interest for a broad range of biomedical applications.",Development of Ion Mobility Spectrometry with Novel Atmospheric Electron Emission Ionization for Field Detection of Gaseous and Blister Chemical Warfare Agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920801,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 16,"Drift tube ion mobility spectrometry with a novel atmospheric electron emission (AEE) source was developed for determination of gaseous and blister chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in negative mode. The AEE source was fabricated from an aluminum substrate electrode covered with 1 μm silver nanoparticle-dispersed silicone resin and a thin gold layer. This structure enabled stable tunneling electron emission upon the application of more than 11 V potential under atmospheric pressure. The reactant ion peak (RIP) was observed for the reduced mobility constant ( K0) of 2.18 and optimized at the charging voltage of 20 V. This RIP was assigned to O2- by using a mass spectrometer. Hydrogen cyanide was detected as a peak ( K0 = 2.47) that was discriminatively separated from the RIP (resolution = 1.4), with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.057 mg/m3, and assigned to CN- and OCN-. Phosgene was detected as a peak ( K0 = 2.36; resolution = 1.2; and LOD = 0.6 mg/m3), which was assigned to Cl-. Lewisite 1 was detected as two peaks ( K0 = 1.68 and 1.34; LOD = 12 and 15 mg/m3). The K0 = 1.68 peak was ascribed to a mixture of adducts of molecules or the product of hydrolysis with oxygen or chloride. Cyanogen chloride, chlorine, and sulfur mustard were also well detected. The detection performance with the AEE source was compared with those under corona discharge and 63Ni ionizations. The advantage of the AEE source is the simple RIP pattern (only O2-), and the characteristic marker ions contribute to the discriminative CWAs detection.","PERSIA for Direct Fluorescence Measurements of Transcription, Translation, and Enzyme Activity in Cell-Free Systems.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920800,ACS synthetic biology,2019 05 17,"Quantification of biology's central dogma (transcription and translation) is pursued by a variety of methods.

In this work, we create an anti-oil fouling coating by spray coating poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-grafted SiO2 nanochains (approximately 45 nm wide and 300 nm long) onto solid surfaces, forming a nanoporous film exhibiting superhydrophilicity (water contact angle in air ≈ 0°) and underwater superoleophobicity (dichloroethane contact angle ≥ 165°). The polymer-grafted nanochain assemblies exhibit extremely low contact angle hysteresis (<1°) and small adhesion hysteresis (-0.05 mN m-1), and thus, oil can readily roll off from the surface when the coating is immersed in water. Compared to other superhydrophilic surfaces, we show that both the unique structure of spray-assembled nanochains and the hygroscopic nature of PAA are essential to enable ultrastable anti-oil fouling. Even after the PAA-grafted nanochain coating is purposely fouled by oil, oil can be readily and completely expelled and lifted-off from the coating within 10 s when placed under water. Further, we show that our coating retains underwater superoleophobicity even after being subjected to shearing under water for more than 168 h. Our approach offers a simple yet versatile method to create an ultrastable superhydrophilic and anti-oil fouling coating via a scalable manufacturing method."

Herein, we summarize the biological and clinical significance of different markers and new diagnostic tools and cut-offs for the detection of skeletal muscle wasting, including micro-RNAs, siRNAs, epigenetic targets, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, mammalian target of rapamycin signalling, news in body composition analysis including the D3-creatine dilution method, and electrocardiography that was modified to enable segmental impedance spectroscopy. Of particular interest were the beneficial effects of BIO101 on muscle cell differentiation, hypertrophy of myofibers associated with mammalian target of rapamycin pathways activation, and the effect of metal ion transporter ZIP14 loss that reduces cancer-induced cachexia. The potential of anti-ZIP14 antibodies and zinc chelation as anti-cachexia therapy should be tested in patients with cancer cachexia. Big randomized studies were presented such as RePOWER (observational study of patients with primary mitochondrial myopathy), STRAMBO (influence of physical performance assessed as score and clinical testing), MMPOWER (treatment of elamipretide in subjects with primary mitochondrial myopathy), FORCE (examined differences in relative dose intensity and moderate and severe chemotherapy-associated toxicities between a strength training intervention and a control group), and SPRINTT (effectiveness of exercise training in healthy aging). Effective treatments were urothelin A, rapamycin analogue treatment, epigenetic factor BRD 4 and epigenetic protein BET, and the gut pathobiont Klebsiella oxytoca. Clinical studies that investigated novel approaches, including urolithin A, the role of gut microbiota, metal ion transporter ZIP14, lysophosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine, and BIO101, were described.

However, the complexity and potential toxicity of the present common synthesis methods limit their clinical application. Herein, multifunctional hyaluronic acid-MnO2 nanoparticles (HA-MnO2 NPs) are synthesized in a simple way by directly mixing sodium permanganate with HA aqueous solutions, which serve as both a reducing agent and a surface-coating material. The obtained HA-MnO2 NPs show an improved water-dispersibility, fine colloidal stability, low toxicity, and responsiveness to the tumor microenvironment (high H2 O2 and high glutathione, low pH). After intravenous injection, HA-MnO2 NPs exhibit a high imaging sensitivity for detecting rat intracranial glioma with MRI for a prolonged period of up to 3 d. These nanoparticles also effectively alleviate the tumor hypoxia in a rat model of intracranial glioma. The downregulation of VEGF and HIF-1α expression in intracranial glioma validates the sustained attenuation effect of HA-MnO2 NPs on tumor hypoxia. These results show that HA-MnO2 NPs can be used for sensitive, targeted MRI detection of gliomas and simultaneous attenuation of tumor hypoxia.",Concise Review: Patency of Small-Diameter Tissue-Engineered Vascular Grafts: A Meta-Analysis of Preclinical Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920771,Stem cells translational medicine,2019 03 28,"Several patient groups undergoing small-diameter (<6 mm) vessel bypass surgery have limited autologous vessels for use as grafts. Tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVG) have been suggested as an alternative, but the ideal TEVG remains to be generated, and a systematic overview and meta-analysis of clinically relevant studies is lacking. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase databases for (pre)clinical trials and identified three clinical and 68 preclinical trials ([>rabbit]; 873 TEVGs) meeting the inclusion criteria. Preclinical trials represented low to medium risk of bias, and binary logistic regression revealed that patency was significantly affected by recellularization, TEVG length, TEVG diameter, surface modification, and preconditioning. In contrast, scaffold types were less important. The patency was 63.5%, 89%, and 100% for TEVGs with a median diameter of 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm, respectively. In the group of recellularized TEVGs, patency was not improved by using smooth muscle cells in addition to endothelial cells nor affected by the endothelial origin, but seems to benefit from a long-term (46-240 hours) recellularization time. Finally, data showed that median TEVG length (5 cm) and median follow-up (56 days) used in preclinical settings are relatively inadequate for direct clinical translation. In conclusion, our data imply that future studies should consider a TEVG design that at least includes endothelial recellularization and bioreactor preconditioning, and we suggest that more standard guidelines for testing and reporting TEVGs in large animals should be considered to enable interstudy comparisons and favor a robust and reproducible outcome as well as clinical translation.",Immunolocalization of DMRTB1 in human testis with normal and impaired spermatogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920770,Andrology,2019 03 28,The transcription factor DMRTB1 plays a pivotal role in coordinating the transition between mitosis and meiosis in murine germ cells.

Well-calculated antibiotic therapies require precise diagnostic criteria. Erysipelas is defined as non-purulent infection considered to be caused by beta-hemolytic strepto-cocci. It is diagnosed clinically by its bright-red erythema and early fever or chills at disease onset. Penicillin is the treatment of choice. Limited soft tissue infection (cellulitis) is usually caused by Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, frequently originates from chronic wounds and presents with a more violaceous-red hue and only rarely with initial fever or chills. Treatment consists of first- or second--generation cephalosporins or flucloxacillin (IV). Severe cellulitis is a purulent, partially necrotic infection which extends through tissue boundaries to fascias and requires surgical management in addition to antibiotics. Moreover, it frequently fulfills the criteria for ""complicated soft tissue infections"", as previously defined by the Food and Drug Administration for use in clinical trials (they include comorbidities such as uncontrolled diabetes, peripheral artery disease, neutropenia). It requires antibiotics which besides S. aureus target anaerobic and/or gramnegative bacteria. The rare so-called necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections represent a distinct entity. They are characterized by rapid, life-threatening progression due to special bacterial toxins that cause ischemic necrosis and shock and need rapid and thorough debridement in addition to appropriate antibiotics. For cutaneous abscesses the first-line treatment is adequate drainage. Additional antibiotic therapy is required only under certain circumstances (e.g., involvement of the face, hands, or anogenital region, or if drainage is somehow complicated). The present guidelines also contain consensus-based recommendations for higher doses of antibiotics than those approved or usually given in clinical trials. The goal is to deliver rational antibiotic treatment that is both effective and well-tolerated and that exerts no unnecessary selection pressure in terms of multidrug resistance.","Molecular modeling of salsolinol, a full Gi protein agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, within the receptor binding site.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920734,Chemical biology & drug design,2019 05 04,"(R/S)-Salsolinol is a full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (μOR) Gi protein pathway via its (S)-enantiomer and is functionally selective as it does not promote β-arrestin recruitment. Compared to (S)-salsolinol, the (R)-enantiomer is a less potent agonist of the Gi protein pathway. We have now studied the interactions of the salsolinol enantiomers docked in the binding pocket of the μOR to determine the molecular interactions that promote enantiomeric specificity and functional selectivity of (R/S)-salsolinol. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that (S)-salsolinol interacted with 8 of the 11 residues of the μOR binding site, enough to stabilize the molecule. (R)-Salsolinol showed higher mobility with fewer prevalent bonds. Hence, the methyl group bound to the (S)-stereogenic center promoted more favorable interactions in the μOR binding site than in the (R)-orientation. Because (S)-salsolinol is a small molecule (179.2 Da), it did not interact with residues implicated in the binding of larger morphinan agonists that are located toward the extracellular portion of the binding pocket: W3187.35 , I3227.39 , and Y3267.43 . Our results suggest that contact with residues which (S)-salsolinol interacts with are enough to elicit Gi protein activation, and possibly define a minimum set required by μOR ligands to promote activation of the Gi protein pathway.",A common metabolomic signature is observed upon inoculation of rice roots with various rhizobacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920733,Journal of integrative plant biology,2019 05 22,"Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), whose growth is stimulated by root exudates, are able to improve plant growth and health. Among those, bacteria of the genus Azospirillum were shown to affect root secondary metabolite content in rice and maize, sometimes without visible effects on root architecture. Transcriptomic studies also revealed that expression of several genes involved in stress and plant defense was affected, albeit with fewer genes when a strain was inoculated onto its original host cultivar. Here, we investigated, via a metabolic profiling approach, whether rice roots responded differently and with gradual intensity to various PGPR, isolated from rice or not. A common metabolomic signature of nine compounds was highlighted, with the reduced accumulation of three alkylresorcinols and increased accumulation of two hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAA), identified as N-p-coumaroylputrescine and N-feruloylputrescine. This was accompanied by the increased transcription of two genes involved in the N-feruloylputrescine biosynthetic pathway. Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen triggered a reduced accumulation of these HCAA in roots, a result contrasting with previous reports of increased HCAA content in leaves upon pathogen infection. Accumulation of HCAA, that are potential antimicrobial compounds, might be considered as a primary reaction of plant to bacterial perception.",miRNA-Specific Unlocking of Drug-Loaded Metal-Organic Framework Nanoparticles: Targeted Cytotoxicity toward Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920730,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 25,"UiO-68 metal-organic framework nanoparticles (NMOFs) are loaded with a doxorubicin drug (fluorescent dye analogs) and locked by means of structurally engineered duplex nucleic acid structures, where one strand is covalently linked to the NMOFs and the second strand is hybridized with the anchor strand. Besides the complementarity of the second strand to the anchor sequence, it includes the complementary sequence to the microRNAs (miRNA)-21 or miRNA-221 that is specific miRNA biomarker for MCF-7 breast cancer cells or OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells. In the presence of the respective miRNA biomarkers, the miRNA-induced displacement of the strand associated with the anchor strand proceeds, resulting in the release of DNA/miRNA duplexes. The released duplexes are, however, engineered to be digested in the presence of exonuclease III, Exo III, a process that recycles the miRNAs and provides the autonomous amplified unlocking of the NMOFs and the release of the doxorubicin load (or the fluorescent dye analogs) even at low concentrations of miRNA. Preliminary cell experiments reveal that the respective NMOFs are unlocked by the miRNA-21 or miRNA-221, resulting in selective cytotoxicity toward MCF-7 breast cancer cells or OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells.",Enhanced Enzyme Activity through Scaffolding on Customizable Self-Assembling Protein Filaments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920729,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 17,"Precisely organized enzyme complexes are often found in nature to support complex metabolic reactions in a highly efficient and specific manner. Scaffolding enzymes on artificial materials has thus gained attention as a promising biomimetic strategy to design biocatalytic systems with enhanced productivity. Herein, a versatile scaffolding platform that can immobilize enzymes on customizable nanofibers is reported. An ultrastable self-assembling filamentous protein, the gamma-prefoldin (γ-PFD), is genetically engineered to display an array of peptide tags, which can specifically and stably bind enzymes containing the counterpart domain through simple in vitro mixing. Successful immobilization of proteins along the filamentous template in tunable density is first verified using fluorescent proteins. Then, two different model enzymes, glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase, are used to demonstrate that scaffold attachment could enhance the intrinsic catalytic activity of the immobilized enzymes. Considering the previously reported ability of γ-PFD to bind and stabilize a broad range of proteins, the filament's interaction with the bound enzymes may have created a favorable microenvironment for catalysis.

In contrast to its atrial specific expression after birth, Nppa is re-expressed in the adult ventricles in response to cardiac hypertrophy. To study cardiac chamber specification during development and pathological cardiac remodeling during heart disease, we generated a novel Nppa reporter mouse line by knocking-in a tagBFP reporter cassette into 3'-UTR of the Nppa gene without disrupting the endogenous gene. Our results demonstrated dynamic tagBFP expression in the developing heart, recapitulating the spatiotemporal expression pattern of endogenous Nppa. We also found that Nppa-tagBFP is induced in the ventricle during pathological remodeling.

Mechanistic studies suggest that a coordination equilibrium exists between the nickel salt and its complex, and that excess nickel salt promotes the formation of the active Ni-complex, and therefore improved the efficiency of the hydrogenation.

However, few studies report their ""enzyme-like"" catalytic performance because it is difficult to prepare enzymatic nanosheets with small size and ultrathin thickness by current synthetic protocols. Herein, a novel one-step wet-chemical method is first proposed for protein-directed synthesis of 2D MnO2 nanosheets (M-NSs), in which the size and thickness can be easily adjusted by the protein dosage. Then, a unique sono-chemical approach is introduced for surface functionalization of the M-NSs with high dispersity/stability as well as metal-cation-chelating capacity, which can not only chelate 64 Cu radionuclides for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, but also capture the potentially released Mn2+ for enhanced biosafety. Interestingly, the resulting M-NS exhibits excellent enzyme-like activity to catalyze the oxidation of glucose, which represents an alternative paradigm of acute glucose oxidase for starving cancer cells and sensitizing them to thermal ablation. Featured with outstanding phototheranostic performance, the well-designed M-NS can achieve effective photoacoustic-imaging-guided synergistic starvation-enhanced photothermal therapy. This study is expected to establish a new enzymatic phototheranostic paradigm based on small-sized and ultrathin M-NSs, which will broaden the application of 2D nanomaterials.",Controlling Monomer Feeding Rate to Achieve Highly Crystalline Covalent Triazine Frameworks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920709,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 08,"The synthesis of highly crystalline covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with ultrastrong covalent bonds (aromatic CN) from the triazine linkage presents a great challenge to synthetic chemists.

In two cases, RNA sequencing identified a fusion transcript composed of PHF1 exon 11 fused to TFE3 exon 3, whereas in a third case PHF1 exon 12 was fused to TFE3 exon 7. A FISH break-apart assay revealed rearrangements in both PHF1 and TFE3 genes in all cases. The cohort included three males and two females with a median age of 64 years. One OFMT originated in the scapula, while four occurred in the deep soft tissues. Two OFMTs had typical features, whereas three were classified as malignant.

The PHF1-TFE3 fusions resulted in consistent protein TFE3 overexpression which can be used as a reliable screening tool, adding OFMT as another tumor driven by TFE3 oncogenic activation pathway.",A Highly Stretchable and Real-Time Healable Supercapacitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920707,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 08,"In addition to a high specific capacitance, a large stretchability and self-healing properties are also essential to improve the practicality and reliability of supercapacitors in portable and wearable electronics. However, the integration of multiple functions into one device remains challenging. Here, the construction of a highly stretchable and real-time omni-healable supercapacitor is demonstrated by sandwiching the polypyrrole-incorporated gold nanoparticle/carbon nanotube (CNT)/poly(acrylamide) (GCP@PPy) hydrogel electrodes with a CNT-free GCP (GP) hydrogel as the electrolyte and chemically soldering an Ag nanowire film to the hydrogel electrode as the current collector. The newly developed dynamic metal-thiolate (M-SR, M = Au, Ag) bond-induced integrated configuration, with an intrinsically powerful electrode and electrolyte, enables the assembled supercapacitor to deliver an areal capacitance of 885 mF cm-2 and an energy density of 123 µWh cm-2 , which are among the highest-reported values for stretchable supercapacitors. Notably, the device exhibits a superhigh stretching strain of 800%, rapid optical healing capability, and significant real-time healability during the charge-discharge process. The exceptional performance combined with the facile assembly method confirms this multifunctional device as the best performer among all the flexible supercapacitors reported to date.",Neural mechanisms of vibrotactile categorization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920706,Human brain mapping,2019 06 04,"The grouping of sensory stimuli into categories is fundamental to cognition. Previous research in the visual and auditory systems supports a two-stage processing hierarchy that underlies perceptual categorization: (a) a ""bottom-up"" perceptual stage in sensory cortices where neurons show selectivity for stimulus features and (b) a ""top-down"" second stage in higher level cortical areas that categorizes the stimulus-selective input from the first stage. In order to test the hypothesis that the two-stage model applies to the somatosensory system, 14 human participants were trained to categorize vibrotactile stimuli presented to their right forearm. Then, during an fMRI scan, participants actively categorized the stimuli. Representational similarity analysis revealed stimulus selectivity in areas including the left precentral and postcentral gyri, the supramarginal gyrus, and the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Crucially, we identified a single category-selective region in the left ventral precentral gyrus. Furthermore, an estimation of directed functional connectivity delivered evidence for robust top-down connectivity from the second to first stage. These results support the validity of the two-stage model of perceptual categorization for the somatosensory system, suggesting common computational principles and a unified theory of perceptual categorization across the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems.",Vertical Organic Thin-Film Transistors with an Anodized Permeable Base for Very Low Leakage Current.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920705,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 08,"The organic permeable base transistor (OPBT) is currently the fastest organic transistor with a transition frequency of 40 MHz. It relies on a thin aluminum base electrode to control the transistor current. This electrode is surrounded by a native oxide layer for passivation, currently created by oxidation in air. However, this process is not reliable and leads to large performance variations between samples, slow production, and relatively high leakage currents. Here, for the first time it is demonstrated that electrochemical anodization can be conveniently employed for the fabrication of high-performance OPBTs with vastly reduced leakage currents and more controlled process parameters. Very large transmission factors of 99.9996% are achieved, while excellent on/off ratios of 5 × 105 and high on-currents greater than 300 mA cm-2 show that the C60 semiconductor layer can withstand the electrochemical anodization. These results make anodization an intriguing option for innovative organic transistor design."

Crucially, the metallic MoS2 monolayer is an ideal platform in which novel topological electronic states can emerge and also exhibits excellent energy conversion and storage properties. However, as its intrinsic metallic phase, little is known about the nature of 2D 1T'-MoS2 , probably because of limited phase uniformity (<80%) and lateral size (usually <1 µm) in produced materials. Herein, solution processing to realize high phase-purity 1T'-MoS2 monolayers with large lateral size is demonstrated. Direct chemical exfoliation of millimeter-sized 1T' crystal is introduced to successfully produce a high-yield of 1T'-MoS2 monolayers with over 97% phase purity and unprecedentedly large size up to tens of micrometers. Furthermore, the large-sized and high-quality 1T'-MoS2 nanosheets exhibit clear intrinsic superconductivity among all thicknesses down to monolayer, accompanied by a slow drop of transition temperature from 6.1 to 3.0 K. Prominently, unconventional superconducting behavior with upper critical field far beyond the Pauli limit is observed in the centrosymmetric 1T'-MoS2 structure. The results open up an ideal approach to explore the properties of 2D metastable polymorphic materials.",OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920691,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2019 05 07,"Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1) is the closest rice homolog of the Arabidopsis BZR1 and bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1)/BZR2 transcription factors. OsBZR1 plays a central role in the rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway. Despite its functional importance, the control mechanism by which the cellular stability of OsBZR1 is regulated has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that a rice U-box E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase OsPUB24 acts as a negative regulator in the BR signaling pathway via the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of OsBZR1. The ospub24 T-DNA knock-out mutant and Ubi:RNAi-OsPUB24 knock-down rice plants displayed enhanced seedling growth, increased lamina joint bending, and hypersensitivity to brassinolide (BL). The expressions of the BR biosynthetic genes suppressed by BR in a negative feedback loop were lower in the mutant progeny than in the wild-type rice plants, which indicated increased BR responses in the mutant line. OsPUB24 ubiquitinated OsBZR1, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of OsBZR1. In addition, the stability of OsPUB24 was downregulated by BL and bikinin, an inhibitor of Oryza sativa Shaggy/GSK3-like kinase 22 (OsSK22). OsSK22, the homolog of Arabidopsis BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2) protein kinase, phosphorylated OsPUB24 and elevated the cellular stability of OsPUB24. Our findings suggest that OsPUB24 participates in OsBZR1 turnover, and that the regulatory networks of OsPUB24, OsSK22 and OsBZR1 are crucial for fine-tuning the BR response in rice.",High Operation Stability of Ultraflexible Organic Solar Cells with Ultraviolet-Filtering Substrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920690,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 08,"Ultralightweight and flexible power sources are essential for driving textile or wearable electronic devices and soft robots because they do not induce discomfort or limit movement when they are attached to human skin, textiles, or soft actuators. Organic solar cells (OSCs) are good candidates for developing such power sources because they have the advantages of being lightweight and flexible. However, achieving operational stability and ultrathin shape simultaneously remains difficult because the ultrathin substrate cannot prevent the penetration of ultraviolet (UV) light, which is major a cause for the degradation of OSCs. Here, ultrathin OSCs that show great operational stability and high performance are reported. The 1.3 µm thick transparent polyimide utilized as a substrate can block light of 350 nm wavelength in the UV range by 90%. The ultrathin OSCs with the transparent polyimide substrate produce a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.0% and realize both photostability and operational stability. The PCE was maintained at 90% after 3 h in a maximum power point tracking test, indicating much better operational stability than the reference rigid OSCs.",Digital behavior surveillance for monitoring the interests of Google users in amber necklace in different countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920686,International journal of paediatric dentistry,2019 04 11,To determine the interests of Google users in information about amber necklace in distinct countries over time.,"Promoting health through housing improvements, education and advocacy: Lessons from staff involved in Wellington's Healthy Housing Initiative.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920685,Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,2019 04 22,Improving the conditions of housing through programs that trigger when children are hospitalised has the potential to prevent further ill-health and re-hospitalisations.

Unfortunately, since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, the rates of PTSD and hazardous drinking among active duty service members have increased significantly. Previous research on PTSD has typically excluded participants with current substance abuse. However, there is some research examining independent treatments for PTSD and substance abuse provided consecutively, concurrently, or as enhancements to other treatment. The current study examined the association between current hazardous drinking and PTSD treatment among 108 active duty service members with PTSD in a randomized controlled trial of group cognitive processing therapy and group present-centered therapy. Total scores above 8 on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test defined hazardous alcohol use. At baseline, 25.0% of the sample was categorized as hazardous drinkers, and the hazardous and nonhazardous drinking groups did not differ in PTSD symptom severity, F(1, 106) = 0.08, p = .777, d = 0.06. Over the course of treatment, the two groups also did not differ significantly in PTSD symptom severity change on the PTSD Checklist, F(1, 106) = 1.20, p = .280, d = 0.33. Treatment for PTSD did not exacerbate hazardous drinking, and the hazardous drinking group showed significant reductions in drinking following PTSD treatment.

In social animals, distinct microbial communities characterize different social groups across a variety of taxa, although little longitudinal research has been conducted that demonstrates how this divergence occurs. Our study addresses this question by characterizing the gut microbial composition of an African Old World monkey, the black-and-white colobus (Colobus vellerosus), before and after a social group fission event. Gut microbial taxonomic composition of these monkeys was profiled using the V-4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene, and pairwise-relatedness values were calculated for all individuals using 17 short tandem repeat loci and partial pedigree information. The two social groups in this study were found to harbor distinct microbial signatures after the fission event from which they emerged, while these communities were not divergent in the same individuals before this event. Three genera were found to differ in abundance between the two new social groups: Parabacteroides, Coprococcus, and Porphyromonadaceae. Additionally, although this fission happened partially along lines of relatedness, relatedness did not structure the differences that we found. Taken together, this study suggests that distinct gut microbial profiles can emerge in social groups in <1 year and recommends further work into more finely mapping the timescales, causes, and potentially adaptive effects of this recurring trend toward distinct group microbial signatures.",Reclaiming missed opportunities: a strategy of targeted direct-acting antiviral prophylaxis for HCV-seronegative recipients of HCV-seropositive donor kidneys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920681,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,2019 03 28,"Direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have cured millions of individuals living with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

We show here that pyrethric acid is produced from chrysanthemol in six steps catalyzed by four enzymes, the first five steps occurring in the trichomes covering the ovaries and the last one occurring inside the ovary tissues. Three steps involve the successive oxidation of carbon 10 (C10) to a carboxylic group by TcCHH, a cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. Two other steps involve the successive oxidation of the hydroxylated carbon 1 to give a carboxylic group by TcADH2 and TcALDH1, the same enzymes that catalyze these reactions in the formation of chrysanthemic acid. The ultimate result of the actions of these three enzymes is the formation of 10-carboxychrysanthemic acid in the trichomes. Finally, the carboxyl group at C10 is methylated by TcCCMT, a member of the SABATH methyltransferase family, to give pyrethric acid. This reaction occurs mostly in the ovaries. Expression in N. benthamiana plants of all four genes encoding aforementioned enzymes, together with TcCDS, a gene that encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of chrysanthemol, led to the production of pyrethric acid.",A charcot-marie-tooth type 1B kindred associated with hemifacial spasm and trigeminal neuralgia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920665,Muscle & nerve,2019 04 08,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) phenotypes can be distinguished by electrophysiology and genetic analysis but few can be identified by their clinical characteristics.

Alterations in the regulatory pathways involved in the establishment, perpetuation and removal of DNA methylation can lead to severe developmental alterations. Our understanding of the mechanistic aspects and relevance of DNA methylation comes from remarkable studies in well-established angiosperm plant models including maize and Arabidopsis. The study of plant models positioned at basal lineages opens exciting opportunities to expand our knowledge on the function and evolution of the components of DNA methylation. In this Tansley Insight, we summarize current progress in our understanding of the molecular basis and relevance of DNA methylation in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha.",Basal forebrain GABAergic innervation of olfactory bulb periglomerular interneurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920662,The Journal of physiology,2019 05 07,"Basal forebrain long-range projections to the olfactory bulb are important for olfactory sensitivity and odour discrimination. Using optogenetics, it was confirmed that basal forebrain afferents mediate IPSCs on granule and deep short axon cells. It was also shown that they selectively innervate specific subtypes of periglomerular (PG) cells. Three different subtypes of type 2 PG cells receive GABAergic IPSCs from the basal forebrain but not from other PG cells. Type 1 PG cells, in contrast, do not receive inputs from the basal forebrain but do receive inhibition from other PG cells. These results shed new light on the complexity and specificity of glomerular inhibitory circuits, as well as on their modulation by the basal forebrain.",Trends in Multidisciplinary Hazard and Disaster Research: A 1982-2017 Case Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920661,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2019 03 28,"From 1982 to 2017, 539 unique awards studying extreme events and natural disasters have been funded by the Infrastructure Management and Extreme Events (IMEE), Decision, Risk and Management Science (DRMS), Humans, Disasters, and the Built Environment (HDBE), and Hazard Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (Hazard SEES) programs under the National Science Foundation, totaling approximately $450 million. The relationships between discipline, topic, and funding are explored through review of the data on each award's active dates, amount of funding received, specific hazards and disasters studied, and principal investigator (PI) and co-PI affiliations. A positive correlation between award funding and increasingly larger multidisciplinary teams of PIs on projects is observed. However, these teams of four or more PIs only account for about 18% of the total number of awards. In terms of topic, projects applicable to general hazard/disaster research encompass the largest portion of awards, but not the greatest funding per award on average. Additionally, both the number of awards per year and the total funds allotted per year show an increasing trend. Finally, some of the trends in project team discipline with relation to hazards show a shift to equal numbers of engineers and social scientists on multidisciplinary teams while others remain fairly homogeneous in their team dynamics. This article provides unique perspectives on how to better allocate funds through extensive topic and funding analysis. This work is a brief analysis of trends in the hazard and disaster research community, focusing on multidisciplinary project teams and their correlation to funding amounts and research areas.",The effect of a novel intravenous fluid (Oxsealife®) on recovery from haemorrhagic shock in pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920660,Anaesthesia,2019 05 28,"Blood transfusion is given according to haemoglobin thresholds aimed at restoration of arterial oxygen-carrying capacity. Patient survival after severe haemorrhagic shock depends on restoration of microvascular perfusion, tissue oxygen delivery, endothelial function and organ integrity. We investigated a novel crystalloid fluid designed for tissue oxygen delivery, Oxsealife® , with components that generate microvascular nitric oxide and scavenge reactive oxygen species generated during ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The amount of dissolved oxygen in blood progressively increased during step-wise in vitro haemodilution with this fluid, suggesting that the oxygen solubility coefficient of blood is dynamic, not static. We performed a pilot safety and efficacy study to compare resuscitation with this novel crystalloid vs. whole blood transfusion in a swine haemorrhagic shock model with animals bled to an arterial lactate oxygen debt target. Despite contributing no haemoglobin, viscosity nor oncotic potential, resuscitation with Oxsealife after severe haemorrhagic shock restored central haemodynamic parameters comparable to stored allogeneic blood transfusion. Tissue perfusion, oxygenation and metabolic outcomes were equivalent between treatment groups. Increased consumption of bicarbonate in animals given Oxsealife suggested greater capillary recruitment and enhanced clearance of acidic tissue metabolites. Serum markers of organ function, animal activity during recovery and histological analysis of tissue morphology and endothelial glycocalyx integrity confirmed functional recovery from haemorrhagic shock. We conclude that recovery of tissue oxygen delivery and organ function after haemorrhagic shock may not be dependent on treatments that increase haemoglobin levels. Oxsealife shows promise for treatment of severe haemorrhagic shock and may reduce the requirement for allogeneic blood products.",High metabolic rate and stem cell characteristics of esophageal cancer stem-like cells depend on the Hsp27-AKT-HK2 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920655,International journal of cancer,2019 04 10,"Tumor progression with chemoresistance and local recurrence is commonly happened during treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Cancer stem cells (CSC) may respond for tumor progression. However, there are few reports regarding metabolism of esophageal CSCs with clinical correlation. In this work, we demonstrated that ESCC cell lines in spheroid culture display CSC phenotypes, including increased ALDH activity, chemoresistance and tumor initiation, which are dependent on Hsp27 activation. Esophageal CSCs also exhibit reprogrammed metabolic features particularly higher glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, which are regulated via the Hsp27-AKT-HK2 pathway. Moreover, HK2 is required for maintenance of CSC phenotypes. Inhibition of CSC metabolism reduces cell growth and tumor formation. Clinically, patients who underwent surgical resection for esophageal cancer, and displayed overexpression of both Hsp27 and HK2, had the worst prognosis of all expression types. In conclusion, stem cells features and aberrant metabolic reprogramming of esophageal CSCs depend on the Hsp27-AKT-HK2 pathway. Targeting Hsp27 and HK2 could be novel therapeutic strategy for treating esophageal cancer and warrants further investigation.",Mosaic abnormalities of the skin - review and guidelines from the European Reference Network for rare skin diseases (ERN-Skin).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920652,The British journal of dermatology,2019 03 28,"Cutaneous mosaicism is an area of Dermatology in which there has been an explosion of knowledge within the current decade.

It is a disease associated with significant morbidity, and is characterised in particular, by intractable pruritus for which treatments are often unsuccessful. Although used in clinical practice by dermatologists in the UK, the evidence base for phototherapy in this condition is not well documented. Case studies have reported on the clinical outcome of phototherapy in cholestatic pruritus which are summarised in this review. In addition, this review considers recent studies that provide insight into the pathophysiology of itch in PBC; these include the role of bile salts, autotaxin and specific receptors including G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor, Gpbar1 (TGR5) and the nuclear transcription factor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Through use of a focused search strategy using PubMed and subsequent literature review, we propose testable hypotheses for the mechanism of action of phototherapy in attenuating itch through modulation of these specific signalling pathways. Such studies could subsequently lead to increased mechanistic understanding, identification of novel therapeutic targets and the potential to refine phototherapy protocols, leading to improved control of itch and quality of life of PBC patients.

Experiments were conducted to evaluate the behavioral response of thrips and tarnished plant bug to Bt Cry51Aa2.834_16. Adult thrips avoided Bt Cry51Aa2.834_16 cotton in field choice tests and in separate field tests of Bt and non-Bt cotton not treated with insecticides. In a greenhouse choice test, approximately twice as many adult thrips and eggs were found on non-Bt compared with Bt Cry51Aa2.834_16 cotton. Similarly, in a field test of nontreated Bt Cry51Aa2.834_16 and non-Bt cotton, 68% of adult thrips collected were found on non-Bt cotton. In cotton that was not sprayed with insecticides, Bt Cry51Aa2.834_16 did not affect the distribution of tarnished plant bug within the canopy, although more square and flower injury was caused by tarnished plant bug in non-Bt cotton. Adult tarnished plant bug exhibited a nonpreference for diet containing lyophilized Bt Cry51Aa2.834_16 leaves and for excised Bt Cry51Aa2.834_16 squares in choice tests with non-Bt squares. The behavioral responses of these pests when exposed to this new Bt toxin will play a key role in the efficacy and potential resistance management strategies if this new technology is incorporated in an overall cotton insect pest management system."

Researchers are faced with a two-fold challenge: to recreate a naturalistic environment during an MRI scan and to produce paradigms that mimic real-life conditions involved with craving. Craving is a multifaceted psychological construct and techniques such as fMRI provide an alternative way to measure craving and to have a better understanding of its complexity. Most studies to date have implemented visual stimuli to measure craving and only a few studies have investigated gustation and olfaction. Moving forward, there needs to be greater attention on the ways in which we measure craving and the use of multisensory environments during fMRI. By going beyond examining subjective craving responses, and investigating neurobiological responses such as brain activity during fMRI, can potentially lead to better treatments for alcohol use disorder. Further, there needs to be additional consideration on standardizing how we measure craving, which will allow for a more unified approach amongst researchers.",Assessment of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET Accuracy in Localizing Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Single-Arm Clinical Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920593,JAMA oncology,2019 03 28,"In retrospective studies, 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging improves detection of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer compared with conventional imaging.",Association of Posttreatment Lymphopenia and Elevated Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio With Poor Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Human Papillomavirus-Negative Oropharyngeal Cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920592,JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,2019 06 13,Better biomarkers are needed for human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) to identify patients at risk of recurrence.

Kisspeptin-neurokinin B-dynorphin A (KNDy) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) have been suggested to govern tonic GnRH/gonadotropin release to control reproduction in male mammals. In this study, we report that chronic exposure to supraphysiological levels of estrogen during the neonatal period caused an irreversible suppression of KNDy genes in the ARC, resulting in reproductive dysfunction in male rats. Daily estradiol benzoate (EB) administration from days 0 to 10 postpartum caused smaller seminiferous tubules, abnormal spermatogenesis, and a decrease in plasma testosterone in adult male rats. The neonatal EB treatment profoundly suppressed LH pulse and ARC KNDy gene expression at adulthood, but it failed to affect the number of GnRH gene-expressing cells in male rats. The EB treatment failed to affect gene expression of other neuropeptides, such as GHRH, proopiomelanocortin, and agouti-related protein in the ARC, suggesting that ARC KNDy neurons would be a specific target of neonatal estrogen to cause male reproductive dysfunction. Because LH secretory responses to kisspeptin challenge and GnRH expression were spared in male rats with the EB treatment, LH pulse suppression is most probably due to ARC KNDy deficiency. Taken together, the current study indicates that chronic exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the developing brain causes a defect of ARC KNDy neurons, resulting in an inhibition of pulsatile GnRH/LH release and the failure of spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis.",Metabolism of 13C-Labeled Fatty Acids in Term Human Placental Explants by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920585,Endocrinology,2019 05 15,"Placental lipid transport and metabolism are poorly understood despite the importance for fetal development and lifelong health. We aimed to explore fatty acid (FA) processing in human villous placental explants from seven uncomplicated term singleton pregnancies delivered by elective cesarean section. Explants were treated with stable isotope-labeled palmitic acid (13C-PA), oleic acid (13C-OA), or docosahexaenoic acid (13C-DHA) for 3, 24, or 48 hours. Stable isotope-labeled lipids synthesized by placental explants from labeled FA were quantified, alongside endogenous unlabeled placental lipids, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Labeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and phosphatidylethanolamines were detected in explants, whereas labeled lysophosphatidylcholines were found in both explants and conditioned media. 13C-PA was primarily directed into PC synthesis (74% of 13C-PA-labeled lipids), whereas 13C-OA was directed almost equally into PC and TAG synthesis (45% and 53%, respectively, of 13C-OA-labeled lipids). 13C-DHA was only detectable in TAGs. TAGs demonstrated the highest isotopic enrichment for all 13C-FAs with 13C-OA-TAGs comprising >50% of total OA-TAGs (unlabeled and labeled), consistent with TAGs being a labile and accessible reservoir for FA storage. Variations in lipid incorporation were correlated to maternal glycemia and body mass index, suggesting that this experimental model could be used to investigate the effect of maternal factors on placental lipid metabolism. We conclude that lipid metabolic partitioning of freshly imported FAs into labile and less labile lipid reservoirs in placenta is FA dependent. This process may partly mediate the physiological preferential transplacental transfer of particular FAs to the fetus, but may also be implicated in the fetoplacental pathophysiology of maternal metabolic dysfunction.",Comparison of intra-procedural vs. post-stenting prolonged bivalirudin infusion for residual thrombus burden in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing: the MATRIX (Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by TRansradial Access Site and angioX) OCT study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920584,European heart journal cardiovascular Imaging,2019 03 28,To compare prolonged bivalirudin infusion vs. an intra-procedural only bivalirudin infusion administration in subjects with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) regarding residual stent strut thrombosis.,The liver-alpha cell axis and type 2 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920583,Endocrine reviews,2019 03 28,"Both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) strongly associate with increasing body mass index (BMI) and together these metabolic diseases affect millions of individuals. In patients with T2D, increased secretion of glucagon (hyperglucagonemia) contributes to the diabetic hyperglycemia as proven by the significant lowering of fasting plasma glucose levels following glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) administration. Emerging data now indicate that the elevated plasma concentrations of glucagon may also be associated with hepatic steatosis and not necessarily with the presence or absence of T2D. Thus, fatty liver disease, most often secondary to overeating, may result in impaired amino acid turnover, leading to increased plasma concentrations of certain glucagonotropic amino acids (e.g. alanine). This, in turn, causes increased glucagon secretion which may help to restore amino acid turnover and ureagenesis, but may eventually also led to increased hepatic glucose production, a hallmark of T2D. Early experimental findings support the hypothesis that hepatic steatosis impairs glucagon's actions on amino acid turnover and ureagenesis. Hepatic steatosis also impairs hepatic insulin sensitivity and clearance which, together with hyperglycemia and hyperaminoacidemia, lead to peripheral hyperinsulinemia; systemic hyperinsulinemia may itself contribute to worsen peripheral insulin resistance. In addition, obesity is accompanied by an impaired incretin effect, causing meal-related glucose intolerance. Lipid-induced impairment of hepatic sensitivity, not only to insulin but potentially also to glucagon, resulting in both hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia, may therefore contribute to the development of T2D at least in a subset of individuals with NAFLD."

The genomic organization of RiPP systems usually allows the expression of each biosynthetic enzyme as an individual unit, which is in stark contrast to the giant assembly lines found in non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide synthesis systems. Evidence is mounting however that the formation of multi-enzyme complexes is critical for efficient RiPPs biosynthesis and that these complexes may be involved in substrate channeling or conformational sampling. In some pathways, polyfunctional enzymes have evolved, which can be viewed as perpetual protein complexes. We summarize what is currently known on enzyme complexes in RiPP systems for lasso peptides, cyanobactins, linear azolic peptides, thiopeptides, and lanthipeptides.",Dual-binding pyridine and rhodamine B conjugate derivatives as fluorescent chemosensors for ferric ions in aqueous media and living cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920566,The Analyst,2019 04 23,"Two new pyridine-type rhodamine B chemosensors (RBPO and RBPF) used to detect Fe3+ have been designed and synthesized, and the sensing behavior towards various metal ions was evaluated via UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques.

Instead we present a full structural and geometrical study by using the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) combined with theoretical calculations that allow us to parameterize their coordinating properties and ability to coordinate to transition and non-transition metals. More importantly, we illustrate that upon coordination and formation of the five-membered chelate ring, these ligands are able to adapt themselves to the requirements of the different metals by changing the MN distances and NMN angles. Therefore, a redefinition of the preferences of these ligands to metals with large ionic radii is needed. Finally, we will present some facts about the participation of these ligands in inorganic-organic hybrids (IOHs) based on Keggin polyoxometalates (POMs).",Synthesis of a hydrogen-bridged tetraborane(6): a substituent effect of a diaminoboryl group toward the B-B multiple bond character.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920564,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 29,"A hydrogen-bridging tetraborane(6) was synthesized from boryllithium, a boron nucleophile, in three steps.

We present excitation-wavelength dependent (565-420 nm) transient absorption (TA) studies to probe the photophysics of cis-to-trans isomerization to identify sources of switching inefficiency. TA data reveals contributions from more than one switch conformer and relaxation cascades between multiple states. Fast (∼4 ps) and slow (∼40 ps) components of spectral dynamics observed at low excitation energies (>470 nm) are readily attributed to deactivation of two conformers; this assignment is supported by computed thermal populations and absorption strengths of two molecular geometries (PA and PB) characterized by roughly parallel dipoles for the thiophenes on opposite sides of the ethene bond. Only the PB conformer is found to contribute to triplet population and the switching of cis-4TCE: high-energy excitation (<470 nm) of PB involves direct excitation to S2, relaxation from which prepares an ISC-active S1 geometry (ISC QY 0.4-0.67, kISC ∼ 1.6-2.6 × 10-9 s-1) that is the gateway to triplet population and isomerization. We ascribe low cis-to-trans isomerization yield to excitation of the nonreactive PA conformer (75-85% loss) as well as loses along the PB S2 → S1 → T1 cascade (10-20% loss). In contrast, electrocyclization is inhibited by the electronic character of the excited states, as well as a non-existent thermal population of a reactive ""antiparallel"" ring conformation.",N-Methylation of ortho-substituted aromatic amines with methanol catalyzed by 2-arylbenzo[d]oxazole NHC-Ir(iii) complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920560,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 15,"Seven new chelated cyclometalated Ir complexes of ABON,P, ABON,O, and ABON,C(carbene) based on a rigid and tunable 2-arylbenzo[d]oxazole backbone have been prepared for the N-methylation of amines.

The steric-modified synthesis of ABON,C(carbene) complexes was described. The most active ABON,C(carbene) complex with marginal steric hindrance as a catalyst was obtained from the benzoxazole ring without a substituent and methyl group of the benzimidazole ring on the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. A variety of amines including para- and meta-substituted aromatic amines, as well as heterocyclic amines, were formulated as suitable substrates. Importantly, this catalyst considerably promoted the yield of the N-methylation of ortho-substituted aromatic amines. Controlled kinetic experiments and deuterium-labeling reactions of these ortho-substituted amines were conducted under optimized conditions.

We found that polymers follow different trajectories depending on their length, flow velocity and pillar array geometry, demonstrating that nanoDLD devices can be used as a continuous polymer fractionation tool. As a model system, we used double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with various contour lengths and demonstrated that dsDNA in the range of 100-10 000 base pairs (bp) can be separated with a size-selective resolution of 200 bp. In contrast to spherical colloids, a polymer elongates by shear flow and the angle of polymer trajectories with respect to the mean flow direction decreases as the mean flow velocity increases. We developed a phenomenological model that explains the qualitative dependence of the polymer trajectories on the gap size and on the flow velocity. Using this model, we found the optimal separation conditions for dsDNA of different sizes and demonstrated the separation and extraction of dsDNA fragments with over 75% recovery and 3-fold concentration. Importantly, this velocity dependence provides a means of fine-tuning the separation efficiency and resolution, independent of the nanoDLD pillar geometry.",Strategies to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2: 3D nanostructuring and heterostructuring with graphitic carbon nanomaterials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920558,Nanoscale,2019 04 11,"TiO2-based photocatalysis has been considered to be one of the most promising avenues for environmental remediation including water purification. However, several technical issues such as the limited surface area of bulk TiO2, the large band gap of TiO2, and rapid charge recombination still limit the practical application of TiO2 photocatalysts. Therefore, here we focus on two structural design strategies: (i) monolithic three-dimensional (3D) nanostructuring, and (ii) heterostructuring with graphitic carbon nanomaterials. A monolithic 3D nanostructure enables maximal surface area in a given volume and efficient reuse of the photocatalyst without recollection. Heterostructuring with carbon nanomaterials helps achieve maximal utilization of the solar spectrum and charge separation and provides efficient TiO2 photocatalysts. In this review, recent progress on TiO2 photocatalysts toward the abovementioned strategies will be summarized. Further discussion and direction will provide insights into the rational design of highly efficient TiO2 photocatalysts, and help develop advanced photocatalyst models.",Simplified Drop-seq workflow with minimized bead loss using a bead capture and processing microfluidic chip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920557,Lab on a chip,2019 05 03,"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biomedical research by enabling the in-depth analysis of cell-to-cell heterogeneity of tissues with unprecedented resolution.

Among several existing droplet-based approaches, the Drop-seq platform has emerged as one of the most widely used systems. Yet, this has surprisingly not incentivized major refinements of the method, thus restricting any lab implementation to the original Drop-seq setup, which is known to suffer from up to 80% bead loss during the process. In this study, we present a systematic re-engineering and optimization of Drop-seq: first, we re-designed the original dropleting device to be compatible with both air-pressure systems and syringe pumps, thus increasing the overall flexibility of the platform. Second, we devised an accompanying chip for post-encapsulation bead processing, which simplifies and massively increases Drop-seq's cell processing efficiency. Taken together, the presented optimization efforts result in a more flexible and efficient Drop-seq version."

The aims of this study were to examine the views of acute care nurses caring for patients during transition to comfort care, to describe the personal impact on nurses, and to identify nurses' strategies for self-support and development of competence. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, we analyzed data from 26 semistructured interviews. Nurses experienced moral distress in situations of continuing treatment when a cure was unlikely. In managing symptoms for patients, they struggled to foster an often-tenuous balance of patient comfort and calm without oversedation.

Response rates were 73%, 26.7%, and 18.8%, respectively. All content areas were reported as being taught by at least 1 faculty member per institution. Lecture was the primary pedagogy to teach all End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium Undergraduate content areas, followed by clinical conference/debriefing and simulation. Content was primarily taught in Critical Care, Maternity, Adult Health, Gerontology, and Fundamentals courses. The disparate response rates suggest that survey dissemination may prove ineffective for multisite curricula evaluation.

During his symptoms' remission, his wife started developing the same OCD symptoms. She was prescribed escitalopram, but, given her inconsistent compliance, it was difficult to obtain full effectiveness of the pharmacological treatment. The case showed several common features with S-OCD. Obsessions and delusions could be considered as extremes of the same spectrum-an option recognized by the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition within the ""OCD with poor insight"" category-and S-OCD could represent the continuum between OCD and psychotic conditions.

The extent of NCI risk, particularly HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) risk, was investigated in 200 microbiologically confirmed inpatients with MDR-TB at a TB-specialist hospital in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Within this population, the prevalence of HIV coinfection, major depressive episode, and substance use disorder was 89.50%, 10.50%, and 7.00%, respectively. After excluding individuals with major depressive episode/substance use disorder and monoinfection (i.e., MDR-TB without HIV), the prevalence of HAND risk was 43.5%. Older and low-income individuals had significantly greater odds of HAND risk, whereas those with family members/relatives who work(ed) in the health services had lower odds.

Two controversies in the treatment of depression are related to the issue of severity. First, are antidepressants only effective for severely depressed patients? Second, should the severity of depression be used as the basis for recommending medication or psychotherapy as first-line treatment? More specifically, should patients with severe depression preferentially be treated with medication? A related question is whether psychotherapy is beneficial for severely depressed patients. Some controversial articles sparked coverage in the popular press related to these questions and stimulated subsequent research on the impact of depression severity on treatment efficacy. The results of three recent large pooled analyses of patient level data indicate that the efficacy of antidepressants is not limited to the narrow band of patients who score highest on symptom severity scales. A meta-analysis of 132 controlled psychotherapy studies of more than 10,000 patients found that greater mean baseline symptom severity did not predict poorer response. A pooled analysis of individual patient data from 16 studies comparing antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy found that severity was not associated with differential treatment outcome. These results are discussed in the context of recommendations in official treatment guidelines.",Systems Perspective for Incivility in Academia: An Integrative Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920476,Nursing education perspectives,2019 04 22,The purpose of this integrative review was to identify evidence of systems thinking on civility in academic settings.

According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 50 million people are living with dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to triple to 150 million by 2050. Dementia initially affects the brain, eventually affecting the entire body culminating in death, commonly from the complications and comorbidities. People with dementia often experience eating difficulties in addition to a severe decline in cognitive, verbal, and functional abilities secondary to gradual neurodegenerative process, leading to weight loss, malnutrition, and dehydration. When eating difficulties and weight loss occur, health care providers and families often feel obligated to decide to either continue the oral feeding or opt for feeding tube placement. Primary care clinicians, both nurse practitioners and physicians, are presented with challenges when facilitating the decision regarding the feeding options in patients with advanced dementia. This narrative review aims at evaluating the impact of enteral nutrition versus oral feeding by comparing the rates of survival and adverse events in older adults with advanced dementia.

Motor coordination and learning were measured by the sticker removal task and the accelerating rotarod. Western blots were conducted on cerebellar tissue samples. We demonstrated that neuron subset-specific deletion of PTEN in mice led to deficits in motor coordination. These changes were accompanied by alterations in many different proteins, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, FMRP, glutamate receptors, and neuronal migration markers. These data firstly support a role for hyperactivation of mTOR in the cerebellum following the loss of PTEN, accompanied by behavioral deficits. Moreover, the results of the current study support a broader role for PTEN signaling in early neuronal migration and organization of the cerebellum, and point to a putative role for PTEN in many neuropsychiatric conditions.",Localization of chloride co-transporters in striatal neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920433,Neuroreport,2019 05 24,"The ionic driving force for the chloride-permeable GABAA receptor is subject to spatial control and distribution of chloride transporters. NKCC1 and KCC2 are mostly expressed in neurons in a specific manner. In the striatum, the localization of these transporters in identified neurons is unknown. In this study, the expression of these transporters was found to be different between projection neurons and interneurons. NKCC1 immunoreactivity was observed in the soma of adult BAC-D1-eGFP+ and D2-eGFP+ striatal projection neurons (SPNs). KCC2 was not expressed in either projection neuron and immunoreactivity to this transporter was observed only in the neuropile. However, NKCC1 and KCC2 co-transporters were not localized in intracellular biocytin-injected dendrites of SPNs of the direct or indirect pathways (D1-SPNs and D2-SPNs). Experiments with PV Cre transgenic mice transfected with Cre-dependent adeno-associated viruses containing tdTomato in the striatum showed a cell-type-specific distribution of KCC2 chloride transporter co-expression associated with PV interneurons. Thus, depolarizing actions of GABA responses in adult projection neurons can be explained by the expression and somatic localization of the NKCC1 transporters. A somato/dendritic distribution of KCC2 expression was observed only in striatal interneurons and corresponds to the hyperpolarizing action of GABA recorded in these cells. This correlates the different roles for GABA actions in striatal neuronal excitability with the expression of specific chloride transporters.",Teamwork Among Medicine House Staff During Work Rounds: Development of a Direct Observation Tool.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920432,Journal of patient safety,2019 03 28,"Teamwork is integral to effective health care but difficult to evaluate.

We recorded intracellularly from L4 dorsal root ganglion neurons characterized as low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) or high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) in female rats 1 week after L5 partial spinal nerve injury or sham control (n = 24 rats/group) before, during, and after ganglionic perfusion with oxytocin, 1 nM. Nerve injury desensitized and hyperpolarized LTMRs (membrane potential [Em] was -63 ± 1.8 mV in sham vs -76 ± 1.4 mV in nerve injury; P < 0.001), and sensitized HTMRs without affecting Em. In nerve-injured rats, oxytocin depolarized LTMRs towards normal (Em = -69 ± 1.9 mV) and, in 6 of 21 neurons, resulted in spontaneous action potentials. By contrast, oxytocin hyperpolarized HTMRs (Em = -68 ± 2.7 mV before vs -80 ± 3.2 mV during oxytocin exposure; P < 0.01). These effects were reversed after removal of oxytocin, and oxytocin had minimal effects in neurons from sham surgery animals. Sensory afferent neurons immunopositive for the vasopressin 1a receptor were larger (34 ± 6.3 μm, range 16-57 μm) than immunonegative neurons (26 ± 3.4 μm, range 15-43 μm; P < 0.005). These data replicate findings that neuropathic injury desensitizes LTMRs while sensitizing HTMRs and show rapid and divergent oxytocin effects on these afferent subtypes towards normal, potentially rebalancing input to the central nervous system. Vasopressin 1a receptors are present on medium to large diameter afferent neurons and could represent oxytocin's target."

In a temporal and βAR isoform-dependent manner, chronic β-blocker infusion increased splenic vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression and leukocyte accumulation (monocytes/macrophages, mast cells and neutrophils) and decreased chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expression, migration of bone marrow cells (BMC) and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL), as well as infiltration into the heart following acute cardiac injury. Further, CCR2 expression and migratory responsiveness was significantly reduced in the PBL of patients receiving β-blocker therapy compared to β-blocker-naïve patients.

It grew optimally at 28-33 °C and pH 6.5-7.0. Strain DHOA04T contained Q-8 as the major respiratory quinone. Its main fatty acids were C16 : 0, C17 : 0cyclo, summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c) and summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c). The DNA G+C content of DHOA04T was 63.0 mol%, which is in the range of the genus Paraburkholderia.

Phylogenetic analysis of genomic data can provide a powerful platform to identify lineages within bacterial populations, and thus inform outbreak investigation and transmission dynamics. However, resolving differences between pathogens associated with low-variant (LV) populations carrying low median pairwise single nucleotide variant (SNV) distances remains a major challenge. Here we present rPinecone, an R package designed to define sub-lineages within closely related LV populations. rPinecone uses a root-to-tip directional approach to define sub-lineages within a phylogenetic tree according to SNV distance from the ancestral node. The utility of this software was demonstrated using both simulated outbreaks and real genomic data of two LV populations: a hospital outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and endemic Salmonella Typhi from rural Cambodia. rPinecone identified the transmission branches of the hospital outbreak and geographically confined lineages in Cambodia. Sub-lineages identified by rPinecone in both analyses were phylogenetically robust. It is anticipated that rPinecone can be used to discriminate between lineages of bacteria from LV populations where other methods fail, enabling a deeper understanding of infectious disease epidemiology for public health purposes.",Genomic and transcriptomic characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa small colony variants derived from a chronic infection model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920365,Microbial genomics,2019 05 21,"Phenotypic change is a hallmark of bacterial adaptation during chronic infection. In the case of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, well-characterized phenotypic variants include mucoid and small colony variants (SCVs). It has previously been shown that SCVs can be reproducibly isolated from the murine lung following the establishment of chronic infection with mucoid P. aeruginosa strain NH57388A. Using a combination of single-molecule real-time (PacBio) and Illumina sequencing we identify a large genomic inversion in the SCV through recombination between homologous regions of two rRNA operons and an associated truncation of one of the 16S rRNA genes and suggest this may be the genetic switch for conversion to the SCV phenotype. This phenotypic conversion is associated with large-scale transcriptional changes distributed throughout the genome. This global rewiring of the cellular transcriptomic output results in changes to normally differentially regulated genes that modulate resistance to oxidative stress, central metabolism and virulence. These changes are of clinical relevance because the appearance of SCVs during chronic infection is associated with declining lung function.",Lactobacillus homohiochii is a later heterotypic synonym of Lactobacillus fructivorans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920364,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2019 06 13,"The taxonomic relationship of Lactobacillus fructivorans and Lactobacillus homohiochii was re-evaluated.

However, radial contracting deformation has been overlooked, another typical deformation in nature, such as the constrictive deformation in the human esophagus and bladder. We present a novel soft ring-shaped actuator that generates radial contraction and examine its quasi-static performance under pressurization. This actuator consists of a soft ring-shaped body and a rigid casing. A single circular air chamber embedded concentrically inside the actuator is created through the lost-wax method. A theoretical model of the quasi-static state of the actuator's contracting deformation was formulated in light of the minimum total potential energy principle. Meanwhile, a finite-element method (FEM) model was constructed to stimulate the radial contraction of the actuator. In addition, experiments were conducted to identify the maximum input pressure and measure the deformations at the specific input pressure. When the actuators were pressurized under 20.0 kPa, axisymmetric contractions were achieved. The theoretical model and FEM models produced the predictions in good agreement with experimental results, with slight mean relative differences regarding peak points, 3.4% and 5.4%, respectively. In addition, pilot tests suggest that the ring-shaped actuator can achieve the key tasks of robotic manipulators, such as gripping and holding."

Plant exudates are essential in the dialogue between microbes and their host plant and in particular amino acids can play an important role in the chemotactic response of bacteria. Histidine, arginine, and aspartate which are the three most abundant amino acids present in S. rostrata seed exudates behave as chemoattractants towards A. caulinodans. A PSI-BLAST analysis of the MCP (chemoreceptors) in the genome of A. caulinodans was performed. Among the 43 MCP homologs, two MCPs harboring a dCache domain were selected as possible cognate amino acid MCPs. After analysis of gene relative expression levels and construction of a gene deleted mutant strain, one of them, AZC_0821 designed as TlpH, was confirmed to be responsible for the chemotactic response to the three amino acids. In addition, it was found that these three amino acids can also influence chemotaxis of A. caulinodans independently of the chemosensory receptors, by being involved in the increase of the expression level of several che and fla genes involved in the chemotaxis pathway and flagella synthesis. Thus, the contribution of amino acids present in seed exudates is directly related to the role as chemoattractants and indirectly related to the role in the regulation of expression of key genes involved in chemotaxis and motility.

This study aims to study the effect of quercetin on visceral pain and 5-HT availability in postinflammatory IBS (PI-IBS) rats. PI-IBS model rats were administered quercetin by gavage at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg for 14 days. Compared with normal rats, the visceral pain threshold of PI-IBS rats was markedly decreased and the abdominal motor response to colon distension was markedly increased. The EC cell count and 5-HT level, as well as tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) protein, were all significantly elevated in PI-IBS rats, while the 5-HT reuptake transporter (serotonin transporter) was reduced. Genes that are responsible for enteroendocrine cell differentiation, that is, Ngn3 and pdx1, were significantly increased in the PI-IBS group. Quercetin treatment markedly elevated the pain threshold pressure and decreased the visceral motor response of PI-IBS animals; and EC cell density and 5-HT level, as well as TPH expression, in the PI-IBS group were all reduced by quercetin. Quercetin treatment also significantly reduced colonic expression of Ngn3 and pdx1 of PI-IBS. Findings from the present study indicated that the analgesic effect of quercetin on PI-IBS may result from reduction of 5-HT availability in the colon, and the regulatory role of quercetin in endocrine progenitors may contribute to reduced EC cells.",Interventions and observations associated with survival of orphaned shelter kittens undergoing treatment for diarrhea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920335,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2019 03 28,The objective of this study was to identify significant associations between treatment interventions and survival of orphan shelter kittens with diarrhea.,Representation of Women Physician Deans in U.S. Medical Schools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920332,Journal of women's health (2002),2019 05 17,"
Background:
 Among U.S. medical school deans, there is a wide gender gap, most prominent at the highest levels. We aimed to discover how well women physicians were represented within the pool of women deans compared with the pool of men deans. 
Materials and Methods:
 A cross-sectional study was performed on 149 allopathic medical schools in the United States. For each school, information was collected on deans' names, titles, genders, and degree(s). Chi-square analyses were performed to determine association between gender and dean ranks. 
Results:
 Of the 2559 deans included from 149 medical schools, 1649 (64.4%) were physicians, and of these, women physicians accounted for 634 (38.4%), a significant under-representation (p < 0.00001). In comparison, the 626 nonphysician doctorate-holders of which women accounted for 291 (46.5%, p = 0.061) were equally represented. Of the 284 deans with bachelor's or master's degrees, women accounted for 180 (63.4%), a significant over-representation (p < 0.00001). This difference was most profound at the lower tier (assistant) dean level. A lower tier physician dean was 1.25 times more likely to be a man than a woman, and a higher tier (dean of medical school, senior associate, vice, or associate) physician dean was 1.16 times more likely to be a man. 
Conclusions:
 Women physicians were under-represented among medical school deans compared with men. This disparity held among lower tier and higher tier deans."

Although several authors claim that decreases in the amplitude of the PPG wave should be addressed from signal acquisition and conditioning stages such decreases can also be associated with changes in the patient condition. In that instance, it is important to ensure continuous and reliable HR monitoring which, in turn, depends on how robust is the peak detection method. Numerous efforts have been made to develop algorithms for accurate PPG peak detection under high motion artefact conditions. However, little has been done regarding peak detection in low-amplitude PPG signals. In an attempt to address this issue, a novel and simple peak detection algorithm for PPG signals was proposed. Results show that our method could be a good contribution for robust strategies that can dynamically adapt their peak detection method to circumstances in which a decrease in the amplitude of the PPG signal is expected. Still, more extensive testing under a wide range of conditions (e.g. intensive physical exercise) is needed to perform a rigorous validation.",Postpartum hormonal contraception use and incidence of postpartum depression: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920314,The European journal of contraception & reproductive health care : the official journal of the European Society of Contraception,2019 06 10,To evaluate the association between postpartum hormonal contraceptive use and postpartum depression.,How can we develop better antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920313,Expert opinion on drug discovery,2019 05 02,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Antispasmodics are a heterogeneous group of drugs that tackle IBS-associated altered bowel habit and abdominal pain. However, some studies have shown their failure to exhibit benefit over placebo. Considering the place of antispasmodics in managing key symptoms of IBS, there is a growing need for developing more efficacious and safe antispasmodics. Areas covered: The authors discuss the role of rational drug design (RDD) in developing new antispasmodics with desired features. Furthermore, they review the potential pharmacological targets and herbal medicines with spasmolytic activity. In addition, the authors present the recent findings concerning novel mechanisms involved in GI motility modulation as well as the potential antispasmodic role of drugs used in other conditions. Expert opinion: To develop better antispasmodics, it will be essential to gain a deeper insight into the underlying mechanisms involved in IBS-induced dysmotility and to uncover GI-specific receptors that regulating motility. New antispasmodics with GI-restricted and the multi-targeting features can be developed via implementation of RDD. Furthermore, the modification of current antispasmodics by formulation technologies might expedite the development of better antispasmodics. To conclude, the complex nature of IBS means that future successful drug discovery will require a multi-disciplinary approach.",DNA barcoding detects floral origin of Indian honey samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920312,Genome,2019 05 21,"The unique medicinal and nutritional properties of honey are determined by its chemical composition. To evaluate the quality of honey, it is essential to study the surrounding vegetation where honeybees forage. In this study we used conventional melissopalynological and DNA barcoding techniques to determine the floral source of honey samples collected from different districts of the state of Mizoram, India. Pollen grains were isolated and genomic DNA was extracted from the honey samples. PCR amplification was carried out using universal barcode candidates ITS2 and rbcL to identify the plant species. Furthermore, TA cloning was carried out to screen the PCR amplicon libraries to identify the presence of multiple plant species. Results from both the melissopalynological and DNA barcoding analyses identified almost exactly the same 22 species, suggesting that both methods are suitable for analysis. However, DNA barcoding is easier and widely practiced. Hence, it can be concluded that DNA barcoding is a useful tool in determining the medicinal and commercial value of honey.",Comparative effectiveness of pan-genotypic therapies for the treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus infection in Bulgaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920311,Journal of comparative effectiveness research,2019 05 10,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the family of Flaviviridae, predominantly infecting liver hepatocytes. HCV infection is a major cause for morbidity worldwide. Aim: The primary objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of pan-genotypic therapies for the treatment of patients with HCV infection in Bulgaria. Materials & methods: The databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov were searched to identify studies evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for the treatment of HCV patients. Results: The range of sustained virologic response rates among all genotypes achieved after therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir was 92-100% (8-week therapy) in treatment-naive patients and 99-100% (12-week therapy) in experienced patients. The range of sustained virologic response rates with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was 91-100% (12-week therapy) and 97-100% (12-week therapy) with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

Forensic examination at the time of discovery indicated fairly remarkable presence of bodily constituents at the anatomical, histological, and molecular levels. The cadaver was preserved in a formalin-based fixative afterward, and maintained in the Hunan Museum. To better protect this rare human corpse, a reappraisal of the status of preservation was carried out using noninvasive approaches, including X-ray radiography, gross anatomical examination, and histological, microbiological, and molecular analyses of sampled tissues. The cadaver remained essentially intact from a gross anatomical perspective, with radiography of the skeletal system and arterial contrast filling appeared comparable with the original documentation. The light microscopic features of the skin, cartilage, and skeletal muscle remained detectable, as were the stratified ultrastructure of the collagen and muscle fibers. The levels of nitrogen and amino acidic elements appeared elevated in the cadaver and liver preservation fixatives, with a higher calcium and phosphate concentration in the former. These findings suggest that there existed a certain degree of macromolecule degradation and bone decalcification in the cadaver, likely irrelevant to biological decomposition. The reappraisal also led to the implementation of stronger scientific measures to better protect the cadaver through a renovated Museum-University coadministrative management agreement.",Differential action of TGR5 agonists on GLP-2 secretion and promotion of intestinal adaptation in a piglet short bowel model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920308,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 05 15,"Enteroendocrine L cells and glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) secretion are activated in the intestinal adaptation process following bowel resection in patients with short bowel syndrome. We hypothesized that enteral activation of Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), expressed in enteroendocrine L cells, could augment endogenous GLP-2 secretion and the intestinal adaptation response. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of different TGR5 agonists to stimulate GLP-2 secretion and intestinal adaptation in a piglet short-bowel model. In study 1, parenterally fed neonatal pigs (n = 6/group) were gavaged with vehicle, olive extract (OE; 10 or 50 mg/kg), or ursolic acid (UA; 10 mg/kg), and plasma GLP-2 was measured for 6 h. In study 2, neonatal pigs (n = 6-8/group) were subjected to transection or 80% mid-small intestine resection and, after 2 days, assigned to treatments for 10 days as follows: 1) transection + vehicle (sham), 2) resection + vehicle (SBS), 3) resection + 30 mg UA (SBS + UA), and 4) resection + 180 mg/kg OE (SBS + OE). We measured plasma GLP-2, intestinal histology, cell proliferation, and gene expression, as well as whole body citrulline-arginine kinetics and bile acid profiles. In study 1, GLP-2 secretion was increased by UA and tended to be increased by OE. In study 2, SBS alone, but not additional treatment with either TGR5 agonist, resulted in increased mucosal thickness and crypt cell proliferation in remnant jejunum and ileum sections. SBS increased biliary and ileal concentration of bile acids and expression of inflammatory and farnesoid X receptor target genes, but these measures were suppressed by UA treatment. In conclusion, UA is an effective oral GLP-2 secretagogue in parenterally fed pigs but is not capable of augmenting GLP-2 secretion or the intestinal adaptation response after massive small bowel resection. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Therapeutic activation of endogenous glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) secretion is a promising strategy to improve intestinal adaptation in patients with short bowel syndrome. This study in neonatal pigs showed that oral supplementation with a selective Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) agonist is an effective approach to increase GLP-2 secretion. The results warrant further study to establish a more potent oral TGR5 agonist that can effectively improve intestinal adaptation in pediatric patients with SBS.",FXR agonist GW4064 improves the liver and intestinal pathology and alters bile acid metabolism in rats undergoing small intestinal resection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920307,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 03 28,"Mortality associated with liver disease was observed in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS); however, its mechanism remains unclear. Bile acid (BA) dysmetabolism may be one of the putative mechanisms, and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is the key regulator of BA synthesis. Here, we showed that in a rat model of small bowel resection associated with liver disease (SBR-ALD), BA composition of hepatic tissues reflected a larger proportion of primary and secondary unconjugated BAs, and those of colon contents and serum showed an increased ratio of secondary unconjugated BAs. Both hepatic and intestinal regulation of BA synthesis was characterized by a blunted hepatic FXR activation response. Gene expression of the key enzymes in BA synthesis was activated. After intervention with FXR agonist GW4064, both liver histology and serum transaminase activity were improved, which demonstrated the attenuation of SBR-ALD. BA compositions of hepatic tissue, colon contents, and serum were recovered and were closer to those of the sham group. Expression levels of hepatic FXR and its target genes were activated. The study showed that FXR agonist GW4064 could balance BA dysmetabolism to alleviate hepatotoxicity in SBR animals. GW4064 intervention resulted in a decrease in fecal bile excretion and elevated plasma/hepatic conjugated BA levels. GW4064 increased the reabsorption of conjugated BAs by inducing ASBT expression in the ileum. Concomitantly, FXR activation in the presence of GW4064 decreased BA production by repressing the expression of key synthetases. These findings provide a clinical research direction for the prevention of SBS with liver disease.",Electroacupuncture via chronically implanted electrodes improves gastrointestinal motility by balancing sympathovagal activities in a rat model of constipation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920306,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 06 07,"Electroacupuncture (EA) has been reported for treating constipation in clinical studies. However, little is known of the possible mechanisms involved in the prokinetic effect of EA. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects and underlying autonomic mechanisms of EA via chronically implanted electrodes for constipation in rat induced by Loperamide (Lop). Lop was given to regular rats to induce constipation. EA was performed via a pair of electrodes chronically implanted at bilateral acupoint ST-36. Feces characteristics, gastric emptying, small intestinal transit, distal colon transit time (dCTT), and whole gut transit time (WGTT) were measured in various sessions with EA or sham EA in rats with constipation induced by Lop. Heart rate variability (HRV) derived from the electrocardiogram was analyzed to evaluate autonomic functions. The number of fecal pellets was reduced by 27% with Lop (P < 0.01) and normalized by 7-day EA. Similar results were also observed in pellet weight. In normal rats compared with sham EA, EA shortened dCTT by 74% (P < 0.05 vs. sham EA), increased small intestinal transit by 28% (P < 0.01) and gastric emptying by 27% (P < 0.05), and accelerated whole gut transit by 14% (P < 0.05). In Lop-treated rats, the dCTT and WGTT were prolonged by Lop and normalized by EA. Lop significantly decreased vagal activity and increased sympathetic nerve activity; however, EA reversed these effects. EA at ST-36 via chronically implanted electrodes improves Lop-induced constipation by enhancing GI motility via the autonomic mechanisms. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The findings of the present study suggest that the proposed electroacupuncture (EA) may have great therapeutic potential for treating patients with opioid-induced constipation. It was demonstrated that EA at ST-36 improved transit of every organ along the gut mediated via the autonomic mechanisms in normal rats and rats with Lop-induced constipation. It is advised to administrate EA daily instead of two or three times weekly as reported in most of the clinical studies.",Chinese Herbal Medicine for Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Montreal Cognitive Assessment: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920303,"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",2019 06 06,"
Background:
 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) prevalence is estimated at 6%-12% of the population. It is possible that early treatment at the MCI stage could reduce progression to more severe cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a sensitive measure used to assess changes in cognitive function. Various Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) have been tested for effects on MCI using MoCA. 
Objectives:
 To evaluate the clinical evidence for CHMs on MoCA scores in MCI. 
Design:
 Five biomedical databases in English and Chinese language were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared orally administered CHMs with a control group and assessed changes in cognition using MoCA. Analyses were based on the comparison, control intervention, and study duration. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to evaluate treatment effects. For each study, risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane tool. 
Results:
 Nineteen studies were included with 16 contributing to the data analyses. Three studies were placebo controlled. Nine compared a CHM with a pharmacotherapy, three combined a CHM with a pharmacotherapy, and one combined CHM with cognitive training. In the two placebo-controlled studies of 24-week duration, results favored the CHMs at end of treatment. 
Conclusions:
 The systematic review suggests that the oral application of certain CHMs improved scores on MoCA by 1.76-2.34 points compared with placebo in people with MCI after 24 weeks of treatment. However, these two studies used different CHM formulations. Two studies that tested the same CHM formulation, Bu Yang Huan Wu Tang, in combination with donepezil, reported improvement in the integrative groups, but the studies were not blind and the durations were only 8-12 weeks. Overall, methodological weaknesses limited the strength of the evidence. The herbal formulae included ingredients that have received considerable research attention for their effects on memory and cognition.

On the basis of the overview of the presented arguments, the most commonly proposed recommendations were that there should be: (a) a general definition of work addiction, (b) the need for more transdisciplinary and integrative approach to research, and (c) propositions regarding more high-quality research. These three aspects are summarized in the present paper. There is a general agreement among work addiction researchers that work addiction is a problematic behavior that merits more systematic studies, which require input and expertise from a wide range of fields due to its complex nature.",Intrapancreatic fat deposition and visceral fat volume are associated with the presence of diabetes after acute pancreatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920289,American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology,2019 06 07,"Ectopic fat and abdominal adiposity phenotypes have never been studied holistically in individuals after acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of the study was to investigate phenotypical differences in ectopic fat and abdominal fat between individuals after AP (with and without diabetes) and to determine the role of pancreatitis-related factors. Eighty-four individuals were studied cross-sectionally after a median of 21.5 mo since last episode of AP and were categorized into ""diabetes"" and ""no diabetes"" groups. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were also recruited. With the use of magnetic resonance imaging, intrapancreatic fat percentage, liver fat percentage, visceral fat volume (VFV), subcutaneous fat volume, and visceral-to-subcutaneous (V/S) fat volume ratio were quantified. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in these phenotypes between the groups. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the association between pancreatitis-related factors and the studied phenotypes. Intrapancreatic fat percentage was significantly higher in the diabetes group (10.2 ± 1.2%) compared with the no diabetes (9.2 ± 1.7%) and healthy volunteers (7.9 ± 1.9%) groups (P < 0.001). VFV was significantly higher in the diabetes (2,715.3 ±1,077.6 cm3) compared with no diabetes (1,983.2 ± 1,092.4 cm3) and healthy volunteer (1,126.2 ± 740.4 cm3) groups (P < 0.001). V/S fat volume ratio was significantly higher in the diabetes (0.97 ± 0.27) compared with no diabetes (0.68 ± 0.42) and healthy volunteer (0.52 ± 0.34) groups (P = 0.001). Biliary AP was associated with significantly higher intrapancreatic fat percentage (β = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.01, 1.33; P = 0.047). C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization for AP were associated with significantly higher VFV (β = 3.32; 95% CI, 1.68, 4.96; P < 0.001). In conclusion, individuals with diabetes after AP have higher intrapancreatic fat percentage, VFV, and V/S fat volume ratio. Levels of C-reactive protein during AP are significantly associated with VFV, whereas biliary AP is significantly associated with intrapancreatic fat percentage. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Individuals with diabetes after acute pancreatitis have significantly higher intrapancreatic fat percentage and visceral fat volume compared with individuals without diabetes after acute pancreatitis and healthy controls.

Learning, memory, and cognition",2019 03 28,"The majority of research on metamemory focuses on retrospective memory: memory for past events. Prospective memory, in contrast, refers to the process of remembering to carry out intentions in the future. Despite claims that metacognition is essential to prospective remembering, it is unclear whether the metamemorial effects that researchers have observed in studies of retrospective memory extend to prospective memory. In the present study, we tested whether the underconfidence with practice (UWP) effect, the finding that in multitrial learning situations, participants become relatively underconfident following retrieval practice, would generalize to a prospective memory paradigm. Participants memorized target-response word pairs and were told that during an upcoming lexical-decision task (the ongoing task), the targets would appear and, should they recognize any of these targets, they were to notify the experimenter and attempt to recall the associated response. Participants then predicted their ability to recognize each target and recall each response. Participants predicted their memory and completed the ongoing task three times. In Experiment 1, we observed preliminary evidence for UWP for the prospective component (recognizing the targets) but no UWP for the retrospective component (recalling the responses). However, after changing the way JOLs were elicited to be more consistent with past studies of UWP (i.e., cueing them with the target instead of the target-response word pair), we observed UWP for both prospective and retrospective memory in Experiments 2 and 3. The present results suggest that, as with retrospective memory, participants become relatively underconfident in their prospective memory following practice.

Human perception and performance,2019 03 28,"This article reports the results of an eye-movement experiment which manipulated the frequency and parafoveal preview (i.e., nonword, transposed-character, or identical) of 2-character Chinese target words using a gaze-contingent boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975). The key findings were that progressive saccades were longer into high- than low-frequency target words, and that this word-frequency effect was more pronounced for identical than transposed previews. These findings suggest that Chinese readers adjust their saccade lengths in response to variables that influence the rate of parafoveal lexical processing. To examine the feasibility of this hypothesis, 2 computer simulations were completed that pitted this dynamic-adjustment account (Liu, Huang, Gao, & Reichle, 2017) against an account in which readers simply move their eyes to a small number of default saccade targets (e.g., the beginning or center of the upcoming word; Yan, Kliegl, Richter, Nuthmann, & Shu, 2010). The simulation results show that the dynamic-adjustment hypothesis more accurately describes our experimental findings using fewer parameters. The theoretical implications of the dynamic-adjustment account of saccadic targeting are discussed relevant to both models of eye-movement control in reading and modes of Chinese word identification.

Human perception and performance,2019 03 28,"Visual search through natural scenes can be guided by knowledge of where a target object has been observed previously (episodic guidance) and knowledge of that object's visual properties (template guidance). In the present experiments, we compared the relative contributions of these two sources of guidance. Episodic guidance was implemented in a contextual cuing task: participants searched multiple times through a set of scenes for a target letter that appeared in a consistent location within each scene. Template guidance was implemented by the color match between a critical distractor in each scene and a secondary visual working memory (VWM) load. There were four main findings. First, search time decreased with increasing scene repetition; episodic memory guided search. Second, the critical distractor was fixated more frequently on match compared with mismatch trials, consistent with automatic template guidance. Third, the VWM-match effect persisted in blocks with strong episodic guidance. Finally, VWM-match effects were observed from the first saccade during search, whereas episodic guidance to the target developed only later in the trial. The results support a view of natural search in which template-based mechanisms operate early during search in a manner that is not strongly constrained by scene-based forms of guidance, such as episodic knowledge.

Human perception and performance,2019 03 28,"Sensory representations are constantly realigned. For instance, in the ventriloquism aftereffect, short exposure to audiovisual stimuli with a consistent spatial disparity results in an adjustment of auditory spatial representations. Here we tested whether repeated audiovisual training over several sessions enhances recalibration in the ventriloquism aftereffect. One group of participants (n = 16) received incremental training in which the presented degree of audiovisual spatial disparity increased over the course of 3 days, whereas a second group (n = 16) was constantly exposed to the largest disparity during all three sessions (constant training). Within each session, a significant ventriloquism aftereffect was observed in both groups. However, the size of the final ventriloquism aftereffect was larger in the constant group, due to an increase over days that was not evident in the incremental group. These findings replicated results obtained in two prestudies that either used a smaller sample size or included constant training only. Taken together, our findings provide strong evidence that recalibration effects are retained and consolidated between sessions, contrary to the intuitive assumption that natural audiovisual stimulation outside the laboratory would immediately overwrite recalibration. Repeated training seems to be particularly effective for consistent changes in cross-modal stimulation.

For example, a GPS for years of education (EduYears) explains substantial variance in cognitive traits such as general cognitive ability and educational achievement. Personality traits are also known to contribute to individual differences in educational achievement. However, the association between EduYears GPS and personality traits remains largely unexplored. Here, we test the relation between GPS for EduYears, neuroticism, and well-being, and 6 personality and motivation domains: Academic Motivation, Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, and Agreeableness. The sample was drawn from a U.K.-representative sample of up to 8,322 individuals assessed at age 16. We find that EduYears GPS was positively associated with Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Academic Motivation, predicting between 0.6% and 3% of the variance. In addition, we find that EduYears GPS explains between 8% and 16% of the association between personality domains and educational achievement at the end of compulsory education. In contrast, both the neuroticism and well-being GPS significantly accounted for between 0.3% and 0.7% of the variance in a subset of personality domains. Furthermore, they did not significantly account for any of the covariance between the personality domains and achievement, with the exception of the neuroticism GPS explaining 5% of the covariance between Neuroticism and achievement. These results demonstrate that the genetic effects of educational attainment relate to personality traits, highlighting the multifaceted nature of EduYears GPS.

Do such patterns reflect the differentiation of individuals by genotype, an increasing influence of environmental factors, or some (interactive) combination of the two? Using a population-based sample of over 2,500 twins and multiples from the Texas Twin Project, we estimated age trends in the variances in self- and parent-reported measures of the Big Five personality traits between Ages 8 and 18 years. We then estimated age trends in the genetic and environmental components of variance in each measure. Individual differences in personality increased in magnitude from childhood through mid-adolescence. This pattern emerged using both children's self-reports and ratings provided by their parents, and was primarily attributable to increases in the magnitude of genetic influences. Most of the increasing genetic variance appeared nonadditive, pointing to the possibility that developmental processes tend to make genetically similar individuals disproportionately more alike in their personality traits over time. These findings could reflect increasing or accumulating effects of trait-by-trait interactions; person-by-environment transactions, whereby genetically similar people are disproportionally likely to experience similar environments; the activation of dominant genes across developmental transitions (e.g., puberty); or some combination of these three processes, among other factors. Theories of personality development will need to accommodate these descriptive findings, and longitudinal, genetically informed designs are needed to test some of the specific hypotheses springing from this study.

Lay rationalism and decision satisfaction in self-control conflicts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920281,Journal of personality and social psychology,2019 03 28,"Are people more satisfied with decisions to resist or to indulge temptation? We propose that the effect of restraint versus indulgence on decision satisfaction depends on individual differences in lay rationalism, that is, reliance on reason versus feelings to guide decisions. Across 2 pilot studies and 9 main studies (N = 3,264) with different methodologies and various self-control domains, we found consistent evidence that individuals experience higher satisfaction with restraint the more they rely on reason than on feelings. The proposed effect uniquely concerns individual differences in lay rationalism and is independent from individual differences in trait self-control. We also show that authenticity (feeling true to oneself) is the mechanism underlying this effect and rule out self-typicality (acting in ways typical of oneself) as an alternative account. Additionally, we examined downstream consequences of this effect for compensatory authenticity seeking. These findings advance a more nuanced view of self-control based on identity and suggest that the subjective utility of restraint is contingent upon individual differences in reliance on reason versus feelings in decision making. Our research contributes to the understudied topic of the phenomenology of self-control and provides novel insights into its potential downsides for some individuals. We discuss theoretical implications for research on self-control, lay rationalism and authenticity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

Rolland (see record 2018-14404-000). Many health care providers have traveled with their patients and families on the journey of disease, disability, and death. This journey is often filled with unanticipated twists and turns: changes in physical functioning, intense emotional experiences, and demands on intimate relationships. In Helping Couples and Families Navigate Illness and Disability: An Integrated Approach, John Rolland has provided clinicians with a map of the territory, guiding them through the challenges of intersecting systems of family relationships, cultural values, and health care practices. This book is a culmination of John Rolland's expertise and writing over his 40-year career. The book expands on his work in theory development while adding an expansive repertoire of practical questions, suggestions, and interventions. His personal experience coping with the illness and death of his young spouse and his parents' health infuses a tender and personal tone to this academic work. In the context of his own journey, he wondered: ""What would have been useful information or support for me and my family members at different phases of the illness that could have made a difference in our ability to cope and adapt?"" (pp. viii). This question is at the heart of the book. His clinical expertise, theoretical acumen, and personal experiences comprise this comprehensive and readable book. The book is organized into four sections: (a) a conceptual overview of the Family Systems Illness Model (FSI); (b) the application of the model for families, couples and multigenerations, and family/cultural health beliefs; (c) health-related phases and transitions with specific populations (e.g., terminally ill, chronic conditions, aging individuals, and couples); and (d) the clinician's personal-professional dynamic emotional experience. This book will be an important resource for the growing workforce of behavioral health providers. It provides physicians with a family-oriented transition of care model and is applicable for nurses, nurse practitioners, and mental health professionals who coach families through many phases of care-inpatient, rehabilitation, or hospice. It does not include critical analysis of the research on family-oriented care. There are references to studies, but it is not a systematic review or meta-analysis of best practices for family-oriented health care. For family systems novices, this book will be conceptually dense. It is not entry-level reading but will be accessible if incorporated into a seminar by seasoned faculty. Clinicians will find that the FSI model is a necessary GPS for guiding families through their health care and journey of illness.

Corso, Christopher L. Hunter, Owen Dahl, Gene A. Kallenberg, and Lesley Manson (see record 2016-51034-000). This practical how-to book is written specifically for an audience working to implement integrated primary care (IPC) from the ground up, moving beyond the clinical competencies required for success in these settings to the business operational requirements to facilitate implementation. The book is divided into three sections, beginning with an introduction to key concepts and tools for successfully IPC practices. Section II is focused on the business practices needed for success, including strategic plan development, return on investment analyses, business cases analyses, hiring, billing, personnel training, and outcome monitoring. The last section is a series of case studies of successful programs from Cherokee Health Systems to Intermountain Health. This is particularly priceless because it provides evidence that IPC can thrive in a multitude of diverse settings, describing practical guidance of what to do and what to avoid. The authors, with more than 84 years of combined IPC experience, offer the reader sage advice, which can be applied readily. Each chapter begins with a Bottom Line, Up Front section, offering bulleted points of specific direction for the lay reader hoping to advance their journey into integration. A nice bonus surprise to the book is the wittiness of this esteemed group, offering refreshing pieces of humor, which is welcomed when thinking through the specific demands of IPC implementation. The book is also an excellent resource manual to delve more deeply into the IPC literature, with each chapter providing a host of references for further study.

Although the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure was designed to assess these 3 constructs, researchers have developed alternative triarchic scales using both omnibus measures of general personality and existing psychopathy scales. The components of the HEXACO model of personality may be especially capable of characterizing the dimensions of the triarchic model of psychopathy. The current study used a consensus-rating approach to create triarchic scales using items from the HEXACO-100. Data from 3 community and college student samples were used to examine the internal consistency, and convergent and discriminant validity of these newly developed HEXACO-Triarchic scales. The scales consistently demonstrated good internal consistency and displayed promising convergent and discriminant validity with theoretically predicted criterion variables. The lone exception was that HEXACO-Meanness and HEXACO-Disinhibition were similarly related to other triarchic measures of meanness. The implications of these findings for the integration of the HEXACO and triarchic models are discussed.

Potential items were derived from a qualitative analysis of self-reported thoughts during SAD-tailored cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-SAD) and subsequently refined based on qualitative feedback from 48 SAD patients. In the psychometric study (N = 536 college students), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses pruned the items to a 26-item scale with a 5-factor solution, demonstrating good internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and 2-week test-retest reliability. In a known groups comparison, the SBQ discriminated SAD patients (n = 86) from both nonseasonal major depressive disorder (MDD) patients (n = 30) and healthy controls (n = 110), whereas a generic measure of depressogenic cognitive vulnerability (the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale [DAS]) discriminated MDD patients from the other groups. In a randomized clinical trial comparing CBT-SAD with light therapy (N = 177), SBQ scores improved at twice the rate in CBT-SAD than in light therapy. Greater change in SBQ scores during CBT-SAD, but not during light therapy, was associated with a lower risk of depression recurrence 2 winters later. In contrast, DAS scores improved comparably during CBT-SAD and light therapy, and DAS change was unrelated to recurrence following either treatment. These results support using the SBQ as a brief assessment tool for a SAD-specific cognitive vulnerability and as a treatment target in CBT-SAD.

However, given the visual changes that occur with normal aging, it is important to establish whether letter position coding is equivalent across adulthood. In 2 experiments, young (18-25 years) and older (65+ years) adults' were recorded while reading sentences with words containing transposed adjacent letters. Transpositions occurred at beginning (rpoblem), internal (porblem), or end (problme) locations in words. In Experiment 1, these transpositions were present throughout reading. By comparison, Experiment 2 used a gaze-contingent paradigm such that once the reader's gaze moved past a word containing a transposition, this word was shown correctly and did not subsequently change. Both age groups showed normal levels of comprehension for text including words with transposed letters. The pattern of letter transposition effects on eye movements was similar for the young and older adults, with greater increases in reading times when external relative to internal letters were transposed. In Experiment 1, however, effects of word beginning transpositions during rereading were larger for the older adults. In Experiment 2 there were no interactions, confirming that letter position coding is similar for both age groups at least during first-pass processing of words. These findings show that flexibility in letter position encoding during the initial processing of words is preserved across adulthood, although the interaction effect in rereading in Experiment 1 also suggests that older readers may use more stringent postlexical verification processes, for which the accuracy of word beginning letters is especially important.

Rural TGNC individuals face additional disparities in accessing appropriate mental health services. Little research has focused on the mental health care providers who work with TGNC individuals in underserved areas. The current study sought to describe the mental health care services delivered by providers perceived as affirming by TGNC community members in the Central Great Plains. We conducted qualitative interviews with 10 providers to understand how providers seek cultural competency and conceptualize and work with their TGNC clients given the barriers to care. Providers held diverse theoretical orientations and described challenges to working with TGNC clients, including the impact of stigma and marginalization and financial and structural barriers to care. Emphasis was placed on individualizing care, helping clients to manage stigma and build resiliency, connecting clients to resources (when available) and support systems, and navigating the intersections of physical health care and mental health care, such as writing letters for medical transition. Providers largely educated themselves on TGNC topics and had previous experience working with marginalized populations. Overall, the providers' approaches to working with TGNC clients mapped onto models of cultural competency, but few providers described their work in the context of an evidence-based model. Implications for increasing the quality and availability of mental health care services for TGNC individuals in underserved areas are discussed.

As a result, most research has been deficit-based focusing on mental illness, which provides an incomplete state of their mental health. Therefore, very little is known about positive mental health (PMH), which is composed of social, emotional, and psychological well-being. To better understand their complete state of mental health, this study examined variations in levels of PMH among 235 Black traditional (ages 18 to 25) and nontraditional (ages 26+) college students attending historically Black colleges and universities and predominantly White institutions, in addition to identifying protective mechanisms promoting flourishing within these subgroups. The sample included 156 traditional college students (Mage = 20.88, SD = 2.12; 83% female) and 79 nontraditional college students (Mage = 36.06, SD = 36.1; 80% female). Approximately 54.4% of nontraditional students were flourishing compared with 43.6% of traditional students who were moderately mentally healthy. No significant differences were found in PMH among Black students attending historically Black colleges and universities and predominantly White institutions. Results indicate spirituality, social support, self-esteem, and racial identity (low centrality and high public regard) are associated with PMH in Black traditional students; however, spirituality, self-esteem, and racial identity (high public regard) were associated with PMH in nontraditional students. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating identified protective mechanisms into existing programs and services to increase levels of flourishing among Black students within the college setting. Implications and recommendations for future research are provided.

(2018).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920240,The Journal of applied psychology,2019 04 18,"Reports an error in ""Why and when hierarchy impacts team effectiveness: A meta-analytic integration"" by Lindred L. Greer, Bart A. de Jong, Maartje E. Schouten and Jennifer E. Dannals (Journal of Applied Psychology, 2018[Jun], Vol 103[6], 591-613). In this article, the hierarchical form value for the study by Cantimur et al. (2015a) was incorrectly coded as representing 'acyclicity' rather than 'steepness'. Updating the coding for this study means that there is just one acyclicity study in our dataset (Bunderson et al., 2016) rather than two, and resulted in some changes to the coefficients in our moderator model presented in Table 3. The corrected Table 3 is presented in the erratum. The only substantive change to our conclusions is that Hypothesis 4a, regarding the effects of membership instability, is no longer supported at p < .05. We also note a minor change to how Hypothesis 5b is tested-we can no longer test for the effects of acyclicity at the study level of analysis. However, we can still test this hypothesis using the 'shifting unit of analysis' approach. These analyses revealed that the population coefficient for acyclical hierarchies was unlikely to be different in magnitude from that of steep hierarchies or centralized hierarchies. Our original conclusion and interpretation-that Hypothesis 5b is not supported, but this interpretation is limited due to low sample size-remain intact. See erratum for full description. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-03097-001.) Hierarchy has the potential to both benefit and harm team effectiveness. In this article, we meta-analytically investigate different explanations for why and when hierarchy helps or hurts team effectiveness, drawing on results from 54 prior studies (N = 13,914 teams). Our findings show that, on net, hierarchy negatively impacts team effectiveness (performance: ρ = -.08; viability: ρ = -.11), and that this effect is mediated by increased conflict-enabling states. Additionally, we show that the negative relationship between hierarchy and team performance is exacerbated by aspects of the team structure (i.e., membership instability, skill differentiation) and the hierarchy itself (i.e., mutability), which make hierarchical teams prone to conflict. The predictions regarding the positive effect of hierarchy on team performance as mediated by coordination-enabling processes, and the moderating roles of several aspects of team tasks (i.e., interdependence, complexity) and the hierarchy (i.e., form) were not supported, with the exception that task ambiguity enhanced the positive effects of hierarchy. Given that our findings largely support dysfunctional views on hierarchy, future research is needed to understand when and why hierarchy may be more likely to live up to its purported functional benefits.

When an effective catalyst is found, it is often explored for other types of reactions, frequently under the auspices of different mechanisms. As successes mount, a unique catalyst scaffold may become viewed as ""privileged"". However, the mechanistic hallmarks of privileged catalysts are not easily enumerated or readily generalized to genuinely different classes of reactions or substrates. We explored the concept of scaffold uniqueness with two catalyst types for an unusual atropisomer-selective cyclodehydration: (a) C2-symmetric chiral phosphoric acids and (b) phosphothreonine-embedded, peptidic phosphoric acids. Pragmatically, both catalyst scaffolds proved fertile for enantioselective/atroposelective cyclodehydrations. Mechanistic studies revealed that the determinants of often equivalent and high atroposelectivity are different for the two catalyst classes. A data-descriptive classification of these asymmetric catalysts reveals an increasingly broad set of catalyst chemotypes, operating with different mechanistic features, that creates new opportunities for broad and complementary application of catalyst scaffolds in diverse substrate space.",The Importance of the Water Molecular Quadrupole for Estimating Interfacial Potential Shifts Acting on Ions Near the Liquid-Vapor Interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920221,The journal of physical chemistry.

A,2019 06 13,"Highly accurate theoretical values of bond energies and activation barriers of primary decomposition reactions are crucial for reliable predictions of thermal decomposition and detonation-related phenomena of energetic materials (EM). However, due to the prohibitive computational cost, high-level ab initio calculations had been impractical for a large number of important EMs, including, e.g., hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20). In the present work, we obtained accurate bond dissociation energies and the activation barriers for primary decomposition reactions for a series of novel promising caged polynitroamino and polynitro EMs, viz., CL-20, TEX, octanitrocubane (ONC), and hexanitro derivatives of adamantane, using the recently proposed domain-localized pair natural orbitals (DLPNO) modifications of coupled cluster techniques. DLPNO-CCSD(T) allows for routine quadruple-ζ basis set quality coupled cluster calculations for the species comprised of ∼30 non-H atoms. The benchmarks on a number of simpler congeners of CL-20 and ONC revealed that the DLPNO approach does not deteriorate the quality of the quadruple-ζ coupled cluster procedure. With the aid of this technique, the full set of gas-phase primary decomposition reactions for all 9 conformers of CL-20 was considered. For all species studied, C-NO2 or N-NO2 radical decomposition channels dominate over molecular counterparts. The best theoretical results reported in the literature so far, viz., density functional theory energies of nitro group radical elimination in CL-20 and ONC, underestimate the value by ∼10 kcal mol-1. We also present reliable and accurate gas-phase formation enthalpies for CL-20, ONC, and related species. In a more general sense, these results offer a new level of predictive computational kinetics for polynitro-caged energetic materials.",Bioactive Dimeric Acylphloroglucinols from the Mexican Fern Elaphoglossum paleaceum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920216,Journal of natural products,2019 04 26,"Two new prenylated acylphloroglucinols, paleacenins A (1) and B (2), were isolated from the rhizome n-hexane and chloroform extracts of the fern Elaphoglossum paleaceum.

Their structures were determined using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopic, HRMS, and ECD analysis. The plant extracts and purified compounds were assayed for inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity, and the n-hexane and chloroform extracts displayed 25.0% and 26.5% inhibition of MAO-A, respectively, as well as 42.5% and 23.7% inhibition of MAO-B, respectively. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited IC50 values of 31.0 (1.3) μM for MAO-A and 4.7 (4.4) μM for MAO-B. Paleacenin A (1) showed a higher selective index (SI) toward MAO-B (SIMAO-B/MAO-A 0.1), and paleacenin B (2) exhibited selectivity to MAO-A (SIMAO-B/MAO-A, 3.5). The extracts showed cytotoxicity against a panel of prostate, cervix, breast, and colon cancer cell lines (IC50 values between 1.7 and 10.6 μg/mL); the pure compounds were more active against the prostate, cervix, and colon cancer cell lines.

Commonly used similarity measures using reduced graphs convert these graphs into 2D vectors like fingerprints, before chemical comparisons are made. This study investigates the effectiveness of a graph-only driven molecular comparison by using extended reduced graphs along with graph edit distance methods for molecular similarity calculation as a tool for ligand-based virtual screening applications, which estimate the bioactivity of a chemical on the basis of the bioactivity of similar compounds. The results proved to be very stable and the graph editing distance method performed better than other methods previously used on reduced graphs. This is exemplified with six publicly available data sets: DUD-E, MUV, GLL&GDD, CAPST, NRLiSt BDB, and ULS-UDS. The screening and statistical tools available on the ligand-based virtual screening benchmarking platform and the RDKit were also used. In the experiments, our method performed better than other molecular similarity methods which use array representations in most cases. Overall, it is shown that extended reduced graphs along with graph edit distance is a combination of methods that has numerous applications and can identify bioactivity similarities in a structurally diverse group of molecules."

A fully biobased nature was achieved by utilizing genipin (GP) as a crosslinking agent and chitosan-derived nanographene oxide (nGO) as a property tuner. The produced chitosan microspheres were further proven as powerful adsorbents for common wastewater contaminants such as anionic dyes and pharmaceutical contaminants, here modeled by methyl orange (MO) and diclofenac sodium (DCF). By regulating the amount of GP and nGO, as well as by controlling the process parameters including the spray-drying inlet temperature and postheat treatment, the surface morphology, size, zeta potential, and adsorption efficiency of the microspheres could be tuned accordingly. The adsorption efficiency for MO and DCF reached 98.9 and 100%, respectively. The microspheres retained high DCF adsorption efficiency after six adsorption and desorption cycles, and the recyclability was improved by the incorporated nGO. The fabricated microspheres, thus, have great potential as reusable and eco-friendly adsorbents.","Carbon-Based, Ultraelastic, Hierarchically Coated Fiber Strain Sensors with Crack-Controllable Beads.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920201,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 29,"Fiber-based electronics or textronics are spotlighted as a promising strategy to develop stretchable and wearable devices for conformable machine-human interface and ubiquitous healthcare systems. We have prepared a highly sensitive fiber-type strain sensor (maximum gauge factor (GF) = 863) with a broad range of strain (ε < 400%) by introducing a single active layer onto the fiber. In contrast to other metal-based fiber-type electronics, our hierarchical fiber sensors are based on coating carbon-based nanomaterials with responsive microbeads onto elastic fibers. Utilizing the formation of uniform cracks around the microbeads, the device performance was maximized by adjusting the number of microbeads in the carbon-coating layer. We overcoated the carbon-based coating layer of the elastic fiber with a protective polymeric layer and verified no effects on the GF and the range of strain. Our fiber sensors were repeatedly tested more than 5000 times, exhibiting excellent cyclic responses to on/off switching behaviors. For practical applications, the hierarchical fiber sensors were sewed into electrical fabric bands, which are integrable to a wireless transmitter to monitor waveforms of pulsations, respirations, and various postures of level of bending a spinal cord.",Enzyme Reactor Based on Reversible pH-Controlled Catalytic Polymer Porous Membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920200,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 29,"The challenge for polymeric enzyme reactors at present is to selectively control the enzymolysis rate in complex conditions. Additionally, the fabrication methodology is hindered by complex processes, especially for achieving diverse stimuli responsiveness and functions. Here, we reported a kind of pH-sensitive polymer, poly(styrene- co-maleic anhydride-acrylic acid) (PS-MAn-AA)-based hybrid enzyme reactor. It comprised magnetic nanoparticles and a pH-sensitive PS-MAn-AA porous polymer membrane made by breath figure method. The enzyme l-asparaginase (l-ASNase) could covalently bond on the surface of the pH-sensitive porous polymer membrane (pH-PPM), and the resultant enzyme reactor was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants ( Km and Vmax) of the l-ASNase enzyme reactor at different pH values were determined by a chiral ligand-exchange capillary electrophoresis method with l-asparagine as the substrate. The Vmax value of the l-ASNase enzyme reactor (0.67 mM/min) was almost 3-fold of that of the free l-ASNase (0.23 mM/min) at pH 8.2. Its ability to precisely control the enzymolysis rate in complex conditions is triggered primarily by the pH of the buffer solution, allowing controlled enzymatic reactions and displaying excellent stability and reusability of the proposed pH-PPM. This strategy for porous polymer membrane enzyme reactor fabrication has established a platform for enzyme efficiency adjusting. These valve-like distinguished features highlight the outstanding potential of stimuli-responsive enzyme reactor applied for enzyme immobilization and enzyme-related disease treatment.",Synthesis and Evaluation of QS-7-Based Vaccine Adjuvants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920199,ACS infectious diseases,2019 06 14,"We have designed and synthesized two analogs (5 and 6) of QS-7, a natural saponin compound isolated from Quillaja saponaria (QS) Molina tree bark. The only structural difference between compound 5 and 6 is that 5 is acetylated at the 3- and 4-O positions of the quillaic acid C28 fucosyl unit while 6 is not. However, the two analogs show significantly different immunostimulant profiles. Compound 5 may potentiate a mixed Th1/Th2 (Th, T helper cells) immune response against the specific antigens while compound 6 may only induce a Th2-biased immunity. These results suggest that the 3- and/or 4-O acetyl groups of the fucosyl unit may play an important role in tuning the adjuvanticity of the QS-7 analogs, and compound 5 can serve as a structurally defined synthetic adjuvant when a mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses is desired.",Employing a Bifunctional Molybdate Precursor To Grow the Highly Crystalline MoS2 for High-Performance Field-Effect Transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920198,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 24,"Growth of the large-sized and high-quality MoS2 single crystals for high-performance low-power electronic applications is an important step to pursue. Despite the significant improvement made in minimizing extrinsic MoS2 contact resistance based on interfacial engineering of the devices, the electron mobility of field-effect transistors (FETs) made of a synthetic monolayer MoS2 is yet far below the expected theoretical values, implying that the MoS2 crystal quality needs to be further improved. Here, we demonstrate the high-performance two-terminal MoS2 FETs with room-temperature electron mobility up to ∼90 cm2 V-1 s-1 based on the sulfurization growth of the bifunctional precursor, sodium molybdate dihydrate. This unique transition-metal precursor, serving as both the crystalline Mo source and seed promotor (sodium), could facilitate the lateral growth of the highly crystalline monolayer MoS2 crystals (edge length up to ∼260 μm). Substrate surface treatment with oxygen plasma prior to the deposition of the Mo precursor is fundamental to increase the wettability between the Mo source and the substrate, promoting the thinning and coalescence of the source clusters during the growth of large-sized MoS2 single crystals. The control of growth temperature is also an essential step to grow a strictly monolayer MoS2 crystal.

Herein, we introduce an atomic intercalation method that brings the wide band gap vdW α-MoO3 for vis-MIR broadband optoelectronic conversion. We confirm experimentally that intercalation significantly enhances photoabsorption and electrical conductivity buts effects negligible change to the lattice structure as compared with ion intercalation. Charge transfer from the Sn atom to the lattices induces an optoelectrical change. As a result, the Sn-intercalated α-MoO3 shows room temperature, air stable, broadband photodetection ability from 405 nm to 10 μm, with photoresponsivity better than 9.0 A W-1 in 405-1500 nm, ∼0.4 A W-1 at 3700 nm, and 0.16 A W-1 at 10 μm, response time of ∼0.1 s, and peak D* of 7.3 × 107 cm Hz0.5 W-1 at 520 nm.

However, their electronic transport characteristics are unstable and unrepeatable with external environment variation. Here, we demonstrate that electron transport of an individual ZnO nanowire-based device with the two same electrodes can be controllably modulated by applying a relatively large uni-/bidirectional bias. After being modulated, moreover, their electrical properties can well be maintained at relatively low operation bias and room temperature, demonstrating a memory behavior. The presence of surface states related to lattice periodicity breaking and traps associated with oxygen vacancy (Vo) and zinc interstitial (Zni) deep-level defects plays a crucial role in tunable electron transport with a memory feature. For the single nanowire-based two-terminal device, two back-to-back connected surface barrier diodes with series resistance are formed. The filling and emptying of traps near two end electrodes can remarkably adjust the width and height of the surface barrier. At a relatively low bias, the unmodulated conductance is governed by the electron hopping of bulk traps since the height of emptied traps is higher than that of the surface barrier, whereas at a relatively large bias, it is dominated by thermion emission due to a dramatic decrease of the surface barrier width resulting from the electron injection into traps from a negative electrode. Moreover, it will be beneficial for a thin surface barrier to penetrate UV light and separate photoexcited electron-hole pairs. After being asymmetrically modulated by a unidirectional injection, it can be successfully applied to realize a self-driven UV photodetector based on a photovoltaic effect in the symmetrical two-electrode structure. Our work provides a new route to tune electrical properties of nanostructures, which may inspire the development of novel electronic and optoelectronic devices.",Embedding cell monolayers to investigate nanoparticle-plasmalemma interactions at transmission electron microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920191,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,2019 04 18,"Transmission electron microscopy is the technique of choice to visualize the spatial relationships between nanoconstructs and cells and especially to monitor the uptake process of nanomaterials.

Consequently, the thrust of this study was to establish the spatial distribution of anthrax and determine ecological drivers of its recurrence, maintenance and epidemiological linkage to anthropogenic activities. Environmental and biological samples were collected within the livestock production and conservation areas (n = 80). Each sample was serially tested for Bacillus anthracis positivity through blood agar culture and Gram stain technique, and then confirmation by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR). Questionnaires (n = 113) were conducted at independently distinct villages in terms of space and time. Most respondents showed that animals that died from anthrax were not properly disposed off. More likely than not, poverty being the main driver for anthrax carcass dressing and meat distribution contributed to environmental contamination with anthrax spores in areas where the animals subsequently died resulting in further environmental contamination, which is the major source of primary infection for livestock and wildlife. From the samples, 15 pure isolates of anthrax were obtained which were spatially distributed across four districts. Twelve, biologically plausible variables were found to be highly significant on multivariable logistic regression analysis model for questionnaires which included herd size (odds = 10.46; P = 0.005; CI 8.8-16), carcass disposal method (odds = 6.9; P = 0.001; CI = 3.4-9.8), access to veterinary services (odds = 10.87; P = 0.004; CI = 4.8-15.9) and management system (odds = 2.57; P = 0.001; CI = 1.3-7.5).

Part A,2019 06 14,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15-25% of breast cancer cases and lacks expression of the three most common receptors seen on other subtypes of breast cancer. This lack of expression makes TNBC unsusceptible to currently available targeted or hormonal therapies, so new treatment strategies are desperately needed. Photothermal therapy (PTT), which utilizes nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in tumors as exogenous energy absorbers to convert externally applied near-infrared (NIR) light into heat to ablate cancer cells, has shown promise as an alternative strategy. However, it typically uses gold-based NPs that will remain in the body for extended period of time with unknown long-term health effects. To enable PTT with biodegradable, polymeric NPs, we encapsulated the NIR-absorbing dye IR820 in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs. We characterized the physicochemical properties of these IR820-loaded PLGA NPs and evaluated their performance as PTT agents using both in vitro and in vivo models of TNBC. The results demonstrate that these NPs are potent mediators of PTT that induce cell death primarily through apoptosis to effectively hinder the growth of TNBC tumors. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, anti-glycolytic agents have yielded few positive results in human patients, in part due to dose-limiting side effects. Here, we discovered the unexpected anti-cancer efficacy of Polydatin (PD) combined with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which is a compound that inhibits glycolysis. We demonstrated in two breast cell lines (MCF-7 and 4T1) that combination treatment with PD and 2-DG induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, we determined the mechanism of PD in synergy with 2-DG, which decreased the intracellular reactive oxygen (ROS) levels and suppressed the PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, the combined treatment inhibited the glycolytic phenotype through reducing the expression of HK2. HK2 deletion in breast cancer cells thus improved the anti-cancer activity of 2-DG. The combination treatment also resulted in significant tumour regression in the absence of significant morphologic changes in the heart, liver or kidney in vivo. In summary, our study demonstrates that PD synergised with 2-DG to enhance its anti-cancer efficacy by inhibiting the ROS/PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α/HK2 signalling axis, providing a potential anti-cancer strategy.",Isolated Diatomic Ni-Fe Metal-Nitrogen Sites for Synergistic Electroreduction of CO2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920151,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 13,"Polynary single-atom structures can combine the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts while providing synergistic functions based on different molecules and their interfaces. However, the fabrication and identification of such an active-site prototype remain elusive. Here we report isolated diatomic Ni-Fe sites anchored on nitrogenated carbon as an efficient electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The catalyst exhibits high selectivity with CO Faradaic efficiency above 90 % over a wide potential range from -0.5 to -0.9 V (98 % at -0.7 V), and robust durability, retaining 99 % of its initial selectivity after 30 hours of electrolysis.

This study aimed to assess the function of VPCs isolated from patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). VPCs were isolated from control and MFS donors and characterized. Compared with control-VPCs, MFS-VPCs exhibited cellular senescence as demonstrated by increased cell size, higher SA-β-gal activity and elevated levels of p53 and p21. RNA sequencing showed that several cellular process-related pathways including cell cycle and cellular senescence were significantly enriched in MFP-VPCs. Notably, the expression level of TGF-β1 was much higher in MFS-VPCs than control-VPCs. Treatment of control-VPCs with TGF-β1 significantly enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (ROS) and induced cellular senescence whereas inhibition of ROS reversed these effects. MFS-VPCs displayed increased mitochondrial fusion and decreased mitochondrial fission. Treatment of control-VPCs with TGF-β1 increased mitochondrial fusion and reduced mitochondrial fission. Nonetheless, treatment of mitofusin2 (Mfn2)-siRNA inhibited TGF-β1-induced mitochondrial fusion and cellular senescence. Furthermore, TGF-β1-induced mitochondrial fusion was mediated by the AMPK signalling pathway. Our study shows that TGF-β1 induces VPC senescence in patients with MFS by mediating mitochondrial dynamics via the AMPK signalling pathway.",Investigation of free and conjugated seleno-amino acids in wheat bran by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920149,Journal of separation science,2019 05 17,"An analytical method for determining seleno-methionine, methyl-seleno-cysteine, and seleno-cystine in wheat bran was developed and validated.

Calcium silicate (CS), doped calcium silicate with zinc and magnesium, with Ca/Zn molar ratios of 6.7:1 (DCS1), and 4.5:1 (DCS2), were synthesized by the sol-gel method. Matreva white MTA (WMTA, Matreva, CA, Egypt) was used as a control. The synthesized powders were characterized by x-ray diffraction. Setting time was measured using the Gilmore needle indentation technique. The in vitro apatite-forming ability of the materials was evaluated by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray. NIH3T3-E1 cells viability was tested using MTT assay. The ion release of Ca, Si, Zn, and Mg was measured using inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). One-way ANOVA was used to analyze setting time results. The Tukey's HSD post hoc test was used to establish significance (p < 0.001). For nonparametric data, the Kruskal-Wallis H test with Dunn's correction for post hoc comparison was used (p < 0.05). CS, DCS1, and DCS2 showed a significant decrease in setting time 33 ± 1.63 min, 28 ± 1.63 min, and 41.75 ± 2.87 min, respectively, compared to WMTA 91 ± 3.16 min (p < 0.001).

One alternative to BP is another type of phosphorus allotrope, red phosphorus (RP), which is much more affordable and easier to process. Although RP has been widely used in industry for hundreds of years and considered as an insulating material, in this study, we demonstrate through field-effect transistors (FET) measurements that amorphous red phosphorus (a-RP) films are semiconductive with a high mobility of 387 cm2  V-1  s-1 and a current switching ratio of ≈103 , which is comparable to the electronic characteristics previously reported for BP. The films were produced via a thermal evaporation method or a facile drop-casting approach onto Si/SiO2 substrates. We also report a study of the oxidation process of the films over time and a method to stabilize the films via doping a-RP with metal oxides. The doped films retain stability for one thousand I-V cycles, with no signs of degradation."

Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of four new viruses infecting halophilic archaea from the saline Lake Retba, located close to Dakar on the coast of Senegal. Three of the viruses, HRPV10, HRPV11 and HRPV12, have enveloped pleomorphic virions and should belong to the family Pleolipoviridae, whereas the forth virus, HFTV1, has an icosahedral capsid and a long non-contractile tail, typical of bacterial and archaeal members of the order Caudovirales. Comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses place HRPV10, HRPV11 and HRPV12 into the genus Betapleolipovirus, whereas HFTV1 appears to be most closely related to the unclassified Halorubrum virus HRTV-4. Differently from HRTV-4, HFTV1 encodes host-derived minichromosome maintenance helicase and PCNA homologues, which are likely to orchestrate its genome replication. HFTV1, the first archaeal virus isolated on a Haloferax strain, could also infect Halorubrum sp., albeit with an eightfold lower efficiency, whereas pleolipoviruses nearly exclusively infected autochthonous Halorubrum strains. Mapping of the metagenomic sequences from this environment to the genomes of isolated haloarchaeal viruses showed that these known viruses are underrepresented in the available viromes.",Treatment response as predictor for brain metastasis in triple negative breast cancer: A score-based model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920124,The breast journal,2019 04 26,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has worse prognosis than other subtypes of breast cancer, and many patients develop brain metastasis (BM).

A novel, stratified prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC) was developed to show robustness of the exposure-response relationships. Time-to-event simulations confirmed the benefit of the recommended dosing schedule of 800 mg/day: initial doses of 800 mg/day were associated with the highest PFS, whereas lower doses (600 or 400 mg/day) were associated with improved tolerability but reduced PFS.

The addition of poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles improves macroporosity and therefore late stage material degradation. CPC degradation and hence, bone formation at an early stage remains challenging, due to the delayed onset of PLGA degradation (i.e., after 2-3 weeks). Consequently, we here explored multimodal porogen platforms based on sucrose porogens (for early pore formation) and PLGA porogens (for late pore formation) to enhance CPC degradation and analyzed mechanical properties, dynamic in vitro degradation and in vivo performance in a rat femoral bone defect model. Porogen addition to CPC showed to decrease compressive strength of all CPC formulations; transition of the crystal phase upon in vitro incubation increased compressive strength. Although dynamic in vitro degradation showed rapid sucrose dissolution within 1 week, no additional effects on CPC degradation or bone formation were observed upon in vivo implantation. © 2019 The Authors. journal Of Biomedical Materials Research Part A Published By Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Attempting to solve these issues and achieve wider acceptance by the clinicians, granular ceramics have been associated with hydrogels (HGs) to produce injectable/moldable SBSs. Dextrin, a low-molecular-weight carbohydrate, was used to develop a fully resorbable and injectable HG. It was first oxidized with sodium periodate and then cross-linked with adipic acid dihydrazide. The in vivo biocompatibility and safety of the dextrin-based HG was assessed by subacute systemic toxicity and skin sensitization tests, using rodent models. The results showed that the HG did not induce any systemic toxic effect, skin reaction, or genotoxicity, neither impaired the bone repair/regeneration process. Then, the HG was successfully combined with granular bone substitute, registered as Bonelike (250-500 μm) to obtain a moldable/injectable SBS, which was implanted in tibial fractures in goats for 3 and 6 weeks.

The diversity of the gut microbiota declines in the elderly and in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Restoring the diversity with probiotic treatment alleviates the psychiatric and histopathological findings. This presents a problem: How does gut microbiota interact with the pathogenesis of AD? The starting point of this comprehensive review is addressing the role of bacterial metabolites and neurotransmitters in the brain under various conditions, ranging from a healthy state to ageing and disease. In the light of current literature, we describe three different linkages between the present gut microbiome hypothesis and the other major theories for the pathogenesis of AD as follows: bacterial metabolites and amyloids can trigger central nervous system inflammation and cerebrovascular degeneration; impaired gut microbiome flora inhibits the autophagy-mediated protein clearance process; and gut microbiomes can change the neurotransmitter levels in the brain through the vagal afferent fibres.",Physical activity as a prognostic factor of pain intensity and disability in patients with low back pain: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920074,"European journal of pain (London, England)",2019 05 15,Identifying factors that influence the course of low back pain (LBP) is important to help clinicians to identify those patients at higher risk of non-recovery.

We aimed to access the effect of aerobic exercise, low- and high-fat diet on mice testis tissue, and sperm function. Obese and nonobese male mice C57BL/6 were exposed to high fat (Hf) or low fat (Lf) and/or activity (Exe: exercise or Sed: sedentary). Finally, testicular morphometric characteristics, sperm concentration and motility (light microscopy), sperm morphology (eosin/nigrosin dye), lipid peroxidation (BODIPY C11 Probe), chromatin (acridine orange and chromomycin A3 staining) were compared within obese groups (Hf/Exe, Lf/Exe, Lf/Sed, Hf/Sed) and nonobese groups (Hf/Exe, Lf/Exe, Lf/Sed, Hf/Sed). Both exercise and diet interventions did not show any alteration in testicular morphological characteristics, sperm morphology and DNA fragmentation within both obese and nonobese groups (p > 0.05). Exercise and/or diet resulted in a significant increase in sperm concentration and motility within both groups (p < 0.05).

Transitional capillaries close to the bone surface, which express both endomucin (Edm) and CD31, bear leptin receptor-expressing (LepR) perivascular cells that may differentiate into osteoblasts. Increased numbers of type H endothelial cells (THEC; ie, Edmhi /CD31hi cells assessed by flow cytometry, FACS) are associated with higher bone formation in young mice. We hypothesized that iPTH administration impacts transitional vessels by expanding THECs. Four-month-old C57/Bl6J female mice were injected with PTH 1-84 (100 μg/kg/d) or saline (CT) for 7 or 14 days. We quantified LepR+ , CD31+ , Edm+ cells and THECs by FACS in hindlimb bone marrow, and Edm/LepR double immunolabelings on tibia cryosections. Additionally, we analyzed bone mRNA expression of 87 angiogenesis-related genes in mice treated with either intermittent or continuous PTH (iPTH/cPTH) or saline (CT) for 7, 14, and 28 days. iPTH dramatically decreased the percentage of THECs by 78% and 90% at days 7 and 14, respectively, and of LepR+ cells at day 14 (-46%) versus CT. Immunolabeling quantification showed that the intracortical Edm+ -vessel density increased at day 14 under iPTH. In the bone marrow, perivascular LepR+ cells, connected to each other via a dendrite network, were sparser under iPTH at day 14 (-58%) versus CT. iPTH decreased LepR+ cell coverage of transitional vessels only (-51%), whereas the number of LepR+ cells not attached to vessels increased in the endocortical area only (+ 49%). Transcriptomic analyses showed that iPTH consistently upregulated PEDF, Collagen-18α1, and TIMP-1 mRNA expression compared with CT and cPTH. Finally, iPTH increased immunolabeling of endostatin, a Collagen-18 domain that can be cleaved and become antiangiogenic, in both endocortical (79%) and peritrabecular transitional microvessels at day 14. Our results show that iPTH specifically remodels transitional vessels and suggest that it promotes LepR+ cell mobilization from these vessels close to the bone surface.",LncRNA PAPAS promotes hepatocellular carcinoma by interacting with miR-188-5p.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920025,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 14,"It has been observed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) PAPAS regulates rRNA synthesis, but its role in human diseases is unclear. Our study was carried out to investigate the role of PAPAS in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we found that PAPAS was upregulated both in plasma from patients with HCC and tumors compared with plasma from healthy people and tumor-adjacent healthy tissues. Expression levels of PAPAS in tumor tissues and plasma of patients with HCC were significantly and positively correlated. Plasma levels of PAPAS effectively distinguished stage I patients from healthy controls. MicroRNA (miR)-188-5p was downregulated in tumor tissues than in tumor-adjacent healthy tissues of patients with HCC, and was inversely correlated with PAPAS in tumor tissues but not in adjacent healthy tissues. PAPAS and miR-188-5p downregulated each other. PAPAS overexpression promoted, while miR-188-5p overexpression inhibited the HCC cell proliferation. Rescue experiment showed that miR-34a overexpression attenuated the effects of PAPAS overexpression. However, PAPAS overexpression failed to affect significantly cancer cell migration and invasion. Therefore, lncRNA PAPAS promotes HCC by interacting with miR-188-5p.",Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 contributes to lipopolysaccharide-induced fibrogenesis in mouse L929 fibroblasts via modulating PPM1A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920024,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Herein, we found that serum chemokine ligand 14 (CXCL14) was significantly enhanced in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In our current study, mouse L929 fibroblasts were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/mL). Cell proliferation, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9, as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) content were assessed to evaluate the fibrogenesis of L929 cells. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cell viability were assessed to evaluate cell proliferation. Hydroxyproline (Hyp), collagen I/III, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) were assessed to evaluate ECM secretion and deposition. α-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was used to measure the occurrence of differentiation from fibroblast toward myofibroblast. Our data suggested that knockdown of CXCL14 prevented LPS-induced fibrogenesis of L929 cells through inhibiting cell proliferation and decreasing the expression of MMP2/9, Hyp, collagen I/III, CTGF, p-Smad2/3, and α-SMA. Notably, upregulation of protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A) was involved in this process. On the contrary, recombinant CXCL14 protein led to an opposite effect. We first suggested that overexpression of PPM1A ameliorated LPS-induced fibrogenesis. Furthermore, we substantiated that knockdown of CXCL14 exerted an antifibrotic effect in IPF in vitro probably via the upregulation of PPM1A. Besides, evidently enhanced CXCL14, yet reduced PPM1A, was found in bleomycin-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis, confirming the roles of CXCL14 and its potential association with PPM1A in IPF in vivo. In conclusion, CXCL14 could be considered as a therapeutic target for preventing fibrogenesis of mouse L929 fibroblasts.",Identification of potential key genes associated with osteosarcoma based on integrated bioinformatics analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920023,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Due to high rates of metastasis and poor clinical outcomes for patients, it is important to study the pathomechanisms of osteosarcoma. However, due to the fact that osteosarcoma shows significant interindividual variation and high heterogeneity, the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the population level cannot answer many important questions related to osteosarcoma tumorigenesis. Therefore, a new strategy to identify dysregulated genes in osteosarcoma samples is required. The aim of this study was to improve our understanding of osteosarcoma pathogenesis by identifying genes with universal aberrant expression in osteosarcoma samples. Because the relative expression ordering of genes is stable in normal bone tissues but is disrupted in osteosarcoma tissues, we used the RankComp algorithm to identify DEGs in normal and osteosarcoma tissue samples. We then calculated the dysregulation frequency for each gene. Genes with deregulation frequencies above 80% were deemed to be universal DEGs. Next, coexpression, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction network analyses were performed to characterize the functions of these genes. From 188 samples of osteosarcoma obtained from four datasets measured on different platforms, 51 universal DEGs were identified, including 4 universally upregulated genes and 47 universally downregulated genes. Genes that were differentially coexpressed with these universal DEGs were found to be enriched in 46 cancer-related pathways. In addition, functional and network analyses showed that genes with high dysregulation frequencies were involved in cancer-related functions. Thus, the commonly aberrant genes identified in osteosarcoma tissues may be important targets for osteosarcoma diagnosis and therapy.",Performance of FRAX and FRAX-Based Treatment Thresholds in Women Aged 40 Years and Older: The Manitoba BMD Registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920022,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2019 05 17,"We examined among women aged ≥40 years the performance of the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and FRAX-based osteoporosis treatment thresholds under the US National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) guidelines. We used registry data for all women aged ≥40 years in Manitoba, Canada, with baseline bone mineral density (BMD) testing (n = 54,459). Incident major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), hip fracture, and clinical fracture were assessed from population-based health services data (mean follow-up 10.5 years). Age-stratified hazard ratios (HR) were estimated from Cox regression models. We assessed the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), number needed to screen (NNS), and number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent a fracture (assuming 20% relative risk reduction on treatment) for osteoporosis treatment thresholds under the NOF and NOGG guidelines. Femoral neck T-score and FRAX (with and without BMD) predicted all fracture outcomes at all ages. There was good calibration in FRAX-predicted versus observed 10-year MOF and hip fracture probability. Overall sensitivity (PPV) for incident MOF was 25.7% (24.0%) for femoral neck T-score ≤ -2.5; 20.3% (26.3%) for FRAX (with BMD)-predicted 10-year MOF risk ≥20% (NOF threshold); 27.3% (22.0%) for FRAX-predicted 10-year MOF risk ≥ age-dependent cut-off (NOGG threshold), 59.4% (19.0%) for the NOF treatment algorithm; and 28.5% (18.4%) for the NOGG treatment algorithm. Sensitivity for identifying incident MOF varied by age, ranging from 0.0% to 26.3% in women 40 to 49 years old and from 49.0% to 93.3% in women aged 80+ years. The gradient of risk for fracture prediction from femoral neck T-score and FRAX (with and without BMD) as continuous measures was strong across the age spectrum. The sensitivity and PPV of the strategies based on dichotomous cut-offs are low, especially among women aged 40 to 49 years (who have lowest incidence rates). Threshold-based approaches should be reassessed, particularly in younger women.",Both neural and global androgen receptor overexpression affect sexual dimorphism in the mouse brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920021,Journal of neuroendocrinology,2019 04 22,"Testosterone is the main endocrine mechanism mediating sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain, although testosterone signalling is complex and important mechanistic questions remain. Notably, the extent to which testosterone acts via androgen receptors (AR) in this process remains unknown and it is also not clear where testosterone acts in the body to produce sexual dimorphisms in neuroanatomy. To address these questions, we used a transgenic mouse model of Cre/loxP-driven AR overexpression in which AR was induced selectively in neural tissue (Nestin-cre) or in all tissues (CMV-cre). We then studied sexually dimorphic features of several well-characterised sexual dimorphisms: calbindin-immunoreactive neurones in the medial preoptic area (CALB-SDN), tyrosine hydroxylase neurones in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, and vasopressin-immunoreactive neurones originating in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and their projections in the lateral septum. We additionally evaluated oestrogen receptor α immunoreactivity in these nuclei. Briefly, we found that global but not neural overexpression of AR resulted in masculinisation of CALB-SDN nucleus volume, cell number and cell size in transgenic females. Furthermore, neural AR overexpression resulted in increased oestrogen receptor α staining in females compared to males in the medial preoptic area. AR overexpression did not affect other measures. Overall, the results of the present study provide support for the hypothesis that androgenic mechanisms external to the nervous system can affect sexual differentiation of the brain.",Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms in a cohort of Asian children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920020,Pediatric dermatology,2019 05 17,"Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is rare but potentially fatal in children.

Here, we revisit the role of resident perifollicular macrophages (pfMACs) located in the hair follicle (HF) mesenchyme (CTS). Substantial, stringently timed fluctuations in the number and localization of pfMACs were first observed long ago during murine HF morphogenesis and cycling. This already suggested some involvement of these innate immunocytes, with a recognized role in tissue remodelling and in hair growth control. The relatively recent demonstration of a Wnt signalling-driven crosstalk between these immunocytes and HF epithelial stem cells in telogen HFs, which promotes anagen induction, has reinvigorated interest in the role that pfMAC plays in hair biology. Besides the apoptosis-associated secretion of stem cell-activating Wnts and the differential secretion of HF-targeting growth factors such as FGF-5 and FGF5s from pfMACs, we also explore how MAC polarization, and thus function, may be influenced by the local metabolic and immune environment. Moreover, we examine how pfMACs may contribute to hair cycle-associated angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, HF immune privilege and immunopathology. On this basis, we discuss why targeting pfMACs may be relevant in the management of hair growth disorders. Finally, we argue that studying pfMACs offers an excellent, clinically relevant model system for characterizing and experimentally manipulating MAC interactions with an easily accessible mammalian, continuously remodelled (mini-)organ under both physiological and pathological conditions."

Here, we have evaluated the level of DNA methylation and expressions of related genes in mice spermatozoa. The spermatozoa were divided into three groups: fresh, spermatozoa incubated at room temperature (RT) and 37°C for 24 hr. The sperm chromatin structure assay was used to determine the DNA fragmentation index (DFI), and DNA methylation was analysed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of DNA methylation-related genes were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). According to the results, we observed significantly higher sperm progressive motility and viability in the group incubated at RT compared to the spermatozoa incubated at 37°C (p < 0.05). Spermatozoa incubated at 37°C had a higher DFI compared to the other groups (p < 0.05), but the DNA methylation level significantly decreased (p < 0.05). qRT-PCR analysis showed increased Dnmt-1 expression in spermatozoa after 24-hr incubation at 37°C. However, there were significantly higher expression levels of Dnmt-3l, Dnmt-3a and Dnmt-3b after incubation at both RT and 37°C compared to the fresh group (p < 0.05).

To this end, quantitative proteomics represents a powerful tool but an optimal solution for reliable large-cohort proteomics analysis, as frequently involved in pharmaceutical/clinical investigations, is urgently needed. Large-cohort analysis remains challenging owing to the deteriorating quantitative quality and snowballing missing data and false-positive discovery of altered proteins when sample size increases. MS1 ion current-based methods, which have become an important class of label-free quantification techniques during the past decade, show considerable potential to achieve reproducible protein measurements in large cohorts with high quantitative accuracy/precision. Nonetheless, in order to fully unleash this potential, several critical prerequisites should be met. Here we provide an overview of the rationale of MS1-based strategies and then important considerations for experimental and data processing techniques, with the emphasis on (i) efficient and reproducible sample preparation and LC separation; (ii) sensitive, selective and high-resolution MS detection; iii)accurate chromatographic alignment; (iv) sensitive and selective generation of quantitative features; and (v) optimal post-feature-generation data quality control. Prominent technical developments in these aspects are discussed. Finally, we reviewed applications of MS1-based strategy in disease mechanism studies, biomarker discovery, and pharmaceutical investigations.","Intravenous antazoline, a first-generation antihistaminic drug with antiarrhythmic properties, is a suitable agent for pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation induced during pulmonary vein isolation due to the lack of influence on atrio-venous conduction and high clinical effectiveness (AntaEP Study).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30920001,British journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 05 23,"Antazoline is a first-generation antihistaminic drug used primarily in eye drop formulations.

Independent reassortment of parental chromosomes and their recombination leads to ample genetic variability among the gametes. Importantly, new mutations also occur during meiosis, at frequencies much higher than during the mitotic cell cycles. These meiotic mutations are associated with genetic recombination and depend on double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate crossing over. Indeed, sequence variation among related strains is greater around recombination hotspots than elsewhere in the genome, presumably resulting from recombination-associated mutations. Significantly, enhanced mutagenicity in meiosis may lead to faster divergence during evolution, as germ-line mutations are the ones that are transmitted to the progeny and thus have an evolutionary impact. The molecular basis for mutagenicity in meiosis may be related to the repair of meiotic DSBs by polymerases, or to the exposure of single-strand DNA to mutagenic agents during its repair.",Relationship Between Bone Mineral Density T-Score and Nonvertebral Fracture Risk Over 10 Years of Denosumab Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919997,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2019 06 07,"Although treat-to-target strategies are being discussed in osteoporosis, there is little evidence of what the target should be to reduce fracture risk maximally. We investigated the relationship between total hip BMD T-score and the incidence of nonvertebral fracture in women who received up to 10 years of continued denosumab therapy in the FREEDOM (3 years) study and its long-term Extension (up to 7 years) study. We report the percentages of women who achieved a range of T-scores at the total hip or femoral neck over 10 years of denosumab treatment (1343 women completed 10 years of treatment). The incidence of nonvertebral fractures was lower with higher total hip T-score. This relationship plateaued at a T-score between -2.0 and -1.5 and was independent of age and prevalent vertebral fractures, similar to observations in treatment-naïve subjects. Reaching a specific T-score during denosumab treatment was dependent on the baseline T-score, with higher T-scores at baseline more likely to result in higher T-scores at each time point during the study. Our findings highlight the importance of follow-up BMD measurements in patients receiving denosumab therapy because BMD remains a robust indicator of fracture risk. These data support the notion of a specific T-score threshold as a practical target for therapy in osteoporosis.",Harmonizing work history data in epidemiologic studies with overlapping employment records.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919995,American journal of industrial medicine,2019 04 29,Work history data often require major data management including handling of overlapping jobs to avoid overestimating exposure before linkage to job-exposure matrices (JEMs) is possible.,New tools for engineering tomorrow's forests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919994,Physiologia plantarum,2019 04 29,"It is difficult to overstate the role of wood in the story of humanity.

We investigated the presence of these hypothetical splenic cells with stem cell characteristics and identified adherent cells forming densely-packed colonies (Splenic Adherent Colony-forming Cell; SACC) in the spleen. Splenic Adherent Colony-forming Cell was positive for alkaline phosphatase staining and stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-1 antigen. However, the self-renewal properties of SACCs were limited because they stopped cell proliferation once colonies visible to the naked eye were formed. Gene expression analyses by semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed the significant expression of c-Myc and Klf4, whereas faint or no expression was evident for Nanog, Oct3/4, and Sox2. Global expression analyses by DNA microarray and subsequent gene ontology analyses revealed that the expression levels of genes related to the immune system were significantly lower in SACCs than in control splenic cells. In contrast, genes unrelated to the immune system, such as those involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance, were relatively highly expressed in SACCs compared with control splenic cells. Taken together, we identified a novel cell type residing in the spleen that is different from the hypothetical splenic stem cell, but which bears some, but not all, characteristics that represent an undifferentiated state.",Regulatory networks upon neurogenesis induction in PC12 cell line by small molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919969,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 28,"Alteration in the normal regulatory pathway of differentiation can lead to the induction of programmed cell death. Accordingly, some chemicals like staurosporine, nerve growth factor, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide, and trimethyltin are shown to be able to induce differentiation in vitro, via different mechanisms in the PC12 cell line. Hence, understanding the details of the molecular mechanisms of differentiation induction by these small molecules are important for further application of these molecules in neurogenesis. Therefore, we sought to determine these signaling pathways, using gene regulatory networks analysis. Then, we have conducted a comparative analysis of the alterations in the gene expression pattern of the PC12 cell lines in response to these chemicals at the early stages.

In this study, we focused on how 5-HT enhances postsynaptic glutamatergic responses in the dendrites of the jaw-closing motoneurons. We demonstrate that 5-HT augments glutamatergic signalling by enhancing the function of the GluN2A-containing NMDA receptor (NMDAR) through the activation of 5-HT2A receptors (5-HT2A Rs) and Src kinase. To enhance glutamatergic responses, activation of the 5-HT2A Rs must occur within ∼60 μm of the location of the glutamate responses. 5-HT inputs to the jaw-closing motoneurons can significantly vary their input-output relationship, which may contribute to wide-range regulation of contractile forces of the jaw-closing muscles.",Targeting siRNA in colorectal cancer therapy: Nanotechnology comes into view.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919964,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 28,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as one of the most important causes of death and mortality worldwide. Although several efforts have been made for finding new therapies, no achievements have been made in this area. Multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms are one of the key factors that could lead to the failure of chemotherapy. Moreover, it has been shown that various chemotherapy drugs are associated with several side effects. Hence, it seems that finding new drugs or new therapeutic platforms is required. Among different therapeutic approaches, utilization of nanoparticles (NPs) for targeting a variety of molecules such as siRNAs are associated with good results for the treatment of CRC. Targeting siRNA-mediated NPs could turn off the effects of oncogenes and MDR-related genes. In the current study, we summarized various siRNAs targeted by NPs which could be used for the treatment of CRC.

This is evidenced by the emergence of Critical Mixed Race Studies (CMRS) as a distinct field of academic inquiry. However, despite the growth of CMRS, there remains a scarcity of scholarship that considers mixed-race experiences from a disaggregated, intersectional perspective. Where CMRS has been attentive to the intersection of gender, the focus has largely been on women and femininity. By way of a response, in this article I draw upon data from semi-structured interviews with Black mixed-race men in the UK and the US in order to explore how Black mixed-race men negotiate their raced and gendered identities, particularly in the context of schooling. Drawing upon George Yancy's (2017) theorizations of the Black monster, I argue that a sense of double consciousness (and even multiple consciousness) means Black mixed-race men are acutely aware of how the white gaze threatens to fragment and erase them. Yet rather than being passive victims of racism, I show that, through hybridity, the imposition of the Black monster stereotype is something that Black mixed-race men are able to resist, modify and manipulate for their own ends.",State Physical Education Policy Changes From 2001 to 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919961,The Journal of school health,2019 05 06,State policies influence the quantity and quality of educational programs delivered in schools.

To explore the risk factors, we retrospectively identified 817 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HSCT from 2005 to 2016 in this largest single centre cohort from National Taiwan Univerisity Hospital. Transplants using donors or recipients positive for HBsAg or HBV DNA were excluded, leaving 445 rHBV patients for analysis. The 3- and 5-year cumulative incidence of HBV-RS after allo-HSCT was 8·7% and 10·5%, respectively, at a median 16 months after allo-HSCT. All had concurrent HBV reactivation. HBV flares developed in 19% of HBV-RS cases, but none experienced hepatic failure. Neither did it impact non-relapse mortality or overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with donor lacking hepatitis B surface antibody and extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) have the highest risk for HBV-RS, with 5-year incidence of 24·2%. In conclusion, adoptive immunity transfer from the donor seems to have protective effects against HBV-RS, which may alter future donor selection algorithms, and combined with extensive cGVHD provides a good target for risk-adaptive HBV prophylaxis.",Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis in children.

This study examined associations among socioeconomic background, home linguistic input, brain structure, and reading skills in 5-to-9-year-old children (N = 94). Naturalistic home audio recordings and high-resolution, T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired. Children who experienced more adult-child conversational turns or adult words had greater left perisylvian cortical surface area. Language input mediated the association between parental education and left perisylvian cortical surface area. Language input was indirectly associated with children's reading skills via left perisylvian surface area. Left perisylvian surface area mediated the association between parental education and children's reading skills. Language experience may thus partially explain socioeconomic disparities in language-supporting brain structure and in turn reading skills.",Does Exposure to Code-Switching Influence Language Performance in Bilingual Children?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919944,Child development,2019 04 30,"This study investigated whether the effect of exposure to code-switching on bilingual children's language performance varied depending on verbal working memory (WM). A large sample of school-aged Spanish-English bilingual children (N = 174, Mage  = 7.78) was recruited, and children were administered language measures in English and Spanish. The frequency with which the children were exposed to code-switching was gathered through parent report. For children with high verbal WM, greater exposure to code-switching was associated with higher levels of language ability. In contrast, for children with lower verbal WM, greater exposure to code-switching was associated with lower levels of language ability. These findings indicate that children's cognitive processing capacity dictates whether exposure to code-switching facilitates or hinders language skills.",Using multidimensional item response theory to evaluate how response styles impact measurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919943,The British journal of mathematical and statistical psychology,2019 04 04,"Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) models for response style (e.g., Bolt, Lu, & Kim, 2014, Psychological Methods, 19, 528; Falk & Cai, 2016, Psychological Methods, 21, 328) provide flexibility in accommodating various response styles, but often present difficulty in isolating the effects of response style(s) from the intended substantive trait(s). In the presence of such measurement limitations, we consider several ways in which MIRT models are nevertheless useful in lending insight into how response styles may interfere with measurement for a given test instrument. Such a study can also inform whether alternative design considerations (e.g., anchoring vignettes, self-report items of heterogeneous content) that seek to control for response style effects may be helpful. We illustrate several aspects of an MIRT approach using real and simulated analyses.",Risk of hospitalised bleeding in comparisons of oral anticoagulant options for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919942,British journal of haematology,2019 06 10,"Understanding of the comparative bleeding risks of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapies for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is limited. Therefore, among anticoagulant-naïve VTE patients, we conducted comparisons of apixaban, rivaroxaban and warfarin on the rate of hospitalised bleeding within 180 days of OAC initation. MarketScan databases for the time-period from 2011 to 2016 were used and, for each OAC comparison, new users were matched with up to five initiators of a different OAC. The final analysis included 83 985 VTE patients, who experienced 1944 hospitalised bleeding events. In multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models, rate of hospitalised bleeding was lower among new users of apixaban when compared to new users of rivaroxaban [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 0·58 (0·41-0·80)] or warfarin [0·68 (0·50-0·92)]. Overall, the hospitalised bleeding rate was similar when comparing new users of rivaroxaban to new users of warfarin [0·98 (0·68-1·11)], though there was some suggestion that rivaroxaban was associated with lower bleeding risk among younger individuals. Findings from this large real-world population concur with results from the randomised trial which found lower bleeding risk with apixaban versus warfarin and, for the first time, reveal a lower risk of bleeding in a comparison of apixaban versus rivaroxaban.","A phase III randomized, multicentre, double blind, active controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of two different anagrelide formulations in patients with essential thrombocythaemia - the TEAM-ET 2·0 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919941,British journal of haematology,2019 05 06,"Anagrelide is an established treatment option for essential thrombocythaemia (ET).

In a 6 to 12-week titration period the individual dose for the consecutive 4-week maintenance period was identified. The primary endpoint was the mean platelet count during the maintenance period (3 consecutive measurements, day 0, 14, 28). Of 112 included patients 106 were randomized. The mean screening platelet counts were 822 × 109 /l (95% confidence interval (CI) 707-936 × 109 /l) and 797 × 109 /l (95% CI 708-883 × 109 /l) for A-PR and the reference product, respectively.

Similarly, haemostatic regulation of clot growth and size is exquisitely controlled by a series of anticoagulant 'checkpoints', that exert their inhibitory activity at distinct stages in the steps leading to clot formation. Although the major plasma protein constituents required for haemostasis have now been largely elucidated and the molecular events that lead to clot formation are well understood, defining a fuller appreciation of the importance, location and regulation of each haemostatic process remains a fertile area of ongoing research. In this review article, we first provide an overview of the original 'waterfall' or 'cascade' hypothesis of blood coagulation as it was defined in the 1960s. We subsequently discuss how this original model has been refined over time to incorporate accumulating data that has enabled a more nuanced consideration of the role of specific proteins, receptors and lipids in dictating the spatial and temporal development of a blood clot."

This capability is made possible by the persistence throughout the lifespan of these animals of a population of pluripotent stem cells known as neoblasts. Planarian neoblasts include both pluripotent stem cells and specialized lineage-committed progenitors that give rise to all mature cell types during regeneration and homeostatic cell turnover. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate neoblast differentiation. A recent study demonstrated that Smed-egfr-1, a homologue of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, is required for final differentiation, but not specification, of gut progenitor cells into mature cells. Given the expression by planarians of several EGFR homologues, it has been proposed that these homologues may have diverged functionally to regulate the differentiation of distinct cell types in these animals. In this study, we investigated the role of Smed-egfr-4 in eye regeneration. Compared with controls, animals in which this gene was silenced by RNA interference (RNAi) regenerated smaller eyes. Moreover, the numbers of both mature eye cell types, photoreceptor neurons and cells of the pigment cup, were significantly reduced in Smed-egfr-4(RNAi) animals. By contrast, these animals exhibited an increase in the numbers of eye progenitor cells expressing the specific markers Smed-ovo and Smed-sp6-9. These results suggest that Smed-egfr-4 is required not for the specification of eye progenitor cells but for their final differentiation, and support the view that in planarians the EGFR pathway might play a general role in regulating the differentiation of lineage-committed progenitors.","Preparation of a fish embryo for micromanipulation: staging of development, removal of the chorion and traceability of PGCs in Prochilodus lineatus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919916,The International journal of developmental biology,2019 03 28,"The transplantation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is a valuable tool for gene-banking and reconstitution by means of a germline chimera.

In order to visualize PGCs in vivo, artificial GFP-nos1 3'UTR mRNA was injected and the migration route was observed in vivo as PGCs were visualized firstly at the segmentation stage (6 to 13 somites). The number of GFP positive cells ranged from 8 to 20 per embryo (mean of 13.8; n = 5). After hatching, GFP-positive cells increased to 14 to 27 embryos (mean of 19.8; n = 5). Visualization of the GFP-positive cells was possible at 10 days post hatching, and at this stage, the cells were positioned in the yolk extension region. This is the first report on PGC visualization in vivo in Neotropical fish; the obtained data provide information on the identification and migration of PGCs. The information presented in this work brings new insights in gene banking in Neotropical species and subsequent reconstitution through a germinal germline chimera.","Functional analysis of Arabidopsis and maize transgenic lines overexpressing the ADP-ribose/NADH pyrophosphohydrolase, AtNUDX7.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919915,The International journal of developmental biology,2019 03 28,"The conserved poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PAR) pathway consists of three genetic components that are potential targets to modulate the plant's energy homeostasis upon stress with the aim to improve yield stability in crops and help secure food supply. We studied the role of the PAR pathway component ADP-ribose/NADH pyrophosphohydrolase (AtNUDX7) in yield and mild drought stress by using a transgenic approach in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize (Zea mays). Arabidopsis AtNUDX7 cDNA was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and maize by means of the constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter and the strong constitutive Brachypodium distachyon pBdEF1α promoter, respectively. Overexpression of AtNUDX7 in Arabidopsis improved seed parameters that were measured by a novel, automated method, accelerated flowering and reduced inflorescence height. This combination of beneficial traits suggested that AtNUDX7 overexpression in Arabidopsis might enhance the ADP-ribose recycling step and maintain energy levels by supplying an ATP source in the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation energy homeostasis pathway. Arabidopsis and maize lines with high, medium and low overexpression levels of the AtNUDX7 gene were analysed in automated platforms and the inhibition of several growth parameters was determined under mild drought stress conditions. The data showed that the constitutive overexpression of the Arabidopsis AtNUDX7 gene in Arabidopsis and maize at varying levels did not improve tolerance to mild drought stress, but knocking down AtNUDX7 expression did, however at the expense of general growth under normal conditions.",Axis elongation during Xenopus tail-bud stage is regulated by GABA expressed in the anterior-to-mid neural tube.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919914,The International journal of developmental biology,2019 03 28,"The receptors of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a well-known neurotransmitter, are expressed in the anterior-to-mid neural tube at an early stage of Xenopus development, but there has been no report on the role of GABA in the presumptive central nervous system. Therefore, we tried to reveal the function of GABA for Xenopus early embryogenesis. We first confirmed that the region expressing a gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase 1 (gad1), which is an enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-glutamate to GABA, overlapped with that of several genes encoding GABA receptors (gabr) in the neural tube. Metabolome analysis of culture medium of dorsal tail-bud explants containing the neural tube region of tail-bud stage embryos also revealed that GABA was expressed at this stage. Then, we examined the treatment of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and picrotoxin (PTX), which are known as inhibitors of GABA receptors (GABA-R), on the early stages of Xenopus embryogenesis, and found that axis elongation in the tail-bud was inhibited by both treatments, and these phenotypic effects were rescued by co-treatment with GABA. Moreover, our spatial- and temporal-specific inhibitor treatments revealed that the gabr- and gad1-overlapped region, which presents at the anterior-to-mid neural tube during the tail-bud stages, was much more sensitive to PTZ and thus caused severe inhibition of axis elongation. Taken together, our results indicate that the small ligand molecule GABA functions as a regulator to induce the axis elongation event in the tail-bud during early embryogenesis via direct stimulation of the neural tube and indirect stimulation of the surrounding area.",Latrophilin2 is involved in neural crest cell migration and placode patterning in Xenopus laevis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919913,The International journal of developmental biology,2019 03 28,"Latrophilin2 (Lphn2) is an adhesion-class of G protein-coupled receptor with an unknown function in development. Here, we show that Xenopus laevis lphn2 (Xlphn2) is involved in the migration and differentiation of neural crest (NC) cells and placode patterning in Xenopus laevis embryos. Although Xlphn2 mRNA was detected throughout embryogenesis, it was expressed more abundantly in the placode region. Morpholino antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of Xlphn2 caused abnormal migration of NC cells, irregular epibranchial placode segmentation, and defective cartilage formation. Transplantation of fluorescently-labeled NC regions of wild-type embryos into Xlphn2 morpholino-injected embryos reproduced the defective NC cell migration, indicating that Xlphn2 regulates the migration of NC cells in a non-cell autonomous manner. Our results suggest that Xlphn2 is essential for placode patterning and as a guidance molecule for NC cells.",Genital disc growth in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919912,The International journal of developmental biology,2019 03 28,"Prior to completion, apoptosis causes the secretion of different signals, including proliferative signals. Signaling associated with death was discovered in Drosophila and mostly characterized by the induction of experimental death. Thus, less is known about physiological death. Here, we analyzed physiological death in the genital disc, a structure with bilateral symmetry, in different growth scenarios. To this end, we prevented or promoted death in regions or in genetic mosaics. We observed that physiological death in the genital disc was associated with proliferative signals and that both processes were JNK-dependent. The proliferative signals promoted growth in the genitalia primordia but not in the analia. Due to the proliferative signaling, the prevention of death that produced undead cells provoked asymmetric growth, high variability in proliferation, and size reduction. Death can occur in the absence of JNK but without signaling. JNK is fundamental for growth and death associated with signaling."

The question addressed was: 'In patients with a pectus excavatum deformity, is vacuum bell therapy (VBT) an effective treatment?' Altogether, 19 papers were found using the reported search of which 7 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical questions. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Numerous groups have demonstrated the utility of VBT in pectus excavatum; the largest series has followed up patients over 13 years with sternal elevation of >1 cm being demonstrated in 105 patients. Initial age <11, initial chest wall depth <1.5 cm and chest wall flexibility have all been associated with better outcomes. The effects of VBT have been confirmed on computed tomography scanning and intraoperatively to lift the sternum to facilitate retrosternal soft tissue dissection during the Nuss procedure. There was significant heterogeneity in the studies reviewed, in terms of patient age, selection criteria, the VBT protocol, length of follow-up time following completion of VBT and the metrics used to assess success of therapy. VBT is a safe therapy for treating pectus excavatum in a non-surgical conservative manner with few complications reported. However, the success of VBT is largely dependent on patient compliance and motivation. Permanence of correction after completion of VBT needs to be properly assessed through rigorous follow-up, and currently the success of correction, i.e. permanence, remains in the hands of the patient.","Change in Policy Allowing Overlapping Surgery Decreases Length of Stay in an Academic, Safety-Net Hospital.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919890,"Operative neurosurgery (Hagerstown, Md.)",2019 03 28,The practice of surgeons running overlapping operating rooms has recently come under scrutiny.,Increased rotational flow in the proximal aortic arch is associated with its dilation in bicuspid aortic valve disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919887,European heart journal cardiovascular Imaging,2019 03 28,"Aortic dilation in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) might extend to the proximal arch.

The structure of electrospun nanofibers strongly influences their properties and functionalities. In polymeric nanofibers X-ray scattering and diffraction methods, i.e. SAXS and WAXD, are capable of decoding their structural insights from about 100 nm down to the Angström scale. Here, we present a comprehensive X-ray scattering and diffraction based study and introduce new data analysis approaches to unveil detailed structural features in electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDFhfp) nanofiber membranes. Particular emphasis was placed on anisotropic morphologies being developed during the nanofiber fabrication process. Global analysis was performed on SAXS data to derive the nanofibrillar structure of repeating lamella crystalline domains with average dimensions of 12.5 nm thickness and 7.8 nm spacing along with associated tie-molecules. The varying surface roughness of the nanofiber was evaluated by extracting the Porod exponent in parallel and perpendicular direction to the nanofiber axis, which was further validated by Atomic Force Microscopy. Additionally, the presence of a mixture of the monoclinic alpha and the orthorhombic beta PVDFhfp phases both exhibiting about 6% larger unit cells compared to the corresponding pure PVDF phases was derived from WAXD.

Our results showed that daily supplementation of VCO (20% of food) for 16 weeks significantly (p < 0.05) ameliorates some deleterious effects caused by alloxan. VCO reduced the diabetes-related increase in food (82.15 ± 1.49 vs. 145.51 ± 4.81 g per kg b.m. per day) and water (305.49 ± 6.09 vs. 583.98 ± 14.80 mL per kg b.m. per day) intake, and the decrease in the body mass gain (0.56 ± 0.16 vs. -2.13 ± 0.49 g per 100 g b.m. per week). In all three tissues, diabetes caused an increase in the concentration of total glutathione and sulfhydryl groups, and catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities, without changes in superoxide dismutase activity. Glutathione peroxidase activity was increased in the kidneys and heart, but not in the liver of the diabetic animals, while glutathione reductase activity was increased in the liver and the kidneys, and not in the heart. The simultaneous VCO supplementation increased the concentration of the sulfhydryl group in all three tissues of diabetic animals and decreased the glutathione S-transferase activity and glutathione concentration, without affecting the glutathione reductase activity. In the liver of diabetic animals it decreased superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, in the heart catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, and in the kidney catalase activity only. The results of canonical discriminant analysis of oxidative stress parameters revealed that VCO exerts its effects in a tissue-specific manner.","A high-speed, high-performance, microfabricated comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatograph.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919866,Lab on a chip,2019 05 07,"A small, consumable-free, low-power, ultra-high-speed comprehensive GC×GC system consisting of microfabricated columns, nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) cantilever resonators for detection, and a valve-based stop-flow modulator is demonstrated.

To realize this prospect, devices with high power density and low-frequency response capability are highly desired. Here, an open-book-like triboelectric nanogenerator with enhanced power density and high responsivity to wave agitations is presented. The device efficiently integrates a large number of TENG units into an open-book-like structure in a limited space, greatly improving the volume density of the microstructured contact interface. A mechanism of force conduction chain is proposed for the first time to effectively drive multiple stacked TENG units. For a device with 50 units, the transferred charges can reach 26 μC and the short-circuit current is 0.45 mA, which should set new records among similar devices. The design of the roll-swing oscillator demonstrates a nonlinear feature in the elasticity with double energy minima, enabling a wide frequency response at low frequencies which is crucial for harvesting wave energy. When agitated by water waves, the roll-swing oscillator can respond effectively to the excitation and drive the stacked TENG units with the assistance of the force conduction chain. A high peak power density of 7.45 W m-3 and an average power density of 0.335 W m-3 in water were obtained. Such high performance of the device makes it an excellent candidate for constructing self-powered marine systems or large-scale wave energy harvesting farms to realize the blue energy dream.","Cascade Rh(ii) and Yb(iii) catalyzed synthesis of substituted naphthofurans via transannulation of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles with β-naphthols.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919843,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 15,"An efficient cascade Rh(ii) and Yb(iii) catalyzed transannulation of N-sulfonyl-1,2,3-triazoles with β-naphthols has been accomplished for the synthesis of substituted naphthofurans in good yields.

The proposed modifications are the following: (i) substitution of the carbonyl oxygen atom, (ii) insertion of heteroatoms in the carbon backbone, and (iii) introduction of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents in different positions of the rings. This work shows how specific modifications of the electronic structure can be used to tune the electrochemistry and photophysics of the quinones, improving their suitability to be singlet fission sensitizers and cathode materials. As it was previously known, intermediate diradical characters favor the accomplishment of the singlet fission process. This can be achieved for 1,5-anthraquinone by introduction of B and Si atoms and electron-donating groups in low spin density positions of the carbon backbone or N atoms in high spin density positions. The introduction of heteroatoms or substituents in 9,10-anthraquinone hardly facilitates the singlet fission process.

Key elements of investigation include formal vision and hearing testing, chromosomal microarray, Fragile-X DNA testing and first-tier testing for treatable inborn errors of metabolism. Brain imaging is recommended in the presence of specific neurological findings.","School, child care and camp exclusion policies for chickenpox: A rational approach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919830,Paediatrics & child health,2019 04 01,"Widespread varicella vaccination in Canada since 2007 has changed the epidemiology of chickenpox, with a significant decline in varicella-related hospitalizations. However, there will always be a varicella-susceptible population because of immune-compromising treatments or conditions and/or parental vaccine refusal. This document updates and replaces a 1999 statement by the Canadian Paediatric Society. The CPS position on school and child care exclusion policies has not changed since the original statement, but because there have been two published reports of varicella outbreaks associated with summer camp attendance since 1999, this revision provides additional recommendations to mitigate risk for varicella transmission at summer camps.",A systematic review of the health impacts of occupational exposure to wildland fires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919829,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,2019 05 21,"The aim of the paper is to summarize the evidence of health impacts of occupational exposure to wildland fires. The authors searched 3 databases for relevant articles and screened the results. After full-text review, articles were included based on pre-determined criteria. The authors identified 32 relevant articles. Occupational exposure to wildland fires affects lung function in the short term and may increase the risk of hypertension in the long term. Exposure to wildland fires is also associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms. There was insufficient evidence to comment on most longer-term risks, and in particular on respiratory disease or cancer risks. Further research is required to understand whether occupational exposure to wildland fires results in clinically significant impacts on respiratory function, and to further clarify the relationship between occupational exposure and blood pressure, mental health, and cancer outcomes.

Intestinal tuberculosis could have intestinal ulcers, strictures, hypertrophic lesions like polyps and may be complicated by perforation, bleeding, and intestinal obstruction. Crohn's disease is an important differential of intestinal tuberculosis which is closely mimics intestinal tuberculosis in clinical, endoscopic, radiological and histological presentation. Crohn's disease is known to have a fistulising variant. We report the case of 23 year old lady who had disseminated tuberculosis with intestinal involvement and seemed to improve on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) but present with intestinal obstruction in the third month of ATT. Surgical exploration revealed clumping of bowel loops with multiple ileo-ileal fistulae. The case is presented because of the presence of entero-enteric fistulae and also because it demonstrated that intestinal tuberculosis may need surgical intervention even after initial improvement because of complications like intestinal obstruction.",Oxidative stress in proliferative lesions of parathyroid gland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919817,Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,2019 03 28,"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is one of the most common endocrine disorders and defined as excessive secretion of parathormone. PHPT is a risk factor of several cardiovascular diseases, which could be caused by alterations in oxidant-antioxidant balance.",Intraperitoneal alloplasty combined with the anterior separation technique in giant incisional hernias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919816,Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,2019 03 28,"The use of the anterior technique for abdominal wall components separation combined with ""onlay"" alloplasty (ACST + onlay) in giant incisional hernias (IH) may pose a surgical challenge as it does not exclude increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and the occurrence of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). There remains a high incidence of surgical site complications. In our view, the use of intra-abdominal alloplasty combined with anterior separation of the anterior abdominal wall components (ACST + IPOM) will contribute to the improvement of surgical outcomes in giant IH.","Postoperative pain relief in general surgery - recommendations of the Association of Polish Surgeons, Polish Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Therapy, Polish Association for the Study of Pain and Polish Association of Regional Anaesthesia and Pain Treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919814,Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,2019 04 01,"It is estimated that there are over 310 million surgeries performed in the world every year. Appropriate analgesic management in the perioperative period constitutes a fundamental right of every patient, significantly reducing the number of postoperative complications and the time and costs of hospitalization, particularly in the high-risk group of patients (ASA III-V) subject to extensive surgical procedures and hospitalized in intensive care units. Despite such significant arguments speaking for the conduct of effective analgesia in the perioperative period, nearly 79% of patients operated in hospitalization settings and 71% of patients operated in outpatient settings (so-called first day surgery) experienced postoperative pain of moderate, strong or extreme intensity. Hence, effective relief of postoperative pain should constitute one of the priorities of integrated, modern perioperative management, the components of which apart from adequate analgesia involve early nutrition through the alimentary canal, early patient activation and active physiotherapy. In the currently published ""Guidelines"", a team of authors has updated the previous ""Recommendations"" primarily in terms of methods for optimizing postoperative pain relief and new techniques and drugs introduced for postoperative pain therapy in recent years. The algorithms of postoperative pain management in different treatment categories were also updated.",Management of hard-to-heal wounds arising as a result of surgical oncology treatment- usage of the modern wound dressings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919813,Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,2019 03 28,"The problem of hard-to-heal wounds concerns 1-1.5% of the total population and about 3% of the population above 60 years of age. The risk factors associated with impaired wound healing are diabetes, arterial and venous insufficiency, advanced atherosclerosis, obesity, and inadequate wound supply. As a result of these pathological processes may develop localized wound infection, disseminated infection, tissue necrosis, and even chronic inflammation carcinogenesis. In the group of patients with malignant tumors, there are wounds arising in the course of the underlying disease and as a result of medical treatment. Wound healing is a significant problem and is often complicated due to the patient's general condition, comorbidities and complex treatment of cancer, which includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Radiotherapy used for local-regional control of disease after surgical treatment has a negative effect on healing by causing fibrosis of tissues and blood vessels damage, while chemotherapy interferes with the process of cell proliferation.",Can the leukocyte`s parameters in peripheral blood smear predict risk of in-hospital death of patients undergoing high-risk gastrointestinal surgery?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919812,Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,2019 03 28,"White blood cell (WBC) count constitutes a part of routine peripheral blood examination (FBC, full blood count). Precise analysis of leukocytes' parameters in blood smear is usually performed only when leukopenia or leukocytosis is found. We aimed to assess the usefulness of leukocytes' smear test in predicting in-hospital death of patients undergoing high-risk gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. Materials &amp; Methods. We prospectively enrolled 101 subjects undergoing high-risk GI surgery from 01.01.2017 till 31.12.2017. Blood tests were performed preoperatively, with analysis focused on the assessment of total WBC count, as well as the count of neutrophils (NEUT), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MONO), eosinophils (EOS) and basophils (BASO). Indices of NEUT/LYM (NLR) and MONO/LYM (MLR) were calculated. In-hospital mortality was considered the outcome.",Statement of the expert group on the current practice and prospects for the treatment of complex perirectal fistulas in the course of Crohn's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919811,Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,2019 03 28,"Perirectal fistulas in the course of Crohn's disease (CD) constitute an important problem in this group of patients. They are observed in a vast majority of patients with involvement through colorectal inflammation. Perirectal fistulas in CD present a great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the intensified clinical symptoms and worse prognosis than in the case of crypt originating fistulas. The condition for implementation of effective treatment of perirectal fistulas in the course of CD is the correct diagnosis, defining the anatomy of fistulas, presence of potential stenoses and inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment of these fistulas is difficult and requires close cooperation between the colorectal surgeon and the gastroenterologist. The combination of surgical and pharmacological treatment has higher efficacy compared to surgical treatment or pharmacotherapy alone. In conservative treatment, aminosalicylates and steroids are of minor importance, while chemotherapeutics, antibiotics, and thiopurines find application in daily clinical practice. TNF-α neutralizing antibodies such as infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA) or certolizumab (CER) prove to be the most effective. Surgical treatment may be provided as ad hoc; in this case, drainage procedures are recommended, usually with leaving a loose seton. Planned procedures consist in the excision of fistulas (simple fistulas) or performing more complex procedures, such as advancement flaps or ligation of the intersphincteric fistula tract Surgical measures can be complemented by the use of video technology (video-assisted anal fistula treatment VAAFT) or vacuum therapy. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to create the stoma. Treatment of perirectal fistulas includes adhesives or so-called plugs. High hopes may be associated with the introduction of stem cells into clinical practice, which is the administration of non-hematopoietic multipotent cells to the fistulas to induce the phenomenon of immunomodulation and tissue healing.",Non-surgical treatment of knee osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30919810,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,2019 04 11,"Knee osteoarthritis is one of the most common degenerative diseases causing disability in elderly patients.
