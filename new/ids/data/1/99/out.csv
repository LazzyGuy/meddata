Our study estimates the number of new cancer cases in France in 2015 attributable to IR exposure from medical procedures. Exposures from external (X-rays, CT scans, interventional radiology) and internal (nuclear medicine) sources were considered. We used 2007 national frequencies of diagnostic examinations by sex and age to estimate the lifetime organ dose exposure adjusted for changes in the use of such procedures over time. The Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII risk models were used to estimate the corresponding excess cancer risk, assuming an average latency period of 10 years. Additionally, we used cancer incidence data from the French Cancer Registries Network. Of the 346,000 estimated new cancer cases in adults in France in 2015, 2300 cases (940 among men and 1360 among women) were attributable to diagnostic IR, representing 0.7% of all new cancer cases (0.5% for men and 0.9% for women). The leading cancers attributable to medical IR were female breast (n = 560 cases), lung (n = 500 cases) and colon (n = 290 cases) cancers. Compared to other risk factors, the contribution of medical IR to the cancer burden is small, and the benefits largely outweigh its harms. However, some of these IR-associated cancer cases may be preventable through dose optimization of and enhanced justification for diagnostic examinations.",Multiple chromosomal rearrangements in a hybrid zone between Littorina saxatilis ecotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537056,Molecular ecology,2019 06 09,"Both classical and recent studies suggest that chromosomal inversion polymorphisms are important in adaptation and speciation. However, biases in discovery and reporting of inversions make it difficult to assess their prevalence and biological importance. Here, we use an approach based on linkage disequilibrium among markers genotyped for samples collected across a transect between contrasting habitats to detect chromosomal rearrangements de novo. We report 17 polymorphic rearrangements in a single locality for the coastal marine snail, Littorina saxatilis. Patterns of diversity in the field and of recombination in controlled crosses provide strong evidence that at least the majority of these rearrangements are inversions. Most show clinal changes in frequency between habitats, suggestive of divergent selection, but only one appears to be fixed for different arrangements in the two habitats. Consistent with widespread evidence for balancing selection on inversion polymorphisms, we argue that a combination of heterosis and divergent selection can explain the observed patterns and should be considered in other systems spanning environmental gradients.",Anaemia in pregnancy among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women of Far North Queensland: A retrospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537054,Nutrition & dietetics: the journal of the Dietitians Association of Australia,2018 12 11,"Anaemia during pregnancy is common worldwide.

A total of 74 sets of full pharmacokinetic profiles and 47 sets of MPA-sparing samples were collected from 102 renal transplant recipients who received oral EC-MPS. The MPA concentration was determined by an enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique, and the pathophysiologic data were recorded. The PPK model was constructed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling, and the limited sampling strategy models for MPA were established by using multiple regression analysis and the maximum a posteriori Bayesian assay based on 2 to 4 sampling time points following EC-MPS administration. The pharmacokinetics of MPA were best described by a 2-compartment model with a first-order absorption process and a lag time of absorption. The clearance of MPA was 12.3 ± 1.14 L/h. Comedicating with cyclosporine A was found to have a significant impact on the clearance/bioavailability of MPA (P < .01). Sampling strategies consisted of plasma concentration at 1.5, 2, 4 (C1.5-C2-C4) hours and 1.5, 2, 4, 6 (C1.5-C2-C4-C6) hours after EC-MPS administration were shown to be suitable for the estimation of the MPA area under the concentration-time curve in these patients. The PPK model was acceptable and can describe the pharmacokinetics of MPA in Chinese renal transplant recipients administered EC-MPS. The area under the concentration-time curve of MPA in Chinese renal transplant recipients could be estimated through a limited sampling strategy method, based on which individualized immunosuppressive regimens could be designed.",Selective Formation of Helical Tetrapyrrin-Fused Porphyrins by Oxidation of β-to-β Linked meso-Aminoporphyrin Dimers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537047,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 15,"Oxidation of β-to-β directly linked and sulfur-bridged meso-amino NiII -porphyrin dimers with PbO2 gave helical tetrapyrrin (biliverdin analogue)-fused NiII -porphyrins. These ring cleaving reactions differ markedly from the previously reported oxidation of a β-β linked NiII -porphyrin dimer carrying one amino group, which gave an azepine-fused porphyrin dimer. The tetrapyrrin-fused NiII -porphyrins display intense NIR absorption bands at 1200-1400 nm and reversible redox processes because of the highly π-conjugated networks and rigid structures. These tetrapyrrin-fused NiII -porphyrins were separated to stable enantiomers, which showed clear Cotton effects in their CD spectra with Δϵ of 102 order.",Recommendations for iliosacral screw placement in dysmorphic sacrum based on modified in-out-in corridors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537046,Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society,2019 03 28,"(1) Can iliosacral osseous corridor diameters in sacral dysmorphism be enlarged by in-out-in screw placement at the posterior iliosacral recessus? (2) Are lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV) the anatomical cause for sacral dysmorphism? (3) Are there sex-specific differences in sacral dysmorphism? 594 multislice CT scans were screened for sacral dysmorphism and 55 data-sets selected. Each pelvis was segmented manually and cylindrical iliosacral corridors (on the level of S1 and S2 vertebra) were semi-automatically determined. Corridor trajectories, -diameters and -lengths were measured. LSTV (Castellvi-type IIIb and IV) were found in 3 of 55 pelves and these lumbosacral variations are therefore not the anatomical basis for sacral dysmorphism. The prevalence of transsacral osseous corridors with diameters of <7.5 mm in axial CT images correlates with qualitative and quantitative criteria of sacral dysmorphism. Enlarging the osseous corridor diameters by penetration of the posterior iliosacral recessus increase the safe corridor diameters (females versus males) by 26% versus 15% at the level of S1- and 50% versus 48% at the level of S2-vertebra. Sex-specific differences for both corridors (osseous and in-out-in) were only found for the osseous corridor diameters at the level of S1 vertebra, being smaller in females (females versus males: 13.3 ± 3.6 mm versus 15.5 ± 3.8 mm, p = 0.04). Dysmorphic sacra can be reliably detected on standard axial CT slice images. Modified in-out-in corridors on the level of S1-vertebra allow screw placement in all patients, but is still demanding compared to non-dysmorphic sacra, due to the oblique corridor axis. Recommendations for intraoperative orientation for oblique screw placement are defined. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Orthop Res."

To improve the energy densities, the traditional methods include optimizing pore structures and modifying pseudocapacitive groups on the carbon materials. Here, another promising way is suggested, which has no adverse effects to the carbon materials, that is, constructing electron-rich regions on the electrode surfaces for absorbing cations as much as possible. For this aim, a series of hierarchical porous carbon materials are produced by calcinating carbon dots-hydrogel composites, which have controllable surface states including electron-rich regions. The optimal sample is employed as the negative electrode to fabricate hybrid supercapacitors, which show remarkable specific energy densities (up to 62.8-90.1 Wh kg-1 ) in different systems.","FAM83H-AS1 is associated with clinical progression and modulates cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in bladder cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537032,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 01 17,"FAM83H-AS1, also known as oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-3, is a novel lncRNA that has been suggested to be dysregulated in a variety of human cancers. However, the expression status and function of FAM83H-AS1 in bladder cancer are still unknown. The object of our study is to explore the clinical value of FAM83H-AS1 in patients with bladder cancer and the biological function of FAM83H-AS1 in bladder cancer cells. In our results, the expression of FAM83H-AS1 was obviously elevated in bladder cancer tissue samples and bladder cancer cell lines compared with adjacent normal tissue samples and normal bladder epithelial cell lines, respectively. In addition, high expression of FAM83H-AS1 was associated with advanced clinical stage and the presence of muscularis invasion and served as an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with bladder cancer. The loss-of-function study showed that silencing FAM83H-AS1 expression suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In conclusion, FAM83H-AS1 is involved in the progression of bladder cancer and serves as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for patients with bladder cancer.",Synthesis and characterization of novel substituted thiophene derivatives and discovery of their carbonic anhydrase and acetylcholinesterase inhibition effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537031,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,2019 05 01,"Novel substituted thiophene derivatives (1, 2a-e, 3, and 4) were synthesized and their structures were characterized by infrared radiation, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass analysis.

In one Mexican community, 95% of species recruit through facilitation; Mimosa luisana being a keystone nurse for many of them. M. luisana individuals manifest greater fitness when growing in association with their facilitated plants than when growing in isolation. This observation suggests that nurses also benefit from their facilitated plants, a benefit thought to be mediated by mycorrhizal fungi. Under field conditions, we experimentally tested whether mycorrhizal fungi mediate the increased fitness that M. luisana experiences when growing in association with its facilitated plants. We applied fungicide to the soil for nurse plants growing alone and growing in association with their facilitated plants in order to reduce the mycorrhizal colonisation of roots. We then assessed the quantity and quality of seed production of M. luisana in four treatments (isolated-control, isolated-fungicide, associated-control and associated-fungicide). Fungicide application reduced the percentage root length colonised by mycorrhizae and reduced fitness of M. luisana when growing in association with their facilitated plants but not when growing in isolation. This reduction was reflected in the total number of seeds, number of seeds per pod, seed mass and seed viability. These results suggest that nurses benefit from the presence of their facilitated plants through links established by mycorrhizae, indicating that both plants and belowground mutualistic communities are all part of one system, coexisting by means of intrinsically linked interactions.",Bimetallic Covalent Organic Frameworks for Constructing Multifunctional Electrocatalyst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537028,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 03 04,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a new class of crystalline porous polymers comprised mainly of carbon atoms, and are versatile for the integration of heteroatoms such as B, O, and N into the skeletons. The designable structure and abundant composition render COFs useful as precursors for heteroatom-doped porous carbons for energy storage and conversion. Herein, we describe a multifunctional electrochemical catalyst obtained through pyrolysis of a bimetallic COF. The catalyst possesses hierarchical pores and abundant iron and cobalt nanoparticles embedded with standing carbon layers. By integrating these features, the catalyst exhibits excellent electrochemical catalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with a 50 mV positive half-wave potential, a higher limited diffusion current density, and a much smaller Tafel slope than a Pt-C catalyst. Moreover, the catalyst displays superior electrochemical performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with overpotentials of -0.26 V and -0.33 V in acidic and alkaline aqueous solution, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 . The overpotential in the catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was 1.59 V at the same current density.",Exosomes in chronic inflammatory skin diseases and skin tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537027,Experimental dermatology,2019 03 13,"Exosomes are membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that can mediate communication between cells and the transport of cellular components such as microRNAs, mRNAs, proteins and DNA.

There are numerous studies on the functional segregation of N400 neural sources; however, the oscillatory dynamics of functional connections among the relevant sources has remained elusive. In this study we acquired magnetoencephalography data during a classic N400 paradigm, where the semantic predictability of a fixed target noun was manipulated in simple German sentences. We conducted inter-regional functional connectivity (FC) and time-frequency analysis on known regions of the semantic network, encompassing bilateral temporal, and prefrontal cortices. Increased FC was found in less predicted (LP) nouns compared with highly predicted (HP) nouns in three connections: (a) right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from 0 to 300 ms mainly within the alpha band, (b) left lateral orbitofrontal (LOF) and right IFG around 400 ms within the beta band, and (c) left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left LOF from 300 to 700 ms in the beta and low gamma bands. Furthermore, gamma spectral power (31-70 Hz) was stronger in HP nouns than in LP nouns in left anterior temporal cortices in earlier time windows (0-200 ms). Our findings support recent theories in language comprehension, suggesting fronto-temporal top-down connections are mainly mediated through beta oscillations while gamma band frequencies are involved in matching between prediction and input.",Towards the 150th Anniversary of the Markovnikov Rule.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537023,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 25,"The Markovnikov rule, known to every student of organic chemistry, was formulated 150 years ago, in 1869. During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry."

It has been found that immunosuppression associated with chronic inflammatory factors, such as growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines is generated by stroma and tumor cells. Chronic and exhaustive secretion of these mediators triggers the generation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) demonstrating one of the key players engaged in tumor immunosuppression. In point of fact, direct cell-to-cell contact is a prerequisite for immunosuppressive functions of MDSCs. From the clinical perspective, the frequency of peripheral blood MDSCs is correlated with clinical stage and therapeutic response in various cancers. Furthermore, MDSCs are involved in chemoresistant settings. Altogether, it is a rational therapeutic approach to block the fierce cycle in which MDSCs are developed and infiltrated to favor cancer progression. In this review, we will summarize recent findings of MDSCs in tumor progression and discuss potential therapeutic strategies that could be evaluated in future clinical trials.",HIV Disease Progression: Overexpression of the Ectoenzyme CD38 as a Contributory Factor?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537007,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",2019 06 10,"Despite abundant evidence associating CD38 overexpression and CD4 T cell depletion in HIV infection, no causal relation has been investigated. To address this issue, a series of mechanisms are proposed, supported by evidence from different fields, by which CD38 overexpression can facilitate CD4 T cell depletion in HIV infection. According to this model, increased catalytic activity of CD38 may reduce CD4 T cells' cytoplasmic nicotin-amide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), leading to a chronic Warburg effect. This will reduce mitochondrial function. Simultaneously, CD38's catalytic products ADPR and cADPR may be transported to the cytoplasm, where they can activate calcium channels and increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations, further altering mitochondrial integrity. These mechanisms will decrease the viability and regenerative capacity of CD4 T cells. These hypotheses can be tested experimentally, and might reveal novel therapeutic targets.

Residing in the specific regions in the skin such as epidermis, dermis and hair follicle, melanocytes perform an array of vital functions including defending the ultraviolet radiation and diversifying animal appearance. As one of the adult stem cells, melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle bulge niche can proliferate, differentiate and keep quiescence to control and coordinate tissue homeostasis, repair and regeneration. In synchrony with hair follicle stem cells, melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicles undergo cyclic activation, degeneration and resting phases, to pigment the hairs and to preserve the stem cells. Disorder of melanocytes results in severe skin problems such as canities, vitiligo and even melanoma. Here, we compare and summarize recent discoveries about melanocyte in the skin, particularly in the hair follicle. A better understanding of the physiological and pathological regulation of melanocyte and melanocyte stem cell behaviours will help to guide the clinical applications in regenerative medicine.","Significant antitumor effect of an antibody against TMEM180, a new colorectal cancer-specific molecule.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537002,Cancer science,2019 02 16,"The present state of therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is far from satisfactory, highlighting the need for new targets for this disease. We identified a new CRC-specific molecule, TMEM180, a predicted 11-pass transmembrane protein that apparently functions as a cation symporter. We developed an anti-TMEM180 mAb and then succeeded in humanizing the mAb. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) in CRC with the mAb showed a similar positivity rate as compared with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor mAb, and IHC with anti-TMEM180 mAb did not show staining in major organs used in this study. Immune electron microscopy clearly indicated that TMEM180 was present on the tumor exosome. The TMEM180 promoter region contains 10 hypoxia-responsive element consensus sequences; accordingly, SW480 cells upregulated TMEM180 under low-oxygen conditions. Anti-TMEM180 mAb has in vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity, and SW480 CRC xenografts were eradicated by the mAb.

Extensive studies have been carried out on numerous ureolytic bacterial species isolated from soils and sewage samples. However, very limited attention has been given to limestone caves with natural calcite formations as a possible source for isolation of ureolytic bacteria. In this study, bacterial isolates were recovered from limestone cave samples to determine their suitability for biocalcification. Twenty-seven morphologically distinct bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and their various genetic diversity was characterized according to their phylogenetic affiliations. Based on the molecular identification, Sporosarcina was the most abundant genus among all the ureolytic isolates, while the rest belonged to Pseudogracilibacillus and Bacillus genera. Analytical analysis on urease measurement showed that urease activities for the isolates ranged from 1·130 to 21·513 mol urea hydrolysed per minute, with isolate NB33 achieving the highest value and TSB4 achieving the lowest value. The estimated CaCO3 precipitates for the isolates ranged from 4·04 to 17·26 mg ml-1 , with isolate NB30 achieving the highest value and TSB20 achieving the lowest value. The findings in this study demonstrated that the ureolytic bacteria from limestone caves are promising bio-calcifying agents. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Ureolytic bacteria continues to play an important role as microbial tools used in geotechnical engineering for soil biocalcification. Microbial strains with the ability to produce urease enzyme and induce calcium carbonate mineral are often isolated from soil, water and sludge samples. However, screening for these essential microbes from extreme regions such as caves are rarely investigated. In this study, native bacteria which were isolated from limestone cave samples are identified and characterized. The findings suggested that these ureolytic bacterial isolates have the potential to serve as suitable alternative microbial agents for soil strengthening and stabilization.","AMD3100 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell invasion, and metastasis in the liver and the lung through blocking the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling pathway in prostate cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537000,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) have been found to be tightly correlated with the progression of prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the effects of an SDF-1α/CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100, on cell progression and metastasis potential of human PC cells. Human PC cell lines (LNCaP, PC3, and DU145) were cultured to detect SDF-1α/CXCR4, which showed higher SDF-1α and CXCR4 expression than the normal human prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1. AMD3100 was confirmed to be an inhibitor of SDF-1α, and to detect the effect of SDF-1α/CXCR4 inhibition on PC, PC cells were treated with AMD3100 or/and CXCR4 siRNA. The results suggested that inhibition of the SDF-1α/CXCR4 pathway could promote the E-cadherin level but inhibit the levels of invasion and migration of vimentin, N-cadherin and α5β1 integrin. Finally, tumor formation in nude mice was conducted, and the cell experiment results were verfied. These data show that AMD3100 suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition and migration of PC cells by inhibiting the SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling pathway, which provides a clinical target in the treatment of PC.",Structures and activities of widely conserved small prokaryotic aminopeptidases-P clarify classification of M24B peptidases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536999,Proteins,2019 02 19,"M24B peptidases cleaving Xaa-Pro bond in dipeptides are prolidases whereas those cleaving this bond in longer peptides are aminopeptidases-P. Bacteria have small aminopeptidases-P (36-39 kDa), which are diverged from canonical aminopeptidase-P of Escherichia coli (50 kDa). Structure-function studies of small aminopeptidases-P are lacking. We report crystal structures of small aminopeptidases-P from E. coli and Deinococcus radiodurans, and report substrate-specificities of these proteins and their ortholog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These are aminopeptidases-P, structurally close to small prolidases except for absence of dipeptide-selectivity loop. We noticed absence of this loop and conserved arginine in canonical archaeal prolidase (Maher et al., Biochemistry. 43, 2004, 2771-2783) and questioned its classification. Our enzymatic assays show that this enzyme is an aminopeptidase-P. Further, our mutagenesis studies illuminate importance of DXRY sequence motif in bacterial small aminopeptidases-P and suggest common evolutionary origin with human XPNPEP1/XPNPEP2.

Until now, remote thermal stimulation of responsive polymers has relied extensively on the use of nanocomposites wherein embedded nanoparticles/structures are selectively targeted for heating purposes. In this study, an alternative remote-heating mechanism demonstrates that the dielectric and resistive thermal losses introduced upon application of an alternating current generate sufficient heat to raise the temperature of a neat polyimide by over 70 °C within ≈10 s. Thermal imaging is used here to measure current-induced temperature changes of polymeric media, and a proposed analytical model yields predictions that compare reasonably well with experimental data, confirming that such remote heating is viable. Conditions permitting a shape-memory polymer possessing a melting transition and susceptible to dielectric actuation to achieve continuous electrostrain-temperature cycling are identified."

Our aim is to expand on current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance and provide data-driven food-effect study design recommendations specific to the oncology therapeutic area. Data for recently approved small-molecule oncology drugs was extracted from the clinical pharmacology review in the sponsor's FDA submission package. Information on subject selection, meal types, timing of the study relative to the pivotal trial, and study outcomes was analyzed. The number of subjects enrolled ranged from 12 to 60, and the majority of studies (19 of 29) were conducted in healthy volunteers. Using AstraZeneca cost data, healthy volunteer studies were estimated to cost 10-fold less than cancer patient studies. Nine of 29 (31%) studies included meals with multiple levels of fat content. Analysis of a subset of 16 drugs revealed that final results for the food-effect study were available before the start of the pivotal trial for only 2 drugs. Conducting small food-effect studies powered to estimate effect, rather than confirm no effect, with only a standardized high-fat meal according to FDA guidance may eliminate unnecessary studies, reduce cost, and improve efficiency in oncology drug development.

This spatial forcing as determined by the metapopulation typology then imposes strong selection pressures on life-history traits, which will in turn feed back on the ecological metapopulation dynamics. Given the relevance of metapopulation persistence for biological conservation, and the potential rescuing role of evolution, a firm understanding of the relevance of these eco-evolutionary processes is essential. We here follow a systems' modelling approach to quantify the importance of spatial forcing and experimentally observed life-history evolution for metapopulation demography as quantified by (meta)population size and variability. We therefore developed an individual-based model matching an earlier experimental evolution with spider mites to perform virtual translocation and invasion experiments that would have been otherwise impossible to conduct. We show that (a) metapopulation demography is more affected by spatial forcing than by life-history evolution, but that life-history evolution contributes substantially to changes in local- and especially metapopulation-level population sizes, (b) extinction rates are minimised by evolution in classical metapopulations, and (c) evolution is optimising individual performance in metapopulations when considering the importance of more cryptic stress resistance evolution. Ecological systems' modelling opens up a promising avenue to quantify the importance of eco-evolutionary feedbacks in spatially structured populations. Metapopulation sizes are especially impacted by evolution, but its variability is mainly determined by the spatial forcing. Eco-evolutionary dynamics can increase the persistence of classical metapopulations. Conservation of genetic variation and, hence, adaptive potential is thus not only essential in the face of environmental change; it also generates putative rescuing feedbacks that impact metapopulation persistence.","MdbHLH93, an apple activator regulating leaf senescence, is regulated by ABA and MdBT2 in antagonistic ways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536977,The New phytologist,2019 03 21,"The molecular mechanism of leaf senescence in apple (Malus domestica) is still not fully understood.

We found that MdbHLH93 promoted leaf senescence and the expression of senescence-related genes, which exhibited similar effects to ABA on leaf senescence. MdbHLH93 activated directly the transcription of MdSAG18. We also found that an ABA-responsive protein, MdBT2, interacted directly with MdbHLH93, and induced the ubiquitination and degradation of the MdbHLH93 protein, and thus delayed leaf senescence.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ppz1 (ScPpz1) is involved in regulation of monovalent cation homeostasis. ScPpz1 is inhibited by two regulatory proteins, Hal3 and Vhs3, which have moonlighting properties, contributing to the formation of an unusual heterotrimeric PPC decarboxylase (PPCDC) complex crucial for CoA biosynthesis. Here we report the functional characterization of CnPpz1 (CNAG_03673) and two possible Hal3-like proteins, CnHal3a (CNAG_00909) and CnHal3b (CNAG_07348) from the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. Deletion of CnPpz1 or CnHal3b led to phenotypes unrelated to those observed in the equivalent S. cerevisiae mutants, and the CnHal3b-deficient strain was less virulent. CnPpz1 is a functional PPase and partially replaced endogenous ScPpz1. Both CnHal3a and CnHal3b interact with ScPpz1 and CnPpz1 in vitro but do not inhibit their phosphatase activity. Consistently, when expressed in S. cerevisiae, they poorly reproduced the Ppz1-regulatory properties of ScHal3. In contrast, both proteins were functional monogenic PPCDCs. The CnHal3b isoform was crystallized and, for the first time, the 3D-structure of a fungal PPCDC elucidated.

It has been under investigation as an implant material both in cardiovascular and orthopedic applications. The use of Mg as an implant material reduces the risk of long-term incompatible interaction of implant with tissues and eliminates the second surgical procedure to remove the implant, thus minimizes the complications. The hurdle in the extensive use of Mg implants is its fast degradation rate, which consequently reduces the mechanical strength to support the implant site. Alloy development, surface treatment, and design modification of implants are the routes that can lead to the improved corrosion resistance of Mg implants and extensive research is going on in all three directions. In this review, the recent trends in the alloying and surface treatment of Mg have been discussed in detail.

It is unclear which cells at the periprosthetic interface transduce mechanical signals into a biochemical response, and subsequently facilitate bone loss. We hypothesized that mechanical overloading of hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells, which are located near to the inserted bone implants, stimulates the release of osteoclast-inducing soluble factors. Using a novel in vitro model to apply mechanical overloading, we found that hematopoietic progenitor cells released adenosine triphosphate (ATP) after only 2 min of mechanical loading. The released ATP interacts with its specific receptor P2X7 to stimulate the release of unknown soluble factors that inhibit (physiological loading) or promote (supraphysiological loading) the differentiation of multinucleated osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cultures. Inhibition of ATP-receptor P2X7 by Brilliant Blue G completely abolished the overloading-induced stimulation of osteoclast formation. Likewise, stimulation of P2X7 receptor on hematopoietic cells by BzATP enhanced the release of osteoclastogenesis-stimulating signaling molecules to a similar extent as supraphysiological loading. Supraphysiological loading affected neither gene expression of inflammatory markers involved in aseptic implant loosening (e.g., interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and PTGES2) nor expression of the osteoclast modulators receptor activator of nuclear factor κ-Β ligand and osteoprotegerin.

AKT plays a crucial regulatory role in differentiation, cell cycle, transcription, translation, metabolism and apoptosis. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is characterized by the presence of the promyelocytic leukaemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RARA) fusion protein, which deregulates expression of several genes involved in differentiation and apoptosis.

We show how alternative allocations for the breeds that are currently stored in 11 European gene banks could reduce overall conservation costs by around 20% by selecting cryogenic banks that have relatively lower combination of fixed and collection costs, and are geographically closer to collection regions. Our results show that centralizing collections in one gene bank would double the costs, relative to collective European collections approaches.

The same symbiont may be a mutualist in one location and a parasite in another. Such spatially conditional mutualisms pose a dilemma for hosts, who might evolve (higher or lower) horizontal or vertical transmission to increase their chances of being infected only where the symbiont is beneficial. To determine how transmission in hosts might evolve, we modeled transmission evolution where the symbiont had a spatially conditional effect on either host lifespan or fecundity. We found that over ecological time, symbionts that affected lifespan but not fecundity led to high frequencies of infected hosts in areas where the symbiont was beneficial and low frequencies elsewhere. In response, hosts evolved increased horizontal transmission only when the symbiont affected lifespan. We also modeled transmission evolution in symbionts, which evolved high horizontal and vertical transmission, indicating a possible host-symbiont conflict over transmission mode. Our results suggest an eco-evolutionary feedback where the component of host fitness affected by a conditionally mutualistic symbiont in turn determines its distribution in the population, and, through this, the transmission mode that evolves.",Impact of a nurse-led sleep programme on the sleep quality and depressive symptomatology among older adults in nursing homes: A non-randomised controlled study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536932,International journal of older people nursing,2019 02 22,"Sleep problems are much more prevalent in nursing home residents than in their community-dwelling counterparts.

Often, studies investigate only intrinsic biological properties of organisms as the causes of diversity, however, extrinsic properties of a clade's environment, particularly geological history, may also offer compelling explanations. The Andes are a young mountain chain known to have shaped many aspects of climate and diversity of South America. The Liolaemidae are a radiation of South American reptiles with over 300 species found across most biomes and with similar numbers of egg-laying and live-bearing species. Using the most complete dated phylogeny of the family, we tested the role of Andean uplift in biogeography, diversification patterns, and parity mode of the Liolaemidae. We find that the Andes promoted lineage diversification and acted as a species pump into surrounding biomes. We also find strong support for the role of Andean uplift in boosting the species diversity of these lizards via allopatric fragmentation. Finally, we find repeated shifts in parity mode associated with changing thermal niches, with live-bearing favored in cold climates and egg-laying favored in warm climates. Importantly, we find evidence for possible reversals to oviparity, an evolutionary transition believed to be extremely rare.",Preservation of boar semen: An update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536928,Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,2019 05 02,"In the pork industry, artificial insemination and the storage of boar semen in liquid at 17°C are routinely applied to optimize the ejaculate and bring about rapid genetic changes that are reflected in the animal protein. Although the results are satisfactory, they are below what occurs with natural mating. It is currently possible to preserve boar semen with storage at 17°C and slow freezing, since to date there is only one study on vitrification, with negative results applicable only in the case of implementing an intracytoplasmic sperm injection. In both methods and due to the sensitivity of boar sperm to osmotic and temperature changes, there is a loss in the quality of the initial sample; however, slow freezing in boar semen has greater deleterious effects on the sample that are reflected in the pregnancy rates and number of live births. Therefore, only 1% of all inseminations are done with frozen semen. The aim of this review is to provide advances and results of studies conducted on the preservation of boar semen, delving more deeply into the critical points that each of the preservation techniques presents, including bacterial contamination, extender components, temperature, ice nucleation, use of additives in extenders and the main deleterious effects on sperm quality.",Periplasmic protein EipA determines envelope stress resistance and virulence in Brucella abortus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536925,Molecular microbiology,2019 05 20,"Molecular components of the Brucella abortus cell envelope play a major role in its ability to infect, colonize and survive inside mammalian host cells. In this study, we have defined a role for a conserved gene of unknown function in B. abortus envelope stress resistance and infection. Expression of this gene, which we name eipA, is directly activated by the essential cell cycle regulator, CtrA. eipA encodes a soluble periplasmic protein that adopts an unusual eight-stranded β-barrel fold. Deletion of eipA attenuates replication and survival in macrophage and mouse infection models, and results in sensitivity to treatments that compromise the cell envelope integrity. Transposon disruption of genes required for LPS O-polysaccharide biosynthesis is synthetically lethal with eipA deletion. This genetic connection between O-polysaccharide and eipA is corroborated by our discovery that eipA is essential in Brucella ovis, a naturally rough species that harbors mutations in several genes required for O-polysaccharide production. Conditional depletion of eipA expression in B. ovis results in a cell chaining phenotype, providing evidence that eipA directly or indirectly influences cell division in Brucella. We conclude that EipA is a molecular determinant of Brucella virulence that functions to maintain cell envelope integrity and influences cell division.","The Fyn kinase inhibitor, AZD0530, suppresses mouse alcohol self-administration and seeking.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536923,Addiction biology,2018 12 11,"Fyn is a member of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that plays an important role not only in normal synaptic functions but also in brain pathologies including alcohol use disorder. We previously reported that repeated cycles of binge drinking and withdrawal activate Fyn in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of rodents, and that Fyn signaling in the DMS contributes to rat alcohol intake and relapse. Here, we used AZD0530, a CNS penetrable inhibitor of Src PTKs developed for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and cancer and tested its efficacy to suppress alcohol-dependent molecular and behavioral effects. We show that systemic administration of AZD0530 prevents alcohol-induced Fyn activation and GluN2B phosphorylation in the DMS of mice. We further report that a single dose of AZD0530 reduces alcohol operant self-administration and promotes extinction of alcohol self-administration without altering basal and dopamine D1 receptor-dependent locomotion. Together, our findings suggest that AZD0530, through its inhibitory actions on Fyn kinase, dampens alcohol seeking and drinking.",Effects of Angelica gigas Nakai on the production of decursin- and decursinol angelate-enriched eggs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536922,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 04 03,"The livestock industry requires high-quality products, as well as improved productivity.

Recently, it has been shown that this factor leads to inflammation in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study, we examine the dual role of T-bet in inducing and suppressing inflammatory reactions as well as angiogenesis induction due to inflammatory cytokines in CVD. Relevant literature was identified by a Pubmed search (1992-2018) of English-language papers using the terms ""T-bet,"" ""Cardiovascular disease,"" ""Immune response,"" and ""Angiogenesis."" Although T-bet causes differentiation of Th1 cells and activation of immune cells such as NK and DC, it suppresses inflammatory responses and replaces damaged vessels with new ones by activating regulatory T-cells and stimulating angiogenesis. It can be stated that T-bet acts as double-edged sword. Therefore, the identification of pathways that can increase the function of T-bet in activating Tregs and inducing angiogenesis might be used as a new therapeutic option in future investigations.",Detection of Brodifacoum and other Rodenticides in Drug Mixtures using Thermal Desorption Direct Analysis in Real Time Mass Spectrometry (TD-DART-MS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536906,Journal of forensic sciences,2018 12 11,"In recent months, there has been increased reporting of seized drug and toxicology cases containing rodenticides, the active ingredient in rat poisons.

This work investigates the use of TD-DART-MS for the simultaneous detection of rodenticides and drugs. Six rodenticides were evaluated, an optimal method was established, and limits of detection in the tens of nanograms were calculated. Additional studies highlight that detection at less than 1% by weight in mixtures with AB-FUBINACA, cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine was possible. This work presents an optimized method for detection of these compounds, allowing for the simultaneous detection of drugs and rodenticides, providing drug chemists with a tool for rapid identification of these compounds for forensic or public health purposes.",Fibroblast-specific integrin-alpha V differentially regulates type 17 and type 2 driven inflammation and fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536905,The Journal of pathology,2019 04 10,"Fibroproliferative diseases affect a significant proportion of the world's population. Despite this, core mechanisms driving organ fibrosis of diverse etiologies remain ill defined. Recent studies suggest that integrin-alpha V serves as a master driver of fibrosis in multiple organs. Although diverse mechanisms contribute to the progression of fibrosis, TGF-β and IL-13 have emerged as central mediators of fibrosis during type 1/type 17, and type 2 polarized inflammatory responses, respectively. To investigate if integrin-alpha V interactions or signaling is critical to the development of type 2 fibrosis, we analyzed fibroblast-specific integrin-alpha V knockout mice in three type 2-driven inflammatory disease models. While we confirmed a role for integrin-alpha V in type 17-associated fibrosis, integrin-alpha V was not critical to the development of type 2-driven fibrosis. Additionally, our studies support a novel mechanism through which fibroblasts, via integrin-alpha V expression, are capable of regulating immune polarization. We show that when integrin-alpha V is deleted on fibroblasts, initiation of type 17 inflammation is inhibited leading to a deregulation of type 2 inflammation. This mechanism is most evident in a model of severe asthma, which is characterized by a mixed type 2/type 17 inflammatory response. Together, these findings suggest dual targeting of integrin-alpha V and type 2 pathways may be needed to ameliorate fibrosis and prevent rebound of opposing pro-fibrotic and inflammatory mechanisms.

During an alloimmune response, activated complement factors (C3a and C5a) bind to their corresponding receptors (C3aR and C5aR) on a number of lymphocytes, including T-regulatory cells (Tregs), and these cell-molecular interactions have been vital to modulate an effective immune response to/from Th1-effector cell and Treg activities, which result in massive inflammation, microvascular impairments, and fibrotic remodeling. Involvement of the complement-mediated cell signaling during transplantation signifies a crucial role of complement components as a key therapeutic switch to regulate ongoing inflammatory state, and further to avoid the progression of CR of the transplanted organ. This review highlights the role of complement-T cell interactions, and how these interactions shunt the effector immune response during alloimmune inflammation in transplantation, which could be a novel therapeutic tool to protect a transplanted organ and avoid progression of CR.",Activation of TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway inhibits the development of ovarian follicle in polycystic ovary syndrome by promoting apoptosis of granulosa cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536903,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,To investigate the role of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad3 signaling pathway in development of ovarian follicle by promoting apoptosis of granulosa cells in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).,"Calcitonin administration improves endometrial receptivity via regulation of LIF, Muc-1 and microRNA Let-7a in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536902,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Calcitonin (CT) is one of the factors affecting the embryo implantation, but its effects on the implantation window have not been fully investigated. The current study investigated the effects of CT on the endometrium receptivity by morphological study and evaluation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), mucin 1 (Muc-1), and microRNA (miRNA) Let-7a in the ovarian stimulation and the normal ovarian cycle. Then the mechanism of the CT effects through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway was studied by using PP242. A total of 64 BALB/c mice were divided into the normal ovarian cycle and ovarian stimulation groups. Each group consisted of four subgroups: control, calcitonin, PP242, and calcitonin+PP242. CT and PP242 were injected on the fourth of pregnancy into the mice and 24 hr later all the mice were killed. The uterine tissue samples were used for morphological analysis, and endometrial cells were mechanically isolated for evaluation of gene and protein expression. The results showed that ovarian stimulation induced mTOR phosphorylation as well as increased expression of the Let-7a miRNA. In addition, CT injection increased the expression of LIF and miRNA Let-7a in ovarian stimulation similar to that in normal ovarian cycles. However, injection of PP242 reduced expression of miRNA Let-7a and increased Muc-1 expression in ovarian stimulation group. In conclusion, the administration of CT improved endometrial receptivity in mice. This phenomenon occurred by upregulation of LIF, miRNA Let-7a and downregulation of Muc-1 via mTOR signaling pathway.",Identification of prognostic miRNA biomarkers for predicting overall survival of colon adenocarcinoma and bioinformatics analysis: A study based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536901,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,This study was conducted to identify the prognostic microRNA (miRNA) for the prediction of survival in colon adenocarcinoma (CA).,"Science for Policy: A Case Study of Scientific Polarization, Values, and the Framing of Risk and Uncertainty.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536900,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2019 06 14,"It is well documented that more research can lead to hardened positions, particularly when dealing with complex, controversial, and value-laden issues. This study is an attempt to unveil underlying values in a contemporary debate, where both sides use scientific evidence to support their argument. We analyze the problem framing, vocabulary, interpretation of evidence, and policy recommendations, with particular attention to the framing of nature and technology. We find clear differences between the two arguments. One side stress that there is no evidence that the present approach is causing harm to humans or the environment, does not ruminate on uncertainties to that end, references nature's ability to handle the problem, and indicates distrust in technological solutions. In contrast, the other side focuses on uncertainties, particularly the lack of knowledge about potential environmental effects and signals trust in technological development and human intervention as the solution. Our study suggests that the two sides' diverging interpretations are tied to their perception of nature: vulnerable to human activities versus robust and able to handle human impacts. The two sides also seem to hold diverging views of technology, but there are indications that this might be rooted in their perception of governance and economy rather than about technology per se. We conclude that there is a need to further investigate how scientific arguments are related to worldviews, to see how (if at all) worldview typologies can help us to understand how value-based judgments are embedded in science advice, and the impact these have on policy preferences.",Highly sensitive spectrofluorimetric method for rapid determination of orciprenaline in biological fluids and pharmaceuticals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536899,Luminescence : the journal of biological and chemical luminescence,2019 03 18,"Orciprenaline sulphate (ORP) is a direct-acting sympathomimetic with mainly beta-adrenoceptor stimulant activity. It is used as a bronchodilator in the management of reversible airway obstruction. For the first time, a rapid highly sensitive spectrofluorimetric method is described that is relied on measuring the fluorescence spectra of ORP at acidic pH and without addition of any chemical reagents. The relative fluorescence intensity was measured at 310 nm and after excitation at 224 nm. ORP native fluorescence was calibrated in both water and acetonitrile as diluting solvents. The method was designed to estimate the drug in miscellaneous matrices with high accuracy and precision. Linear ranges of calibration curves were 30.0-400.0 ng/ml and 10.0-240.0 ng/ml in water and acetonitrile, respectively. The detection limits were calculated and reached as low as 3.3 and 3.1 ng/ml, respectively, representing the ultra-sensitivity of the proposed method. This result permitted application of this method for spiked human plasma and urine and was used as a preliminary investigation with good percentage recovery (89.4-106.8%). The application was further extended to analyse ORP in its pharmaceutical formulations.

RO6839921 and temozolomide, alone or in combination in mice implanted with TP53 wt SHSY5Y-Luc and NB1691-Luc cells showed that combined RO6839921 and temozolomide led to greater tumour growth inhibition and increase in survival compared to vehicle control. Overall, RO6839921 had a favourable pharmacokinetic profile consistent with intermittent dosing and was well tolerated alone and in combination. These preclinical studies support the further development of idasanutlin in combination with temozolomide in neuroblastoma in early phase clinical trials."

Dendrimers have attracted considerable attention due to their small size, monodispersed, well-defined globular shape, and a relative ease incorporation of targeting ligands. In this study, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized via a coprecipitation method. The magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) had been modified with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, and then polyamidoamine functionalized MNPs had been synthesized cycling. Various characterization techniques had been used to reveal the morphology, size, and structure of the nanoparticles such as scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, X-ray diffraction analysis, and vibrating sample magnetometer, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. In addition, the cytotoxicity property of G3-dendrimer functionalized MNPs were evaluated using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay which confirmed the biocompatibility of the nanocomposites. Dendrimer functionalized MNPs are able to act as contrast agents for MRI and magnetic fluid hyperthermia mediators. A superior heat generation was achieved for the given concentration according to the hyperthermia results. MRI results show that the synthesized nanocomposites are a favorable option for MRI contrast agent.

Then, we critically evaluated the cumulative evidence for the G×E interactions using an extension of the Human Genome Epidemiology Network's Venice criteria. Overall, 15 articles reporting systematic reviews of observational studies on 89 G×E interactions, 20 articles reporting meta-analyses of candidate gene- or single-nucleotide polymorphism-based studies on 521 G×E interactions, and 8 articles reporting 33 genome-wide G×E interaction analyses were identified. On the basis of prior and observed scores, only the interaction between rs6983267 (8q24) and aspirin use was found to have a moderate overall credibility score as well as main genetic and environmental effects. Though 5 other interactions were also found to have moderate evidence, these interaction effects were tenuous due to the lack of main genetic effects and/or environmental effects. We did not find highly convincing evidence for any interactions, but several associations were found to have moderate strength of evidence. Our conclusions are based on application of the Venice criteria which were designed to provide a conservative assessment of G×E interactions and thus do not include an evaluation of biological plausibility of an observed joint effect.",Diacylglycerol kinase α-selective inhibitors induce apoptosis and reduce viability of melanoma and several other cancer cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536880,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"Diacylglycerol (DG) kinase (DGK), which phosphorylates DG to generate phosphatidic acid (PA), consists of ten isozymes (α-к). Recently, we identified a novel small molecule inhibitor, CU-3, that selectively inhibits the activity of the α isozyme. In addition, we newly obtained Compound A, which selectively and strongly inhibits type I DGKs (α, β, and γ). In the present study, we demonstrated that both CU-3 and Compound A induced apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activity and DNA fragmentation) and viability reduction of AKI melanoma cells. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the production of 32:0- and 34:0-PA species was commonly attenuated by CU-3 and Compound A, suggesting that lower levels of these PA molecular species are involved in the apoptosis induction and viability reduction of AKI cells. We determined the effects of the DGKα inhibitors on several other cancer cell lines derived from refractory cancers. In addition to melanoma, the DGKα inhibitors enhanced caspase 3/7 activity and reduced the viability of hepatocellular carcinoma, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer cells, but not breast adenocarcinoma cells. Interestingly, Western blot analysis indicated that the DGKα expression levels were positively correlated with the sensitivity to the DGK inhibitors. Because both CU-3 and Compound A induced interleukin-2 production by T cells, it is believed that these two compounds can enhance cancer immunity. Taken together, our results suggest that DGKα inhibitors are promising anticancer drugs.","The methanolic extract of Guibourtia tessmannii (caesalpiniaceae) and selenium modulate cytosolic calcium accumulation, apoptosis and oxidative stress in R2C tumour Leydig cells: Involvement of TRPV1 channels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536879,Andrologia,2019 06 14,"This study evaluated the effects of the methanolic extract of Guibourtia tessmannii (GT) and selenium (Se) on cell viability, intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+ ]i ), apoptosis and oxidative stress through transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel activity in CCL-97 (R2C) tumour Leydig cells.

Interestingly, these parameters were significantly (p < 0.001) improved by GT and Se, compared to the CAP group. Moreover, the co-administration of GT+CAP or Se+CAP inhibited the cytotoxicity of CAP. Thus, the modulatory properties of GT and Se on Ca2+ influx, apoptosis and oxidative stress require the integrity of TRPV1 channel in CCL-97 Leydig cells.

It was consequently found that nurses' organizational communication satisfaction and emotional labor positively affected their prosocial service behavior. The potential benefits of emotional labor were also explored, and these variables were determined to explain 41.1% of the variance in prosocial service behavior. These findings provide evidence that organizational communication satisfaction and emotional labor in nurses can have significant effects on their prosocial service behavior."

In this study, a soft tissue-to-bone interface is tissue engineered with a cellular gradient of fibrochondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells and subjected to a biochemical gradient through a custom media diffusion bioreactor. These constructs, consisting of interpenetrating collagen and boney regions, display improved mechanical performance and collagen organization compared to controls without a cellular or chemical gradient. Media gradient exposure produces morphological features in the constructs that appear similar to the native tissue. Collectively, these data show that cellular and biochemical gradients improve integration between collagen and bone in a tissue engineered soft tissue-to-bone construct.",Determining the motivations of family members to undertake cardiopulmonary resuscitation training through grounded theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536860,Journal of advanced nursing,2019 03 25,To explore the motivation of family members of patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death for undertaking cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training.,Clinical Guidelines in Pediatric Hearing Loss: Systemic Review Using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II Instrument.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536859,The Laryngoscope,2018 12 11,"Despite the importance, impact, and prevalence of pediatric hearing loss (HL), there are very few published clinical practice guidelines (CPG) supporting the evaluation and management of pediatric patients with HL.

Here, we describe a simple method for casting a thin (about 500 μm) and soft (about 0.3 kPa) hydrogel of gelatin and a method for characterizing the mechanical properties of the hydrogel simply by changing pressure with a water column. The gelatin is crosslinked with mTransglutaminase and the area of the resulting hydrogel can be increased up 13-fold by increasing the radial water pressure. This is far beyond physiological stretches observed in vivo. Actuating the hydrogel with a radial force achieves both information about stiffness, stretchability, and contractability, which are relevant properties for tissue engineering purposes. Cells could be stretched and contracted using the gelatin membrane. Gelatin is a commonly used polymer for hydrogels in tissue engineering, and the discovered reversible stretching is particularly interesting for organ modeling applications.",Cis-trans proline isomers in the catalytic domain of calcineurin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536857,The FEBS journal,2019 03 18,"Calcineurin is an essential calcium-activated serine/threonine phosphatase. The six NMR-observable methionine methyl groups in the catalytic domain of human calcineurin Aα (CNA) were assigned and used as reporters of the presence of potential cis-trans isomers in solution. Proline 84 is found in the cis conformation in most calcineurin X-ray structures, and proline 309, which is part of a highly conserved motif in phosphoprotein phosphatases, was modeled with a cis peptide bond in one of the two molecules present in the asymmetric unit of CNA. We mutated each of the two prolines to alanine to force the trans conformation. Solution NMR shows that the P84A CNA mutant exists in two forms, compatible with cis-trans isomers, while the P309A mutant is predominantly in the trans conformation.

It was hypothesized that Gp2 may benefit from increased hydrophilicity for improved physiological distribution as well as for physicochemical robustness. We identified seven exposed hydrophobic sites for hydrophilic mutations and experimentally evaluated single mutants, which yielded six mutations that do not substantially hinder expression, binding affinity or specificity (to epidermal growth factor receptor), and thermal stability. Eight combinations of these mutations improved hydrophilicity relative to the parental Gp2 clone as assessed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (p < 0.05). Secondary structures and refolding abilities of the selected single mutants and all multimutants were unchanged relative to the parental ligand. A variant with five hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic mutations was identified with enhanced solubility as well as reasonable binding affinity ( K d  = 53-63 nM), recombinant yield (1.3 ± 0.8 mg/L), and thermal stability ( T m  = 53 ± 3°C). An alternative variant with a cluster of three leucine-to-hydrophilic mutations was identified with increased solubility, nominally increased binding affinity ( K d  = 13-28 nM) and reasonable thermal stability ( T m  = 54.0 ± 0.6°C) but reduced yield (0.4 ± 0.3 mg/L). In addition, a ≥7°C increase in the midpoint of thermal denaturation was observed in one of the single mutants (T21N). These mutants highlight the physicochemical tradeoffs associated with hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic mutation within a small protein, improve the solubility and hydrophilicity of an existent molecular imaging probe, and provide a more hydrophilic starting point for discovery of new Gp2 ligands towards additional targets.","Alkene Carboarylation through Catalyst-Free, Visible Light-Mediated Smiles Rearrangement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536854,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 15,"A light-mediated Truce-Smiles arylative rearrangement is described that proceeds in the absence of any photocatalyst.

In both patients, the post-transplant course was complicated by profound skeletal muscle weakness that resolved with corticosteroid withdrawal. These cases highlight that both HT and ventricular assist device support are feasible in patients with DD.

Diatom species delimitation has often been based exclusively on the recognition of morphological discontinuities without investigation of other lines of evidence. Even though DNA sequences and reproductive experiments have revealed several examples of (pseudo)cryptic diversity, our understanding of diatom species boundaries and diversity remains limited. The cosmopolitan pennate raphid diatom genus Pinnularia represents one of the most taxon-rich diatom genera. In this study, we focused on the delimitation of species in one of the major clades of the genus, the Pinnularia subgibba group, based on 105 strains from a worldwide origin. We compared genetic distances between the sequences of seven molecular markers and selected the most variable pair, the mitochondrial cox1 and nuclear encoded LSU rDNA, to formulate a primary hypothesis on the species limits using three single-locus automated species delimitation methods. We compared the DNA-based primary hypotheses with morphology and with other available lines of evidence. The results indicate that our data set comprised 15 species of the P. subgibba group. The vast majority of these taxa have an uncertain taxonomic identity, suggesting that several may be unknown to science and/or members of (pseudo)cryptic species complexes within the P. subgibba group."

We assessed the ability to identify the point at which the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) emerges through the deep fascia by ultrasound on 26 volunteers (mean age 27.85 years ± 13.186; equal male: female). This point was identified, characterized in relation to surrounding bony landmarks (lateral malleolus and head of the fibula), and compared to data from 16 formalin-fixed human cadavers (mean age 82.88 years ± 6.964; equal male: female). The SPN was identified bilaterally in all subjects. On ultrasound it was found to pierce the deep fascia of the leg at a point 0.31 (±0.066) of the way along a straight line from the lateral malleolus to the head of the fibula (LM-HF line). This occurred on or anterior to the line in all cases. Dissection of cadavers found this point to be 0.30 (±0.062) along the LM-HF line, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (U = 764.000; exact two-tailed P = 0.534). It was always on or anterior to the LM-HF line, anterior by 0.74 cm (±0.624) on ultrasound and by 1.51 cm (±0.509) during dissection. This point was significantly further anterior to the LM-HF line in cadavers (U = 257.700, exact two-tailed P < 0.001). Dissection revealed the nerve to divide prior to emergence in 46.88% (n = 15) limbs, which was not identified on ultrasound (although not specifically assessed).

Alterations in the kinematics of the pelvis have been hypothesized as a major cause of SIJ-related pain. However, definitions of both the range and the extent of physiological movement are controversial, and there are no clear baseline data for pathological alterations. The present study combined a novel biomechanical setup allowing for physiological motion of the lumbosacral transition and pelvis without restricting the SIJ movement in vitro, combined with optical image correlation. Six fresh human pelvises (81 ± 10 years, three females, three males) were tested, with bodyweight-adapted loading applied to the fifth lumbar vertebra and both acetabula. Deformation at the lumbopelvises was determined computationally from three-dimensional image correlation data. Sacroiliac joint motion under the loading of 100% bodyweight primarily consisted of a z-axis rotation (0.16°) and an inferior translation of the sacrum relative to the ilium (0.32 mm). Sacroiliac joint flexion-extension rotations were minute (< 0.02°). Corresponding movements of the SIJ were found at the lumbosacral transition, with an anterior translation of L5 relative to the sacrum of -0.97 mm and an inferior translation of 0.11 mm, respectively. Moreover, a flexion of 1.82° was observed at the lumbosacral transition. Within the innominate bone and at the pubic symphysis, small complementary rotations were seen around a vertical axis, accounting for -0.10° and 0.11°, respectively. Other motions were minute and accompanied by large interindividual variation. The present study provides evidence of different SIJ motions than reported previously when exerted by physiological loading. Sacroiliac joint kinematics were in the sub-degree and sub-millimeter range, in line with previous in vivo and in vitro findings, largely limited to the sagittal rotation and an inferior translation of the sacrum relative to the ilium. This given physiological loading scenario underlines the relevance of the lumbosacral transition when considering the overall motion of the lumbopelvis, and how relatively little the other segments contribute to overall motion.",Disruption of the default mode network and its intrinsic functional connectivity underlies minor hallucinations in Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536829,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2019 06 16,"Minor hallucinations and well-structured hallucinations are considered in the severity continuum of the psychotic spectrum associated with Parkinson's disease.

However, functional neuroimaging studies in patients with isolated minor hallucinations are lacking. The objectives of this study were to explore the structural and functional changes underlying minor hallucinations.",Potassium deficiency aggravates yield loss in rice by restricting the translocation of non-structural carbohydrates under Sarocladium oryzae infection condition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536828,Physiologia plantarum,2019 03 04,"Sheath rot disease (ShR) caused by Sarocladium oryzae (S. oryzae) infection is an emerging disease that causes severe yield loss by restricting the translocation of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). Potassium (K) nutrition plays a critical role in disease resistance and the exportation of NSC. However, the physiological mechanisms of K with respect to ShR have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. The objectives of this study were to reveal the mechanisms by which K increases ShR resistance by regulating NSC translocation of rice, therefore, a field experiment combined with an inoculation experiment was conducted. We demonstrate that ShR disease incidence and disease index decreased dramatically with an increasing K application. K deficiency sharply induced the accumulation of NSC in the flag leaf (FL) and flag leaf sheath (FLS) under S. oryzae infection condition, which reduced the contribution of transferred NSC to final yield. A permutational multivariate analysis showed that K deficiency had a greater (49.0%, P < 0.001) effect on the NSC content variation in FL than that of S. oryzae infection (15.0%, P < 0.001). S. oryzae infection dramatically increased the difference in apparent transferred mass of NSC and cell membrane injury of diseased organs between K-deficient and K-sufficient rice. Finally, we demonstrate that cell membrane injury was a limiting factor imposed by K deficiency, which restricts the export of NSC from source organs. This work highlights the importance of K in improving ShR resistance by regulating NSC translocation (particularly the stem NSC).",Pharmacotherapy for patent ductus arteriosus closure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536827,Congenital heart disease,2019 05 13,"Even though up to 60% of premature infants less than 28 weeks gestation develop persistent patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), there remains controversy regarding if, when, and how to close the PDA. Failure to close the PDA has been associated with significant morbidity but no cause-and-effect has been proven for short-term or long-term outcomes in modern times. Surgical closure has the advantage of eliminating the PDA, but short-term complications and long-term adverse outcomes are worrisome. Intravenous indomethacin has been the ""gold standard"" for pharmacologic treatment over the past 40 years with high closure rates and decreased incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and pulmonary hemorrhage with early treatment but without improvement in long-term outcomes and with risk of renal toxicity. Intravenous ibuprofen has less vasoconstrictive toxicity than indomethacin with comparable closure rates but without improvement in IVH and with hyperbilirubinemia risks. Earlier this decade, acetaminophen (paracetamol) was discovered to effectively close the PDA with good short-term safety profile.

Mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, CFA, and propofol+CFA. Mechanical allodynia was assessed by von Frey analysis, and heat hyperalgesia was detected by exposure of the plantar surface to a beam of radiant heat. Propofol significantly attenuated the severity and duration of CFA-induced pain hypersensitivity, heat hyperalgesia, and paw edema. Propofol inhibited CFA-induced microglia activation, and markedly decreased CFA-induced ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA-1) expression. Propofol inhibited CFA-induced expression of p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) p65, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. In addition, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assays indicated that propofol had no cytotoxic effect on BV2 microglia cells. Reverse transcription-quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results demonstrated that propofol attenuates CFA-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β production in the spinal cord as well as in BV2 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that propofol attenuates CFA-induced neuroinflammation (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β expression) through a mechanism that involves activation of ERK1/2/NF-κB signaling pathway.",Mentoring beginning immigrant teachers: How culture may impact the message.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536811,International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,2019 02 15,"Beginning immigrant teachers may experience cross-cultural conflicts because their home cultures may differ in important ways from U.S. school culture. In California, mentors are assigned to work with new teachers, many born in other countries, to solve a range of problems-often attributable to cross-cultural conflicts between the culture of the school and the cultures of these teachers. Mentors are veteran teachers, but even those who receive special training as mentors are not educated in theories explaining how culture influences child-rearing and schooling practices. In this study, 12 beginning immigrant high school math and science teachers born in Asia and Latin America participated in lengthy, semi-structured interviews conducted by an experienced mentor specialist (not known to the participants). Conflicts reported by participants were analysed from the perspective of differences between the collectivistic cultures of the teachers and individualistic culture of the schools in which they teach. The conflicts reported, primed in part by the nature of interview questions, were categorised as having to do with differences in perceptions of the roles of parents, teachers and students and relations among those roles-particularly in terms of role hierarchy and regard for authority.",High-Parameter Mass Cytometry Evaluation of Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients Treated with Daratumumab Demonstrates Immune Modulation as a Novel Mechanism of Action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536810,Cytometry. Part A : the journal of the International Society for Analytical Cytology,2019 03 12,"Daratumumab is a CD38-targeted human monoclonal antibody with direct anti-myeloma cell mechanisms of action. Flow cytometry in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients treated with daratumumab revealed cytotoxic T-cell expansion and reduction of immune-suppressive populations, suggesting immune modulation as an additional mechanism of action. Here, we performed an in-depth analysis of the effects of daratumumab on immune-cell subpopulations using high-dimensional mass cytometry. Whole-blood and bone-marrow baseline and on-treatment samples from RRMM patients who participated in daratumumab monotherapy studies (SIRIUS and GEN501) were evaluated with high-throughput immunophenotyping. In daratumumab-treated patients, the intensity of CD38 marker expression decreased on many immune cells in SIRIUS whole-blood samples. Natural killer (NK) cells were depleted with daratumumab, with remaining NK cells showing increased CD69 and CD127, decreased CD45RA, and trends for increased CD25, CD27, and CD137 and decreased granzyme B. Immune-suppressive population depletion paralleled previous findings, and a newly observed reduction in CD38+ basophils was seen in patients who received monotherapy. After 2 months of daratumumab, the T-cell population in whole-blood samples from responders shifted to a CD8 prevalence with higher granzyme B positivity (P = 0.017), suggesting increased killing capacity and supporting monotherapy-induced CD8+ T-cell activation. High-throughput cytometry immune profiling confirms and builds upon previous flow cytometry data, including comparable CD38 marker intensity on plasma cells, NK cells, monocytes, and B/T cells. Interestingly, a shift toward cytolytic granzyme B+ T cells was also observed and supports adaptive responses in patients that may contribute to depth of response. © 2018 The Authors.

However, data concerning effects on T cells are probably involved in increased risk of opportunistic infections. We analyzed clinical and immunological changes in children with GvHD taking ruxolitinib. Twenty-two children that underwent transplantation and received ruxolitinib were included. Ruxolitinib indication was acute and chronic GvHD in 13 and 9 patients, respectively. Overall response rate (ORR) in acute GvHD and chronic GvHD was high, of 77% and 89%, respectively. Ruxolitinib was associated with an increase in CD4 effector memory (EM), and decrease of CD4 central memory percentage. CD4 regulatory T cells percentage decreased significantly. Patients who achieved complete response to ruxolitinib had higher natural killer (NK) cells before ruxolitinib that patients who did not respond. Also there was an increase of CD4 lymphocytes percentage, with decrease of CD8 and NK cells percentage in responders against non-responders. There were 54%, 18% and 13% of infections caused by virus, bacteria and fungi, respectively. Cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality was 19 ± 9%and 28 ± 10%, respectively.

Progesterone-induced acrosome reaction (AR) rates were significantly (p < 0.001) elevated in sperm coincubated with VGS for 10-30 min, compared with PBS. Sperm artificially deposited in the vaginas of superovulated females for these periods also showed significant (p < 0.01) increases in AR rates, compared with PBS. Thus in vitro and in vivo, sperm acquire from the vaginal environment factors that induce capacitation, explaining recent findings for their acrosomal status in the isthmus. Overall, VGS appear to deliver higher levels of proteins involved in preventing premature capacitation and AR than those promoting them. Our findings which have implications for humans open the possibility of new approaches to infertility treatment with exosome therapeutics.",Topological and Steric Constraints to Stabilize Heteroleptic Copper(I) Complexes Combining Phenanthroline Ligands and Phosphines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536801,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 03 28,"Heteroleptic copper(I) complexes combining phenanthroline derivatives (NN) and chelating bisphosphine ligands (PP) are an important class of luminescent materials for various applications. Although thermodynamically stable, [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ derivatives are also kinetically unstable. As a result, a dynamic ligand-exchange reaction is often observed in solution, leading to a dynamic mixture of heteroleptic and homoleptic complexes. To prevent the formation of the homoleptic species, macrocyclic phenanthroline ligands have been used for the preparation of [Cu(NN)(PP)]+ pseudorotaxanes. The topological constraint resulting from the macrocyclic structure of the NN ligand drives the thermodynamic equilibrium towards the exclusive formation of the heteroleptic complex as long as the macrocycle is large and flexible enough to allow for the threading of the PP ligand. Conversely, when the threading is prevented by steric constraints, unprecedented copper(I) complexes with a trigonal coordination geometry are obtained. These results are summarized in the present concept article."

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 11 normal-weight patients with T1D consecutively treated with a GLP-1RA in addition to insulin. Paired t tests were used to compare the changes in HbA1c, insulin doses, body weight, body mass index, and C-peptide concentrations prior to and 12 ± 1 weeks after GLP-1RA therapy. At the end of 12 ± 1 weeks of GLP-1RA therapy, HbA1c fell from 10.74 ± 0.96% (95 ± 10.5 mmol/mol) to 7.4 ± 0.58% (58 ± 6.3mmol/mol) (P < 0.01), body weight fell from 71 ± 2.0 to 69 ± 2 kg (P = 0.06), and total insulin dose was reduced by 64% from 33 ± 6 to 11 ± 5 units (P < 0.01).

Accumulating evidence has indicated that interoception plays a fundamental role in cognitive and emotional processes, such as anxiety, but how different functional connectivity patterns contribute to emotions and visceral feelings during an interoceptive attention state is still unclear. In the present study, an interoceptive attention task was performed during functional magnetic resonance imaging of healthy subjects, and the participants' subjective ratings of the intensity of interoception and feelings of anxiety were recorded. Several network nodes were selected, based on previous studies, to construct task-dependent functional connectivity patterns, which were processed by support vector regression to predict the corresponding feeling scores. The results showed that for interoception, the cingulo-opercular task control network provided the greatest contribution, whereas the most important feature for anxiety was the connections between the sensorimotor area (SSM) and the salience network (SN). There existed four overlapping connections between the two predictions: two negative connections between the default mode network (DMN) and the SSM, one negative connection between the DMN and the SN, and one positive connection between the ventral attention network and the SN; this overlap might suggest common bodily attention processing that is involved in both interoception and anxiety. This study remediates the lack of network-level biomarkers of interoception and provides a reference at the level of the brain for further understanding anxiety from an interoceptive perspective.",Contrasting stomatal sensitivity to temperature and soil drought in mature alpine conifers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536787,"Plant, cell & environment",2019 04 12,"Conifers growing at high elevations need to optimize their stomatal conductance (gs ) for maximizing photosynthetic yield while minimizing water loss under less favourable thermal conditions.

We used 4 years of sap flow measurements to elucidate intraspecific and interspecific variability of gs in Larix decidua Mill. and Picea abies (L.) Karst along an elevational gradient and contrasting soil moisture conditions. Site- and species-specific gs response to main environmental drivers were examined, including vapour pressure deficit, air temperature, solar irradiance, and soil water potential. Our results indicate that maximum gs of L. decidua is >2 times higher, shows a more plastic response to temperature, and down-regulates gs stronger during atmospheric drought compared to P. abies. These differences allow L. decidua to exert more efficient water use, adjust to site-specific thermal conditions, and reduce water loss during drought episodes. The stronger plasticity of gs sensitivity to temperature and higher conductance of L. decidua compared to P. abies provide new insights into species-specific water use strategies, which affect species' performance and should be considered when predicting terrestrial water dynamics under future climatic change.",Spin-Crossover Assisted Spin-Switching and Rectification Action in Half-Metallic Graphitic Carbon Nitride(g-C4 N3 ).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536785,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,2019 04 03,"Herein, we report on the potential multifunctional spintronic action of half-metallic graphitic carbon nitride (g-C4 N3 ). We observed electrostatic spin-crossover action at an applied electric field of -0.77 V nm-1 , which eventually leads to spin-switching action and change in sign of bias dependent spin injection coefficient. The system also acts as a spin polarized charge current rectifier with rectification ratio of 65.41 in spin-up channel only. This electric field-controlled spin switching action and simultaneous existence of rectification action makes graphitic carbon nitride a perfect multifunctional spintronic system-an ideal material for quantum logic gate design. Results obtained have been substantiated through transmission spectra and transmission pathways analyses. An analysis of projected device density of states of the system and molecular projected self consistent Hamiltonian states analysis reveals that the electron flow of the system is mainly facilitated by 2p orbitals of C and N atoms.","Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence in veterinarians in Finland: Older age, living in the countryside, tasting beef during cooking and not doing small animal practice associated with seropositivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536784,Zoonoses and public health,2019 04 01,"Practising veterinary medicine has an inherent risk of exposure to zoonotic agents, including the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. We screened sera of veterinarians authorized to work in Finland for the presence of specific immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. gondii with an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay, and evaluated potential risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity from extensive questionnaire data with almost 1,300 quantitative variables. We used a causal diagram approach to address the complexity of the life cycle of the parasite and its numerous possible transmission routes, and built a multivariable binomial logistic regression model to identify risk factors that are particularly relevant for veterinarians. The samples and questionnaire data were collected in 2009. Altogether, 294 veterinarians, almost 15% of the Finnish veterinary profession, were included in the study.

It relies on the accelerated formation of prenucleation clusters around proteins via a metallothionein-like self-assembly. The encapsulated proteins maintained their native conformations, and the structural confinement within porous MOFs endowed enzymes with excellent bioactivity, even in harsh conditions (e.g. in the presence of proteolytic or chemical agents or at high temperature). Furthermore, owing to the merits of nondestructive and protein surface charge-independent encapsulation, the feasibility of this biomimetic strategy for biostorage, enzyme cascades, and biosensing was also verified.

Recently, EGFR-mutated NSCLC has demonstrated the potential for heterogeneity; therefore, the manner of clonal heterogeneity may impact the duration of progression-free and overall survival and other parameters affecting EGFR-TKI treatment efficacy. However no predictive biomarker of these favorable treatment efficacies has been identified to date. The exosome-focused translational research for afatinib (EXTRA) study aims to identify a novel predictive biomarker and a resistance marker for afatinib by analyzing data from association studies of the clinical efficacy of afatinib and four ""OMICs"" (genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics) using peripheral blood from patients treated with afatinib. This study aims to: (i) conduct comprehensive multi-OMIC analyses in a prospective clinical trial, and (ii) focus on both sera/plasma and exosome as a source for OMIC analyses to identify a novel predictor of the efficacy of a specific drug. To eliminate the carryover bias of prior treatment, systemic treatment-naïve patients were enrolled. The candidates to be screened for biomarkers comprise a discovery cohort of 60 patients and an independent validation cohort of 40 patients.

Addition of metal perchlorates to solutions of these substances promotes short wavelength shifts in their absorption and fluorescence maxima and increases in their fluorescence intensities. The magnitudes of the fluorescence intensity increases are dependent on the ring size and number of the crown ether and the nature of the metal cation. Association constants for complex formation were calculated using fluorescence intensity versus concentration data. Analysis using Job's plots showed that the substances containing one benzocrown ether moiety form 1:1 complexes with metal ions. Results of experiments employing repeated addition and removal of Mg(ClO4 )2 demonstrate that the ON-OFF fluorescence response can be repeated at least three times. Results of molecular orbital calculations show that complexation with metal ions lowers the energies of both the π and π* levels of the ethynylpyrene moiety and that in some cases the vacant orbital on the metal becomes the LUMO of the complex.

However, the most commonly used electron ionization (EI) technique often makes the identification of the majority of hydrocarbons impossible due to the exhaustive fragmentation and lack of molecular ion preservation, prompting the need of soft-ionization energies. In this study, three different soft-ionization techniques including photo ionization (PI), chemical ionization (CI), and field ionization (FI) were compared against EI to elucidate their relative capabilities to reveal different base oil hydrocarbon classes. Compared with EI (70 eV), PI (10.8 eV) retained significant molecular ion (M+· ) information for a large number of isomeric species including branched-alkanes and saturated monocyclic hydrocarbons along with unique fragmentation patterns. However, for bicyclic/polycyclic naphthenic and aromatic compounds, EI played upper hand by retaining molecular as well as fragment ions to identify the species, whereas PI exhibited mainly molecular ion signals. On the other hand, CI revealed selectivity towards different base oil groups, particularly for steranes, sulfur-containing thiophenes, and esters, yielding protonated molecular ions (M + H)+ for unsaturated and hydride abstracted ions (M-H+ ) for saturated hydrocarbons. FI, as expected, generated intact molecular ions (M+· ) irrespective to the base oil chemical classes. It allowed elemental composition by TOFMS with a mass resolving power up to 8000 (FWHM) and a mass accuracy of 1 mDa, leading to the calculation of heteroatomic content, double bond equivalency, and carbon number of the compounds.

Coal-fired power plants contribute a great deal to the anthropogenic emissions; therefore, numerous sorbents/catalysts have been developed to remove elemental mercury (Hg0 ) from flue gases. Among them, ceria (CeO2 ) has attracted significant interest, due to its reversible Ce3+ /Ce4+ redox pair, surface-bound defects and acid-base properties. The removal efficiency of Hg0 vapor depends among others, on the flue gas composition and temperature. CeO2 can be incorporated into known materials in such a way that the abatement process can be effective at different operating conditions. Hence, the scope of this account is to discuss the role of CeO2 as a promoter, active phase and support in the design of composite Hg0 sorbents/catalysts. The elucidation of each of these roles would allow the integration of CeO2 advantageous characteristics to such degree, that tailor-made environmental solution to complex issues can be provided within a broader application scope. Besides, it would offer invaluable input to theoretical calculations that could enable the materials screening and engineering at a low cost and with high accuracy.",Strategies toward rheumatoid arthritis therapy; the old and the new.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536757,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"Currently, medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are glucocorticoids (GCs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), predominantly used for controlling the pain and inflammation, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), administered as first-line medication for newly diagnosed RA cases, and biological therapies, used to target and inhibit specific molecules of the immune and inflammatory responses. NSAIDs and other GCs are effective in alleviating the pain, inflammation, and stiffness due to RA. DMARDs that are used for RA therapy are hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine. The biological therapies, on the contrary, are chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) like etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab, a recombinant inhibitor of interleukin-1 (IL-1), anakinra, and costimulation blocker, abatacept. Moreover, newly under evaluation biological therapies include new TNF-α inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, anti-interleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibodies (mABs), and antibodies against vital molecules involved in the survival and development of functional B cells.

Unexpectedly, a screen for mutations that affected the activity of the UzcR-regulated urcA promoter (PurcA ) revealed four previously uncharacterized proteins whose inactivation led to metal-independent induction of PurcA . Using molecular genetics and functional genomics, we find that these auxiliary regulators control PurcA expression by modulating the activity of UzcRS through distinct mechanisms. An ABC transporter with a periplasmic metallo-aminopeptidase domain forms a sensory complex with UzcRS, antagonizing metal dependent stimulation by virtue of its ATPase and peptidase domains. Two MarR-like transcription factors synergistically regulate UzcRS activity by repressing the expression of the membrane proteins UzcY and UzcZ, which stimulate UzcRS activity and enhance its sensitivity to a more environmentally relevant U/Zn/Cu concentration range. Additionally, the membrane protein UzcX, whose expression is positively regulated by UzcR, provides a mechanism of feedback inhibition within the UzcRS circuit. Collectively, these data suggest that UzcRS functions as the core-signaling unit within a multicomponent signal transduction pathway that includes a diverse set of auxiliary regulators, providing further insight into the complexity of signaling networks.",Toll-like receptor 2 regulates metabolic reprogramming in gastric cancer via superoxide dismutase 2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536754,International journal of cancer,2019 04 13,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in host defense after recognition of conserved microbial- and host-derived components, and their dysregulation is a common feature of various inflammation-associated cancers, including gastric cancer (GC). Despite the recent recognition that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, the molecular effectors of altered metabolism during tumorigenesis remain unclear. Here, using bioenergetics function assays on human GC cells, we reveal that ligand-induced activation of TLR2, predominantly through TLR1/2 heterodimer, augments both oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, with a bias toward glycolytic activity. Notably, DNA microarray-based expression profiling of human cancer cells stimulated with TLR2 ligands demonstrated significant enrichment of gene-sets for oncogenic pathways previously implicated in metabolic regulation, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), p53 and Myc. Moreover, the redox gene encoding the manganese-dependent mitochondrial enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD)2, was strongly induced at the mRNA and protein levels by multiple signaling pathways downstream of TLR2, namely JAK-STAT3, JNK MAPK and NF-κB. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated suppression of SOD2 ameliorated the TLR2-induced metabolic shift in human GC cancer cells. Importantly, patient-derived tissue microarrays and bioinformatics interrogation of clinical datasets indicated that upregulated expression of TLR2 and SOD2 were significantly correlated in human GC, and the TLR2-SOD2 axis was associated with multiple clinical parameters of advanced stage disease, including distant metastasis, microvascular invasion and stage, as well as poor survival.

To uncover the mechanism of the stir-frying process and its effect on the pharmacokinetic behavior of active compounds in model rats, four active compounds-chlorogenic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, 1,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid and apigenin-were selected based on previous spectrum-effect experiments. High performance liquid chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-QqQ-MS) technology, an accurate and feasible method, was applied to measure the concentration of these four compounds in rat plasma. This validated method can accurately measure the concentration of each compound at each sampling point of rat plasma. This validated method shows good linearity, extraction recoveries, matrix effects, intra- and inter-day precision and stabilities. Compared with the XF group, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) value of 1,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid decreased remarkably (p < 0.05) after oral administration of stir-fried Xanthii fructus (SXF) extract, while the other compounds showed no significant difference. The mean residence time value of chlorogenic acid (p < 0.05) and 1,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (p<0.01) after oral administration of SXF extraction demonstrated significant differences compared with the XF group, while the other two compounds showed no statistical difference, indicating that the stir-frying process prolonged the effect time and delayed the removal time of chlorogenic acid and 1,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid. The values of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last quantifiable time-point, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity, the time to maximum concentration and the elimination half-life of four compounds in the SXF group showed no statistically significant difference from the XF group. From this data, we speculated that the stir-frying process can not only keep the absorption of 4-caffeoylquinic acid and apigenin, but also increase the effect time of chlorogenic acid and 1,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, which could be the mechanism underlying the stir-frying process enhancing the effects of XF.",Assessment of within-breath impulse oscillometry parameters in children with asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536749,Pediatric pulmonology,2019 01 11,Impulse oscillometry (IOS) measures respiratory resistance and reactance during tidal breaths and is a convenient tool for evaluation of lung function.

Combining the enzyme-free cycling chemical-ligation-mediated signal amplification, and the intrinsic outstanding ability of DLS for discriminating the extremely low level of particle aggregation in a large pool of monodisperse AuNPs, high sensitivity was achieved and as low as 78.6 fm plant miRNA could be easily detected.","Effects of Substituents on Metastable-State Photoacids: Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of their Photochemical Properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536732,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 02 15,"Recently, metastable-state photoacids have been widely used to control proton transfer in numerous chemical and biological processes as well as applications with visible light.

The imperative features that can inhibit CDK4 were identified and refined by docking under standard precision mode, extra precision mode, extra precision mode with core constraints, and induced fit using extra precision protocol. Statistically significant correlation was observed when docking experiments in the extra precision mode carried out by applying core constraints in the ligand molecule which forms two specific hydrogen bonds with Val 96 of CDK4. Importance of solvent molecule was understood by molecular dynamic simulation studies. The presence of a water molecule which forms a hydrogen bond with Asp158 increased the binding affinity between the ligand and CDK4. Hydrogen bonding interactions, pi-pi stacking interactions, and salt bridge formation were the key interactions contributing to the increased inhibitory value. All these findings were supported by the high correlation between pIC50 and glide emodel values. Binding energy determinations under various conditions also support these findings. Thus, extra precision docking with ligand constraints through the insertion of water molecule effectively classified the actives and inactives of given set of molecules and can be used for virtual screening of new molecules for promising biological activity.","Gingival crevicular fluid and salivary HIF-1α, VEGF, and TNF-α levels in periodontal health and disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536725,Journal of periodontology,2018 12 11,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is expressed as an adaptive response to hypoxia, mediates angiogenesis through the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and can be induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).

Based on the unique TME for achieving tumor-specific therapy, here a novel concept of photothermal-enhanced sequential nanocatalytic therapy in both NIR-I and NIR-II biowindows is proposed, which innovatively changes the condition of nanocatalytic Fenton reaction for production of highly efficient hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and consequently suppressing the tumor growth. Evidence suggests that glucose plays a vital role in powering cancer progression. Encouraged by the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and H2 O2 by glucose oxidase (GOD), an Fe3 O4 /GOD-functionalized polypyrrole (PPy)-based composite nanocatalyst is constructed to achieve diagnostic imaging-guided, photothermal-enhanced, and TME-specific sequential nanocatalytic tumor therapy. The consumption of intratumoral glucose by GOD leads to the in situ elevation of the H2 O2 level, and the integrated Fe3 O4 component then catalyzes H2 O2 into highly toxic •OH to efficiently induce cancer-cell death. Importantly, the high photothermal-conversion efficiency (66.4% in NIR-II biowindow) of the PPy component elevates the local tumor temperature in both NIR-I and NIR-II biowindows to substaintially accelerate and improve the nanocatalytic disproportionation degree of H2 O2 for enhancing the nanocatalytic-therapeutic efficacy, which successfully achieves a remarkable synergistic anticancer outcome with minimal side effects.",Analysis of agriculture-related life-threatening injuries presenting to emergency departments of rural generalist hospitals in Southern Queensland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536722,Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,2018 12 11,Agricultural industries are among the most dangerous in Australia posing significant public health risks.

This study was conducted to report the outcomes of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) in ACLF and assess the survival benefit of liver transplantation (LT) in these patients. It was a retrospective study of 218 ACLF patients on the basis of European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL)-chronic liver failure criteria from January 2014 through November 2017. Patients were considered for LDLT if there was no improvement on standard medical therapy for 5-10 days. Prior to LDLT, active sepsis was excluded/treated, and renal, circulatory, and respiratory failures were improved to the greatest extent possible. The mean age was 42.9 years, and 181 patients were male. Sepsis was the most common acute precipitating event followed by alcohol. Of the patients, 35 (16.1%), 66 (30.3%), and 117 (53.7%) were classified into ACLF grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Although 80% of the ACLF 1 group and 72.7% of the ACLF 2 group underwent LDLT, only 35% of the ACLF 3 group could undergo LDLT. The circulatory and respiratory failures at admission were significantly higher in the nontransplant group with poor subsequent response to standard medical therapy, exclusion from LDLT, and poor outcomes. None of the patients on high support for circulatory and respiratory failure underwent LDLT. Posttransplant survival at 1 year was comparable among different grades of ACLF (92.9%, 85.4%, and 75.6%; P = 0.15). Among patients in the ACLF 3 group, survival at 90 days was extremely poor in those who could not undergo LDLT (5.9% versus 78%; P < 0.001).

In target cells of ILPs, insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) is highly conserved in animals. IIS in the legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is known to be involved in maintaining hemolymph trehalose levels and promoting larval growth. However, ILPs in M. vitrata have not been reported yet. This study predicted two ILP genes of Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 from transcriptome of M. vitrata. Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 shared high sequence homologies and domain architecture with Drosophila ILPs. Both ILPs exhibited similar expression patterns in most developmental stages, showing high expression levels in adult stage. In the larval stage, Mv-ILP1 and Mv-IlP2 were expressed mostly in the brain and fat body. However, in the adult stage, both ILP genes were expressed more in the abdomen than those in the head containing the brain. RNA interference (RNAi) of either Mv-ILP1 or Mv-ILP2 during larval stage resulted in significant malfunctioning in regulating hemolymph trehalose titers. RNAi-treated larvae also exhibited significant retardation of larval growth. RNAi treatment in adult stage interfered with the ovarian development of females. These results suggest that Mv-ILP1 and Mv-ILP2 play crucial roles in mediating larval growth and adult reproduction.",Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 promotes cervical cancer development via AKT2/p53 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536701,IUBMB life,2019 02 13,"Aberrant activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is widespread in human cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms of CDK9 activation and the therapeutic potential of CDK9 inhibition in cervical cancer remain largely unknown. Here, we report that CDK9 is gradually upregulated during cervical lesion progression and regulated by HPV16 E6. CDK9 levels are highly correlated with FIGO stage, pathological grade, deep-stromal invasion, tumor size, and lymph nodes metastasis. Knockdown of CDK9 by specific siRNA inhibits cervical cancer cell proliferation in vitro, as well as tumorigenesis in vivo. CDK9 inhibition causes a significant decreased AKT2 and increased p53 protein expression revealing novel CDK9-regulatory mechanisms. Overexpression of AKT2 rescued the suppressive effects caused by CDK9 knockdown, suggesting that AKT2 induction is essential for CDK9-induced transformation. Moreover, CDK9 expression was positively correlated with AKT2 and negatively correlated with p53 in cervical cancer tissues with HPV16 infection. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that CDK9 acts as a proto-oncogene in cervical cancer, modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis through AKT2/p53 pathway. Therefore, our data provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of CDK9 in cervical cancer development. © 2018 IUBMB Life, 71(3):347-356, 2019.","Silencing H19 regulated proliferation, invasion, and autophagy in the placenta by targeting miR-18a-5p.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536700,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a serious pregnancy complication associated with increased perinatal mortality and morbidity. It may lead to neurodevelopmental impairment and adulthood onset disorders. Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to be associated with the pathogenesis of FGR. Here we report that the lncRNAH19 is significantly decreased in placentae from pregnancies with FGR. Downregulation of H19 leads to reduced proliferation and invasion of extravillous trophoblast cells. This is identified with reduced trophoblast invasion, which has been discovered in FGR. Autophagy is exaggerated in FGR. Downregulation of H19 promotes autophagy via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/ERK/mTOR pathways of extravillous trophoblast cells in FGR. We also found that the expression level of microRNAs miR-18a-5p was negatively correlated with that of H19. H19 can act as an endogenous sponge by directly binding to miR-18a-5p, which targets IRF2. The expression of miR-18a-5p was upregulated, but IRF2 expression was downregulated after the H19 knockdown. In conclusion, our study revealed that H19 downexpressed could inhibit proliferation and invasion, and promote autophagy by targeting miR-18a-5pin HTR8 and JEG3 cells. We propose that aberrant regulation of H19/miR-18a-5p-mediated regulatory pathway may contribute to the molecular mechanism of FGR.

More recently, the ability of the second mainstream protein export system, the twin-arginine translocase, to transport fully-folded proteins into the periplasm of not only E. coli, but also other Gram-negative bacteria, has captured the interest of the biotechnology industry. In this study, we have used a novel approach to block the export of a heterologous Tat substrate in the later stages of the export process, and thereby generate a single-span membrane protein with the soluble domain positioned on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. Biochemical and immuno-electron microscopy approaches were used to investigate the export of human growth hormone by the twin-arginine translocase, and the generation of a single-span membrane-embedded variant. This is the first time that a bonafide biotechnologically relevant protein has been exported by this machinery and visualized directly in this manner.

The model can test how a composite trait is determined by pleiotropic QTLs for its component traits or jointly by different sets of QTLs each responsible for a different component. The model can visualize the pattern of time-varying genetic effects for individual components and their impacts on composite traits.

With the increasing use of high magnetic fields, the utility of in vivo 1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has markedly improved for measuring specific metabolite concentrations in biological tissues. Higher fields, coupled with recent developments in hyperpolarization, also enable techniques for complimenting 1 H measurements with spectroscopy of other nuclei, such as 31 P and 13 C, and for combining measurements of metabolite pools with metabolic flux measurements.

However, most impact research on agriculture to date has focused on impacts of warming >2°C on mean crop yields, and many previous studies did not focus sufficiently on extreme events and yield interannual variability. Here, with the latest climate scenarios from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) project, we evaluated the impacts of the 2015 Paris Agreement range of global warming (1.5 and 2.0°C warming above the pre-industrial period) on global wheat production and local yield variability. A multi-crop and multi-climate model ensemble over a global network of sites developed by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) for Wheat was used to represent major rainfed and irrigated wheat cropping systems. Results show that projected global wheat production will change by -2.3% to 7.0% under the 1.5°C scenario and -2.4% to 10.5% under the 2.0°C scenario, compared to a baseline of 1980-2010, when considering changes in local temperature, rainfall, and global atmospheric CO2 concentration, but no changes in management or wheat cultivars. The projected impact on wheat production varies spatially; a larger increase is projected for temperate high rainfall regions than for moderate hot low rainfall and irrigated regions. Grain yields in warmer regions are more likely to be reduced than in cooler regions. Despite mostly positive impacts on global average grain yields, the frequency of extremely low yields (bottom 5 percentile of baseline distribution) and yield inter-annual variability will increase under both warming scenarios for some of the hot growing locations, including locations from the second largest global wheat producer-India, which supplies more than 14% of global wheat. The projected global impact of warming <2°C on wheat production is therefore not evenly distributed and will affect regional food security across the globe as well as food prices and trade.","Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: comparison of patient characteristics and clinical outcomes within Asia and between Asia, Europe and the Americas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536678,European journal of heart failure,2019 05 09,Nearly 60% of the world's population lives in Asia but little is known about the characteristics and outcomes of Asian patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) compared to other areas of the world.,The complete chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes of the diatom Nitzschia palea (Bacillariophyceae) demonstrate high sequence similarity to the endosymbiont organelles of the dinotom Durinskia baltica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536677,Journal of phycology,2019 04 11,"Nitzschia palea is a common freshwater diatom used as a bioindicator because of its tolerance of polluted waterways.

Defects in insulin action contribute to alterations of TH expression and/or activity in the brain and insulin increases TH levels in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated neuronal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of TH by insulin have not been elucidated yet. Using PC12 cells, we show for the first time that insulin increases TH expression in a biphasic manner, with a transient peak at 2 hr and a delayed response at 16 hr, which persists for up to 24 hr. The use of a dominant negative hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) and its pharmacological inhibitor chetomin, together with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments for the specific binding to TH promoter, demonstrate the direct role of HIF-1α in the early phase. Moreover, ChIP experiments and transfection of a dominant negative of the nerve growth factor IB (Nur77) indicate the involvement of Nur77 in the late phase insulin response, which is mediated by HIF-1α. In conclusion, the present study shows that insulin regulates TH expression through HIF-1α and Nur77 in PC12 cells, supporting the critical role of insulin signaling in maintaining an appropriate dopaminergic tone by regulating TH expression in the central nervous system.",Gender differences in mental health and substance use disorders and related healthcare services utilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536669,The American journal on addictions,2018 12 22,"Pathological gambling often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders.

Their protective effect in a variety of diseases has been demonstrated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on omega-3 fatty acids related to acute cold-restraint stress (CRS) induced hepatic dysfunction in rats. Forty adult male Sprague-Dawley albino rats were used and classified into: control, omega-3 group, each rat was pretreated with omega-3 fatty acids; CRS group, rats were subjected to acute CRS for 6 hr; and CRS group pretreated with omega-3 fatty acids. Serum was obtained to determine corticosterone (CORT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels were measured. Also, liver tissues were taken for histological examination and immunohistochemical assessment of the apoptotic marker, caspase-3. Results showed that pretreatment of stressed rats with omega-3 fatty acids led to significant decrease in hepatic MDA and increase in TAC levels. They reduced serum levels of CORT, ALT, AST, and TNF-α. Also, they improved liver damage and suppressed hepatic caspase-3 expression. In conclusion, pretreatment of stressed rats with omega-3 fatty acids has ameliorated stress-induced liver damage due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects. So, they can be used to minimize stress complications on the liver.",The P-class pentatricopeptide repeat protein PpPPR_21 is needed for accumulation of the psbI-ycf12 dicistronic mRNA in Physcomitrella chloroplasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536655,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2019 03 26,"Chloroplast gene expression is controlled by numerous nuclear-encoded RNA-binding proteins. Among these, pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are known to be key players in post-transcriptional regulation in chloroplasts. However, the functions of many PPR proteins remain unknown. In this study, we characterized the function of a chloroplast-localized P-class PPR protein PpPPR_21 in Physcomitrella patens. Knockout (KO) mutants of PpPPR_21 exhibited reduced protonemata growth and lower photosynthetic activity. Immunoblot analysis and blue-native gel analysis showed a remarkable reduction of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center protein and poor formation of the PSII supercomplexes in the KO mutants. To assess whether PpPPR_21 is involved in chloroplast gene expression, chloroplast genome-wide microarray analysis and Northern blot hybridization were performed. These analyses indicated that the psbI-ycf12 transcript encoding the low molecular weight subunits of PSII did not accumulate in the KO mutants while other psb transcripts accumulated at similar levels in wild-type and KO mutants. A complemented PpPPR_21KO moss transformed with the cognate full-length PpPPR_21cDNA rescued the level of accumulation of psbI-ycf12 transcript. RNA-binding experiments showed that the recombinant PpPPR_21 bound efficiently to the 5' untranslated and translated regions of psbImRNA. The present study suggests that PpPPR_21 may be essential for the accumulation of a stable psbI-ycf12mRNA.",microRNA-96 protects pancreatic β-cell function by targeting PAK1 in gestational diabetes mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536654,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",2019 03 20,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a disease condition in which a woman develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy, which might be induced by multiple factors.

EpCAMhigh CTC were detected with CellSearch, tdEV in the CellSearch images and EpCAMlow CTC with filtration after CellSearch. ctDNA was isolated from plasma and mutations present in the primary tumor were tracked with deep sequencing methods. In 97 patients, 21% had ≥2 EpCAMhigh CTC, 15% had ≥2 EpCAMlow CTC, 27% had ≥18 tdEV and 19% had ctDNA with ≥10% mutant allele frequency. Either one of these four biomarkers could be detected in 45% of the patients and all biomarkers were present in 2%. In 11 out of 16 patients (69%) mutations were detected in the ctDNA. Two or more unfavorable biomarkers were associated with poor OS.

Although the gut microbiota has been associated with fitness level and cardiometabolic risk factors, the effects of exercise-induced gut microbiota changes in elderly individuals are unclear. This study evaluated whether endurance exercise modulates the gut microbiota in elderly subjects, and whether these changes are associated with host cardiometabolic phenotypes. In a randomized crossover trial, 33 elderly Japanese men participated in a 5-week endurance exercise program. 16S rRNA gene-based metagenomic analyses revealed that the effect of endurance exercise on gut microbiota diversity was not greater than interindividual differences, whereas changes in α-diversity indices during intervention were negatively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, especially during exercise. Microbial composition analyses showed that the relative abundance of Clostridium difficile significantly decreased, whereas that of Oscillospira significantly increased during exercise as compared to the control period. The changes in these taxa were correlated with the changes in several cardiometabolic risk factors. The findings indicate that short-term endurance exercise has little effect on gut microbiota in elderly individuals, and that the changes in gut microbiota were associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, providing preliminary insight into the associations between the gut microbiota and cardiometabolic phenotypes.",MicroRNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms and diabetes mellitus: A comprehensive review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536647,Clinical genetics,2019 03 18,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become the third major chronic non-communicable disease affecting global public health, following cancer and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.

While some RNA-protein interactions are ""specific"", that is, the RNA-binding proteins preferentially bind to particular RNA sequence or structural motifs, others are ""non-RNA specific."" Deciphering the protein-RNA recognition code is essential for comprehending the functional implications of these interactions and for developing new therapies for many diseases. Because of the high cost of experimental determination of protein-RNA interfaces, there is a need for computational methods to identify RNA-binding residues in proteins. While most of the existing computational methods for predicting RNA-binding residues in RNA-binding proteins are oblivious to the characteristics of the partner RNA, there is growing interest in methods for partner-specific prediction of RNA binding sites in proteins. In this work, we assess the performance of two recently published partner-specific protein-RNA interface prediction tools, PS-PRIP, and PRIdictor, along with our own new tools. Specifically, we introduce a novel metric, RNA-specificity metric (RSM), for quantifying the RNA-specificity of the RNA binding residues predicted by such tools. Our results show that the RNA-binding residues predicted by previously published methods are oblivious to the characteristics of the putative RNA binding partner. Moreover, when evaluated using partner-agnostic metrics, RNA partner-specific methods are outperformed by the state-of-the-art partner-agnostic methods. We conjecture that either (a) the protein-RNA complexes in PDB are not representative of the protein-RNA interactions in nature, or (b) the current methods for partner-specific prediction of RNA-binding residues in proteins fail to account for the differences in RNA partner-specific versus partner-agnostic protein-RNA interactions, or both.",The effect of inhaled heliox on peak flow rates in normal and brachycephalic dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536634,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,2019 02 15,"Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, alleviates airway obstruction in people and improves air flow, and its use has been proposed in dogs.

The genetic basis underlying plant architecture in rapeseed (Brassica napus), a key global oil crop, is elusive. We characterized an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized rapeseed mutant, sca, which had multiple phenotypic alterations, including crinkled leaves, semi-dwarf stature, narrow branch angles and upward-standing siliques. We identified the underlying gene, which encodes an Aux/IAA protein (BnaA3.IAA7). A G-to-A mutation changed the glycine at the 84th position to glutamic acid (G84E), disrupting the conserved degron motif GWPPV and reducing the affinity between BnaA3.IAA7 and TIR1 (TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1) in an auxin dosage-dependent manner. This change repressed the degradation of BnaA3.IAA7 and therefore repressed auxin signaling at low levels of auxin that reduced the length of internodes. The G84E mutation reduced branch angles by enhancing the gravitropic response. The heterozygote +/sca closely resembled a proposed ideal plant architecture, displaying strong yield heterosis through single-locus overdominance by improving multiple component traits. Our findings demonstrate that a weak gain-of-function mutation in BnaA3.IAA7 contributes to yield heterosis by improving plant architecture and would be valuable for breeding superior rapeseed hybrid cultivars and such a mutation may increase the yield in other Brassica crops.",Relative Bioavailability of Orally Dispersible Tablet Formulations of Levo- and Racemic Praziquantel: Two Phase I Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536632,Clinical and translational science,2019 01 25,"Orally dispersible tablet (ODT) formulations of levo praziquantel (L-PZQ) and racemic PZQ (rac-PZQ) are being developed to treat schistosomiasis in preschool-aged children.

AUC0-∞ and peak plasma concentration (Cmax ) were highly variable in both studies. For both ODTs, L-PZQ AUC0-∞ showed greater than dose-proportional increase over the ranges tested and a significant food effect. Safety was comparable among formulations. The lower bioavailability of ODT L-PZQ, as well as the high variability and nondose-proportionality of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, highlighted the need for a dedicated pediatric dose-finding study for the selection of the most appropriate formulation and dose (L-PZQ ODT or rac-PZQ ODT).",Handling Missing Dosing History in Population Pharmacokinetic Modeling: An Extension to MDM Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536631,CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology,2019 02 16,"A major challenge in population pharmacokinetic modeling is handling data with missing or potentially incorrect dosing records.

The post-translational modification of histones plays a key role in maintaining the structure and function of chromatin under different pathophysiological stress conditions. Here, we investigate the functions of previously unexplored amino acid residues in histones H3 and H4. To do so, we screened a library of yeast histone mutants following DNA damage and identified that substitution mutations of histone H3 (H3Q5A/E and H3Q120A) and H4 (H4Y88A/E and H4R78K) render yeast cells sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. These histone mutants show an activated DNA damage response, Rad53 phosphorylation and Sml1 degradation in the presence of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). In histone H3Q5A/E mutants, RNR2 and RNR3 genes were induced at low level, as was RNR3 in H4 histone mutants following DNA damage. In H3 mutant cells, the cell cycle was deregulated, leading to inefficient cell cycle arrest in the presence of MMS, and genes involved in aging and DNA damage repair pathways were constitutively upregulated. In H3 mutants (H3Q5A, H3Q5E and H3Q120A), we observed reduced chronological lifespan (CLS), compared with extended CLS in the H4R78K mutant. Histone mutants also showed altered H3K4me and H3K56ac modifications and improper activation of the stress responsive Slt2 and Hog1 kinases.

Rhenium disulfide (ReS2 ) is a new family of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides with unique distorted 1T crystal structure and thickness-independent direct bandgap. The role of growth substrate is more critical for ReS2 owing to its weak interlayer coupling property, which leads to preferred growth along the out-of-plane direction while suppressing the uniform in-plane growth. Herein, graphene is introduced as the growth substrate for ReS2 and the synthesis of graphene/ReS2 vertical heterostructure is demonstrated via chemical vapor deposition. Compared with the rough surface of SiO2 /Si substrate with dangling bonds which hinders the uniform growth of ReS2 , the inert and smooth surface nature of graphene sheet provides a lower energy barrier for migration of the adatoms, thereby promoting the growth of ReS2 on the graphene surface along the in-plane direction. Furthermore, patterning of the graphene/ReS2 heterostructure is achieved by the selective growth of ReS2 , which is attributed to the strong binding energy between sulfur atoms and graphene surface. The fundamental studies in the role of graphene as the growth template in the formation of van der Waals heterostructures provide better insights into the synthesis of 2D heterostructures."

It is characterized by abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts, dysregulated fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblast, and disorganized collagen and extracellular matrix production, deposition and degradation. There is still a lack of effective treatment strategies for PF. Extracellular high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) induces PF through NF-κB-mediated TGF-β1 release. Herein, we first validate the suppressive effect of HMGB1 knockdown on TGF-β1-induced α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I protein expression. In PF, miRNAs exert different effects through targeting various downstream target messenger RNAs. We searched an online database for dysregulated miRNAs in PF tissues; among them, miR-627 was predicted by online tools to target HMGB1 to inhibit its expression. miR-627 overexpression could partially reverse TGF-β1-induced normal human lung fibroblast proliferation, as well as α-SMA and collagen I protein expression. miR-627 inhibition could partially reverse the suppressive effect of HMGB1 knockdown on TGF-β1-induced α-SMA and collagen I protein expression through direct binding to the 3'-untranslated region of HMGB1. Moreover, miR-627/HMGB1 affected TGF-β1 release through RAGE/NF-κB signaling; miR-627/HMGB1 and RAGE/NF-κB signaling formed a regulatory loop to modulate TGF-β1-induced PF in vitro. In conclusion, miR-627 may be a potential agent that targets HMGB1 to inhibit its expression, thereby improving TGF-β1-induced PF in vitro.",Simvastatin and the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 prevent myofibroblast transformation in Peyronie's disease-derived fibroblasts via inhibition of YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536599,BJU international,2019 03 11,"To uncover the anti-myofibroblast (MFB) properties of Rho-kinase inhibitor (compound Y-27632) and simvastatin in an in vitro model of Peyronie's disease (PD), a sexually debilitating disease caused by an irreversible fibrotic plaque in the penile tunica albuginea (TA).",Glioma exosomes mediate the expansion and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells through microRNA-29a/Hbp1 and microRNA-92a/Prkar1a pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536597,International journal of cancer,2019 04 13,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) play a pivotal role in mediating the formation of an immunosuppressive environment and assisting tumors in evading the host immune response. However, the mechanism through which tumors manipulate the differentiation and function of MDSCs remains unclear. Here, we report that hypoxia-induced glioma cells can stimulate the differentiation of functional MDSCs by transferring exosomal miR-29a and miR-92a to MDSCs. Our results showed that glioma-derived exosomes (GEXs) can enhance the differentiation of functional MDSCs both in vitro and in vivo, and hypoxia-induced GEXs (H-GEXs) demonstrated a stronger MDSCs induction ability than did normoxia-induced GEXs (N-GEXs). A subsequent miRNA sequencing analysis of N-GEXs and H-GEXs revealed that hypoxia-induced exosomal miR-29a and miR-92a expression induced the propagation of MDSCs. miR-29a and miR-92a activated the proliferation and function of MDSCs by targeting high-mobility group box transcription factor 1 (Hbp1) and protein kinase cAMP-dependent type I regulatory subunit alpha (Prkar1a), respectively.

The aim of the present study was therefore to report the major landmarks and the time course in the development of retina. Serial histological sections of Indian buffalo embryos and foetuses were used as group1 (<20.0 cm CVRL), group2 (>20.0 but <40.0 cm CVRL) and group3 (>40.0 cm CVRL). Age estimation was made on the basis of crown vertebral-rump length (CVRL), which ranged between 36 and 286 days (1.6-94.0 cm). The retina in Indian buffalo was developed in a similar manner to that of the other mammals with the principal differences in the time of occurrence of various layers of this nervous tunic. In 36 days (1.6 cm stage), the foetal retina was composed of pigmented layer and the layer of neuroblasts. Differentiation of layers was first observed in 47 days (4.0 cm CVRL) which became prominent in 52 days (5.1 cm stage). At 120 days (20.5 cm stage), the differentiation of inner plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer was evident. At 143 days (31.0 cm) foetal age, the faint line in neuroblastic layer was the first evidence of the future outer plexiform layer. In foetuses of group III, the retina was comprised of all 10 layers (eight cell layers and two membranes) viz. pigmented epithelium, layer of rods and cones, outer limiting membrane, outer nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, ganglion cell layer, layer of nerve fibres and the inner limiting membrane.","Efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan compared with olmesartan in Asian patients with essential hypertension: A randomized, double-blind, 8-week study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536595,"Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",2019 01 10,"This study assessed the efficacy and safety of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan vs olmesartan in Asian patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

The primary endpoint was reduction in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) from baseline with sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg vs olmesartan 20 mg at Week 8. Secondary endpoints included msSBP reduction with sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg, and reductions in clinic and ambulatory BP and pulse pressure (PP) vs olmesartan. In addition, changes in msBP from baseline in the Chinese subpopulation, elderly (≥65 years), and in patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) were assessed. Sacubitril/valsartan 200 mg provided a significantly greater reduction in msSBP than olmesartan 20 mg at Week 8 (between-treatment difference: -2.33 mm Hg [95% confidence interval (CI) -4.00 to -0.66 mm Hg], P < 0.05 for non-inferiority and superiority). Greater reductions in msSBP were also observed with sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg vs olmesartan 20 mg (-3.52 [-5.19 to -1.84 mm Hg], P < 0.001 for superiority). Similarly, greater reductions in msBP were observed in the Chinese subpopulation, in elderly patients, and those with ISH. In addition, both doses of sacubitril/valsartan provided significantly greater reductions from baseline in nighttime mean ambulatory BP vs olmesartan. Treatment with sacubitril/valsartan 200 or 400 mg once daily is effective and provided superior BP reduction than olmesartan 20 mg in Asian patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension and is generally safe and well tolerated."

With the advent of high resolution imaging strategies, metabolomics techniques, and so forth, there is an increasing appreciation of critical role that tumor cell metabolism plays in the overall breast cancer (BC) growth. In this report, we demonstrate a sensitive, flow-cytometry-based assay for rapidly assessing the metabolic phenotypes in isolated suspensions of breast cancer cells. By measuring the temporal variation of NAD(p)H signals in unlabeled, living cancer cells, and by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential {Δψm } in fluorescently labeled cells, we demonstrate that these signals can reliably distinguish the metabolic phenotype of human breast cancer cells and can track the cellular sensitivity to drug candidates. We further show the utility of this metabolic ratio {Δψm /NAD(p)H} in monitoring mitochondrial functional improvement as well as metabolic heterogeneity in primary murine tumor cells isolated from tumor biopsies. Together, these results demonstrate a novel possibility for rapid metabolic functional screening applications as well as a metabolic phenotyping tool for determining drug sensitivity in living cancer cells. © 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.","Dopamine, Oxidative Stress and Protein-Quinone Modifications in Parkinson's and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536578,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 06,"Dopamine (DA) is the most important catecholamine in the brain, as it is the most abundant and the precursor of other neurotransmitters. Degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons of substantia nigra pars compacta in Parkinson's disease represents the best-studied link between DA neurotransmission and neuropathology. Catecholamines are reactive molecules that are handled through complex control and transport systems. Under normal conditions, small amounts of cytosolic DA are converted to neuromelanin in a stepwise process involving melanization of peptides and proteins. However, excessive cytosolic or extraneuronal DA can give rise to nonselective protein modifications. These reactions involve DA oxidation to quinone species and depend on the presence of redox-active transition metal ions such as iron and copper. Other oxidized DA metabolites likely participate in post-translational protein modification. Thus, protein-quinone modification is a heterogeneous process involving multiple DA-derived residues that produce structural and conformational changes of proteins and can lead to aggregation and inactivation of the modified proteins.",Phytophthora infestans effector SFI3 targets potato UBK to suppress early immune transcriptional responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536576,The New phytologist,2019 02 28,"The potato blight agent Phytophthora infestans secretes a range of RXLR effectors to promote disease. Recent evidence indicates that some effectors suppress early pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) following perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs). Phytophthora infestans effector PiSFI3/Pi06087/PexRD16 has been previously shown to suppress MAMP-triggered pFRK1-Luciferase reporter gene activity. How PiSFI3 suppresses immunity is unknown. We employed yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assays, co-immunoprecipitation, transcriptional silencing by RNA interference and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), and X-ray crystallography for structure-guided mutagenesis, to investigate the function of PiSFI3 in targeting a plant U-box-kinase protein (StUBK) to suppress immunity. We discovered that PiSFI3 is active in the host nucleus and interacts in yeast and in planta with StUBK. UBK is a positive regulator of specific PTI pathways in both potato and Nicotiana benthamiana. Importantly, it contributes to early transcriptional responses that are suppressed by PiSFI3. PiSFI3 forms an unusual trans-homodimer. Mutation to disrupt dimerization prevents nucleolar localisation of PiSFI3 and attenuates both its interaction with StUBK and its ability to enhance P. infestans leaf colonisation. PiSFI3 is a 'WY-domain' RXLR effector that forms a novel trans-homodimer which is required for its ability to suppress PTI via interaction with the U-box-kinase protein StUBK.",The Role of Behavioral Phenotypes on Impaired Driving Recidivism Risk and Treatment Response to Brief Intervention: A Preliminary Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536575,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",2019 02 11,"Heterogeneity in the driving while impaired (DWI) offender population and modest outcomes from remedial programs are fueling interest in clarifying clinically significant DWI subtypes to better assess recidivism risk and target interventions.

Similarly, regional body composition and fat distribution changes with age might also contribute to an overall lower REE. This study investigated the influence of age on REE, regional body composition and fat distribution, including subcutaneous fat (SF) and visceral fat (VF), in a Chinese Han population as well as their contributions to age-related changes in REE. One hundred and two males aged 31-83 years old underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) which measured whole body and regional FM and FFM. SF and VF were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and REE by indirect calorimetry. Age was significantly negatively correlated with REE (r = -0.37), total FFM (r = -0.25), upper limbs FFM (r = -0.32), lower limbs FFM (r = -0.34) and showed positive association with trunk FFM (β=0.926). FM, SF and VF decreased in older age groups after an initial rise up to 55-65 years. REE correlated positively to FM, FFM, SF, VF and showed significant association with age (β = -0.254) independent of age-associated changes in body composition. The regional alterations in body composition with age were explained by changes in trunk FFM (β = 0.926). Age-related decline in REE were not solely due to alterations in FM and FFM. Therefore, the changes in regional body composition, fat distribution and REE which occur during aging could be explained by disparities in race, ethnicity, diet, physical activity, and lower specific metabolic rates of FFM components.",Altered Spontaneous Brain Activity in Patients with Classical Trigeminal Neuralgia Using Regional Homogeneity: A Resting-State Functional MRI Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536573,Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,2019 05 23,Neuroimaging studies have shown that patients with pain-related conditions have altered neuronal activity and structural functions.

A hypoxic microenvironment contributes to the chemoresistance of cancer stem cells (CSCs), but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood yet. Here, we show that increased HIF-2α expression is associated with enhanced stemness of OCSCs and poor outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. OVCAR-3 and CAOV-3 sphere-forming (OVCAR-3 S and CAOV-3 S) cells with OCSC-like properties showed strong resistance to adriamycin (ADR). Hypoxia (1% O2 ) induced high expression of both HIF-1α and especially HIF-2α, and increased the resistance of OVCAR-3 S and CAOV-3 S cells to ADR. Notably, treatment with ADR further increased the expression of HIF-2α, but not that of HIF-1α. Knockdown of HIF-2α expression substantially attenuated the resistance of OVCAR-3 S and CAOV-3 S cells to ADR, and the HIF-2α overexpression had the opposite effect. Furthermore, in mouse models xenografted with OCSCs, HIF-2α depletion significantly inhibited tumor growth and sensitized OCSCs to ADR in vivo. Mechanistically, HIF-2α directly promotes transcription/expression of BCRP, a gene encoding a transporter protein responsible for pumping drugs (e.g., ADR) out of cells, which in turn increases drug resistance due to increased drug transportation. Collectively, our studies reveal a novel drug-resistant mechanism in ovarian cancer by which hypoxia (and ADR treatment)-induced HIF-2α overexpression endows OCSCs with resistance to ADR by promoting BCRP expression and ADR transportation. Therefore, targeting the HIF-2α/BCRP axis holds therapeutic potential for treating drug-resistant ovarian cancer.",The Effects of a Functional Three-dimensional (3D) Printed Knee Joint Simulator in Improving Anatomical Spatial Knowledge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536570,Anatomical sciences education,2019 01 24,"In recent decades, three-dimensional (3D) printing as an emerging technology, has been utilized for imparting human anatomy knowledge. However, most 3D printed models are rigid anatomical replicas that are unable to represent dynamic spatial relationships between different anatomical structures. In this study, the data obtained from a computed tomography (CT) scan of a normal knee joint were used to design and fabricate a functional knee joint simulator for anatomical education. Utility of the 3D printed simulator was evaluated in comparison with traditional didactic learning in first-year medical students (n = 35), so as to understand how the functional 3D simulator could assist in their learning of human anatomy. The outcome measure was a quiz comprising 11 multiple choice questions based on locking and unlocking of the knee joint. Students in the simulation group (mean score = 85.03%, ±SD 10.13%) performed significantly better than those in the didactic learning group, P < 0.05 (mean score = 70.71%, ±SD 15.13%), which was substantiated by large effect size, as shown by a Cohen's d value of 1.14. In terms of learning outcome, female students who used 3D printed simulators as learning aids achieved greater improvement in their quiz scores as compared to male students in the same group. However, after correcting for the modality of instruction, the sex of the students did not have a significant influence on the learning outcome. This randomized study has demonstrated that the 3D printed simulator is beneficial for anatomical education and can help in enriching students' learning experience.",Implementation of the transradial approach as an alternative vascular access for transcatheter aortic valve replacement guidance: Experience from a high-volume center.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536569,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2019 06 07,This study sought to assess the potential benefits of the transradial approach (TRA) as an alternative vascular access to the classical contralateral femoral approach for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).,Impact of processing load on analogical mapping with visual sequences in children with developmental language disorders (DLD).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536567,International journal of language & communication disorders,2019 04 26,"Analogical mapping is a domain-general cognitive process used notably in language development, and particularly in the abstraction of construction schemas.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is an emerging resource to detect and monitor molecular characteristics of various tumors. The present study aims to clarify the clinical utility of ctDNA for RCC. Fifty-three patients histologically diagnosed with clear cell RCC were enrolled. Targeted sequencing was carried out using plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and tumor DNA. We applied droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to validate detected mutations. cfDNA fragment size was also evaluated using a microfluidics-based platform and sequencing. Proportion of cfDNA fragments was defined as the ratio of small (50-166 bp) to large (167-250 bp) cfDNA fragments. Association of mutant allele frequency of ctDNA with clinical course was analyzed. Prognostic potential was evaluated using log-rank test. A total of 38 mutations across 16 (30%) patients were identified from cfDNA, including mutations in TP53 (n = 6) and VHL (n = 5), and median mutant allele frequency of ctDNA was 10%. We designed specific ddPCR probes for 11 mutations and detected the same mutations in both cfDNA and tumor DNA. Positive ctDNA was significantly associated with a higher proportion of cfDNA fragments (P = .033), indicating RCC patients with ctDNA had shorter fragment sizes of cfDNA. Interestingly, the changes of mutant allele frequency in ctDNA concurrently correlated with clinical course. Positive ctDNA and fragmentation of cfDNA were significantly associated with poor cancer-specific survival (P < .001, P = .011). In conclusion, our study shows the clinical utility of ctDNA status and cfDNA fragment size as biomarkers for prognosis and disease monitoring in RCC.",Influence of colonic dialysis using Gubenxiezhuo on the distribution of gut microflora in uremia rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536550,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,This study aimed to explore the underlying function of Gubenxiezhuo dialysis on the distribution of gut microflora uremia.,Six years of experience using an advanced algorithm for botulinum toxin application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536548,Journal of cosmetic dermatology,2019 05 24,"Botulinum toxin (BTX) products continue to be widely used for facial rejuvenation.

Fas and its adaptor protein FADD are known to negatively regulate LPS-induced proinflammatory responses, but their role in LPS-induced type I interferon production is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Fas engagement on macrophages, using an agonistic Fas antibody CH11, augments LPS-induced NF-κB responses, causing increased production of TNFα, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-12. Conversely, costimulation with both LPS and CH11 causes a significant reduction in the level of interferon-beta (IFNβ) production. This differential effect involves the Fas adaptor FADD because while LPS-induced IL-6 production increased in FADD-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts, LPS-induced IFNβ production was significantly reduced in these cells. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of FADD (FADD-DD) inhibits LPS-induced IFNβ luciferase but not LPS-induced NF-κB luciferase. In contrast, overexpression of full-length FADD inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB luciferase activation but was seen to augment LPS-induced IFNβ luciferase. Moreover, FADD-DD inhibits TRIF-, TRAM-, IKKε-, TBK-1- and TRAF3-induced IFNβ luciferase production, with coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating an interaction between FADD and TRIF. These data identify FADD as a novel component of the noncanonical Toll-like receptor 4/IFNβ signalling pathway and demonstrate that both Fas and its adaptor FADD can differentially regulate the production of LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons.",PdII -Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3 )-H Activation/Cross-Coupling Reactions of Free Carboxylic Acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536546,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 06 11,PdII -catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3 )-H cross-coupling of free carboxylic acids with organoborons has been realized using either mono-protected amino acid (MPAA) ligands or mono-protected aminoethyl amine (MPAAM) ligands.

We conducted Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES), Whole-Transcriptome Sequencing (WTS), and Single-Cell Sequencing (SCS) of TMZ-naïve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors to identify distinct clinical or genomic manifestations that contribute to the development of hypermutation in untreated adult gliomas. TMZ-naïve hypermutated tumors were marked by absence of IDH1 somatic mutation and MGMT promoter (pMGMT) methylation, two genomic traits that were significantly associated with the TMZ-induced hypermutagenic event in glioblastoma, and harbored inherited alterations in the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. The immediate family members of the TMZ-naive hypermutated glioma patients were also previous diagnosed with cancer development history, suggesting that germline dysfunction of the MMR pathway could potentially pose hereditary risk to genetic predisposition of carcinogenesis in gliomas. Lastly, both TMZ-naïve and post-TMZ-treated hypermutated tumors exhibited a significant accumulation of neoantigen loads, suggesting immunotherapeutic alternatives. Our results present new and unique understanding of hypermutagenic process in adult gliomas and an important step towards clinical implication of immunotherapy in glioma treatment.",Atrial fibrillation in β-thalassemia patients with a focus on the role of iron-overload and oxidative stress: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536543,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Cardiac complications including arrhythmia and especially atrial fibrillation (AF) are common causes of death in β-thalassemia patients. The main factor in the etiopathogenesis of these complications is iron overload, which results in increased oxidative stress. Although there is a known association between cardiac complications and iron overload in β-thalassemia patients, there is no comprehensive review on AF and excessive iron with a focus on oxidative stress in these patients. The aim of this article was to review the different aspects of AF in β-thalassemia patients with a focus on the prevention and treatment of AF by using iron chelators and/or anti-oxidants. AF in β-thalassemia patients is more common than in the general population. One of the most important causes of AF is cardiac iron overload and the harmful effects of increased oxidative stress. Iron-induced AF can be reversed by using an intensive iron chelation regimen. Based on a few experimental studies, the combination of iron chelators with some anti-oxidants, including NAC, vitamin C, and acetaminophen, can lead to improved cardiac protection. However, the effect of such combinations on cardiac arrhythmias should be further evaluated with animal and human studies."

Studies of forest thinning or stand conditions after mortality events have provided indirect evidence for how competition can promote drought stress and predispose forests to severe fire and/or bark beetle outbreaks. Here, we demonstrate linkages between fire deficits and increasing drought stress through analyses of annually resolved tree-ring growth, fire scars, and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13 C) across a dry mixed-conifer forest landscape. Fire deficits across the study area have increased the sensitivity of leaf gas exchange to drought stress over the past >100 years. Since 1910, stand basal area in these forests has more than doubled and fire-return intervals have increased from 25 to 140 years. Meanwhile, the portion of interannual variation in tree-ring Δ13 C explained by the Palmer Drought Severity Index has more than doubled in ca. 300-500-year-old Pinus ponderosa as well as in fire-intolerant, ca. 90-190-year-old Abies grandis. Drought stress has increased in stands with a basal area of ≥25 m2 /ha in 1910, as indicated by negative temporal Δ13 C trends, whereas stands with basal area ≤25 m2 /ha in 1910, due to frequent or intense wildfire activity in decades beforehand, were initially buffered from increased drought stress and have benefited more from rising ambient carbon dioxide concentrations, [CO2 ], as demonstrated by positive temporal Δ13 C trends. Furthermore, the average Δ13 C response across all P. ponderosa since 1830 indicates that photosynthetic assimilation rates and stomatal conductance have been reduced by ~10% and ~20%, respectively, compared to expected trends due to increasing [CO2 ]. Although disturbance legacies contribute to local-scale intensity of drought stress, fire deficits have reduced drought resistance of mixed-conifer forests and made them more susceptible to challenges by pests and pathogens and other disturbances.",A Reversible Proton Generator with On/Off Thermoswitch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536529,Macromolecular rapid communications,2019 03 19,"A reversible polymer photoacid with a thermal on/off switch at physiological temperature able to trigger a large pH modulation of its environment is prepared. Light is used to control the acidity of the solution. Additionally, the temperature could be used to modulate the photoacid efficiency, practically turning on and off the ability of the polymer to produce protons. The behavior of this thermoresponsive photoacid copolymer is the result of the combined action of the temperature-responsive N-isopropylacrylamide and of a reversible photoacid monomer based on a spiropyran derivative. The acidification of the aqueous medium is activated by irradiation at λ = 460 nm. The reverse reaction is achieved by removing the light stimuli or by exposing the solution to UV-light. Increasing the temperature above the lower critical solution temperature of the copolymer deactivates the photoacid and irradiation at λ = 460 nm does not lead to the generation of protons or to any detectable change in the pH value of the solution. Hence, the addition of N-isopropylacrylamide as a comonomer acts as a thermal on/off switch for the photoacid and the coupling of temperature-and light-responsiveness in the polyphotoacids yields a ""thermophotoacid"".","EPID-based in vivo dosimetry using Dosimetry Check™: Overview and clinical experience in a 5-yr study including breast, lung, prostate, and head and neck cancer patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536528,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2019 05 17,"Independent verification of the dose delivered by complex radiotherapy can be performed by electronic portal imaging device (EPID) dosimetry.

However, as of yet, the research regarding immunotoxicity of 8:2 FTOH remains largely limited. In the present study, adult male C57BL/6 mice were administered with 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/d 8:2 FTOH by gavage for 28 days to investigate its immunotoxicity in vivo. The results showed that exposure to 8:2 FTOH caused increases in liver weight and histological changes in the liver, including vacuolation, cell swelling, immune cell infiltration, karyopyknosis and nuclear swelling. No histological change in either the spleen or the thymus was observed after administration of 8:2 FTOH. In addition, exposure to 8:2 FTOH reduced the concentration of IL-1β in serum, and mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in both the thymus and spleen. CXCL-1 mRNA expression was downregulated in both the liver and thymus after 8:2 FTOH administration, while only IL-1β mRNA expression was upregulated in the liver. Moreover, the exposure of primary cultured splenocytes to 8:2 FTOH inhibited the ConA-stimulated proliferation of splenocytes at concentrations of 30 and 100 μM, and the LPS-stimulated proliferation of splenocytes at 100 μM. Furthermore, 8:2 FTOH inhibited the level of secreted IFN-γ in ConA-stimulated splenocytes. The results obtained in the study demonstrated that 8:2 FTOH posed potential immunotoxicity and liver injury in mice. Our findings will provide novel data for the health risk assessment of 8:2 FTOH.",Intrathecal betamethasone for cancer pain: A study of its analgesic efficacy and safety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536525,Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,2019 04 04,"A preliminary study has shown effective cancer pain relief by intrathecal betamethasone (ITB).

However, the role of Eomes in CD4 T-cell differentiation is less well appreciated. In this issue of the European Journal of Immunology [Eur. J. Immunol. 2019. 49: 79-95] Mazzoni et al. and [Eur. J. Immunol. 2019. 49: 96-111] Gruarin et al. studied the role of Eomes in human CD4 T-cell differentiation. Mazzoni et al. showed that Eomes plays a key role in helper T cell (Th) plasticity by favoring the phenotype shift of Th17 cells toward non-classic Th1 cells; while Gruarin et al. proposed Eomes as a lineage-defining TF for human IL-10 and IFN-γ co-producing regulatory T-cells (Tr1 cells). Both studies show that Eomes drives IFN-γ secretion and stamps a ""cytotoxic"" signature, while it also represses Th17 features. However, additional signals including the cytokine milieu may further influence the fate of Eomes+ CD4 T cells. A common feature of Eomes+ CD4 T cells appears to be their accumulation in inflamed tissues in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. Whether Eomes favors expression of the proinflammatory cytokines or on the contrary, promotes the anti-inflammatory cytokines, remains a matter of debate.",Reagent-free and pH-independent degradation of N-nitrosamines using electrons generated via corona discharge at ambient pressure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536522,Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,2019 02 25,"Traditional degradation methods for N-nitrosamines are either confined with acid solution or required for additional chemical reagents to guarantee high reaction efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate a facile and effective way for reagent-free and pH-independent degradation of N-nitrosamines, which was induced by free electrons generated via corona discharge at ambient pressure. The highly reactive free electron is produced in situ and responsible for degradation of three N-nitrosamines, which was also theoretically confirmed. N-nitrosamines were believed to be reduced by electrons and to form the radical anion, which underwent a selectively heterolytic cleavage of the N-NO bonds to form the corresponding secondary amines as the degradation products.",Heat acclimation does not affect maximal aerobic power in thermoneutral normoxic or hypoxic conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536521,Experimental physiology,2019 04 26,"What is the central question of this study?

We showed that heat acclimation did not affect maximal cardiac output or maximal aerobic power in thermoneutral normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Heat acclimation augmented the sweating response in thermoneutral normoxic conditions.

As such, their folding is monitored by envelope stress response systems. Previous studies demonstrated that the Cpx envelope stress response is required for virulence of Citrobacter rodentium, a murine pathogen used to model infections by the human pathogens enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli; however, the mechanisms by which the Cpx response promotes host infection were previously unknown. Here, we characterized the C. rodentium Cpx regulon in order to identify genes required for host infection. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we found that the Cpx response upregulates envelope-localized protein folding and degrading factors but downregulates pilus genes and type III secretion effectors. Mouse infections with C. rodentium strains lacking individual Cpx-regulated genes showed that the chaperone/protease DegP and the disulfide bond oxidoreductase DsbA were essential for infection, but Cpx regulation of these genes did not fully account for attenuation of C. rodentium ΔcpxRA. Both deletion of dsbA and treatment with the reducing agent dithiothreitol activated the C. rodentium Cpx response, suggesting that it may sense disruption of disulfide bonding. Our results highlight the importance of envelope protein folding in host infection by Gram-negative pathogens."

Rats in groups A, B, C, and D received the vehicle of administration (olive oil), 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg body weight menadione intraperitoneally, respectively, for 7 days. Menadione lowered serum cholesterol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and testosterone and luteinizing hormone reduced significantly in rats when compared with the control rats. Furthermore, menadione lowered the testicular function indices in the testes of rats. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the testes of menadione-treated rats decreased significantly. Also, glutathione was depleted with concomitant malondialdehyde increase. The findings of this study show that menadione induces testicular toxicity by depleting the antioxidant defense system leading to perturbation in the testicular function indices.",Positive Allosteric Control of Guests Encapsulation by Metal Binding to Covalent Porphyrin Cages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536482,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 01 30,"The allosteric control of the receptor properties of two flexible covalent cages is reported.

Logistic regression was used to examine the main effects and interaction of race and geographic region on reconstruction. Hot spot Analysis was used to examine clustering of reconstruction across counties by race. We found large regional variation in racial differences in the rate of immediate postmastectomy reconstruction. Understanding how racial disparities vary by region can identify important factors for intervention to reduce disparities in practice.,"Assessing regional drought impacts on vegetation and evapotranspiration: a case study in Guanacaste, Costa Rica.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536477,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,2019 03 01,"This research investigates ecological responses to drought by developing a conceptual framework of vegetation response and investigating how multiple measures of drought can improve regional drought monitoring. We apply this approach to a case study of a recent drought in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. First, we assess drought severity with the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) based on a 64-yr precipitation record derived from a combination of Global Precipitation Climatology Center data and satellite observations from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and Global Precipitation Measurement. Then, we examine spatial patterns of precipitation, vegetation greenness, evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), and evaporative stress index (ESI) during the drought years of 2013, 2014, and 2015 relative to a baseline period (2002-2012). We compute wet season (May-October) anomalies for precipitation at 0.25° spatial resolution, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at 30-m spatial resolution, and ET, PET and ESI derived with the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) model at 1-km spatial resolution. We assess patterns of landscape response across years and land cover types including three kinds of forest (deciduous, old growth, and secondary), grassland, and cropland. Results show that rainfall in Guanacaste reached an all-time low in 2015 over a 64-yr record (wet season SPI = -3.46), resulting in NDVI declines. However, ET and ESI did not show significant anomalies relative to a baseline, drought-free period. Forests in the region exhibited lower water stress compared to grasslands and had smaller declines, and even some increases, in NDVI and ET during the drought period. This work highlights the value of using multiple measures to assess ecosystem responses to drought. It also suggests that agricultural land management has an opportunity to integrate these findings by emulating some of the characteristics of drought-resilient ecosystems in managed systems.",Neonatal influenza-specific effector CTLs retain elevated CD31 levels at the site of infection and have decreased IFN-γ production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536476,Journal of leukocyte biology,2019 02 26,"The underlying mechanisms that regulate neonatal immune suppression are poorly characterized. CD31 (PECAM1) is highly expressed on neonatal lymphocytes and is a known modulator of TCR signaling. To further characterize the role of CD31 in the neonatal CTL response, 3-d and 7-d-old murine neonates were infected with influenza virus and compared to adults. The majority of the pulmonary viral-specific CTLs in the 3-d-old murine neonate retain CD31 expression, whereas adult CTLs have decreased CD31 expression. In addition, CD31+ neonatal viral-specific CTLs demonstrate decreased IFN-γ production, decreased proliferative capacity, and increased likelihood of death. At the peak of infection, sorted neonatal effector CTLs continue to transcribe CD31, indicating a developmental regulation of expression. To explore potential mechanisms for this reduced function, we compared the expression of the transcription factors Eomesodermin (Eomes) and T-bet; there was a significant increase in Eomes paired with a reduction in T-bet in CD31+ neonatal effector CTLs in the lung. Furthermore, in vitro stimulated neonatal CTLs significantly reduce IFN-γ production upon CD31 signaling. Altogether, these data indicate that neonatal CTLs may retain elevated levels of CD31 to maintain peripheral T cell suppression during the bridge to ex utero life.",Guiding Principles for Designing Highly Efficient Metal-Free Carbon Catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536475,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 03 25,"Carbon nanomaterials are promising metal-free catalysts for energy conversion and storage, but the catalysts are usually developed via traditional trial-and-error methods.

The cell proliferation was inhibited by PL in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Electron microscopy, acridine orange staining, and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate autophagosome formation and LC3 protein expression in PL-treated SMMC-7721 cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed that PL treatment suppressed the expression of apoptosis and autophagy factors (LC3, Beclin1, Atg7, and Atg5), which are associated with tumor apoptosis and autophagy in SMMC-7721 cells. In the study of in vitro tumor nude mouse models, PL can inhibit tumor growth. Cell apoptosis and autophagy of the transplanted tumors were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling staining, and Western blot. In addition, in the in vivo studies of HCC cells, we found that pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked the formation of apoptosis induced by PL. In contrast, administration of the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD did not affect PL-induced autophagy. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that PL is a promising drug with significant antitumor activity in HCC.",Utility of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients receiving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for primary treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536472,Head & neck,2019 04 16,"Past research established that surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy (S + AR) improves overall survival (OS) in esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB).

However, little information is known about the genetic mechanisms by which crops respond to environmental changes induced by N signaling. Here, we dissected the genetic architecture of N-induced phenotypic plasticity in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by integrating functional mapping and semiautomatic high-throughput phenotyping data of yield-related canopy architecture. We identified a set of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that determined the pattern and magnitude of how wheat cultivars responded to low N stress from normal N supply throughout the wheat life cycle. This analysis highlighted the phenological landscape of genetic effects exerted by individual QTLs, as well as their interactions with N-induced signals and with canopy measurement angles. This information may shed light on our mechanistic understanding of plant adaptation and provide valuable information for the breeding of N-deficiency tolerant wheat varieties.",Gossypin inhibits gastric cancer growth by direct targeting of AURKA and RSK2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536456,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2019 06 13,"Gossypin is a flavone extracted from Hibiscus vitifolius, which has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. However, the anticancer properties of gossypin and its molecular mechanism of action against gastric cancer have not been fully investigated. In the present study, we report that gossypin is an Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and RSK2 inhibitor that suppresses gastric cancer growth. Gossypin attenuated anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent gastric cancer cell growth as well as cell migration. Based on the results of in vitro screening and cell-based assays, gossypin directly binds to and inhibits AURKA and RSK2 activities and their downstream signaling proteins. Gossypin decreased S phase and increased G2/M phase cell cycle arrest by reducing the expression of cyclin A2 and cyclin B1 and the phosphorylation of the CDC protein. Additionally, gossypin also induced intrinsic apoptosis by activating caspases and PARP and increasing the expression of cytochrome c. Our results demonstrate that gossypin is an AURKA and RSK2 inhibitor that could be useful for treating gastric cancer.",Effects of catalpol on bronchial asthma and its relationship with cytokines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536454,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"An animal (BALB/c mice) model of catalpol associated with bronchial asthma in vivo was established, and the effects of catalpol and its relationship with cytokines were investigated.

The malondialdehyde content in the lung tissue homogenate of the mice was also decreased in the catalpol group. The cytokines IL-5 and IL-4 exhibited a similar tendency: the concentrations of IL-4 and IL-5 for the catalpol group were dramatically decreased compared with the model group. However, the IFN-γ concentration for the catalpol group was higher than the model group. The results indicated that IL-5 may involve in the pathologic process of asthma-like IL-4, and an inflammatory reaction may still exist in the airway during the remission stage of asthma. The imbalances of the cytokine network might be an important molecular basis in the asthma pathogenesis. It is suggested that catalpol may be a potential drug for the clinical treatment of asthma.",Evaluating Collaborative Readiness for Interdisciplinary Flood Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536453,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2018 12 11,"Increasing trends in global flood risk are driven by a complex web of interactions among natural, built environment, and social systems. As a result, flood resilience research is an ideal topic for an interdisciplinary approach. Core characteristics of interdisciplinary research are team collaboration and the systematic integration of disciplinary knowledge, in both problem formulation and analytical methods. Indicators of interdisciplinarity tend to focus on scholarly outcomes, but collaborative processes may be even more important for knowledge integration. In this Perspective piece, we outline and advocate a two-pronged approach to enhance potential for integrating knowledge: using collaborative proximity to assess team readiness to conduct interdisciplinary research and employing program evaluation to assess change in proximity components over time. To do so, we draw on scholarship in economic geography, team science, and program evaluation. We then connect the findings to a case study of collaboration within our interdisciplinary team of flood researchers, program evaluators, and local stakeholders, as we navigate a multi-institutional project on flood resilience.",Matrix Coordination Induced Emission in a Three-Dimensional Silver Cluster-Assembled Material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536452,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 25,"Developing highly luminescent and extensively stable silver cluster-assembled materials (SCAMs) from the inferior luminogens and unstable silver cluster is an important and challenging issue. Herein, a new luminescent three-dimensional SCAM (Ag12 CPPP, [Ag12 (StBu)6 (CF3 COO)6 (CPPP)2 (DMAc)12 ]n ; CPPP=2,5-bis(4-cyanophenyl)-1,4-bis(4-(pyridine-4-yl)-phenyl)-1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole, DMAc=dimethylacetamide) was designed and synthesized with a quadridentate rigid emission ligand (CPPP) and a silver-chalcogenolate cluster (SCC) containing 12 AgI atoms. The luminescence study indicates that CPPP is an aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) molecule with twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) character. Benefiting from the strong immobilization effect in the robust framework, the quantum yield of CPPP is greatly enhanced in Ag12 CPPP compared with that of CPPP in solution or in the solid state. As a result, Ag12 CPPP exhibits typical matrix coordination induced emission (MCIE) effect. Such efficient rigidifying methodology provides a promising approach for enhancing luminescence of ACQ molecules in an aggregated state and strengthening the silver cluster in an unstable state.",Influence of surface wetness on bonding effectiveness of universal adhesives in etch-and-rinse mode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536451,European journal of oral sciences,2019 03 20,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether surface wetness would influence the bonding effectiveness of universal adhesives in etch-and-rinse mode. All-Bond Universal (AB), G-Premio Bond (GP), Prime & Bond Active (PB), and Scotchbond Universal Adhesive (SU) were evaluated. Initial bond strengths and bond-fatigue strengths of universal adhesives to both wet and dry enamel and dentin in etch-and-rinse mode were determined. Scanning electron microscopy observations of the adhesive interfaces were also conducted. The bond-fatigue durability of universal adhesive to enamel in etch-and-rinse mode was influenced by the surface wetness, unlike that to dentin. The bond fatigue durability of AB and GP to dentin in etch-and-rinse mode was different depending on the surface wetness, unlike that of PB and SU. The thicknesses of the adhesive or hybrid layer of resin-dentin interfaces were not influenced by the surface wetness, but the length of resin tags in the wet group was longer than in the dry group. Some universal adhesives with the addition of specific components and optimization of water content can achieve stable bonds regardless of surface wetness, but the surface wetness of dentin is still a significant factor for universal adhesive bonding in etch-and rinse mode, unlike that of enamel.",Atherothrombotic risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction: The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Risk Score for Secondary Prevention in the light of the French Registry of Acute ST Elevation or non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction registries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536449,Clinical cardiology,2019 05 07,Guidelines recommend using risk stratification tools in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to assist decision-making.

This retrospective analysis comprises 2000 single-organ KTx recipients transplanted between 2011 and 2016 in the two largest transplant centers of the Netherlands. TEC and bleeding events were scored ≤7 days post-KTx. Primary analyses were for associations of antithrombotic therapy with incidence of TEC and bleeding. Secondary analyses were for associations of other potential risk factors. Mean age was 55 ± 14 years, 59% was male and 60% received a living donor kidney. Twenty-one patients (1.1%) had a TEC. Multiple donor arteries [OR 2.79 (1.15-6.79)] and obesity [OR 2.85 (1.19-6.82)] were identified as potential risk factors for TEC. Bleeding occurred in 88 patients (4.4%) and incidence varied significantly between different antithrombotic therapies (P = 0.006). Cardiovascular disease [OR 2.01 (1.18-3.42)], pre-emptive KTx [OR 2.23 (1.28-3.89)], postoperative heparin infusion [OR 1.69 (1.00-2.85)], and vitamin K antagonists [OR 6.60 (2.95-14.77)] were associated with an increased bleeding risk. Intraoperative heparin and antiplatelet therapy were not associated with increased bleeding risk.

This study was determined whether TMEM196 gene hypermethylation and downregulation are considered to be promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in lung cancer. Methylation status was detected with methylation-specific PCR. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were used to determine the significance of prognosis. TMEM196 gene was hypermethylated in 68.1% (64/94) of lung cancer tissues, 52.8% (67/127) of plasma and 55.2% (79/143) of sputum samples, but unmethylated (0/50) in normal tissues. TMEM196 methylation in plasma and sputum samples was significantly correlated with that in the corresponding paired tumor tissues (r = 0.750, r = 0.880, P < 0.001). TMEM196 aberrant methylation in cancer tissues, plasma and sputum DNA was significantly associated with age and pathological type (P < 0.05). TMEM196 high methylation could robustly distinguish lung cancer patients (AUC = 0.905) from normal subjects and patients with TMEM196 high methylation have a significantly poorer survival than those with low level from The Cancer Genome Atlas (Wilcoxon P < 0.001). Multivariate models showed TMEM196 methylation is an independent prognostic marker in lung cancer. Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with low TMEM196 expression was significantly poorer than that of TMEM196-high patients (P < 0.001, log-rank test). Low TMEM196 expression in tumor tissues was found to predict poorer survival (HR = 3.007; 95%CI, 1.918-4.714). Our study provided new insights into the clinical importance and potential use of TMEM196 methylation and expression as novel early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for human lung cancers."

The US regulations that describe functional Ig lot release thus require the demonstration of minimum antibody titers against these two viruses, although the use of vaccines has now dramatically reduced their incidence. The lower clinical importance of these viruses raises the question of whether other virus antibodies might be more informative for patients with immunodeficiency.",Antibodies to vaccine antigens in pooled polyclonal human IgG products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536430,Transfusion,2019 04 23,"Immune-deficient patients depend on the antibodies in pooled human immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations to remain free from serious infections. The potency of IgG preparations is therefore an ongoing concern. The use of pooled IgG to prevent infection is based on the concept that healthy adults have recovered from infections earlier in life and maintain relatively high antibody titers. In general, vaccine-induced immunity is less robust or long-lasting than immunity after natural infection, and many infectious diseases which were formerly widely prevalent have become much less common due to improved hygiene and vaccines. This raises questions as to the adequacy of protective antibodies in current IgG preparations. This paper reviews available data on antibodies against selected bacterial and virus vaccine antigens in current IgG products. Most products contain sufficient antibody to yield levels above minimal protective concentrations to a broad range of pathogens and toxins. Illustrative examples of effects of vaccines on antibody content of IgG products are also discussed: antibody titers to hepatitis A virus in donor plasma pools in both the US and EU are dropping due to decreased natural infection, but they are still sufficient to provide robust protection. Increasing seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus as a result of immunization suggests that antibody titers against this virus may actually be increasing. Finally, serial studies suggest that pooled IgG provides protection against seasonal influenza viruses despite year-to-year antigenic drift, and is also likely to provide at least some protective antibody against potentially pandemic strains.",Humoral immunodeficiencies: conferred risk of infections and benefits of immunoglobulin replacement therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536429,Transfusion,2019 06 10,"Primary immunodeficiency (PID) diseases result from genetic defects of the immune system that increase a patient's susceptibility to infections. The types of infections that occur in patients with PID diseases are dictated largely by the nature of the immunodeficiency, which can be defined by dysfunction of cellular or humoral defenses. An increasing number of PID diseases, including those with both cellular and humoral defects, have antibody deficiency as a major feature, and as a result can benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In fact, the most common PID diseases worldwide are antibody deficiencies and include common variable immunodeficiency, congenital agammaglobulinemia, hyper-IgM syndrome, specific antibody deficiency, and Good syndrome. Although immunoglobulin replacement therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of these conditions, a thorough understanding of the specific infections for which these patients are at increased risk can hasten diagnosis and guide additional therapies. Moreover, the infection trends in some patients with PID disease who have profound defects of cellular immunity, such as autosomal-dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (Job/Buckley syndrome) or dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, suggest that select patients might benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy even if their immunodeficiency is not limited to antibody defects. In this review, we provide an overview of the predisposition to infections seen in PID disease that may benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy.",Evaluation of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay compared to a first-generation cardiac troponin I assay in Doberman Pinschers with and without dilated cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536428,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,2019 02 15,"Echocardiography and 24-hour ECG are the gold standard tests to diagnose dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in Doberman Pinschers (DP), but myocardial damage might be detected earlier using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay.",SUSAN: segment unannotated image structure using adversarial network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536427,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 03 12,To describe and evaluate a segmentation method using joint adversarial and segmentation convolutional neural network to achieve accurate segmentation using unannotated MR image datasets.,Evolution of Our Understanding of the Hyperparathyroid Syndromes: A Historical Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536424,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2019 03 03,"We review advancing and overlapping stages for our understanding of the expressions of six hyperparathyroid (HPT) syndromes: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or type 4, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism, and familial isolated hyperparathyroidism. During stage 1 (1903 to 1967), the introduction of robust measurement of serum calcium was a milestone that uncovered hypercalcemia as the first sign of dysfunction in many HPT subjects, and inheritability was reported in each syndrome. The earliest reports of HPT syndromes were biased toward severe or striking manifestations. During stage 2 (1959 to 1985), the early formulations of a syndrome were improved. Radioimmunoassays (parathyroid hormone [PTH], gastrin, insulin, prolactin, calcitonin) were breakthroughs. They could identify a syndrome carrier, indicate an emerging tumor, characterize a tumor, or monitor a tumor. During stage 3 (1981 to 2006), the assembly of many cases enabled recognition of further details. For example, hormone non-secreting skin lesions were discovered in MEN1 and MEN2A. During stage 4 (1985 to the present), new genomic tools were a revolution for gene identification. Four principal genes (""principal"" implies mutated or deleted in 50% or more probands for its syndrome) (MEN1, RET, CASR, CDC73) were identified for five syndromes. During stage 5 (1993 to the present), seven syndromal genes other than a principal gene were identified (CDKN1B, CDKN2B, CDKN2C, CDKN1A, GNA11, AP2S1, GCM2). Identification of AP2S1 and GCM2 became possible because of whole-exome sequencing. During stages 4 and 5, the newly identified genes enabled many studies, including robust assignment of the carriers and non-carriers of a mutation. Furthermore, molecular pathways of RET and the calcium-sensing receptor were elaborated, thereby facilitating developments in pharmacotherapy. Current findings hold the promise that more genes for HPT syndromes will be identified and studied in the near future. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",Perspective into the regulation of cell-generated forces toward stem cell migration and differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536423,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 11,"Stem cells are promising candidates for cell-based therapies in diverse conditions including regenerating damaged tissues, treating inflammation in virtue of sepsis, acute renal failure, and cardiovascular disease. Advancement of these therapies relies on the ability to guide stem cells to migrate directly and differentiate towards specific cell phenotypes. During the past decade, many researchers have demonstrated that exogenous applied forces could significantly affect the migration and lineage differentiation of stem cells. Besides, recent advances have highlighted the critical role of internal forces due to cell-matrix interaction in the function of stem cells. Stem cells can generate contractile forces to sense the mechanical properties of cell-generated force microenvironment, and thereby perceive mechanical information that directs broad aspects of stem cell functions, including migration and lineage commitment. In the review, we recount the cell-generated force microenvironment of stem cells and discuss the interactions between cell-generated forces with migration and differentiation of stem cells.

A population pharmacokinetics model was developed with data from 465 patients and 3300 pharmacokinetic samples. Simulations provided data to support revision of the dosing recommendations to remove body weight-adjusted dosing, and the analysis formed the basis for updates that are reflected on the current imipenem label for both the United States and Europe. The optimized regimen provided an advantage in terms of improved target attainment at breakpoint minimum inhibitory concentration values of 1 and 2 μg/mL, as low-body-weight patients maintained >90% probability of target attainment compared to <90% probability of target attainment achieved with the previously approved regimen. It was concluded that additional dose adjustments for body weight were not necessary and the new scheme would simplify dosing while maintaining patient safety and efficacy."

However, the preclinical investigation of long-term cerebral injury and recovery mechanisms related to DHCA has been restricted to a satisfactory recovery animal model with a determined recovery time. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a long-term surviving DHCA model without blood priming in rats, in order to investigate the pathophysiology of long-term complications in further studies. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups: sham group (n = 3) and DHCA group (n = 9). The DHCA group was further assigned to the surviving time of postoperative day 2, 14, and 30 (n = 3, respectively). The entire cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit consisted of a modified reservoir, a custom-designed small-volume membrane oxygenator, a roller pump and a heater/cooler. A 24-G catheter was cannulated in the branch of the left femoral artery for arterial blood pressure monitoring. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via the right external jugular vein-right atrium and tail artery. Rats were cooled to a rectal temperature of 18°C, followed by 30 minutes of DHCA with global ischemia. After re-warming for approximately 40 minutes, the animals were weaned from the CPB at 35.5°C. Blood gas and hemodynamic parameters were recorded preoperatively and intraoperatively, and at 2, 14, and 30 days postoperatively. Thereafter, the brains were perfusion fixed and histologically analyzed. All DHCA processes were successfully achieved, and none of the rats died. Blood gas analysis and hemodynamic parameters at each time point were normal, and vital signs of all rats were stable. Histopathologic deficits in the hippocampus (pathological score, surviving hippocampal neurons, and Ki67-positive neurons) manifested after 30 minutes of DHCA, which persisted for at least 14 days and recovered after 30 days. A novel and simple long-term recovery model of DHCA in rats was established in the present study, and histopathologic deficits were observed after clinically relevant 30-minute DHCA durations, in order to determine the 30-day recovery time frame.",Effect of experimentally induced hypertension on cerebellum of postmenopausal rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536406,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Cerebellum seems to be a specific target for both the decrease of estrogen and hypertension in menopause. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypertension and menopause-induced changes in rat's cerebellar cortex and the possible mechanisms of these changes. Rats were divided into four groups: the sham-operated control (SC-group), the ovariectomized (OVX-group), the hypertensive (H-group), and the ovariectomized-hypertensive (OVX-H-group) group. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum nitric oxide (NO), lipid peroxides and antioxidant catalase enzyme levels were assayed. Cerebellar tissue homogenization for analysis of lipid peroxides, antioxidant catalase enzyme, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and estradiol was done. Quantification of adrenomedullin (AM) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA was also done. Cerebella were processed for histological, immunohistochemical and transmission electron microscopic examination. In the OVX-group, insignificant structural and biochemical changes were observed compared with the SC-group apart from the significantly increased lipid peroxides and decreased NO and catalase levels in serum. The H-group showed an elevated lipid peroxides and TNF-α levels, reduced catalase level, numerous degenerated Purkinje cells, vacuolations of the neuropil, some axonal degeneration, and few ghosts in the granular cell layer (GL). However, in OVX-H-group, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cerebellar damage were exacerbated and cerebellar estrogen was reduced associated with reduction in GL thickness and decreased Purkinje cells number. Most axoplasms had degenerated neurofilaments with abnormal myelination. The immunoexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein were significantly increased in both OVX-group and H-group and significantly decreased in OVX-H group. Gene expression of AM and IL-10 were increased in cerebellar tissues of H-group compared with the SC-group but it was significantly decreased in OVX-H-group compared with H-group. Taken together, postmenopausal rats with hypertension suffered from structural cerebellar changes than rats with only hypertension or estrogen deficiency separately due to augmentation of the increased oxidative stress markers and the proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α) with down regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and the blood pressure regulator, AM.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a class of small noncoding RNAs, which have remarkable functions in cell formation, differentiation, and cancer development and contribute in these processes through controlling the expressions of protein-coding genes by repressing translation or breaking down the messenger RNA in a sequence-specific method. miRNAs in cancer are able to reflect informative data about the current status of disease and this might benefit PCa prognosis and diagnosis since that is concerned to PCa patients and we intend to highlight it in this paper.",Dimethyl fumarate: Regulatory effects on the immune system in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536402,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an important oral treatment option for various autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and psoriasis. DMF and its dynamic metabolite, monomethyl fumarate (MMF) are the major compounds that exert therapeutic effects on several pathologic conditions in part, through downregulation of immune responses. The exact mechanism of DMF is yet to be fully understood even though its beneficial effects on the immune system are extensively studied. It has been shown that DMF/MMF can affect various immune cells, which can get involved in both the naive and adaptive immune systems, such as T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells. It is suggested that DMF/MMF may exert their effect on immune cells through inhibition of nuclear factor-κB translocation, upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2(E2)-related factor antioxidant pathway, and activation of hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor 2.

In this study, we addressed the dependence of somatic release on Ca2+ influx in trigeminal neurons and the involvement of the different types of voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels in the process. Similar to the closely related dorsal root ganglion neurons, we found two kinetically distinct components of somatic release, a faster component stimulated by voltage but independent of the Ca2+ influx, and a slower component triggered by Ca2+ influx. The Ca2+ -dependent component was inhibited 80% by ω-conotoxin-MVIIC, an inhibitor of both N- and P/Q-type Cav channels, and 55% by the P/Q-type selective inhibitor ω-agatoxin-IVA. The selective L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor nimodipine was instead without effect. These results suggest a major involvement of N- and P/Q-, but not L-type Cav channels in the somatic release of trigeminal neurons. Thus antinociceptive Cav channel antagonists acting on the N- and P/Q-type channels may exert their function by also modulating the somatic release and cross-communication between sensory neurons.",In vitro modulatory effect of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate on apoptosis and expression of apoptosis-related genes in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536399,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Systemic lupus erythematosus‌ (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by hyperactive B cells that produce various autoantibodies.

Paternal/maternal obesity and diabetes can also be transmitted to the subsequent generation via gametes, suggesting the association of epigenetic inheritance with obesity and diabetes, particularly for its effects on offspring. Recent studies indicate that both obesity and diabetes change DNA and histone methylation levels, histone acetylation, and noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in oocytes and sperm. Several important genes, such as PPAR-α, Igf2, H19, Fyn, Stella, Sirt3, Sirt6, and Peg3 as well as miRNAs, such as let-7c, reportedly participate in the regulation of epigenetic modifications in mammalian gametes. This review summarizes the recent progress that links obesity/diabetes and reproductive disorders from the perspective of gamete epigenetic modifications."

High GI food can be detrimental to diabetics since they can rapidly increase the glucose level in blood during digestion. Instant rice is increasing in popularity and is produced by dehydrating whole grain cooked rice, therefore, to make it more suitable for diabetics, the effect of the processes involved in the production on GI were tested. The objective was to optimize cooking temperature and the ratio of water to rice to reduce in vitro starch digestibility and GI of instant rice made from three Thai rice cultivars (Hom Mali (KDML105), Pathumthani Fragrant (PT) and Sao Hai (SH)) that had different amylose contents. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the cooking conditions. The rapidly digestible starch (RDS) content and estimated glycemic index (eGI) decreased as cooking temperature decreased and the ratio of water to rice increased. The decrease in RDS content was associated with the increase in both slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) contents. The microstructure of instant rice kernels after cooking at higher temperature or lower volumes of water showed larger voids and a less compact surface, which facilitated enzymatic accessibility and increased starch digestibility. Rice cooked at higher temperature (90 °C) showed lower peak viscosity and breakdown in pasting properties, compared with lower temperature 82 °C. The optimal cooking condition for producing lower GI instant rice was cooking at 82 °C with 1.9-fold water volume. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Rice has a high glycemic index (GI) that makes it unsuitable for consumption by many people with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Therefore, preparation of an instant rice product with a lower GI would ensure the product was beneficial to a wider range of the population.",Curcumin as a therapeutic candidate for multiple sclerosis: Molecular mechanisms and targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536381,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that has shown a considerable increase in prevalence in recent centuries. Current knowledge about its etiology is incomplete, and therefore it cannot be managed optimally utilizing targeted therapeutic regimens at each stage of the disease. MS progresses in different stages, beginning with a cascade of inflammation. The pivotal spark to initiate this cascade seems to be the migration of Th17 into the central nervous system across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through the disrupted tight junctions. Coupling of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 to their receptors in the BBB layer facilitates this migration. Subsequently, axon degeneration and the various manifestations of nerve-muscle disorders appear. Curcumin, a major component of turmeric, is derived from Curcuma longa, which belongs to the Zingiberaceae family. Numerous properties of curcumin have been identified recently, some of which can be effective in the treatment of MS, particularly the anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. In this paper, we will review the various properties and key effects of curcumin for the treatment of MS.",The role of microRNAs in embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation in male germ cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536380,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"New perspectives have been opened by advances in stem cell research for reproductive and regenerative medicine. Several different cell types can be differentiated from stem cells (SCs) under suitable in vitro and in vivo conditions. The differentiation of SCs into male germ cells has been reported by many groups. Due to their unlimited pluripotency and self-renewal, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used as valuable tools for drug delivery, disease modeling, developmental studies, and cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine. The unique features of SCs are controlled by a dynamic interplay between extrinsic signaling pathways, and regulations at epigenetic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. In recent years, significant progress has been made toward better understanding of the functions and expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) in the maintenance of SC pluripotency. miRNAs are short noncoding molecules, which play a functional role in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, the important regulatory role of miRNAs in differentiation and dedifferentiation has been recently demonstrated. A balance between differentiation and pluripotency is maintained by miRNAs in the embryo and stem cells. This review summarizes the recent findings about the role of miRNAs in the regulation of self-renewal and pluripotency of iPSCs and ESCs, as well as their impact on cellular reprogramming and stem cell differentiation into male germ cells.",Long noncoding RNA GACAT3 promotes glioma progression by sponging miR-135a.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536379,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) gastric cancer associated transcript 3 (GACAT3) has been reported to play important roles in human tumorigenesis. However, its expression pattern, functions, and underlying mechanism in glioma remain unclear. In the present study, we showed that GACAT3 is upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Through online databases, luciferase reporter assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, we determined that GACAT3 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for microRNA (miR)-135a, which was downregulated and performed as a tumor inhibitor in glioma. Further, nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) was confirmed as a target gene of miR-135a by a series of gain- and loss-of-function assays. Overall, the present study was the first to show that GACAT3 regulates the expression of NAMPT to promote glioma progression by sponging miR-135a. These findings provide a promising therapy strategy for glioma.","Prevalence, pathological mechanisms, and genetic basis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies: A review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536378,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 28,"Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are a highly heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders that are associated with weakness and wasting of muscles in legs and arms. Signs and symptoms may begin at any age and usually worsen by time. LGMDs are autosomal disorders with different types and their prevalence is not the same in different areas. New technologies such as next-generation sequencing can accelerate their diagnosis. Several important pathological mechanisms that are involved in the pathology of the LGMD include abnormalities in dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, the sarcomere, glycosylation of dystroglycan, vesicle and molecular trafficking, signal transduction pathways, and nuclear functions. Here, we provide a comprehensive review that integrates LGMD clinical manifestations, prevalence, and some pathological mechanisms involved in LGMDs.","Loss of Lgr4 inhibits differentiation, migration and apoptosis, and promotes proliferation in bone mesenchymal stem cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536377,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"The key signaling networks regulating bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are poorly defined. Lgr4, which belongs to the leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor (LGR) family, is widely expressed in multiple tissues from early embryogenesis to adulthood. We investigated whether Lgr4 functions in BMSCs and in osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and skeletal myoblasts, using mice with a β-geo gene trap inserted into the Lgr4 gene. Abundant Lgr4 expression was detected in skeletal, adipose and muscular tissue of Lgr4+/- mice at E16.5 by β-gal staining, and Lgr4-deficiency promoted BMSC proliferation (16 ± 4 in wild-type [WT] and 28 ± 2 in Lgr4-/- ) using colony forming units-fibroblast assay, while suppressing BMSC migration (from 103 ± 18 in WT to 57 ± 10 in Lgr4-/- ) by transwell migration assay and apoptosis ratio (from 0.0720 ± 0.0123 to 0.0189 ± 0.0051) by annexin V staining assay. Deletion of Lgr4 decreased bone mass (BV/TV from 19.16 ± 2.14 in WT mice to 10.36 ± 1.96 in KO) and fat mass through inhibiting BMSC differentiation to osteoblasts or adipocytes. Furthermore, LGR4-regulated osteogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic gene expression. Importantly, our data showed that loss of Lgr4-inhibited fracture healing by suppressing osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, deletion of Lgr4 in BMSCs-delayed fracture healing following stem cell therapy by BMSC transplantation. Together, our results demonstrated that LGR4 is essential for mesoderm-derived tissue development and BMSC differentiation, demonstrating that LGR4 could be a promising drug target for related diseases and a critical protein for stem cell therapy.",Artemisinin inhibits breast cancer-induced osteolysis by inhibiting osteoclast formation and breast cancer cell proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536376,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 04 23,"In addition to being used to treat malaria, artemisinin (Art) can be used as an anti-inflammatory and antitumor agent. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Art on osteoclast formation and activation and on the development of breast cancer cells in bone. To evaluate the effect of Art on osteoclast differentiation in vitro, we treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with various concentrations of Art and evaluated the expression of genes and proteins involved in osteoclast formation. We also performed cell counting kit-8 assays to evaluate the toxicity of Art in BMMs and MDA-MB-231 cells. We also performed Transwell assays, wound-healing assays, colony formation assays, and cell apoptosis assays to evaluate the effect of Art in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also evaluated the effect of Art in an in vivo osteoclast bone resorption assay using a nude mouse model. We demonstrated that Art inhibits the differentiation and establishment of osteoclasts even though Art is not toxic to osteoclasts. In addition, Art reduced expression of genes involved in osteoclast formation and inhibited osteoclast bone resorption in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on our data, we believe that Art can inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells by activating apoptosis pathways, and inhibit osteoclast formation and differentiation by inhibiting activation of cathepsin K, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit D2, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, calcitonin receptor, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB activation.",Berberine reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of normal colonic epithelial cells induced by SW480 cells through regulating the important components in the TGF-β pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536375,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 20,"Stroma-tumor interactions within microenvironment play a crucial role in tumor development and growth. Cellular transdifferentiation in the stroma is a prerequisite for tumor formation. Targeting the interactions maybe a promising anticancer strategy. Berberine (BBR) has been confirmed to have anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. We found for the first time that colon cancer cells SW480 induced spindle-like morphological changes and downregulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin in colon epithelial cells HCoEpiCs by using transwell coculture system and conditioned medium from SW480. The conditioned medium also promoted the migration of HCoEpiCs. This transition was inhibited by a transforming growth factor-β receptor inhibitor LY364947. BBR (50 and 100 µg/ml) reversed the EMT-like transition and repressed the migration in HCoEpiCs. Further results demonstrated that downregulation of TβRII, Smad2, p-Smad3, and overexpression of Smad3 participated in the SW480-induced phenotypic transition of HCoEpiCs. In addition, BBR upregulated the expressions of TβRII, Smad2, and p-Smad3. In conclusion, our findings suggest that BBR exerts the anti-EMT and antimigration effect by mediating the expression of TβRII, Smad2, and p-Smad3.",Cancer incidence in Northern Uganda (2013-2016).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536374,International journal of cancer,2019 04 13,"Gulu Cancer Registry was established in 2014 to assess the incidence and survival of cancer in 4 districts of the Acholi Sub-region of northern Uganda. Here we report the results of the first 4 years of registration (2013-2016) in this largely rural population of 771,514. In total there were 1627 cases of cancers registered; 644 among men (corresponding to an ASR of 106.7 per 100,000 population) and 983 cancer cases among women (ASR 118.5 per 100,000). The most common cancers were cancers of the cervix and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in females, and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Kaposi Sarcoma, prostate and liver cancers in men. Incidence rates of Burkitt lymphoma in children were high in comparison to elsewhere in Africa, whilst the incidence of breast cancer in women was rather low. The figures suggest a rather different pattern from that observed in the metropolitan population of Kampala, where there has been a cancer registry since 1951. This helps to provide a more complete picture of the national cancer profile, permitting more targeted interventions in prevention, early detection and treatment services."

During a routine examination of the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) files of patients who were scanned for dental medical purposes, we identified a case with multiple rare anatomic variations. First, the petrous apex was bilaterally pneumatized. Moreover, bilateral and multilocular pneumatizations of the AT were observed, while on one side it was further found that the pneumatic cells were equally dehiscent towards the extradural space and the superior joint space. To the best of our knowledge, such dehiscence has not previously been reported. The two temporomastoid pneumatizations were extended with occipital pneumatizations of the lateral masses and occipital condyles, the latter being an extremely rare evidence. The internal dehiscence of the mandibular canal in the right ramus of the mandible was also noted. Additionally, double mental foramen and impacted third molars were found on the left side. Such multilocular PAT represents a low-resistance pathway for the bidirectional spread of fluids through the roof of the TMJ. Further, it could add to a morphological picture of hyperpneumatization of the posterior cranial fossa floor, which could signify the involvement of the last four cranial nerves in the clinical picture of TMJ pain.",Cross-over type of supernumerary digastric muscle: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536357,Folia morphologica,2018 12 11,"A cross-over type asymmetric anomaly of the anterior belly of the right digastric muscle was observed during a cadaveric dissection of the submental region.

It is a modified method of brain fixation and dissection, based on freezing and thawing of the brain tissue, subsequent peeling away of white matter fibers and the gradual exposure of white matter tracts. The added value of this technique is that it is carried out in a stratigraphic manner; This fact makes it an invaluable tool for an in-depth understanding of the complex anatomical organization of the cerebral hemispheres. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of Klingler's method while taking into account the original description of the technique and its value for medical training. The historical background, the concise outline of white matter organization, as well as our own experience in using this procedure for research and teaching activities were also included. The fiber dissection technique may still be considered an excellent complementary research tool for neuroanatomical studies. Numerous detailed observations about the white matter topography and spatial organization have been recently made by applying this method. Using this technique may also improve understanding of the three-dimensional intrinsic structure of the brain, which is particularly important both in under- and postgraduate training in the field of neuroanatomy.",Sex and level differences in the diameters of extradural segment of vertebral artery: CT angiographic study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536355,Folia morphologica,2018 12 11,"We investigated diameters of prevertebral -V1, and atlantic -V3 parts of extradural segment of vertebral artery (VA). Variable results from the literature about VA diameters reflect variety of diagnostic and imaging methods, various sample sizes, different levels of measurements, and lack of possible specific ethnic, regional or genetic data. Additionally, the data are often without distinctions of left- right or of sex. For this CT angiographic study were selected 91 adult person (182 vertebral arteries) of both sexes (47 males and 44 females) and of age between 33 and 75 years. Diameters were measured at fixed predefined points of VA, marked as inferior (A) point (at V1 part in region of VA origin), as middle (B) point (the end of V1 part), and superior (C) point, at V3 part - 5 mm before VA penetrated the dura. Inferior (A) and middle (B) points actually represent locations at beginning (A) and at terminal (B) regions of V1 part of VA, and superior point C represents terminal part of V3. In total sample ipsilateral (both left and right sided) diameters on investigated levels of VA showed progressive and highly significant decreases. The mean values were on the right side at point A 3.63 mm, at B point 3.31 mm, and at C point 3.08 mm. On the left side, mean values were at point A 3.76 mm, at B point 3.50 mm, and at point C 3.21 mm. Pattern of increasing sex differences in diameters of VA, was ranging from no differences (point A), trough significant (point B), to highly significant differences (point C). For inferior point (A) we did not find significant differences in VA diameters between males (right 3.78 mm; left 3.89 mm) and females (right 3.50 mm; left 3.62 mm), in middle (B) point sex differences were significant (males - right 3.44 mm, left 3.66 mm; females -right 3.18 mm, left 3.33 mm) and in most superior point (C) differences were highly significant (males -right 3.278 mm, left 3.39 mm; females - right 2.88 mm, left 3.01 mm). However, we did not find significant intrasex (in males or in females) left- right differences in mean values of VA diameters for all three investigated levels.

Growing prospective and retrospective evidence supports the use of RT, particularly stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), for a wide range of indications in HCC from locally advanced unresectable disease to bridge therapy for liver transplant candidates. SBRT is associated with excellent local control, even for patients refractory to or ineligible for other forms of locoregional therapy.

Early diagnosis is a key challenge because of the lack of specific symptoms, and the curability rate is low due to the difficulty in achieving a radical resection and the intrinsic chemoresistance of CCA cells. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are transcripts that are not translated into proteins but exert their functional role by regulating the transcription and translation of other genes. The discovery of the first ncRNA dates back to 1993 when the microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 was discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans. Only 10 years later, miRNAs were shown to play an oncogenic role in cancer cells and within 20 years miRNA therapeutics were tested in humans.

These are tumors that are in contact with the nerve but do not bind the fibers. Benign neoplasms of the Schwann cells of the auditory and equilibrium nerves can also occur primarily in the inner ear and are referred to as intralabyrinthine schwannomas (ILS). Vestibular schwannomas represent 6-7 % of all intracranial and 90 % of cerebellopontine angle tumors. Bilateral occurrence occurs in < 5 % of cases, and then corresponds to type 2 neurofibromatosis. The first symptom is often a unilateral hearing loss. It may then lead to balance disorders, tinnitus, facial paralysis and other impairments. Diagnosis is audiological, vestibular and imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging currently represents the gold standard. Management chooses between an observational strategy and surgery, depending on tumor size, age, and other factors. The possible access routes offer different advantages and disadvantages; the potential complications include the liquorrhoea. Radiation therapy is possible in special cases, and drug therapies are also being tested. In the rehabilitation of the hearing function, in addition to a CROS or BICROS restoration, the cochlear implant has been used with good success.

To determine the effects of EPA on metabolic pathways in obese adipose tissues and liver, mice were fed normal chow diet (NCD), high-fat diet (HFD), or 3% EPA-containing high fat diet (HFD+EPA) for 8 weeks. Metabolomic analysis was performed using epididymal adipose tissues (epi WAT) and liver. Metabolites that were specifically elevated in HFD+EPA, were assessed for their anti-inflammatory properties using RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Body and adipose tissue weights were significantly higher in HFD than NCD, and lower in HFD+EPA than HFD. Plasma insulin levels were significantly higher in HFD than NCD, and lower in HFD+EPA compared with HFD. Plasma monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels were higher in HFD than NCD, and tended to be lower in HFD+EPA than HFD. The levels of intermediate metabolites in the glycolytic pathways were lower in HFD compared with NCD and HFD+EPA in both epi WAT and liver, while intermediate metabolites of the TCA cycles were elevated in HFD and HFD+EPA compared with NCD in epi WAT. Among the metabolites in epi WAT, the levels of thiaproline, phenaceturic acid, and pipecolic acid were specifically elevated in HFD+EPA, but not in HFD or NCD. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with thiaproline significantly ameliorated LPS-induced iNOS expression, while pipecolic acid inhibited LPS-induced IL-1β expression.

The functionality, as well as the current and recommended usage of each given imaging system, will be discussed.",Non-viral Gene Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536226,Experientia supplementum (2012),2019 05 13,"Although viral vectors comprise the majority of gene delivery vectors, their various safety, production, and other practical concerns have left a research gap to be addressed. The non-viral vector space encompasses a growing variety of physical and chemical methods capable of gene delivery into the nuclei of target cells. Major physical methods described in this chapter are microinjection, electroporation, and ballistic injection, magnetofection, sonoporation, optical transfection, and localized hyperthermia. Major chemical methods described in this chapter are lipofection, polyfection, gold complexation, and carbon-based methods. Combination approaches to improve transfection efficiency or reduce immunological response have shown great promise in expanding the scope of non-viral gene delivery."

Unlike conventional statistical mediation models, this biometric mediation model can detect unobserved confounding. Using a sample of 1410 pairs of Norwegian twins, we investigated specific hypotheses that DSM-IV personality-disorder (PD) traits mediate effects of childhood stressful life events (SLEs) on AUD, and that adulthood SLEs mediate effects of PDs on AUD. Models including borderline PD traits indicated unobserved confounding in phenotypic path coefficients, whereas models including antisocial and impulsive traits did not. More than half of the observed effects of childhood SLEs on adulthood AUD were mediated by adulthood antisocial and impulsive traits. Effects of PD traits on AUD 5‒10 years later were direct rather than mediated by adulthood SLEs. The results and the general approach contribute to triangulation of developmental origins for complex behavioral disorders.",A Valveless Pulsatile Pump for the Treatment of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction: A Simulation Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536212,Cardiovascular engineering and technology,2019 02 23,Effective treatment of patients with terminal heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an unmet medical need.

However, data on their effects on blood volume and true positive rate are limited. Therefore, we investigated the effect of replacing interns with a phlebotomy team on blood culture results. We performed a 24-month retrospective, quasi-experimental study before and after the introduction of a phlebotomy team dedicated to collecting blood cultures in a 2700-bed tertiary-care hospital. The microbiology laboratory database was used to identify adult patients with positive blood culture results. During the study period, there were no changes in blood collection method, blood culture tubes, and the application of antiseptic measures. Blood volume was measured by the BACTEC™ FX system based on red blood cell metabolism. A total of 162,207 blood cultures from 23,563 patients were analyzed, comprising 78,673 blood cultures during the intern period and 83,534 during the phlebotomy team period. Blood volume increased from a mean of 2.1 ml in the intern period to a mean of 5.6 ml in the phlebotomy team period (p < 0.001). Introduction of the phlebotomy team also reduced contamination rate (0.27% vs. 0.45%, p < 0.001) and led to a higher true positive rate (5.87% vs. 5.01%, p < 0.05). The increased true positive rate associated with the phlebotomy team involved both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The introduction of a dedicated phlebotomy team can increase blood volumes, reduce blood culture contamination rate, and increase true positive rate.","Mortality of women with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a population-based study from the Girona province, Spain (1994-2013).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536209,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,2019 06 13,"We aim to comprehensively describe the incidence and mortality trends of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the Girona province, Spain (1994-2013) and to estimate the all-cause mortality excess risk of diagnosed women.",Outcomes and prognostic factors in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: multi-institutional analysis of the Spanish RECAP database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536208,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,2019 06 13,To retrospectively assess outcomes and to identify prognostic factors in patients diagnosed with intermediate-risk (IR) prostate cancer (PCa) treated with primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).,District-level implementation of British Columbia's school food and beverage sales policy: a realist evaluation exploring intervention mechanisms in urban and rural contexts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536207,Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,2019 02 03,British Columbia's (BC) provincial school food and beverage sales policy.,Tunable Electric Properties of Bilayer α-GeTe with Different Interlayer Distances and External Electric Fields.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536206,Nanoscale research letters,2018 12 27,"Based on first-principle calculations, the stability, electronic structure, optical absorption, and modulated electronic properties by different interlayer distances or by external electric fields of bilayer α-GeTe are systemically investigated. Results show that van der Waals (vdW) bilayer α-GeTe has an indirect band structure with the gap value of 0.610 eV, and α-GeTe has attractively efficient light harvesting. Interestingly, along with the decrease of interlayer distances, the band gap of bilayer α-GeTe decreases linearly, due to the enhancement of interlayer vdW interaction. In addition, band gap transition is originated from the electric field-induced near free-electron gas (NFEG) under the application of positive electrical fields. However, when the negative electric fields are applied, there is no NFEG. On account of these characteristics of bilayer α-GeTe, a possible data storage device has been designed. These results indicate that bilayer α-GeTe has a potential to work in new electronic and optoelectronic devices.",Age-related variability in decision-making: Insights from neurochemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536205,"Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience",2018 12 11,"Despite dopamine's significant role in models of value-based decision-making and findings demonstrating loss of dopamine function in aging, evidence of systematic changes in decision-making over the life span remains elusive. Previous studies attempting to resolve the neural basis of age-related alteration in decision-making have typically focused on physical age, which can be a poor proxy for age-related effects on neural systems. There is growing appreciation that aging has heterogeneous effects on distinct components of the dopamine system within subject in addition to substantial variability between subjects. We propose that some of the conflicting findings in age-related effects on decision-making may be reconciled if we can observe the underlying dopamine components within individuals. This can be achieved by incorporating in vivo imaging techniques including positron emission tomography (PET) and neuromelanin-sensitive MR. Further, we discuss how affective factors may contribute to individual differences in decision-making performance among older adults. Specifically, we propose that age-related shifts in affective attention (""positivity effect"") can, in some cases, counteract the impact of altered dopamine function on specific decision-making processes, contributing to variability in findings. In an effort to provide clarity to the field and advance productive hypothesis testing, we propose ways in which in vivo dopamine imaging can be leveraged to disambiguate dopaminergic influences on decision-making, and suggest strategies for assessing individual differences in the contribution of affective attentional focus.",Identification and Functional Characterization of an ISL1 Mutation Predisposing to Dilated Cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536204,Journal of cardiovascular translational research,2018 12 11,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most prevalent cause of non-ischemic cardiac failure and the commonest indication for cardiac transplantation. Compelling evidence highlights the pivotal roles of genetic defects in the occurrence of DCM. Nevertheless, the genetic determinants underpinning DCM remain largely obscure. In this study, the coding regions of ISL1, which encodes a transcription factor critical for embryonic cardiogenesis and postnatal cardiac remodeling, were sequenced in 216 unrelated patients with DCM, and a novel heterozygous ISL1 mutation, NM_002202.2: c.631A>T; p.(Lys211*), was identified in a proband. The mutation, which co-segregated with DCM in the family, was absent in 238 unrelated controls, as well as in the Genome Aggregation and the Exome Aggregation Consortium population databases. Functional analyses unveiled that the mutant ISL1 protein lost transcriptional activity alone or in synergy with TBX20 or GATA4, two other transcription factors associated with DCM. These findings indicate ISL1 as a new gene of DCM."

A T-CAS approach focuses on key stages and activities within a continuous network cycle to facilitate systems level change. The theory highlights the importance of establishing transdisciplinary strategic partnerships to identify and develop opportunities for system reorientation. Investment in and the linking of resources develops the capacity for key social agents to take advantage of disruption points in the re-orientated system, and engagement activities develop the network to facilitate new social interactions and opportunities for transdisciplinary activities. A focus on transdisciplinary action research to co-produce interventions, generate research evidence and inform policy and practice is shown to play an important part in developing new normative processes that act to self-regulate the emerging system. Finally, the provision of reciprocal network benefits provides critical feedback loops that stabilise the emerging adaptive system and promote the network cycle. SHRN is shown to have embedded itself in the system by securing sustainability funding from health and education, a key role in national and regional planning and recruiting every eligible school to the network. It has begun to reorient the system to one of evidence generation (56 research studies co-produced) and opportunities for data-led practice at multiple levels. Further capacity development will be required to capitalise on these.

The study aimed to generate usable knowledge on what works in adolescent substance use prevention and how it works best-a combined parent and youth programming or parent-only programming. A total of 532 adolescents in the 7th grade from 19 participating middle schools were randomly assigned into three intervention conditions: parent-youth (PY), parent-only (PO), and comparison (C). This article focuses on the comparison between PY and PO in order to determine which intervention strategy works best to reduce adolescent substance use including alcohol, inhalant, cigarette, and marijuana uses. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model examined the longitudinal data. The results for alcohol use show that PO yielded better results than PY and that PY outperformed C after 20 months. Further, PO showed a decreasing trajectory in any substance use over time since the implementation of the intervention. The effect sizes based on Cohen's h indicate small effects in any substance use and alcohol use for PO condition and smaller effects for the PY condition. These findings have implications for the design of future culturally specific parenting and youth prevention interventions with Latino families.",CONFINE-MAS: a magic-angle spinning NMR probe that confines the sample in case of a rotor explosion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536187,Journal of biomolecular NMR,2019 01 02,"Magic-angle spinning (MAS) is mandatory in solid-state NMR experiments to achieve resolved spectra.

The assumed climate, eutrophication and cod (Gadus morhua) fisheries scenarios modified seal predation impacts on fish. Fish biomass and catches are more affected by fishing mortality and the environment than by seal predation. Our results highlight that the impacts of the increasing seal population on lower trophic levels are complex; thus, we emphasize the need to consider a range of possible ecosystem contexts when evaluating potential impacts of top predators.

In addition to playing an important role in neuroinflammation, these cells regulate essential functions for the preservation of brain tissue. Therefore, the search for therapeutic alternatives to preserve these cells and maintain their functions contributes in some way to counteract the progress of the injury and maintain neuronal survival in various brain pathologies. Among these strategies, the conditioned medium from human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CM-hMSCA) has been reported with a potential beneficial effect against several neuropathologies. In this study, we evaluated the potential effect of CM-hMSCA in a model of human astrocytes (T98G cells) subjected to scratch injury. Our findings demonstrated that CM-hMSCA regulates the cytokines IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-α, downregulates calcium at the cytoplasmic level, and regulates mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain. These actions are accompanied by modulation of the expression of different proteins involved in signaling pathways such as AKT/pAKT and ERK1/2/pERK, and may mediate the localization of neuroglobin (Ngb) at the cellular level. We also confirmed that Ngb mediated the protective effects of CM-hMSCA through regulation of proteins involved in survival pathways and oxidative stress. In conclusion, regulation of brain inflammation combined with the recovery of fundamental cellular aspects in the face of injury makes CM-hMSCA a promising candidate for the protection of astrocytes in brain pathologies.",Contribution of the OC Sensor® immunoassay in comparison to the Hemoccult II® guaiac-test in organized colorectal cancer screening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536183,European journal of epidemiology,2019 05 24,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related death of worldwide with high incidence and mortality rate, accessible to a screening program in France, first with guaiac- based fecal occult blood test (g-FOBT) then with fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), since 2015, because of better accuracy.

The pathogenesis of various disease entities that comprise the area of CVD is complex and multifactorial. Inflammation serves a central role in these complex aetiologies. The inflammasomes are intracellular protein complexes activated by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) present in CVD such as atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (MI). After a two-step process of priming and activation, inflammasomes are responsible for the formation of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, inducing a signal transduction cascade resulting in a strong immune response that culminates in disease progression.

The predominant menaquinone of strain NEAU-YY211T was identified as MK-8(H4) and the major fatty acids were identified as iso-C16:0, C17:1ω8c and iso-C16:1. The phospholipid profile was found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol and an unidentified phospholipid. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 72.6 mol%. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness with P. ammonioxydans JCM 12462T and P. antitumoralis DSM 45322T were 54.5 ± 3.5% and 49.8 ± 2.5% (mean ± SD), respectively. Based on phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic and genotypic data, it is concluded that the isolate can be distinguished from closely related type strains and thus represents a novel species of the genus Pseudonocardia, for which the name Pseudonocardia tritici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-YY211T (= DSM 106068T = CGMCC 4.7474T).",Therapy of Advanced Prostate Cancer: Targeting the Androgen Receptor Axis in Earlier Lines of Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536163,Targeted oncology,2019 06 04,"With the decrease in PSA screening based on the 2011 United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines and the potential approval of highly sensitive imaging techniques over the next few years, we are likely to see an increasing trend of metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis. Traditional therapy for nonmetastatic prostate cancer (nmPC) has consisted of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) followed by other hormonal therapy maneuvers, such as anti-androgen withdrawal, herbal preparations, low dose steroids, or ketoconazole. Androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapies (ARAT) were previously only approved for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This has recently changed after reporting of results from the SPARTAN and PROSPER trials, which were conducted in nonmetastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) patients. These studies demonstrated improved metastasis-free survival with apalutamide and enzalutamide, each compared to placebo in a double blind randomized setting. In 2017, the LATITUDE and STAMPEDE studies demonstrated marked survival benefit with early abiraterone and prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in addition to ADT. Other second-generation AR antagonists are currently in phase 3 trials in mHSPC and nmCRPC. This article summarizes the key clinical trials that led to FDA approval of ARAT in the mHSPC and nmCRPC settings and highlights potential limitations, future directions, and treatment-algorithms when selecting patients for early therapy in mHSPC and NMPC.",Brain activations associated with scientific reasoning: a literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536162,Cognitive processing,2019 04 26,"Scientifically literate individuals are defined as individuals who are able to apply scientific knowledge and use scientific reasoning skills to solve problems. In recent years, cognitive neuroscience has turned its attention to understanding the brain activation patterns associated with scientific reasoning skills, but this work has not been systematically reviewed for more than a decade. The present study reviews neuroimaging studies related to three types of scientific reasoning tasks: overcoming misconceptions, causal reasoning, and hypothesis generation. These studies indicate converging evidence for the involvement of (1) lateral prefrontal areas, reinforcing the idea of an association between scientific reasoning and executive functions, and (2) middle temporal areas, suggesting an association between scientific reasoning and declarative memory. Potential educational implications and leads for future research are discussed.","Prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label study to compare efficacy of a mineral-rich solution vs normal saline after complete ethmoidectomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536161,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 10,The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of a mineral-rich solution vs normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl) following endoscopic complete bilateral ethmoidectomy.,"Modeling the Transmission Dynamics of Rabies for Dog, Chinese Ferret Badger and Human Interactions in Zhejiang Province, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536160,Bulletin of mathematical biology,2019 03 02,"Human rabies is one of the major public health problems in China with an average of 1977 cases per year. It is estimated that 95% of these human rabies cases are due to dog bites. In recent years, the number of wildlife-associated human rabies cases has increased, particularly in the southeast and northeast regions of mainland China. Chinese ferret badgers (CFBs) are one of the most popular wildlife animals which are distributed mostly in the southeast region of China. Human cases caused by rabid CFB were first recorded in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, in 1994. From 1996 to 2004, more than 30 human cases were caused by CFB bites in Zhejiang Province. In this paper, based on the reported data of the human rabies caused by both dogs and CFB in Zhejiang Province, we propose a multi-host zoonotic model for the dog-CFB-human transmission of rabies. We first evaluate the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] discuss the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, and study persistence of the disease. Then we use our model to fit the reported data in Zhejiang Province from 2004 to 2017 and forecast the trend of human or livestock rabies. Finally by carrying out sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number in terms of parameters, we find that the transmission between dogs and CFB, the quantity of dogs, and the vaccination rate of dogs play important roles in the transmission of rabies. Our study suggests that rabies control and prevention strategies should include enhancing public education and awareness about rabies, increasing dog vaccination rate, reducing the dog and CFB interactions, and avoiding CFB bites or contact."

In Experiment 1, we used an iPhone application that we had developed, called RECAPP-XPR, to present 76 participants with a single list of eight words presented at a rate of one word every hour, followed by a test of free recall an hour later. The experiment was exceptionally easy to schedule, taking only between 5 and 10 min to set up using a web-based interface. RECAPP-XPR randomly samples the stimuli, presents the stimuli, and collects the free recall data. The stimuli disappear shortly after they have been presented, and RECAPP-XPR collects data on when each stimulus was viewed. In Experiment 2, the study was replicated using the widely used image-sharing application Snapchat. A total of 197 participants were tested by 38 student experimenters, who manually presented the stimuli as ""snaps"" of experimentally controlled stimuli using the same experimental rates that had been used in Experiment 1. Like all snaps, these stimuli disappeared from view after a very short interval. In both experiments, we observed significant recall advantages for the first and last list items (primacy and recency effects, respectively), and there were clear tendencies to make more transitions at output between near-neighboring items, with a forward-ordered bias, consistent with temporal contiguity effects. The respective advantages and disadvantages of RECAPP-XPR and Snapchat as experimental software packages are discussed, as is the relationship between single-study-list smartphone experiments and long-term recency studies of real-world events.",Time course of changes in corticospinal excitability induced by motor imagery during action observation combined with peripheral nerve electrical stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536148,Experimental brain research,2019 06 13,"While previous studies assessed corticospinal excitability changes during and after motor imagery (MI) or action observation (AO) combined with peripheral nerve electrical stimulation (ES), we examined, for the first time, the time course of corticospinal excitability changes for MI during AO combined with ES (AO-MI + ES) using transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in healthy individuals. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in the following three sessions on different days: AO-MI alone, ES alone, and AO-MI + ES. In the AO-MI task, participants imagined squeezing and relaxing a ball, along with the respective actions shown in a movie, while passively holding the ball. We applied ES (intensity, 90% of the motor threshold) to the ulnar nerve at the wrist, which innervates the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. We assessed the FDI muscle MEPs at baseline and after every 5 min of the task for a total of 20 min. Additionally, participants completed the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VMIQ-2) at the beginning of the experiment. Compared to baseline, AO-MI + ES significantly increased corticospinal excitability after 10 min, while AO-MI or ES alone had no effect on corticospinal excitability after 20 min. Moreover, the AO-MI + ES-induced cortical excitability changes were correlated with the VMIQ-2 scores for visual and kinaesthetic imagery. Collectively, our findings indicate that AO-MI + ES induces cortical plasticity earlier than does AO-MI or ES alone and that an individual's imagery ability plays an important role in inducing cortical excitability changes following AO-MI + ES.",The future of healthcare has arrived: who dares take up the challenge?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536147,Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2019 01 10,"According to the Euro Health Consumer Index, the Dutch healthcare system is the champion of Europe. Yet we are living for longer, prosperity is increasing and the population is growing. If we do not continue to adjust our healthcare system to these trends, medical expenses in the Netherlands will double to € 174 billion (in 2040). We are also facing job market difficulties in healthcare. We risk a shortfall of 125 thousand employees in 2022. It is therefore time to restructure healthcare. Not tomorrow but today. Healthcare will increasingly be organised around the day-to-day lives of patients-at home or work, with offline and online healthcare seamlessly matching up to each other. The shortage of personnel also demands a different attitude to healthcare provision. As a health insurer we can help to improve healthcare, for instance by giving healthcare providers the financial capacity to organise their care differently. Or by conducting independent research so that conclusions can be drawn on the legal criterion of 'the state of science and practice'. This is how it was possible, in conjunction with the Dutch Cardiology Centres, the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and FocusCura, to include the 'Hartwacht' telemonitoring service in health insurance policies.",Telemedicine in heart failure-more than nice to have?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536146,Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation,2019 01 10,"Telemedicine in chronic diseases like heart failure is rapidly evolving and has two important goals: improving and individualising care as well as reducing costs. In this paper, we provide a critical and an updated review of the current evidence by discussing the most important trials, meta-analyses and systematic reviews. So far, evidence for the CardioMEMS device is most convincing. Other trials regarding invasive and non-invasive telemonitoring and telephone support show divergent results, but several meta-analyses and systematic reviews uniformly reported a beneficial effect. Voice-over systems and ECG monitoring had neutral results. Lack of direct comparison between different modalities makes it impossible to determine the most effective method. Dutch studies showed predominantly non-significant results, mainly due to underpowered studies or because of a high standard of usual care. There are no conclusive results on cost-effectiveness of telemedicine because of the above shortcomings. The adherence of elderly patients was good in the trials, being essential for the compliance of telemedicine in the entire heart failure population. In the future perspective, telemedicine should be better standardised and evolve to be more than an addition to standard care to improve care and reduce costs.",Efficacy of Invasive and Non-Invasive Brain Modulation Interventions for Addiction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536145,Neuropsychology review,2019 05 21,"It is important to find new treatments for addiction due to high relapse rates despite current interventions and due to expansion of the field with non-substance related addictive behaviors. Neuromodulation may provide a new type of treatment for addiction since it can directly target abnormalities in neurocircuits. We review literature on five neuromodulation techniques investigated for efficacy in substance related and behavioral addictions: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), (repetitive) transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), EEG, fMRI neurofeedback and deep brain stimulation (DBS) and additionally report on effects of these interventions on addiction-related cognitive processes. While rTMS and tDCS, mostly applied at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, show reductions in immediate craving for various addictive substances, placebo-responses are high and long-term outcomes are understudied. The lack in well-designed EEG-neurofeedback studies despite decades of investigation impedes conclusions about its efficacy. Studies investigating fMRI neurofeedback are new and show initial promising effects on craving, but future trials are needed to investigate long-term and behavioral effects. Case studies report prolonged abstinence of opioids or alcohol with ventral striatal DBS but difficulties with patient inclusion may hinder larger, controlled trials. DBS in neuropsychiatric patients modulates brain circuits involved in reward processing, extinction and negative-reinforcement that are also relevant for addiction. To establish the potential of neuromodulation for addiction, more randomized controlled trials are needed that also investigate treatment duration required for long-term abstinence and potential synergy with other addiction interventions. Finally, future advancement may be expected from tailoring neuromodulation techniques to specific patient (neurocognitive) profiles.","Prevalence of Depression, Anxiety and PTSD in People with Dementia: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536144,Neuropsychology review,2019 01 31,"There appears to be a link between depression/anxiety/PTSD and dementia, although the evidence is incomplete and the reason is unclear. Mental illness may cause dementia or may be prodromal or comorbid with dementia, or dementia may trigger a relapse of symptoms in individuals with a history of mental illness. This study examined the link between depression/anxiety/PTSD and dementia by evaluating the prevalence of these disorders in people with dementia, relative to their healthy peers. Existing meta-analyses have examined the prevalence of clinically-significant depression and anxiety in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and depression in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but have not considered vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), PTSD, or anxiety in FTD. The current meta-analysis compared the prevalence of clinically-significant depression, anxiety and PTSD in the four most common types of dementia (AD, VaD, DLB, FTD) and in unspecified dementia to that of healthy controls (PROSPERO number: CRD42017082086). PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL database searches identified 120 eligible studies. Prevalence rates were calculated for depression and anxiety in AD, VaD, DLB, FTD, unspecified dementia, and controls. PTSD data were only available for unspecified dementia. Subgroup analyses indicated that depression, but not anxiety, was more prevalent in people with dementia compared to controls; however, the anxiety analyses were probably under-powered. The results support a link between depression and dementia; however, the link between anxiety or PTSD and dementia remains unclear due to insufficient data. Longitudinal data is now needed to clarify whether depression/anxiety/PTSD may be risk factors for dementia.",Real-World Use of Talimogene Laherparepvec in German Patients with Stage IIIB to IVM1a Melanoma: A Retrospective Chart Review and Physician Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536143,Advances in therapy,2019 01 15,Talimogene laherparepvec is a first-in-class oncolytic immunotherapy for intratumoral injection with proven efficacy and tolerability in patients with unresectable early metastatic melanoma (stage IIIB-IVM1a) in the pivotal phase III OPTiM study.

The study was conducted under laboratory-controlled conditions until larvae reached 30 days after hatching (DAH). The specific activity of amylase and pepsin was analysed by spectrophotometric methods, and lipase, trypsin, chymotrypsin and alkaline phosphatase by fluorometry. The results showed that S. rivoliana larvae had different enzyme patterns depending on their developmental stage, and also when exogenous food was administered (rotifers and Artemia). At hatching (2.98 ± 0.14 mm SL), lipase, alkaline phosphatase, trypsin and chymotrypsin activities were detected, but the last two enzymes showed an activity close to zero. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, lipase and alkaline phosphatase sharply increased their activities after starting the first feeding. Amylase activity was not detected until 5 DAH (3.51 ± 0.18 mm SL) and had a peak on day 15 (4.59 ± 0.39 mm SL); no activity was observed from then on. Pepsin activity was detected approximately at 15 DAH, showing a constant increase onwards. Trypsin had a peak on day 15 and then decreased on the following days. Chymotrypsin had the highest peak at 5 DAH, then a sharp decrease on day seven (3.88 ± 0.11 mm SL), and it increased gradually until day 30 (11.71 ± 1.59 mm SL). Lipase showed the highest activity at 15 DAH and then decreased its value. Finally, alkaline phosphatase showed the highest value at 3 DAH (3.62 ± 0.06 mm SL); then, a severe decrease was observed with activity stability on the following days. In conclusion, S. rivoliana larvae had a similar pattern as that observed in other marine-carnivorous fish larvae, so it could be considered as juvenile at 20 DAH in terms of digestive physiology; based on our results and previous study, the weaning process could start after this age, which would allow establishing a co-feeding protocol using inert diet."

Microscopy has been used for more than 100 years to detect and identify these parasites; however, this technique requires considerable training and high-level expertise. Several PCR methods with highly sensitive and specific detection capabilities have now been developed in addition to microscopic examination. However, recent studies have shown that these molecular protocols are insufficient at detecting mixed infections of different haemosporidian parasite species and genetic lineages. In this study, we developed a simple, sensitive, and specific multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection and discrimination of parasites of the genera Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon in single and mixed infections. Relative quantification of parasite DNA using qPCR showed that the multiplex PCR can amplify parasite DNA ranging in concentration over several orders of magnitude. The detection specificity and sensitivity of this new multiplex PCR assay were also tested in two different laboratories using previously screened natural single and mixed infections. These findings show that the multiplex PCR designed here is highly effective at identifying both single and mixed infections from all three genera of avian haemosporidian parasites. We predict that this one-step multiplex PCR assay, being convenient and inexpensive, will become a widely used method for molecular screening of avian haemosporidian parasites.",Effects of supplementing herbaceous forage legume pellets on growth indices and blood profile of West African dwarf sheep fed Guinea grass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536120,Tropical animal health and production,2019 04 19,"Twenty West African dwarf (WAD) rams with average body weight of 12.43 ± 0.5 kg were used for the experiment that lasted 84 days to investigate the effects of supplementing herbaceous forage legume pellets on weight change and blood profile of animals fed Panicum maximum basal diet. Sole Panicum maximum served as the control diet and three other experimental diets were P. maximum supplemented with Lablab purpureus pellets, P. maximum supplemented with Calopogonium mucunoides pellets and P. maximum supplemented with Mucuna pruriens pellets constituted the four treatments which were arranged in a completely randomised design. The rams were divided into four groups of five animals each and were balanced for variation in live weight before they were assigned the experimental diets. Panicum maximum was offered to the animals ad libitum and legume pellets were supplemented. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in weight gain of the rams. Those fed the control diet had the lowest value of 41.88 g/day while rams supplemented L. purpureus pellets had the highest value (83.66 g/day). Haematological parameters, leucocyte values and serum biochemical indices of WAD rams were significantly (P < 0.05) different across the dietary treatments at the final stage of the trial. The values for red blood cells, haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin decreased slightly in rams supplemented with M. pruriens pellets. Reduction of serum biochemical parameters was also noticed in rams supplemented with M. pruriens pellets. It can be concluded that L. purpureus pellets ranked the best among the herbaceous legume pellets as supplemental feed for West African dwarf sheep resulting in higher weight gain and better feed conversion efficiency with no deleterious effect on blood profile.",Leveraging the variable natural history of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to select optimal therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536119,Breast cancer research and treatment,2019 03 19,Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-obligate precursor to invasive ductal carcinoma.

The flattened structure was designed to add the effective optical path length to improve the sensitivity. AgNPs were then deposited on the surface of the flattened area of the fiber via chemical silver mirror reaction for further improving the sensitivity by enhancing the infrared absorption. Combining the AgNPs modified flattened fiber ATR sensor with a CO2 laser showed a strong mid-infrared glucose absorption, with an enhancement factor of 4.30. The glucose concentration could be obtained by a five-variable partial least-squares model with a root-mean-square error of 4.42 mg/dL, which satisfies clinical requirements.

We evaluated the relationship between soil and vegetable metals and the distance from the shuttered chemical factory, and calculated the hazard index to assess local population metal exposure via contaminated vegetable ingestion. Soil metal concentrations ranged between 15.6 and 525.8 mg/kg for total Cr, between 25.4 and 559.5 mg/kg for Pb, and between 363.1 and 1389.6 mg/kg for Mn.

Studies published prior to 31 January 2018 were searched on Pubmed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase databases and Chinese databases. Only RCTs, which examined acupuncture as the sole or adjunctive treatment for IR-related diseases, were included. The primary outcome was homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The secondary outcomes consisted of fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS) and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2h-PBG). The differences between groups were reported as mean differences (MD). All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan software 5.3. After carefully screening relevant studies, 9 RCTs involving 562 patients (279 in experimental group and 283 in control group) were enrolled in this study. The pooled results showed that acupuncture had significant effects on HOMA-IR (MD 0.70, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.35, P=0.04<0.05), FINS (MD 3.35 mU/L, 95% CI 1.99 to 4.7, P<0.001) and 2h-PBG (MD 1.03 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.82, P=0.01). However, the differences in FBG were not significant (MD 0.28 mmol/L, 95% CI-0.28 to 0.84, P=0.32>0.05). The present meta-analysis indicated that acupuncture can help to improve IR to a certain extent, which remains to be confirmed by further high-quality RCTs.",A Retrospective Analysis on 1330 Adverse Event Reports of Qingkailing in China: Further Perception of Its Risks and Rational Use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536076,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"Qingkailing (QKL) is a modern preparation exploited according to the traditional Chinese medicine theory.

ADE cases induced by QKL were collected and analyzed according to patients' demographics, characteristics of drugs involved, characteristics of ADEs, causality, and outcomes. A total of 1330 qualified ADEs were included. Most ADEs occurred within 30 min after administration and the 0-10 years old age group had the highest number of ADEs. The common ADEs included anaphylactic reaction, dyspnea and nausea. Serious reactions accounted for 5.19%. Combination with cephalosporin (74/146, 50.69%) caused more ADEs than other drugs did.

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) are effective carriers for targeted drug delivery. This study aimed to examine the toxicity and biodistribution of SPION coated with polyethylenimine (PEI) (SPION-PEI) designed for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery both in vitro and in vivo. SPION-PEI/siRNA complexes were prepared at different weight ratios. Cytotoxic effects of SPION-PEI/siRNA on HSC-T6 cell viability were determined by using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Rats were divided into three groups: a control group, a normal-saline group and a SPION-PEI/siRNA group. After a single intravenous injection, in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and accumulation were evaluated by Prussian blue staining in the heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney 8 h, 24 h, and 7 days after the injection. Their distribution was histologically studied at the three time points by measuring ironpositive areas (μm2) in organ sections stained with Prussian blue. The same organs were analyzed by H&E staining for any possible histopathological changes. Furthermore, biochemical indexes such as alanine amino transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CREA) were also assessed at all experimental time points. Electrophoresis exhibited that the SPION-PEI could retard siRNA altogether at weight ratios above 4. MTT assay showed that SPION-PEI loaded with siRNA had low cytotoxicity. In vivo study revealed that the liver and spleen were the major sites of SPION-PEI/siRNA deposition. The iron content was significantly increased in the liver and spleen, peaking 24 h after intravenous injection and then declining gradually. No evidence was found of irreversible histopathological damage to any of the organs tested. These results suggested that most SPION-PEI/siRNA complexes were distributed in the liver and spleen, which might be the target organs of SPION-PEI/siRNA complexes. SPIONPEI/siRNA may serve as in vivo carrier for biomedical medicines.",Application of the Guiding Template Designed by Three-dimensional Printing Data for the Insertion of Sacroiliac Screws: a New Clinical Technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536074,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"This study is aimed to explore the clinical application of the guiding template designed by three-dimensional printing data for the insertion of sacroiliac screws. A retrospective study of 7 cases (from July 2016 to December 2016), in which the guiding template printed by the threedimensional printing technique was used for the insertion of sacroiliac screws of patients with posterior ring injuries of pelvis, was performed. Totally, 4 males and 3 females were included in template group, aged from 38 to 65 years old (mean 50.86±8.90). Of them, 5 had sacral fractures (3 with Denis type I and 2 with type II) and 2 the separation of sacroiliac joint. Guiding templates were firstly made by the three-dimensional printing technique based on the pre-operative CT data. Surgical operations for the stabilization of pelvic ring by applying the guiding templates were carried out. A group of 8 patients with sacroiliac injuries treated by percutaneous sacroiliac screws were analyzed as a control group retrospectively. The time of each screw insertion, volume of intra-operative blood loss, and the exposure to X ray were analyzed and the Matta's radiological criteria were used to evaluate the reduction quality. The Majeed score was used to evaluate postoperative living quality. The visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied at different time points to judge pain relief of coccydynia. All the 7 patients in the template group were closely followed up radiographically and clinically for 14 to 20 months, mean (16.57±2.44) months. Totally 9 sacroiliac screws for the S1 and S2 vertebra were inserted in the 7 patients. The time length for each screw insertion ranged from 450 to 870 s, mean (690.56±135.68) s, and the number of times of exposure to X ray were 4 to 8, mean (5.78±1.20). The intra-operative blood loss ranged from 45 to 120 mL, mean (75±23.32) mL. According to Matta's radiology criteria, the fracture and dislocation reduction were excellent in 6 cases and good in 1. The pre-operative VAS score ranged from 5.2 to 8.1, mean (7.13±1.00). The average one-week/six-month post-operative VAS was (5.33±0.78) and (1.33±0.66), respectively (P<0.05 when compared with pre-operative VAS). The 12-month postoperative Majeed score ranged from 86 to 92, mean (90.29±2.21). The three-dimensional printed guiding template for sacroiliac screw insertion, which could significantly shorten the operation time, provide a satisfied outcome of the stabilization of the pelvic ring, and protect doctors and patients from X-ray exposure, might be a practical and valuable new clinical technique.",Upregulation of UBAP2L in Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Promotes Functional Recovery in Rats with Spinal Cord Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536073,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"Post-translational modifications of cellular proteins with ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins regulate many cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, signal transduction, intercellular immune recognition, inflammatory response, stress response, and DNA repair. Nice4/UBAP2L is an important member in the family of ubiquitin-like proteins, and its biological function remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of UBAP2L on spinal cord injury (SCI). At first, rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were infected with adeno-associated virus to induce over-expression of Nice4. Subsequently, the infected BMSCs were transplanted into rats suffering from semi-sectioned SCI. The results showed that the over-expression of Nice4 significantly promoted the proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. In addition, the transplantation of infected BMSCs into the injured area of SCI rats improved the function repair of SCI. Importantly, the immunohistochemical and hematoxylin-eosin staining and RT-PCR results showed that the number of neuronal cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes was significantly increased in the injured area, along with significantly upregulated expression of cyclin D1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Meanwhile, the expression of caspase 3 protein was significantly down-regulated. In conclusion, the over-expression of Nice4 gene can promote the functional recovery in SCI rats by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. The results of this study indicate an alternative option for the clinical treatment of SCI.",Effects of Preoperative Risk Stratification on Direct In-hospital Costs for Chinese Patients with Coronary Artery Bypass Graft: A Single Center Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536072,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the components of inpatient costs for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) according to preoperative risk stratification and to provide evidence for improvement of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) payment. All patients (n=458) receiving an isolated CABG between January 2014 and December 2016 in a tertiary referral center, in southwest China, were analyzed. Hospital mortality was predicted by the EuroSCORE II for each patient. The patients were subdivided into two groups according to the observed mortality (1.97%, 9/458): a high-risk group (group H, predicted mortality ≥1.97%) and a low-risk group (group L, predicted mortality <1.97%). Clinical outcomes, resource use, in-hospital direct costs, and reimbursement expenses were compared between the two groups. Significant differences existed between group L and group H in postoperative mortality (0.4% vs. 3.4%; P=0.02), postoperative complications (10.6% vs. 45.7%; P<0.001), postoperative length of hospital stay (17.5±4.9 days vs. 18.8±6.5 days, P=0.01), in-hospital costs ($20 256±3096 vs. $23 334±6332; P<0.001), and reimbursement expenses ($7775±2627 vs. $9639±3917; P<0.001). In general, a higher EuroSCORE II was significantly associated with a worse clinical outcome and increased costs. The CABG cost data provide evidence for improvement of DRGs payment.",Using Tree Shrews (Tupaia belangeri) as a Novel Animal Model of Liver Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536071,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"Liver transplantation (LT) is most effective and promising approach for end-stage liver disease. However, there remains room for further improvement and innovation, for example, to reduce ischemic reperfusion injury, transplant rejection and immune tolerance. A good animal model of LT is essential for such innovation in transplant research. Although rat LT model has been used since the last century, it has never been an ideal model because the results observed in rat may not be applied to human because these two species are genetically distinct from each other. In this study, we for the first time performed LT using the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri), a species in the Order Scandentia which is closely related with primates, and evaluated the possibility to adopt this species as a new model of LT. We performed LT on 30 animals using the two-cuff technique, examining the success rate, the survival rate and the immunological reaction. The recipient operation time was 60 min averagely, and we limited the time of the anhepatic phase within 20 min. Twenty-seven (90%) of the animals survived for at least 3 days after the transplantation. Thirteen animals that did not receive any immunosuppressive drug died in 8 days mostly because of acute rejection effect (n=9), similar to the reaction in human but not in experimental rat. The rest 14 animals that were given rapamycin survived significantly longer (38 days) and half of them survived for 60 days until the end of the study. Our results suggest that performing LT in tree shrews can yield high success rate and high survival rate. More importantly, the tree shrews share similar immunological reaction with human. In addition, previous genomics study found that the tree shrews share more proteins with human. In sum, the tree shrews may outperform the experimental rats and could be used as a better and cost-effective animal model for LT."

The objective of this study was to identify the genetic factors in a Chinese family with ASD patients by a whole exome sequencing approach. Causative ASD gene mutations were examined in 16 members from a three-generation family, among which 6 individuals were diagnosed as having ASD. One hundred and eighty-three unrelated healthy Chinese were recruited as a normal control group. Peripheral venous blood was collected from every subject for genetic analysis. Exome sequencing was performed in the ASD patients. Potential causal mutations were detected in non-ASD family members and normal controls by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis. The results showed that all affected family members carried two novel compound mutations, c.1187delT of PCDHGA4 and c.2557insC of SLFN14, and these two mutations were considered to have synergetic function on ASD. In conclusion, the mutations of c.1187delT of PCDHGA4 and c.2557insC of SLFN14 may be pathogenic factors contributing to the development of ASD.",Dual Convergence of Facial Nerve Branches Innervating Whisker Pad in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536059,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"The precise anatomy of the facial nerve branches innervating rat whisker pad and the distribution of their corresponding motor neurons in facial nucleus area were investigated. The extratemporal facial nerves of 6 rats were anatomically observed under a surgical microscope, and then the nerve specimens of facial nerve branches at 7 anatomical sites were taken and examined for the axons and myelin sheath using Luxol fast blue staining. The distribution of facial motor neurons innervating the facial branches was observed in 12 rats by retrograde labelling. The distal pes, a fusing architecture of the buccal and marginal mandibular branches, was found to furcate into superior, middle and inferior branches to innervate whisker pad. Histologically, the myelin sheath of each branch was morphologically consistent, and the nerve fiber bundles of facial nerve branches became increasingly thinner and scattered, particularly after crossing the distal pes site and innervating the whisker pad. The facial motor neurons innervating the buccal and marginal mandibular branches were clearly distributed in similar regions in facial nucleus.

As a result, two new triterpenoid saponins (1, 2), together with 12 known compounds (3-14), were isolated from the roots of I. cornuta. Their structures were determined based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrum (MS) technologies, chemical reactions as well as gas chromatography (GC). Compounds 4, 6, 8, 11, 12 and 13 were isolated from this genus for the first time. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined as 3β-O-α-D-xylopyranosyl-(1→3)-α-L-2-O-acetylarabinopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-D glucopyranosyl-23-hydroxyl-20α(H)-urs-12-en-28-oic acid 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (1) and 3β-O-α-D-xylopyranosly-(1→3)-α-L-2-O-acetylarabinopyranosyl-(1→2)-β-Dglucopyranosyl- 19α,23-dihydroxyl-20α(H)-urs-12-en-28-oic acid 28-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester (2).",Research Progress in MRI of the Visual Pathway in Diabetic Retinopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536057,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"With an increasing incidence, diabetic retinopathy is one of the most important complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is also known as one of the major reasons of adult acquired blindness. It is widely accepted that the visual impairment of diabetic patients results from retinal microvascular changes. However, recent clinical experimental and neuroimaging studies suggest that the visual impairment of diabetic patients is also related to the pathophysiological changes of different parts of the visual pathway in diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been widely used for evaluating the microstructural changes, white matter integrity, metabolite changes, and the whole or partial functional and anatomic changes in the diabetic retinopathy patients' brains in order to fully understand the mechanism of vision loss of the diabetic retinopathy patients. This review focuses on the research progress in application of MRI of the visual pathway in diabetic retinopathy.",Relationship between Volatile Anesthetics and Tumor Progression: Unveiling the Mystery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536056,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"A series of factors can be involved in the perioperative period to cause an increase in cancer-related mortality. Unfortunately, volatile anesthesia might aggravate the deleterious effects. In this article, we review the association of diverse volatile anesthetic agents with immune system and cancer cell biology, and examine the effects on angeogenesis and postoperative metastasis or recurrence. Isoflurane, haloflurane and enflurane enhance immunosuppression and upregulate hypoxia-inducible-factor 1 and matrix metalloproteinases, leading to the cancer malignant progression, whereas roles of desflurane and sevoflurane are still unclear. As the effects of volatile anesthetics on tumor immunity have been known, it will be beneficial for using selective drugs into anesthesia and operation in cancer patients.",Recent Advancements in Intestinal Microbiota Analyses: A Review for Non-Microbiologists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536055,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"Microbial constituents naturally inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract may influence the homeostasis of the gut environment. The presence or overabundance of some bacterial taxa has been reported to be associated with complex diseases, and the metabolites of certain bacteria may contribute to diverse disorders by influencing signaling pathways. Therefore, the study of gut microbial population has emerged as a crucial field and a new potential area of clinical significance. Advances in the methods of microbiota analysis have shed light upon the details including species diversity, microfloral activities as well as the entire gut microbiota. Nevertheless, comprehensive reviews on this subject are still limited. For elucidating the appropriate selection strategy of the methods to address a particular research question, we comprehensively reviewed the continuously improving technologies, classical to newly developed, and dissected their relative advantages and drawbacks. In addition, aiming at the rapidly advancing next-generation sequencing, we enumerated the improvements in mainstream platforms and made the horizontal and vertical comparison among them. Additionally, we demonstrated the four main -omics methods, which may provide further mechanistic insights into the role of microbiota, to propel phylotyping analysis to functional analysis.",Computer-assisted Surgery for Scaphoid Fracture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536054,Current medical science,2019 03 19,"The computer-assisted surgery (CAS) has significantly improved the accuracy, reliability and outcomes of traumatic, spinal, nerve surgery and many other operations with a less invasive way. The application of CAS for scaphoid fractures remains experimental. The related studies are scanty and most of them are cadaver researches. Some intrinsic defects from the registration procedure, scan and immobilization of limbs may inevitably result in deviations. Some deviations become more obvious with operations of small bones (such as scaphoid) although they are acceptable for spine and other orthopedic surgeries. We reviewed the current literatures on the applications of CAS for scaphoid operation and summarized technical principles, scan and registration methods, immobilization of limbs and their outcomes. On the basis of the data, we analyzed the limitations of this technique and envisioned its future development.",Laryngeal temperature simulations during carbon dioxide laser irradiation delivered by a scanning micromanipulator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536053,Lasers in medical science,2018 12 11,"We use scatter-limited phototherapy techniques to calculate the time-dependent temperature profiles of incisions made with a commercial carbon dioxide laser being used to make a 1-mm incision under computer control using the Digital Acublade™ and with incisions made with the same laser under manual control. The goal is to understand the differences in the amount of lateral thermal damage that is likely from the computer-controlled incisions versus the manually controlled incisions. The temperature profiles are calculated from the absorption and scatter of light in a homogeneous material. The resulting temperature profiles are presented as videos showing how the tissue heats up and cools down with the incident laser pulses. The time-dependent thermal distributions indicate that the computer-controlled laser incision could show as little as 210 μm of lateral thermal damage, whereas the manually controlled laser incisions could show as much as 375 μm of lateral thermal damage. The computer-controlled laser incision is able to control laser pulses fast enough that subsequent pulses can ablate away tissue with a significant amount of residual heat from the previous laser pulse. Using the scatter-limited phototherapy techniques, we can see how a computer-controlled laser can make incisions with less thermal damage by ablating away tissue holding a significant amount of heat from the previous pulse before it has time to diffuse through the tissue. This method of heat removal from laser incisions has not been previously described or demonstrated.",A new semi-automated workflow for chemical data retrieval and quality checking for modeling applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536051,Journal of cheminformatics,2019 05 12,"The quality of data used for QSAR model derivation is extremely important as it strongly affects the final robustness and predictive power of the model. Ambiguous or wrong structures need to be carefully checked, because they lead to errors in calculation of descriptors, hence leading to meaningless results.

In the light of this, we designed and implemented a semi-automated workflow integrating structural data retrieval from several web-based databases, automated comparison of these data, chemical structure cleaning, selection and standardization of data into a consistent, ready-to-use format that can be employed for modeling. The workflow integrates best practices for data curation that have been suggested in the recent literature.

A previous study reported decreased levels of serum sulfatides in hemodialysis patients and suggested an association with cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanism of changes in serum sulfatides in chronic kidney dysfunction has not been well investigated. The current study examined whether a chronic kidney disease (CKD) state could decrease serum sulfatide levels using 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6NCKD) mice, an established CKD murine model, and studied the mechanisms contributing to diminished sulfatides. 5/6NCKD mice and sham operation control mice were sacrificed at the 4th or 12th postoperative week (POW) for measurement of serum sulfatide levels. Hepatic sulfatide content, which is the origin of serum sulfatides, and the expression of sulfatide metabolic enzymes in liver tissue were assessed as well. The 5/6NCKD mice developed CKD and showed increased serum creatinine and indoxyl sulfate. The serum levels and hepatic amounts of sulfatides were significantly decreased in 5/6NCKD mice at both 4 and 12 POW, while the degradative enzymes of sulfatides arylsulfatase A and galactosylceramidase were significantly increased. In a Hepa1-6 murine liver cell line, indoxyl sulfate addition caused intracellular levels of sulfatides to decrease and degradative enzymes of sulfatides to increase in a manner comparable to the changes in 5/6NCKD mice liver tissue. In conclusion, chronic kidney dysfunction causes degradation of sulfatides in the liver to decrease serum sulfatide levels. One explanation of these results is that indoxyl sulfate, a uremic toxin, accelerates the degradation of sulfatides in liver tissue.",Effects of Heat Treatment on the Structural Characteristics and Antitumor Activity of Polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536035,Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,2019 05 28,"This study investigated the effects of heat treatment on structural characteristics and in vitro antitumor activity of polysaccharides from Grifola frondosa.

We analyzed bioactive withanolides in Withania coagulans from 11 different sites in Pakistan and evaluated the antiprostate cancer activities of leaf extracts from two sites with the greatest amounts. Total withanolide concentration differed by ~ 17-fold between sites, ranging from 1.01 ± 0.01 mg/g dry weight (mean ± SE) at Jand to 16.83 ± 0.02 mg/g at Mohmand Agency. Different tissues varied in their total withanolide content with roots having the least (0.42 ± 0.07 mg/g dry weight) and leaves the most (2.45 ± 0.45 mg/g).

Regarding the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory activities of the different samples, Q-PCR analyses revealed that IL-10 gene expression in THP-1 cells was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in cells treated with the SjMp or SjMk sample than those treated with the unfermented sample. Cells treated with the SjMp extract or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher relative gene expression of IL-4 cytokine than cells treated with SjMk or SjU extracts. The relative gene expression of IFN-α was higher in cells treated with SjMp followed by LPS, SjMk, and SjU. TGF-β expression was higher in LPS-stimulated cells followed by SjMk and other samples. Cells treated with SjMp exhibited significantly higher pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and NF-κB) cytokine gene expression than cells treated with SjU. These results revealed that extracts from S. japonica fermented with Monascus spp. regulate cytokine gene expression.

Here, we addressed the potential use of carnosol and carnosic acid for in vitro bone tissue engineering applications, specifically depending on their cytotoxic effects on bone marrow stromal and stem cells, and osteosarcoma cells in monolayer and 3D cultures. Carnosol and carnosic acid displayed a bacteriostatic effect on Gram-positive bacteria, especially on S. aureus. The viability results indicated that bone marrow stromal cells and bone marrow stem cells were more tolerant to the presence of carnosol compared to osteosarcoma cells. 3D culture conditions increased this tolerance further for healthy cells, while not affecting the cytotoxic potential of carnosol for osteosarcoma cells. Carnosic acid was found to be more cytotoxic for all cell types used in the study.

Over the past decades both disease-free survival and overall survival have been significantly prolonged by the approval of new drugs; however, despite high response rates and achievement of deep responses to primary treatment, recurrence of the disease is still expected in nearly all patients treated. Fortunately, good treatment options for myeloma patients in relapse are also currently available and the possible combinations of approved substances are numerous. Patient-specific criteria, such as primary response, comorbidities and treatment-associated toxicity can thus be taken into account more frequently in the selection of a suitable treatment of recurrences; however, the lack of comparative studies of new substances and extensive interindividual disease heterogeneity continue to make it difficult to select the best treatment of recurrence in a specific case. Therefore, the treatment of recurrence of multiple myeloma, especially for patients with high-risk features, remains a clinical challenge. This review article deliberately dispenses with the commonly used combination of mere study results and a more practical approach should be taught for the rational planning of treatment for recurrent multiple myeloma.

Recently, several studies have shown that the metabolic regulation for ATP synthesis and biological building block generation in CSCs are different from that in bulk cancer cells and rather similar to that in normal tissue stem cells. To take advantage of this difference for CSC elimination therapy, many studies have tested the effect of blocking these metabolism. Two specific processes for lipid biosynthesis, i.e., fatty acid unsaturation and cholesterol biosynthesis, have been shown to be very effective and selective for CSC targets. In this review, lipid metabolism specific to CSCs are summarized. In addition, how monounsaturated fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis may contribute to CSC maintenance are discussed. Specifically, the molecular mechanism required for lipid synthesis and essential for stem cell biology is highlighted.

Here, we investigated the activation of the purinergic system and proinflammatory responses during congenital infection by T. gondii. Moreover, neuroprotective and neuromodulatory properties of resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic natural compound, were studied in infected neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs). For this study, NPCs were isolated from the telencephalon of infected mouse embryos and subjected to neurosphere culture in the presence of EGF and FGF2. ATP hydrolysis and adenosine deamination by adenosine deaminase activity were altered in conditions of T. gondii infection. P2X7 and adenosine A2A receptor expression rates were augmented in infected NPCs together with an increase of proinflammatory (INF-γ and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokine gene expression. Our results confirm that RSV counteracted T. gondii-promoted effects on enzymes hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotides and nucleosides and also upregulated P2X7 and A2A receptor expression and activity, modulating INF-γ, TNF-α, and IL-10 cytokine production, which plays an integral role in the immune response against T. gondii.",Anovaginal distance and obstetric anal sphincter injury: a prospective observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535980,International urogynecology journal,2019 06 10,No measurements are available for diagnosing the extent of obstetric lacerations.

In the current literature, Stypella papillata, the genus type of Stypella (described from Brazil), is treated as a taxonomic synonym of S. vermiformis. In the present paper, we revise the type material of S. papillata and a number of specimens addressed to S. vermiformis. As a result, the presumed synonymy of S. papillata and S. vermiformis is rejected and the genus Stypella is restricted to the single species S. papillata. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies of specimens from the Northern Hemisphere corresponding to the current concept of S. vermiformis uncovered three species from two newly described genera. S. vermiformis s.str. is distributed in temperate Europe and has small-sized basidia and basidiospores, and it is placed in a new genus, Mycostilla. Another genus, Stypellopsis, is created for two other species, the North American Stypellopsis farlowii, comb. nov., and the North European Stypellopsis hyperborea, sp. nov.

A population-based cohort study using record linkage of state-wide data was undertaken, evaluating children born in New South Wales, Australia, 2001-2007. Those with and without a cardiac procedure in the first year of life with a linked developmental (Australian version Early Development Instrument testing result, age 4-6 years) and/or educational outcome (Australian National Assessment Program result, age 7-9 years) were included. Perinatal, perioperative and sociodemographic factors were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Of 468,329 eligible children, 768 had a cardiac procedure in the first year of life and 582 were included. For those with a cardiac procedure and developmental outcome (n = 260), 13.1% were classified as having 'special needs' compared to 4.4% without a cardiac procedure. Of those with an educational outcome, after adjusting for perinatal, perioperative and demographic variables, children with a cardiac procedure (n = 396) were twice as likely to score below National Minimum Standard in school literacy and numeracy tests compared to their peers. Significant predictors included low birthweight, parent not completing school and having > 4 re-hospitalisations in their first six years. The developmental and educational trajectory of children who have had a cardiac procedure in their first year remains altered into primary school years. While perioperative factors did not impact outcomes, ongoing health and sociodemographic factors were important in identifying those children at greatest risk.","Pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of generic and branded abiraterone acetate tablet: a single-dose, open-label, and replicate designed study in healthy Chinese male volunteers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535959,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,2019 02 27,Abiraterone acetate is a highly variable drug and has been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in many countries.

Administration of defibrotide affords some protection against SOS, but the effect is modest. Hence, there is unmet medical need justifying the preclinical search for alternative approaches. Prostaglandins exert protective actions on endothelial cells of various vascular beds. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of the prostacyclin analog treprostinil to prevent SOS. Treprostinil acts via stimulation of IP, EP2, and EP4 receptors, which we detected in murine liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Busulfan-induced cell death was reduced when pretreated with treprostinil in vitro. In a murine in vivo model of SOS, concomitantly administered treprostinil caused lower liver weight-to-body weight ratios indicating liver protection. Histopathological changes were scored to assess damage to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, to hepatocytes, and to the incipient fibrotic reaction. Treprostinil indeed reduced sinusoidal endothelial cell injury, but this did not translate into reduced liver cell necrosis or fibrosis. In summary, our observations provide evidence for a beneficial effect of treprostinil on damage to LSECs but unexpectedly treprostinil was revealed as a double-edged sword in SOS. KEY MESSAGES: Murine liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) express prostanoid receptors. Treprostinil reduces busulfan-induced cell death in vitro. Treprostinil lowers liver weight-to-body weight ratios in mice. Treprostinil positively affects LSECs in mice but not hepatic necrosis/fibrosis.","Serum level vitamin D and parathyroid hormone, and mortality, with or without chronic kidney disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535953,Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,2018 12 11,"Levels of vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are closely associated with renal function. We evaluated the associations among 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels, PTH levels, and mortality, and whether these associations varied by renal function. We used data from the Dong-gu Study, a population-based cohort in Korean adults. We analyzed the associations among intact PTH, 25OHD levels and mortality in 8580 participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression after adjusting for age, sex, month of sampling, lifestyle, and comorbidities. We also evaluated the effects of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A total of 860 deaths occurred during the follow-up period of 7.6 years. Compared to the first 25OHD quartile, the HRs of the second, third, and fourth quartiles were 0.96 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79-1.16], 0.84 (95% CI 0.68-1.02), and 0.71 (95% CI 0.57-0.89), respectively. The association between intact PTH levels and mortality varied by renal function, and was both nonlinear and significant only in subjects with CKD. Compared to the second intact PTH quartile in such subjects, the HRs for the first, third, and fourth quartiles were 1.61 (95% CI 0.92-2.81), 1.97 (95% CI 1.17-3.31), and 2.19 (95% CI 1.33-3.59), respectively.

Genes putatively related to the synthesis of indole acetic acid (IAA) have been found in the symbiotic plasmid of CIAT 899, in the vicinity of the regulatory nodulation gene nodD5, and, in this study, we obtained mutants for two of these genes, y4wF and tidC (R. tropiciindole-3-pyruvic acid decarboxylase), and investigated their expression in the absence and presence of tryptophan (TRP) and apigenin (API). In general, mutations of both genes increased exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis and did not affect swimming or surface motility; mutations also delayed nodule formation, but increased competitiveness. We found that the indole-3-acetamide (IAM) pathway was active in CIAT 899 and not affected by the mutations, and-noteworthy-that API was required to activate the tryptamine (TAM) and the indol-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathways in all strains, particularly in the mutants. High up-regulation of y4wF and tidC genes was observed in both the wild-type and the mutant strains in the presence of API. The results obtained revealed an intriguing relationship between IAA metabolism and nod-gene-inducing activity in R. tropici CIAT 899.

This study included 265 (52.9%) males and 216 (43.1%) females. The median age of the cohort was 2.2 years with 295 (58.9%) cases younger than 3 years. GTR was achieved in 217 (43.3%) patients. Initial adjuvant CCMT, CCMT plus intrathecal chemotherapy (ITCMT), CCMT plus high-dose chemotherapy (HDCMT), and CCMT plus ITCMT and HDCMT were administered in 228 (45.5%), 78 (15.6%), 55 (11.0%), and 24 (4.8%) patients, respectively. Radiotherapy (RT) was prescribed in 266 (53.1%) patients. Fewer patients younger than 3 years old received RT (21.9% vs 33.0%, p < 0.001, chi-square test).

The 3-year OS of surgery alone, surgery plus CCMT, surgery plus RT, surgery plus ICMT, surgery plus CCMT and RT, and surgery plus ICMT and RT were 8.9, 13.4, 23.7, 37.4, 48.3, and 68.5%, respectively. When taking into consideration the extent of tumor resection (n = 462), GTR followed by RT, CCMT, intrathecal chemotherapy, and high-dose chemotherapy provided the best OS (5-year OS 88.2%). In younger children, adjuvant ICMT had a greater 3-year OS than adjuvant RT alone (34.0% vs 0%, p = .001).

These include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and more recently, a combined angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril/valsartan. In select cases, digoxin, ivabradine and hydralazine with isosorbide dinitrate have a role to play in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. On this foundation, other more advanced treatments such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy are recommended in guidelines for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (i.e. an ejection fraction of ≤ 40%) and for a select few there remains the option of mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation. The efficacy of pharmacotherapy does not vary by age and each of these therapies should be considered in all patients, irrespective of age. Other factors such as co-morbidities like renal dysfunction may limit the use of some of these drugs in the elderly. Decision making with regard to device therapy is more complex; the likelihood of competing non-cardiovascular causes of death and life expectancy need to be considered. Despite multiple treatment options for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the options for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are limited. In the absence of robust outcomes data from a large randomised trial, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is a reasonable therapy to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",Approaches to Deprescribing Psychotropic Medications for Changed Behaviours in Long-Term Care Residents Living with Dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535930,Drugs & aging,2019 04 18,"Psychotropic medications have a high risk of serious adverse events and small effect size for changed behaviours for people with dementia. Non-pharmacological approaches are recommended as first-line treatment for changed behaviours, yet psychotropic medications remain highly prevalent in long-term aged care settings. This narrative review describes the current evidence regarding deprescribing psychotropic medications for people with dementia in long-term care. Deprescribing psychotropic medications can be achieved without harm to the person with dementia, and most people experience no withdrawal symptoms. Interventions to deprescribe psychotropic medications should be multifactorial, including lowering the dose of the medication over time, educational interventions and psychological support. However, implementing this is a significant challenge due to the overreliance on psychotropic medications for behavioural management in long-term aged care. Facilitators to deprescribing psychotropic medications in long-term care include multidisciplinary teams with adequate training, education and managerial support, engaging residents and families and change 'champions'. Deprescribing practices should be person-centred, and an individualised deprescribing protocol should be in place, followed by careful monitoring of the individual. The person with dementia and their family, general practitioner, pharmacist, and allied health and direct care staff should all be involved throughout the deprescribing process. Direct care staff need adequate support, education and training, so they can effectively help the individual and implement person-centred approaches in the absence of psychotropic medications. Effective communication between residents and staff and amongst staff is consistently shown to be an important factor for deciding whether deprescribing of a medication should occur and the successful implementation of deprescribing psychotropic medications."

So far, few studies have analyzed the macromolecular and chemical characteristics of the polysaccharidic matrix in induced cyanobacterial biocrusts and the scarce existing studies have mainly focused on sandy soil textures. However, the characteristics of the cyanobacterial polysaccharidic matrix may greatly depend on soil type. The objective of this study was to examine the macromolecular distribution and monosaccharidic composition of the polysaccharidic matrix induced by inoculation of two cyanobacterial species common in arid environments, Phormidium ambiguum (non N-fixing) and Scytonema javanicum (N-fixing) in different soil types. S. javanicum promoted a higher release in the soil of the more soluble and less condensed EPS fraction (i.e., the loosely bound EPS fraction, LB-EPS), while P. ambiguum showed a higher release of the less soluble and more condensed EPS fraction (i.e., the tightly bound EPS fraction, TB-EPS). LB-EPSs were mainly composed of low MW molecules (< 50 kDa), while TB-EPSs were mainly composed of high MW molecules (1100-2000 kDa). The two EPS fractions showed a complex monosaccharidic composition (from 11 to 12 different types of monosaccharides), with glucose as the most abundant monosaccharide, in particular in the poorer soils characterized by lower organic C contents. In more C-rich soils, high abundances of galactose, mannose, and xylose were also found. Low abundance of uronic acids and hydrophobic monosaccharides, such as fucose and rhamnose, was found in the EPS extracted from the inoculated soils. Our results point to the influence of soil type on the macromolecular distribution and monosaccharide composition of the polysaccharidic matrix in induced biocrusts, which is likely to affect biocrust development and their role in soil structure and nutrient cycling in restored dryland soils.",Fouling Microbial Communities on Plastics Compared with Wood and Steel: Are They Substrate- or Location-Specific?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535914,Microbial ecology,2018 12 11,"Although marine biofouling has been widely studied on different substrates, information on biofouling on plastics in the Arabian Gulf is limited. Substrate- and location-specific effects were investigated by comparing the microbial communities developed on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) with those on steel and wood, at two locations in the Sea of Oman. Total biomass was lower on PET and PE than on steel and wood. PET had the highest bacterial abundance at both locations, whereas chlorophyll a concentrations did not vary between substrates. MiSeq 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing revealed comparable operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness on all substrates at one location but lower numbers on PET and PE at the other location. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed distinct clusters of the bacterial communities based on substrate (analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), R = 0.45-0.97, p < 0.03) and location (ANOSIM, R = 0.56, p < 0.0001). The bacterial genera Microcystis and Hydrogenophaga and the diatoms Licmophora and Mastogloia were specifically detected on plastics. Desulfovibrio and Pseudomonas spp. exhibited their highest abundance on steel and Corynebacterium spp. on wood. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed fissure formation on PET and PE, indicating physical degradation. The presence of free radicals on PET and carbonyl bonds (C=O) on PE, as revealed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, indicated abiotic degradation while hydroxyl groups and spectral peaks for proteins and polysaccharides on PE indicated biotic degradation. We conclude that fouling microbial communities are not only substrate-specific but also location-specific and microbes developing on plastics could potentially contribute to their degradation in the marine environment.",The genetic profile of bone marrow transplant patients in different samples of forensic interest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535913,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2019 05 22,"Humans constantly lose epithelial cells, and these biological traces are frequently studied in the context of criminal investigations. The objective of this work was to examine the genetic profile in samples of forensic interest (nail and skin epithelial cells) of bone marrow transplant patients and discuss its forensic and clinical implications. The genetic profile of nail, epidermal cells and blood samples of patients receiving HSCT was analyzed by the amplification and sequencing of 38 insertion/deletion polymorphisms and 15 short tandem repeat polymorphisms. In this analysis, the age of patients and donors, the time elapsed from the transplant, the type of conditioning prior to the transplant and whether the patient suffered graft-versus-host disease were considered. Donor chimerism can be detected in the DNA extracted from nail and skin epithelial cells of transplant patients. No statistically significant correlation was found between the type of conditioning and the percentage of donor DNA in nail (p > 0.05). A positive correlation, without statistical significance, was encountered when we analyzed the relationship between the time elapsed from the transplant with the percent donor chimerism found in epithelial cells of the epidermis and in nails. We conclude that within a judicial context (e.g. when testifying as an expert witness) it is necessary to consider whether we are facing a possible transplant patient or a person who has been a bone marrow donor.",A lethal case of hoarding due to the combination of traumatic and confined space asphyxia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535912,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2019 04 17,"Hoarding is defined as the acquisition of, and failure to discard, possessions of little use or value to others, usually associated with a significant degree of clutter in the individual's home. We describe a case of a woman who died from a combined traumatic and confined space asphyxia, after being trapped under some of the objects amassed in her apartment. The event was considered to be accidental; by taking into account the information gathered during assessment of the scene, we believe that the accident took place while entering or exiting the apartment. It appears that the woman, who was trying to open or close the door, could have been using her leg to keep the objects piled behind the door from falling. Unfortunately the pile of hoarded objects collapsed and the woman was fatally trapped underneath them. The age and strength of the woman played an important role in the fatal incident, she was too old and weak to remove the items that had collapsed over her body. The scarcity of space between the collapsed objects and the woman, as well as the absence of external or internal signs of violent asphyxiation, or other causes of death, allowed us to establish that the death resulted from a combined mechanism of both the traumatic and the confined space asphyxiation.",Sex estimation using the mandibular canine index components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535911,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2019 05 22,"The mandibular canine index (MCI) has been described as a suitable methodology for sex estimation in forensic scenarios but there are contradictory reports about its accuracy. Moreover, the two mandibular canine teeth must be available, which is not always a viable option. The aim of this study was to strip the MCI by analyzing the MCI itself and its components, in order to optimize its use for sex estimation. The mesiodistal dimensions of the mandibular canine crown and the mandibular canine arch width were measured in a sample of 120 cast models. Five predictor variables were considered in this study: the standard MCI, a variation of the MCI using the left canine, and MCI components (MD43, MD33 and D33-43). Multivariate binary logistic regression was performed using stepwise forward approach to select the most statistical relevant variables on the probability of a cast being from a female. The estimated probability was then analyzed with respect to performance in sex classification (ROC analysis and optimal cut-offs accuracy) and compared with the performance of the univariate variables. MCI43 and MCI33 presented the lowest performance (64.2% and 63.3% respectively), and the highest overall accuracy was attained using the MD43 and MD33 (85.8% in both cases). The multivariate logistic model obtained (using MD43 and MD33) exhibited the same accuracy as the logistic model based solely on MD43 (85.8%). Our results suggest that MD43 should be used instead of MCI for sex estimation.",Utilizing ticks as forensic indicators in a livestock investigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535910,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2019 04 17,"Although forensic parasitology remains in its infancy compared with more developed fields like forensic entomology, parasites can be useful forensic indicators.

Following recognition of the infestation by animal health officers, the individual asserted that the infestation had occurred either during transport or upon arrival at the site of discovery, and that they had not contravened quarantine legislation. Utilizing ticks as forensic indicators, knowledge of the life cycle and minimum age of ticks on the infested horse indicated that the individual's assertions were false, and that they had in fact transported the tick infested horse from a cattle tick endemic region across state lines and quarantine zones.",A phase II trial of the effect of perindopril on hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) incidence and severity in patients receiving regorafenib for refractory mCRC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535909,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that offers an OS benefit to patients with mCRC refractory to standard therapy (Grothey et al., in Lancet 381:303-312, 2013), but comes with potential significant toxicities including grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR). The pathogenesis of regorafenib-induced HFSR is not well established, but may be related to alterations in the capillary endothelium. We hypothesized that perindopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of hypertension (Ceconi et al., in Cardiovasc Res 73:237-246, 2007), and which plays a role in preventing endothelial dysfunction, may help to prevent or reduce the severity of regorafenib-induced HFSR.",Genetic testing in sudden unexpected natural death in the young: New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner's experience and perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535908,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2018 12 11,"Postmortem genetic testing is a diagnostic tool that is becoming increasingly utilized.

Examination of the remains revealed an old crush fracture of a thoracic vertebra and an unusual, probably congenital, malformation of the atlanto-occipital joint with deformation of the left occipital condyle and resultant narrowing of the foramen magnum. Although the occipital malformations were most likely congenital, they may still have caused, or contributed to, death by compression of the underlying upper cervical spinal cord.",An unusual case of pulmonary fat embolism following blunt trauma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535906,"Forensic science, medicine, and pathology",2019 05 22,"Fat embolism is markedly underdiagnosed, even though it is a well-known phenomenon following fractures of the long bones, injury to subcutaneous fat tissue, rupture of a fatty liver, surgical operations on fatty tissues, septicemia, burns and barotrauma. Forensic pathologists tend to ""simplify"" autopsy report conclusion in cases with multiple injuries where fat embolism and exsanguination could be considered to be the concomitant causes of death. Herein we present a case of 24-year-old male who was beaten with a metal rod by several persons. On admission to hospital his vital signs and laboratory findings indicated hemorrhagic shock with gradual respiratory failure; he died 17 h after injury. On internal autopsy examination the subcutaneous tissue of the limbs and back was severely bruised, corresponding to about 35% of the body surface area. He had fractures of several small bones. Injuries of the internal organs were absent, there was no free blood in the body cavities, and all other autopsy findings were unremarkable but suggestive of a significant blood loss. Microscopic examination showed a massive pulmonary fat embolism (grade III according to Sevitt), without systemic fat embolism. The cause of death was attributed to pulmonary fat embolism combined with severe blood loss, following extensive and severe bruising of the subcutaneous tissues and bone fractures."

HuR is composed by three RNA recognition motifs, namely RRM1, RRM2, and RRM3. The two N-terminal RRM domains are disposed in tandem and contribute mostly to HuR interaction with adenine and uracil-rich elements (ARE) in mRNA. Here, we used a combination of NMR and electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) to characterize the structure, dynamics, RNA recognition, and dimerization of HuR RRM1. Our solution structure reveals a canonical RRM fold containing a 19-residue, intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension, which is not involved in RNA binding. NMR titration results confirm the primary RNA-binding site to the two central β-strands, β1 and β3, for a cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2) ARE I-derived, 7-nucleotide RNA ligand. We show by 15N relaxation that, in addition to the N- and C-termini, the β2-β3 loop undergoes fast backbone dynamics (ps-ns) both in the free and RNA-bound state, indicating that no structural ordering happens upon RNA interaction. ESI-IMS-MS reveals that HuR RRM1 dimerizes, however dimer population represents a minority. Dimerization occurs via the α-helical surface, which is oppositely orientated to the RNA-binding β-sheet. By using a DNA analog of the Cox2 ARE I, we show that DNA binding stabilizes HuR RRM1 monomer and shifts the monomer-dimer equilibrium toward the monomeric species. Altogether, our results deepen the current understanding of the mechanism of RNA recognition employed by HuR.",Systematic Review: Efficacy and Safety of Accelerated Induction Regimes in Infliximab Rescue Therapy for Hospitalized Patients with Acute Severe Colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535888,Digestive diseases and sciences,2019 05 05,"Pharmacokinetic data suggest that standard induction dosing schedules may not be sufficient in patients with acute severe colitis (ASUC).

Although the genetic analysis of wildlife usually requires collecting DNA non-invasively, the variety of non-invasive DNA sampling methods is limited for each species. We present a method to obtain DNA of an endangered species, the bonobo (Pan paniscus), in which the pith of the terrestrial herbaceous vegetation (THV) that they consumed was newly utilized. We investigated the (1) frequency of encountering remnant saliva on three types of THV pith; (2) concentrations of DNA in the saliva samples by the real-time quantitative PCR; and (3) rates of positive PCR, accurate genotyping, and allelic drop out by analyzing two autosomal microsatellite loci (D7s817 and D9s910). The number of remnant saliva samples was recorded by following the bonobo groups on a daily basis. The frequency of encountering DNA samples was higher in saliva samples than in fecal samples. More than half of the saliva samples remaining on two types of THV pith provided sufficient concentrations of bonobo DNA (> 200 pg/μl). Rates of positive PCR and accurate genotyping were high, and allelic drop out rate was low when the amount of template DNA was above 200 pg per reaction.

A prototype of a radiation protection cabin was installed besides the gantry of a CT system. The CT system was equipped with a simplified user interface on a portable tablet and a mobile remote control. 98 patients with an indication for CT of the chest were randomly assigned to examination using the mobile devices (study group, n = 47) or using the conventional stationary workflow on the console (reference group, n = 51). Three ceiling mounted fisheye cameras were used for motion tracking of the radiographers, two in the examination room and one in the control room.

In multivariate analysis, EphB3 expression (P = 0.007) and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for poor survival. Hypermethylation of the EphB3 promoter was detected in cell lines and CRC tissues. EphB3 is down-regulated in CRC compared to normal mucosa. Hypermethylation of CpG island is contributed to downregulation of EphB3 in CRC. EphB3 expression in tumor cells may be a useful prognostic indicator for patients with CRC.",Introducing off-the-job training to cardiovascular surgical residency training: a new era of developing competent cardiovascular surgeons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535863,Surgery today,2019 04 03,This review summarizes the recent progress made in understanding the skill acquisition process of achieving expert status in various fields that require fine motor skills.

Historians have argued that twentieth century eugenics cannot be reduced to a uniform set of practices, and that no simple lessons can be drawn from this complex history. Some authors stress the similarities between past eugenics and present reproductive technologies and practices (what I define throughout the paper as 'the continuity view') in order to condemn the latter. Others focus on the differences between past and present practices (what I define throughout the paper as 'the discontinuity view') in order to defend contemporary reproductive technologies. In this paper, I explore the meanings of the word 'eugenics' and the relationship between its past and present uses in terms of contemporary debates on reproductive technologies and practices. I argue that moral disagreement about present technologies originate in divergent views of condemnable and justifiable features of the past.","Organs, embryos, and part-human chimeras: further applications of the social account of dignity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535861,Monash bioethics review,2019 05 24,"In their recent paper in this journal, Zümrüt Alpinar-Şencan and colleagues review existing dignity-based objections to organ markets and outline a new form of dignity-based objection they believe has more merit: one grounded in a social account of dignity.

The present study tested a pitch-window explanation of the auditory oddball effect on perceived duration in two experiments. For both experiments, participants listened to isochronous sequences consisting of a series of 400 Hz fixed-duration standard tones with an embedded oddball tone that differed in pitch and judged whether the variable-duration oddball was shorter or longer than the standard. Participants were randomly assigned to either a wide or narrow pitch-window condition, in which an anchor oddball was presented with high likelihood at either a far pitch (850 Hz) or a near pitch (550 Hz), respectively. In both pitch-window conditions, probe oddballs were presented with low likelihood at pitches that were either within or outside the frequency range established by the standard and anchor tones. Identical 700 Hz probe oddballs were perceived to be shorter in duration in the wide pitch-window condition than in the narrow pitch-window condition (Experiments 1 and 2), even when matching the overall frequency range of oddballs across conditions (Experiment 2). Results support the proposed pitch-window hypothesis, but are inconsistent with both enhanced processing and predictive coding accounts of the oddball effect.",Investigation of Hanwoo-specific structural variations using whole-genome sequencing data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535859,Genes & genomics,2019 05 15,The total length of the cattle genome is approximately ~ 3 billion base pairs.

The nanocomposite was characterized by transmission electron microscopy, elemental mapping, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical studies results show the modified GCE to possess a low electrochemical resistance (Rct = 7 Ω) and a large electroactive surface (A = 0.112 cm2). The heterogeneous electron transfer rate (ks) is found to be 1.26 × 10-2 cm s-1. Due to the excellent synergistic effect of c-MWCNT and TiN, the GCE displays and excellent performance in terms of nitrite sensing. At a typical working voltage of +0.8 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), the limit of detection (LOD) is as low as 4 nM, and the useful analytical range extends from 6 nM to 950 μM. This is much better than the LODs of previously reported nitrite sensors. The sensor is fast (response time 4 s), selective, and long-term stable.

Altogether, 31 case-control studies with 20,703 cases, 34,518 controls and 140 individual odds ratio (OR) estimates are included in the meta-analysis. Weighted median OR was calculated for five radon intervals. The following parameters were used for the weighting: standard error of OR, duration of radon concentration measurement, and relative number of controls in reference intervals. The dependence of the weighted median OR on the radon concentration was estimated applying linear non-threshold and threshold models. The results obtained suggest a significant linear no-threshold exposure-effect relationship for radon concentrations above 100 Bq/m3, with a slope of 0.14 (95% confidence interval 0.08-0.21) per 100 Bq/m3.",Improvement of hyponatremia is associated with lower mortality risk in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535839,Heart failure reviews,2019 02 26,"Hyponatremia at admission is predictive of poor prognosis in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We performed a meta-analysis of cohort studies to evaluate whether improvement of hyponatremia is associated with improved survival in patients with ADHF and hyponatremia. Relevant studies were identified through systematic search of PubMed and Embase. A random-effect model was used to pool the results. Predefined subgroup analyses were performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. Five thousand seven hundred fourteen patients with ADHF and hyponatremia from eight cohort studies were included. Results showed that improvement of hyponatremia during hospitalization was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.80, p < 0.001) as compared with those without improvement of hyponatremia. Results of subgroup analyses indicated that improvement of hyponatremia was associated with more remarkable changes of short-term (within 3 months after discharge) mortality (RR = 0.54) as compared with long-term mortality (RR = 0.74). Other factors such as study design, sample size, and heart failure subtypes did not affect the association. This was further confirmed by the meta-analysis of studies with multivariate analysis, which also suggested an association between improved hyponatremia and lower risk of all-cause mortality in ADHF patients (adjusted RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.92, p = 0.02; I2 = 63%). These results suggested that improvement of hyponatremia in ADHF patients is associated with lower mortality risk during follow-up, particularly for the short-term mortality.",Mitochondrial membrane transporters and metabolic switch in heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535838,Heart failure reviews,2019 02 26,"Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely recognized as a major factor for the progression of cardiac failure. Mitochondrial uptake of metabolic substrates and their utilization for ATP synthesis, electron transport chain activity, reactive oxygen species levels, ion homeostasis, mitochondrial biogenesis, and dynamics as well as levels of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria are key factors which regulate mitochondrial function in the normal heart. Alterations in these functions contribute to adverse outcomes in heart failure. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are also major factors for the evolution of cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and aging-associated pathological changes in the heart. Mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters have a key role in regulating iron metabolism and maintenance of redox status in cells. Deficiency of mitochondrial ABC transporters is associated with an impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain complex activity, iron overload, and increased levels of reactive oxygen species, all of which can result in mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, we discuss the role of mitochondrial ABC transporters in mitochondrial metabolism and metabolic switch, alterations in the functioning of ABC transporters in heart failure, and mitochondrial ABC transporters as possible targets for therapeutic intervention in cardiac failure.",Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Once-Daily Liraglutide for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes: A Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Estonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535837,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",2019 02 19,Once-weekly semaglutide is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that was associated with greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) versus once-daily GLP-1 analogue liraglutide in a recent network meta-analysis (NMA).

We used inductive content analysis approach based on grounded theory derived from reviewing, coding, and interpreting data. We interviewed 28 adolescents living with HIV (16 in the adolescent clinic and 12 from the pediatric clinic) and 14 of their caregivers. Barriers to retention in care included having to attend clinic during school hours, fear of disclosure to others, social isolation, and conflict with clinical staff. Facilitators to retention in care seen in the adolescent-friendly services clinic included after school clinic hours, peer support, and connection to the clinical staff. Adolescent-friendly services are facilitators of HIV care and warrant prioritization in treatment programs.","Demand and Supply Motivations for Antiretroviral Drugs in Illicit Street Markets: The Case of Atlanta, Georgia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535835,AIDS and behavior,2018 12 11,"We studied the motivations behind supply and demand of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in the illicit street markets of the metropolitan statistical area of Atlanta, Sandy Springs, and Roswell, Georgia. We found that these two market actions were largely interdependent: 39.53% of participants said that they sold their ARVs to pay for personal needs, and 20.93% said that they bought ARVs because they had previously sold them to pay for personal needs. The pattern that emerged suggests that illicit street markets have become mechanisms through which HIV patients cooperate to achieve competing goals: cover personal needs and keep up, however imperfectly, with their medication regime. We also found that HIV patients used illicit street markets because they faced institutional deficiencies, such as exclusion from the Ryan White/ADAP program, long waiting times to see a doctor, and prescription delays.",Spontaneous future cognitions: an integrative review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535833,Psychological research,2019 06 10,"Spontaneous future cognitions refer to mental representations about the future that enter consciousness with no immediately preceding attempt of bringing them to mind. They are studied under different terms in several areas of psychology, but with little interdisciplinary exchange of findings and theoretical developments. Different conceptions of spontaneous future cognition derive from separate literatures and are rarely considered together, leaving their potential conceptual overlaps as well as their unique features unclarified. In this article, I review research on spontaneous future cognitions in relation to mind wandering, involuntary episodic future thoughts, and intrusive future imagery in cravings and clinical disorders. I conclude that more research is needed to clarify the potential functions served by spontaneous future cognitions in everyday life, under which conditions they may become dysfunctional, how they are triggered by situational cues, and how their content may be constrained by motivational factors and beliefs. The burgeoning field of spontaneous future cognitions forms a promising novel approach to the cognitive and motivational regulation of behavior in everyday life.",Preparing to migrate: expression of androgen signaling molecules and insulin-like growth factor-1 in skeletal muscles of Gambel's white-crowned sparrows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535830,"Journal of comparative physiology. A, Neuroethology, sensory, neural, and behavioral physiology",2019 05 17,"Migratory birds, including Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii), exhibit profound modifications of skeletal muscles prior to migration, notably hypertrophy of the pectoralis muscle required for powered flight. Muscle growth may be influenced by anabolic effects of androgens; however, prior to spring departure, circulating androgens are low in sparrows. A seasonal increase in local androgen signaling may occur within muscle to promote remodeling. We measured morphological parameters, plasma and tissue levels of testosterone, as well as mRNA expression levels of androgen receptor, 5α-reductase (converts testosterone to 5α-dihydrotestosterone), and the androgen-dependent myotrophic factor insulin-like growth factor-1. We studied the pectoralis muscle as well as the gastrocnemius (leg) muscle of male sparrows across three stages on the wintering grounds: winter (February), pre-nuptial molt (March), and pre-departure (April). Testosterone levels were low, but detectable, in plasma and muscles at all three stages. Androgen receptor mRNA and 5α-reductase Type 1 mRNA increased at pre-departure, but did so in both muscles. Notably, mRNA levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, an androgen-dependent gene critical for muscle remodeling, increased at pre-departure in the pectoralis but decreased in the gastrocnemius. Taken together, these data suggest a site-specific molecular basis for muscle remodeling that may serve to enable long-distance flight."

Here we used the pig genome as a model to compare cis- and trans-retrogenes. We found that cis- and trans-retrogenes have similar patterns in terms of excessive X-chromosome representation, testis expression preference, and metabolic functional enrichment. Despite these similarities, lower levels of selective pressure were found in cis- than in trans-retrogenes. The evolutionary dating evidence revealed that more cis-retrogenes have originated after pig-cattle divergence than trans-retrogenes, suggesting a more recent origination of cis-retrogenes. The gene family clustering confirmed that excesses of X-derived cis-retrogenes may be driven by their rapid expansion in the recent times. Thus, the different selective constraints between cis- and trans-retrogenes may be due to different evolutionary time-scales rather than any differential functional importance. Thus, this study highlights the ongoing functional contributions from cis- and trans-traffic retrogenes during the reshaping of pig genome.",Impact of short stature on health-related quality of life in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood and adolescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535818,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,2018 12 27,"Some survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood and adolescence exhibit short stature, especially if their treatment included cranial irradiation.

Upon the implantation of tissue engineered constructs into the body, macrophages respond, invade and orchestrate the host's immune response. By altering their phenotype, macrophages can adopt a variety of roles. They can promote inflammation at the site of the implanted construct; they can also promote tissue repair. Macrophages support tissue repair by promoting angiogenesis through the secretion of pro-angiogenic cytokines and by behaving as support cells for nascent vasculature. Thus, the ability to manipulate the macrophage phenotype may yield macrophages capable of supporting vessel development. Moreover, macrophages are an easily isolated autologous cell source. For the generation of vascularized constructs outside of the body, these isolated macrophages can also be skewed to adopt a pro-angiogenic phenotype and enhance blood vessel development in the presence of endothelial cells. To assess the influence of macrophages on vessel development, both in vivo and in vitro models have been developed. Additionally, several groups have demonstrated the pro-angiogenic roles of macrophages in vascularization of tissue engineered constructs through the manipulation of macrophage phenotypes. This review comments on the roles of macrophages in promoting vascularization within these contexts.",Quantification of Cerebellar Crowding in Type I Chiari Malformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535814,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 02 20,"This study was focused on a semi-automated morphometric analysis of the cerebellum in the mid-sagittal plane as an alternative to tonsillar descent alone in the evaluation of Chiari malformation type 1 (CMI) patients. Morphometric analyses of posterior fossa structures were performed on mid-sagittal MRI images of 375 individuals (females, > 18 years, 235 CMI and 140 healthy controls). Twenty-six parameters including linear, angular and area measurements together with non-dimensional ratios were calculated. Eighteen parameters were found to be significantly different between CMI and control subjects. Smaller posterior cranial fossa (PCF) area in CMI subjects was attributed to a smaller PCF area anterior to the brainstem. The cerebellar area was found to be larger in CMI subjects as compared to controls (15.1%), even without inclusion of the tonsillar area below the foramen magnum (FM) (8.4%). The larger cerebellar area in CMI subjects was due to cranial-caudal elongation of the cerebellum, predominately below the fastigium. The cerebrospinal fluid spaces below the FM were smaller in CMI subjects as compared to controls. Overall, greater cerebellar crowding was identified in CMI subjects relative to healthy controls. These observations may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of CMI in adult female patients.",Periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is associated with leukoencephalopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535813,Neurogenetics,2019 04 04,"Here, we report brain white matter alterations in individuals clinically and genetically diagnosed with periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a rare disease characterized by premature loss of teeth and connective tissue abnormalities. Eight individuals of two families clinically diagnosed with periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were included in the present study and underwent general physical, dental, and neurological examination. Whole exome sequencing was performed, and all patients included in the study underwent MRI of the brain. Whole exome sequencing revealed heterozygous C1R mutations c.926G>T (p.Cys309Phe, Family A) and c.149_150TC>AT (p.Val50Asp, Family B). All adult individuals (n = 7; age range 31 to 68 years) investigated by MRI had brain white matter abnormalities. The MRI of one investigated child aged 8 years was normal. The MRI pattern was suggestive of an underlying small vessel disease that is progressive with age. As observed in other leukoencephalopathies related to microangiopathies, the extent of the white matter changes was disproportionate to the neurologic features. Medical history revealed recurrent headaches or depression in some cases. Neurological examination was unremarkable in all individuals but one had mild cognitive decline and ataxia and experienced a seizure. The observation that periodontal Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by missense mutations in C1R is consistently associated with a leukoencephalopathy opens a new pathogenic link between the classical complement pathway, connective tissue, brain small vessels, and brain white matter abnormalities.","Cane toads (Rhinella marina) rely on water access, not drought tolerance, to invade xeric Australian environments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535812,Oecologia,2019 03 03,"The invasion of habitats with novel environmental challenges may require physiological tolerances not seen in conspecifics from the native range. We used a combination of field and laboratory-based experiments to assess physiological tolerance to limited water access at four sites distributed across the historical invasion path of cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia that, from east to west, alternated between mesic and seasonally xeric habitats. Toads from all locations were well hydrated at the time of capture. However, experimental dehydration caused greater mass loss, higher plasma osmolality, and inhibition of lytic ability in toads from xeric compared to mesic locations. These results suggest somewhat surprisingly that toads from xeric environments are physiologically more vulnerable to water loss. In contrast, bactericidal ability was not sensitive to hydric state and was greater in toads from eastern (long-colonized) areas. Similar patterns in lytic ability in hydrated toads and agglutination ability in wild toads suggest that toads along the invasion front face a tradeoff between enhanced dispersal ability and physiological responses to dehydration. The ability of this invasive species to spread into drier environments may be underpinned by a combination of phenotypic plasticity and evolved (heritable) traits.",Hydrological and hydrochemical behavior of a riparian zone in a high-order flatland stream.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535811,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 01 29,"Hydrological and hydrochemical processes occurring within riparian zones in temperate mid-latitudes flatland areas have significant implications for water management by controlling nutrient transfer between the watershed and the stream system. The riparian zone in a high-order flatland stream located within a 7063-km2 agricultural watershed in Argentina was investigated to study its hydrological connectivity to upland zones, interactions with the stream, and their implications for groundwater hydrochemistry. The analysis was based on 9-year-long time series of groundwater/stream water levels collected along a 220-m-long transect comprising six piezometers, a river stage sensor, and hydrochemical information from 37 groundwater/stream water sampling campaigns. Samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity (EC), Cl-, SO4+2, (Ca+2 + Mg+2), pH, and redox potential (ORP). Data were interpreted using descriptive statistics, statistical tests, groundwater flux calculations, and identification of hydrological patterns and associated hydrochemical responses. The system was hydrologically controlled by shallow groundwater. Three representative landscape hydrological patterns were identified: disconnected, incipient-weakly connected, and fully connected. Groundwater hydrochemistry was closely linked to hydrological connectivity, which played an important role in the mobilization and fluxes of solutes. Overall, groundwater EC, Cl-, SO4+2, and (Ca+2 + Mg+2) concentrations decreased from upland to lowland. For full connectivity, Cl- concentrations reduced 33%, while SO4+2 reduced 42%, demonstrating the system's buffering capacity.

Incentive programs are used to engage landowners in voluntary conservation, but outcomes after landowners exit these programs are poorly understood. Previous research identified several pathways, including landowner motivations, cognitions, and resources, which could sustain or undermine continued conservation management behavior after incentive program participation. We tested the utility of these pathways for explaining management intentions of participants in U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) young forest habitat conservation programs in the eastern United States. We conducted a telephone survey of enrolled landowners in the programs from January to May 2017 (n = 102). We compared candidate multiple regression models to determine variables explaining landowner intentions to re-enroll in young forest programs or to persist with management without further cost-share. We found intentions to re-enroll in NRCS young forest programs were highest among landowners with high agency trust, and for whom cost-share, environmental concerns, and hunting were important motivations. Management persistence intentions were highest for group landowners (e.g., hunting clubs and nonprofits), landowners motivated by environmental concerns, and those less motivated by cost-share. Our results suggest that fostering trust through positive program experiences and recruiting landowners with supportive motivations and resources may encourage sustained young forest management. Differences in variables explaining program re-enrollment and management persistence in this study highlight the importance of considering these outcomes separately for conservation programs widely.","A pilot dose-response study of the acute effects of haskap berry extract (Lonicera caerulea L.) on cognition, mood, and blood pressure in older adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535796,European journal of nutrition,2018 12 11,"Haskap (Lonicera caerulea L. or blue honeysuckle) is a plant native to the low-lying wet areas and mountains of Siberia and northeastern Asia, but is now cultivated in Canada.

CGRP has been shown to be involved in arteriolar dilation, cardiovascular regulation, pain transmission, migraine, and gastrointestinal physiology. Our current research is aimed at analyzing CGRP's impact on appetite/satiety, body metabolism, and energy homeostasis. Our study investigated the effects of a single-dose intraperitoneal (IP) treatment with CGRP on food and water consumption, energy expenditure, physical activity, respirometry, and a panel of plasma metabolic hormones in C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) mice. After a CGRP IP injection at a dose of 2 nmol (10 μM CGRP in 200 μl of saline), a significant reduction in food intake and metabolic parameters as RQ, VCO2, and VO2 was observed. CGRP-injected mice had also significantly lower total energy expenditure (TEE) with no changes in activity levels compared to vehicle-injected controls. CGRP treatment in mice induced significantly lower plasma levels of glucagon and leptin but higher levels of amylin. Our data show that a single dose of CGRP peptide significantly decreased food consumption and altered calorimetric parameters and plasma metabolic hormone levels, thus confirming that CGRP plays a pivotal role in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. Future studies are necessary to analyze CGRP's long-term impact on body metabolism and its potential effects on appetite, obesity, and metabolic disorders.",Adaptive responses to low doses of radiation or chemicals: their cellular and molecular mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535789,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 03 29,"This article reviews the current knowledge on the mechanisms of adaptive response to low doses of ionizing radiation or chemical exposure. A better knowledge of these mechanisms is needed to improve our understanding of health risks at low levels of environmental or occupational exposure and their involvement in cancer or non-cancer diseases. This response is orchestrated through a multifaceted cellular program involving the concerted action of diverse stress response pathways. These evolutionary highly conserved defense mechanisms determine the cellular response to chemical and physical aggression. They include DNA damage repair (p53, ATM, PARP pathways), antioxidant response (Nrf2 pathway), immune/inflammatory response (NF-κB pathway), cell survival/death pathway (apoptosis), endoplasmic response to stress (UPR response), and other cytoprotective processes including autophagy, cell cycle regulation, and the unfolded protein response. The coordinated action of these processes induced by low-dose radiation or chemicals produces biological effects that are currently estimated with the linear non-threshold model. These effects are controversial. They are difficult to detect because of their low magnitude, the scarcity of events in humans, and the difficulty of corroborating associations over the long term. Improving our understanding of these biological consequences should help humans and their environment by enabling better risk estimates, the revision of radiation protection standards, and possible therapeutic advances."

Post-irradiation, reproductive death was revealed as the predominant form of death in S. cerevisiae and almost all the irradiated cells were physically present and intact. In addition, cell cycle arrest reached its peak and cell division was at its valley at 2 h. Cell cycle arrest, cell division potential, DNA damage, and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) showed significant recovery at 4 h (P > 0.05 vs. control). The improvements of DNA damage and MTP decrease were evaluated as at least 77% and 84% for the original irradiated cells at 4 h, respectively. In the transcriptional profile, the amount of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the fold change in the repair-related DEGs were highest at 1 h post-irradiation and then decreased. The DEGs at 1 h (but not 2 h or 3 h) were significantly enriched in gene ontology (GO) categories of detoxification (up) and antioxidant activity (up). Although the transcriptional profile supported the repair time frame observed in the phenotypic profile, the complete repair may take a longer duration as the transcriptional levels of several important repair-related DEGs did not show a decrease and the DNA repair-related pathways (up) were the major enriched pathway in Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis throughout the whole course of the study.

The role of CK in the regulation of amyloid β (Aβ) and its capacity to activate the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway were also studied due to their translational relevance to Alzheimer's disease. The Morris water maze was used to assess spatial memory functions. Levels of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde in brain tissues were tested. Cell morphology was detected by hematoxylin and eosin staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to determine expression levels of Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway-related factors and Aβ. Ginsenoside CK was found to enhance memory function, normalize neuronal morphology, decrease neuronal apoptosis, increase superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase levels, reduce malondialdehyde levels, inhibit Aβ expression, and activate the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway in scopolamine-exposed animals. Based on these results, we conclude that CK may improve memory function in scopolamine-injured mice by regulating Aβ aggregation and promoting the transduction of the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway, thereby reducing oxidative damage to neurons and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis. This study suggests that CK may serve as a future preventative agent or treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",Overexpression of SMN2 Gene in Motoneuron-Like Cells Differentiated from Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Ponasterone A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535775,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,2019 03 20,"Cell therapy and stem cell transplantation strategies have provided potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neurological disorders. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) are abundant adult stem cells with low immunogenicity, which can be used for allogeneic cell replacement therapies. Differentiation of ADMSCs into acetylcholine-secreting motoneurons (MNs) is a promising treatment for MN diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is associated with the level of SMN1 gene expression. The SMN2 gene plays an important role in MN disorders, as it can somewhat compensate for the lack of SMN1 expression in SMA patients. Although the differentiation potential of ADMSCs into MNs has been previously established, overexpression of SMN2 gene in a shorter period with a longer survival has yet to be elucidated. Ponasterone A (PNA), an ecdysteroid hormone activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, was studied as a new steroid to promote SMN2 overexpression in MNs differentiated from ADMSCs. After induction with retinoic acid, sonic hedgehog, forskolin, and PNA, MN phenotypes were differentiated from ADMSCs, and immunochemical staining, specific for β-tubulin, neuron-specific enolase, and choline acetyltransferase, was performed. Also, the results of real-time PCR assay indicated nestin, Pax6, Nkx2.2, Hb9, Olig2, and SMN2 expression in the differentiated cells. After 2 weeks of treatment, cultures supplemented with PNA showed a longer survival and a 1.2-fold increase in the expression of SMN2 (an overall 5.6-fold increase; *P ≤ 0.05), as confirmed by the Western blot analysis. The PNA treatment increased the levels of ChAT, Isl1, Hb9, and Nkx2 expression in MN-like cells. Our findings highlight the role of PNA in the upregulation of SMN2 genes from MSC-derived MN-like cells, which may serve as a potential candidate in cellular therapy for SMA patients.",Preliminary study on alginate/NIPAM hydrogel-based soft microrobot for controlled drug delivery using electromagnetic actuation and near-infrared stimulus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535774,Biomedical microdevices,2019 05 29,"Currently, microrobots are receiving attention because of their small size and motility, which can be applied to minimal invasive therapy. Additionally, various microrobots using hydrogel with the characteristics of biocompatibility and biodegradability are also being developed. Among them, microrobots that swell and deswell in response to temperature changes caused by external near infrared (NIR) stimuli, focused ultrasound, and an alternating magnetic field, have been receiving a great amount of interest as drug carriers for therapeutic cell delivery. In this study, we propose a spring type medical microrobot that can be manipulated by an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system and respond to an external stimulus (NIR). Additionally, we verified its feasibility with regard to targeting and drug delivery. There exist various methods of fabricating a spring type microrobot. In this study, we adopted a simple method that entails using a perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) microtube and a syringe pump. Moreover, we also used a hydrogel mixture composed of natural alginate, N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) for temperature responsiveness, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for electromagnetic control. Then, we fabricated a spring type alginate/NIPAM hydrogel-based soft microrobot. Additionally, we encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) for tumor therapy in the microrobot. To verify the feasibility of the proposed spring type hydrogel-based soft microrobot's targeting and drug delivery, we developed an EMA and NIR integrated system. Finally, we observed the swelling and deswelling of the soft microrobot under NIR stimulation and verified the EMA controlled targeting. Moreover, we implemented a control function to release the encapsulated anticancer drug (DOX) through the swelling and deswelling of the soft microrobot by NIR, and evaluated the feasibility of cancer cell therapy by controlling the release of the drug from the soft microrobot.",Influence of dronedarone (a class III antiarrhythmic drug) on the anticonvulsant potency of four classical antiepileptic drugs in the tonic-clonic seizure model in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535773,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2019 05 15,"Increasing evidence indicates that some antiarrhythmic drugs play a pivotal role in seizures, not only in vivo studies on animals, but also in clinical trials. Some of these antiarrhythmic drugs potentiate or alleviate the anticonvulsant action of the classical antiepileptic drugs. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of dronedarone (DRO-a multichannel blocker belonging to the class III of antiarrhythmic drugs) on the anticonvulsant effects of four standard antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate) in the tonic-clonic seizure model in mice. Potential acute adverse effects exerted by the antiepileptic drugs combined with DRO were evaluated in three behavioral tests (chimney, grip-strength and passive avoidance). To confirm the nature of interaction, total brain concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were measured. DRO (50 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduces the anticonvulsant potency of phenytoin (P < 0.05), having no impact on that of carbamazepine, phenobarbital and valproate in the tonic-clonic seizure model in mice. DRO (50 mg/kg) neither changed total brain concentrations of phenytoin in mice, nor affected normal behavior in experimental animals subjected to the chimney, grip-strength and passive avoidance tests. In conclusion, DRO should not be combined with phenytoin because it reduced the anticonvulsant effects of the latter drug in experimental animals. The combined administration of DRO with carbamazepine, phenobarbital and valproate resulted in neutral interaction between these drugs in the tonic-clonic seizure model in mice.","Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of mitochondrial disorders in childhood: a personalized medicine in the new era of genome sequence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535772,European journal of pediatrics,2019 01 28,"Primary mitochondrial disorders are highly variable in clinical presentation, biochemistry, and molecular etiology. Mitochondrial disorders can be caused by genetic defects in the mitochondrial, in nuclear genome, or in the interplay between the two genomes. Biochemical screening tests may be inconclusive or misleading since patients, with confirmed mitochondrial disorders specially in pediatric age, may exhibit normal routine biochemistry, muscle histology, or enzymatic analysis of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Diagnosis is often challenging even with combination of multiple criteria (clinical, biochemical, histological, and functional), as innumerous conditions cause secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. Nowadays, a definite diagnosis is only possible by genetic confirmation since no single score system is satisfactorily accurate, being sensitive but not specific.Conclusion: Awareness between physicians is of major importance considering that clinical suspicion may not be obvious regarding the heterogenicity in presentation and biochemical features of mitochondrial disorders. In this review, we provide information on diagnosis approach to patients suspected for mitochondrial disorders as well as management on chronic and acute settings. Follow-up should provide comprehensive information on patient's status, since intervention on these diseases is mostly supportive and prognosis is variable and sometimes unpredictable. What is Known: • Mitochondrial disorders are heterogenous and may present at any age, with any symptoms and any type of inheritance. • Mitochondrial disorders may be due to pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear genes (nDNA). What is New: • Since no single score system is satisfactorily accurate, a definite diagnosis is only possible with genetic studies with gene panels proving to be a cost-effective approach. • Clinical and biochemical features of patients without a confirmed diagnosis must be reviewed and other diagnosis must be considered. A wider genetic approach may be applied (WES or WGS).",Cyclic sulfur-containing compounds from Allium fistulosum 'Kujou'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535771,Journal of natural medicines,2019 03 28,"Sulfur-containing compounds, allicin and ajoene, etc., were isolated from Allium species.

Instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is a nonhyperemic index of stenosis severity with discordant reports regarding its accuracy in relation to FFR. There is no information on the correlation of iFR with measurements derived from intracoronary imaging devices. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship among iFR, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) parameters. Eighty lesions in 72 patients who underwent elective angiography and had intermediate lesions were enrolled. All lesions were assessed by iFR, FFR, IVUS, and OFDI. iFR was ≤ 0.89 in 21 (26%) lesions and FFR was ≤ 0.80 in 41 (51%) lesions. iFR correlated significantly with both IVUS-derived minimum lumen area (MLA) (r = 0.375, p = 0.003) and OFDI-derived MLA (r = 0.357, p = 0.005). FFR also correlated significantly with both IVUS-derived MLA (r = 0.472, p < 0.001) and OFDI-derived MLA (r = 0.445, p < 0.001).

The prevalence of unrecognized PAD is high, leading to a lack of opportunity to detect subjects at a high risk for cardiovascular events. Inflammatory processes play an important role in the disease initiation as well as in the disease progression. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, appears to be an important mediator in inflammatory processes. Therefore, we hypothesized that in patients with PAD, circulating VCAM-1 might be elevated due to its function in mediating adhesion of immune cells to the vascular endothelium in the process of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, and, therefore, applicable as a diagnostic biomarker. A total of 126 non-consecutive patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 51 patients had typical clinical manifestations of PAD and as controls 75 patients with no history of PAD or cardiovascular disease. All serum samples were obtained either during hospitalization or during out-patient visits and analyzed for VCAM-1 by the ELISA. Compared with controls, median levels of VCAM-1 were significantly elevated in patients suffering from PAD (953 vs. 1352 pg/ml; p < 0.001). Furthermore, VCAM-1 appeared to be highly discriminative for the detection of PAD (AUC = 0.76; CI 0.67-0.83). We could not observe dynamics related to increasing disease stages according to Rutherford classes in patients with apparent PAD. VCAM-1 was shown to be a potential discriminator and biomarker for the severity of systemic atherosclerosis. In a logistic regression analysis, VCAM-1 was robustly associated with the diagnosis of PAD, even after correction for clinically relevant cofounders (namely age, arterial hypertension, diabetes and LDL levels). Thusly, VCAM-1 might serve as a biomarker for PAD screening and detection.",Detection and identification of fungi in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from immunocompromised patients using panfungal PCR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535753,Folia microbiologica,2019 06 10,"Rapid diagnostics of fungal pneumonia and initiation of appropriate therapy are still challenging. In this study, we used two panfungal assays to test bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples to prove their ability to confirm invasive fungal disease diagnosis and identify causative agents. Two methods targeting different fungal rDNA regions were used, and the obtained PCR products were sequenced directly or after cloning. In total, 106 BALF samples from 104 patients were tested. After sequencing, we obtained 578 sequences. Four hundred thirty-seven sequences were excluded from further analysis due to duplication (n = 335) or similarity with sequences detected in the extraction control sample (n = 102); 141 unique sequences were analyzed. Altogether, 23/141 (16%) of the fungi detected belonged to pathogenic species, and 63/141 (45%) were identified as various yeasts; a variety of environmental or very rare fungal human pathogens represented 29/141 (21%) of the total and 26/141 (18%) were described as uncultured fungus. Panfungal PCR detected fungal species that would be missed by specific methods in only one case (probable cryptococcosis). Panfungal PCR followed by sequencing has limited use for testing BALF samples due to frequent commensal or environmental fungal species pickup.","""Do You Know What I Know?"": How Communication Norms and Recipient Design Shape the Content and Effectiveness of Patient Handoffs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535752,Journal of general internal medicine,2019 03 05,"Poor communication during end-of-shift transfers of care (handoffs) is associated with safety risks and patient harm.

Identifying these mechanisms among people living with HIV (PLHIV) after release from prison is particularly important, as individuals during this critical period are at high risk for both depression and poor ART adherence. 347 PLHIV recently released from prison in North Carolina and Texas were included in analyses to assess mediation of the relationship between depressive symptoms at 2 weeks post-release and ART adherence (assessed by unannounced telephone pill counts) at weeks 9-21 post-release by the hypothesized explanatory mechanisms of alcohol use, drug use, adherence self-efficacy, and adherence motivation (measured at weeks 6 and 14 post-release). Indirect effects were estimated using structural equation models with maximum likelihood estimation and bootstrapped confidence intervals. On average, participants achieved 79% ART adherence. The indirect effect of depression on adherence through drug use was statistically significant; greater symptoms of depression were associated with greater drug use, which was in turn associated with lower adherence. Lower adherence self-efficacy was associated with depressive symptoms, but not with adherence.

Cucurbitadienol is the skeleton of cucurbitane-type triterpenoids. As an alternative production strategy, we developed baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a microbial host for the eventual transformation of cucurbitadienol. The synthetic pathway of cucurbitadienol was constructed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by introducing the cucurbitadienol synthase gene from different plants, resulting in 7.80 mg cucurbitadienol from 1 L of fermentation broth. Improving supplies of isoprenoid precursors was then investigated for increasing cucurbitadienol production. Cucurbitadienol production increased to 21.47 mg/L through the overexpression of a global regulatory factor (UPC2) gene of triterpenoid synthase. In addition, knockout of the ERG7 gene increased cucurbitadienol production from 21.47 to 61.80 mg/L. Finally, fed-batch fermentation was performed, and 63.00 mg/L cucurbitadienol was produced. This work is an important step towards the total biosynthesis of valuable cucurbitane-type triterpenoids and demonstrates the potential for developing a sustainable and secure yeast biomanufacturing platform for triterpenoids.","Identification, sexual dimorphism and aspects of the natural history of Sapria himalayana (Rafflesiaceae) on Vietnam's Lang Biang Plateau.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535726,Botanical studies,2019 01 08,"Sapria is a distinctive and narrowly host-specific holoparasitic genus belonging to the Rafflesiaceae.

This study aimed to compare the biocompatibility and osteoinductivity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)/PHBV composites with multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs)/PHBV composites. CNTs were dispersed in PHBV by ultrasonication and composites were created using thermal injection moulding. In order to test their biocompatibility and osteoinductivity. Rat osteoblasts (rOBs) were then cultured and seeded on the composites. The composites were implanted in rat femoral bone defects. Our results showed that lower weight percentages of SWCNTs and MWCNTs (2-4%) improved both their mechanical and thermal decomposition properties. However, further reduction of rOBs cell death was observed in MWCNTs/PHBV. SWCNTs were shown to upregulate the expression of Runx-2 and Bmp-2 in early stage significantly, while MWCNTs showed a stronger long-term effect on Opn and Ocn. The in vivo result was that MWCNTs/PHBV composites induced intact rounding new bone, increased integration with new bone, and earlier completed bone remodeling when compared with SWCNTs. Immunohistochemistry also detected higher expression of RUNX-2 around MWCNTs/PHBV composites.

Here, we focus on spiders as a model group of generalist predators. They are among the most abundant and most diverse natural enemies in agroecosystems. We review their functional traits that influence food-web dynamics and pest suppression at organisational levels ranging from individuals to communities. At the individual and population levels, we focus on hunting strategy, body size, life stage, nutritional target, and personality (i.e., consistent inter-individual differences in behaviour). These functional traits determine the spider trophic niches. We also focus on the functional and numerical response to pest densities and on non-consumptive effects of spiders on pests. At the community level, we review multiple-predator effects and effect of alternative prey on pest suppression. Evidence for a key role of spiders in pest suppression is accumulating. Importantly, recent research has highlighted widespread non-consumptive effects and complex intraguild interactions of spiders. A better understanding of these effects is needed to optimize biocontrol services by spiders in agroecosystems.","A non-enzymatic voltammetric xanthine sensor based on the use of platinum nanoparticles loaded with a metal-organic framework of type MIL-101(Cr).

Some years later, similar models have been developed by various doses and durations and the main of these models exhibited obesity and features of diabetes mellitus, including glycosuria, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, decreased glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. Studies indicated that MSG treatment of newborn animals generates necrosis of neuronal cells of the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus. Neonatal MSG-treatment was related to normoglycemic-normoinsulinemic state at young ages and development of obesity and hyperinsulinemia at adult ages. Following observation of a severe hypertrophy of pancreatic islets due to the proliferation of β-cells in MSG-treated mice, this model has been proposed as a useful animal model of human T2DM. A higher dose of MSG (≥4 mg/g body weight) accompanied by a longer follow-up duration (>6 months) are needed to establish a typical animal model of T2DM.","Mitochondrial Involvement in Mental Disorders; Energy Metabolism, Genetic, and Environmental Factors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535680,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 06 13,"Mental disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ) are generally characterized by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behavior, and relationships with others.

Although numerous evidences have supported a role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in DOX-induced myocardial damage, the exact etiology and pathogenesis remain largely obscure. In this study, we focused on the role of miR-15b-5p in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. We employed a public miRNA and gene microarray to screen differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in rat cardiomyocytes, and 33 DEMs including miR-15b-5p and 237 DEGs including Bmpr1a and Gata4 were identified. The Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of 237 DEGs indicated that the DEGs were mainly enriched in heart development and ALK pathway in cardiomyocyte which included the main receptor Bmpr1a and transcription factor Gata4. The up-regulated miR-15b-5p and down-regulated Bmpr1a and Gata4 mRNA expressions were further validated in H9c2 cardiomyocytes exposed to DOX. Moreover, the results showed overexpression of miR-15b-5p or inhibition of Bmpr1a may enhance the DOX-induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and mitochondria damage in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. The Bmpr1a was suggested as a potential target of miR-15b-5p by bioinformatics prediction. We further verified the negatively regulatory effect of miR-15b-5p on Bmpr1a signaling. Moreover, we also confirmed that overexpression of miR-15b-5p may exacerbate the DOX-induced apoptosis of H9c2 cardiomyocytes by affecting the protein expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and Akt activation, while this pro-apoptotic effect was able to be suppressed by Bmpr1a agonist. Collectively, the results suggest that miR-15b-5p is likely involved in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via inhibiting Bmpr1a signaling in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Our study provides a novel insight for investigating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",Ischemic Preconditioning Efficacy Following Anabolic Steroid Usage: A Clear Difference Between Sedentary and Exercise-Trained Rat Hearts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535662,Cardiovascular toxicology,2018 12 11,"Previous studies show that anabolic steroids impair innate cardioprotective mechanisms. Here, we investigated the effect of supraphysiological doses of nandrolone on ischemic preconditioning (IPC) as a potent cardioprotective tool against ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury in rat hearts. Male Wistar rats in two experimental settings of sedentary and exercise-trained (60 min/day swimming, 5 days/week, for 8 weeks) were either pretreated with intramuscular injections of arachis oil (Arach, n = 16) as vehicle or nandrolone decanoate (ND, n = 8), 10 mg/kg/week, for 8 weeks. At the end, the hearts were excised and perfused in a Langendorff system. Then, the vehicle-treated hearts subdivided into the IR (30 min of LAD coronary artery occlusion and 120 min reperfusion, n = 8) and IPC (three cycles of 3-min ischemia and 3-min reperfusion before test ischemia, n = 8) groups and nandrolone-treated hearts served as ND + IPC (nandrolone pretreatment before IR and IPC protocols, n = 8) group. Post-ischemic cardiac function and infarct size were assessed. Reperfusion arrhythmias were analyzed using a standard scoring system. In sedentary hearts, ND slightly increased heart-to-body weight ratio and increased baseline cardiac contractile function. In trained hearts, ND markedly increased heart-to-body weight ratio which was also associated with enhanced baseline cardiac function. ND pretreatment enhanced protective effects of IPC in sedentary group; however, abolished these effects in exercise-trained group. The arrhythmia score was not significantly different between nandrolone-treated groups vs. respective preconditioned groups. Our findings show that ND impairs IPC-induced cardioprotection in exercise-trained rat hearts. Cardiac hypertrophy seems to play a crucial role in this response.",Mapping terrestrial oil spill impact using machine learning random forest and Landsat 8 OLI imagery: a case site within the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535661,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 10,"Terrestrial oil pollution is one of the major causes of ecological damage within the Niger Delta region of Nigeria and has caused a considerable loss of mangroves and arable croplands since the discovery of crude oil in 1956. The exact extent of landcover loss due to oil pollution remains uncertain due to the variability in factors such as volume and size of the oil spills, the age of oil, and its effects on the different vegetation types. Here, the feasibility of identifying oil-impacted land in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria with a machine learning random forest classifier using Landsat 8 (OLI spectral bands) and Vegetation Health Indices is explored. Oil spill incident data for the years 2015 and 2016 were obtained from published records of the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency and Shell Petroleum Development Corporation. Various health indices and spectral wavelengths from visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared bands were fused and classified using the machine learning random forest classifier to distinguish between oil-free and oil spill-impacted landcover. This provided the basis for the identification of the best variables for discriminating oil polluted from unpolluted land. Results showed that better results for discriminating oil-free and oil polluted landcovers were obtained when individual landcover types were classified separately as opposed to when the full study area image including all landcover types was classified at once. Similarly, the results also showed that biomass density plays a significant role in the characterization and classification of oil contaminated and oil-free pixels as tree cover areas showed higher classification accuracy compared to cropland and grassland.",A carbon paste electrode modified with a nickel titanate nanoceramic for simultaneous voltammetric determination of ortho- and para-hydroxybenzoic acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535660,Mikrochimica acta,2019 02 15,"An electrochemical sensor is described for the simultaneous determination of ortho-hydroxybenzoic acid (OHB) and para-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHB).

Blueberries contain bioactive compounds with important pharmacological effects such as neuroprotective and antioxidant actions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of blueberry extract and/or lithium on oxidative stress, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in an experimental ketamine-induced model of mania. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with vehicle, blueberry extract (200 mg/kg), and/or lithium (45 mg/kg or 22.5 mg/kg twice daily) for 14 days. Between the 8th and 14th days, the animals also received an injection of ketamine (25 mg/kg) or vehicle. On the 15th day the animals received a single injection of ketamine; after 30 min, the locomotor activity was evaluated in an open field test. Ketamine administration induced an increase in locomotor activity. In the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, ketamine also induced an increase in reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels, as well a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity. Pretreatment with blueberry extract or lithium was able to prevent this change. Ketamine increased the AChE and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in brain structures, while the blueberry extract partially prevented these alterations. In addition, our results showed that the neuroprotective effect was not potentiated when lithium and blueberry extract treatment were given together. In conclusion, our findings suggest that blueberry extract has a neuroprotective effect against an experimental model of mania. However, more studies should be performed to evaluate its effects as an adjuvant therapy.",Intrasubject repeatability of in vivo intervertebral motion parameters using quantitative fluoroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535658,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",2019 02 22,"In vivo quantification of intervertebral motion through imaging has progressed to a point where biomarkers for low back pain are emerging.

QFR is a novel approach for assessment of functional significance of coronary artery stenosis without using pressure wire and induced hyperemia. Patient-specific coronary flow is estimated semi-automatically by frame count method, which is subjective and inconvenient in the workflow of QFR analysis. The vascular structures were automatically delineated from coronary angiogram. Subsequently, the centerline of the interrogated vessel was extracted from the delineated lumen on each image frame and the change in the length of centerline was used to compute the flow velocity, which provided patient-specific flow for computation of QFR (QFRauto). A parameter derived from the increase in centerline length was used to automatically quantify the stability of contrast flow. From the two angiographic image runs used for three-dimensional angiographic reconstruction, the one with better stability was used to compute QFRauto. QFRauto was assessed in all patients enrolled in the FAVOR II China study, and compared with the commercialized QFR computational method based on frame count (QFRcount), using pressure wire-based fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the reference standard. Out of 328 vessels with paired FFR data, QFRauto was successfully computed on 325 (99%) vessels with acceptable stability in filling of contrast flow. The flow velocity computed by the proposed approach had a weak to moderate correlation with the frame count method (r = 0.37, p < 0.001), with mean differences of - 0.02 ± 0.07 m/s (p < 0.001). QFRauto had good correlation (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) and agreement (mean difference: - 0.01 ± 0.04, p < 0.001) with QFRcount. Good correlation (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) and agreement (mean difference: 0.01 ± 0.06, p = 0.016) were also observed between QFRauto and FFR. Using FFR ≤ 0.80 to define functional significance of coronary stenosis, the overall diagnostic accuracy for QFRauto was 93.2% (95% CI 90.5-96.0%). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve did not differ significantly between QFRcount and QFRauto (difference: 0.00; 95% CI - 0.01 to 0.01; p = 0.529). Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for QFRauto were 92.4% (95% CI 86.0-96.5%), 93.7% (95% CI 89.5-96.6%), 14.7 (95% CI 8.7-25.0), and 0.1 (95% CI 0.0-0.2), respectively. Automatic computation of patient-specific coronary flow velocity based on coronary angiography is feasible. Assessment of QFR based on this novel approach had good diagnostic accuracy in determining the functional significance of coronary stenosis.",Imaging and Surgical Treatment of Primary Pulmonary Artery Sarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535656,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2018 12 11,"Primary pulmonary artery sarcoma is a rare tumor originating from the pulmonary artery tree.

The primary imaging modality for most cardiac tumors such as primary pulmonary artery sarcoma is now MRI. It provides superb spatial resolution as well as functional assessment of the heart and pulmonary circulation. CT imaging also is part of routing imaging and remains as the most pertinent imaging modality to evaluate the lung parenchyma and presence of metastatic disease.

The CuNCs display blue-green fluorescence with excitation/emission peaks at 390/485 nm. A sensitive fluorometric assay was worked out for determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. If the ALP substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP) is enzymatically hydrolyzed, it forms p-nitrophenol (PNP) which reduces the fluorescence of CuNCs because its absorption band at 410 nm overlaps the excitation peak of CuNCs at 390 nm. In addition, the amino groups and imidazole groups on the surface of CuNCs possibly form a complex with the phenol groups of PNP. This induces aggregation-induced quenching of the fluorescence of CuNCs.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to monitor by RT-PCR the G and P genotypes of RVA strains identified in dairy cattle herds regularly vaccinated with the RVA UK strain (G6P[5]). Of the 14 randomly selected herds, two were excluded because no calf was diagnosed with diarrhea on the day of fecal collection. Another six herds were also excluded from the study because all 20 diarrheic fecal samples evaluated were RT-PCR-negative. In the remaining six herds, 17 (25.4%) of the 67 diarrheic samples were RVA-positive. One G and P amplicon from each herd were selected for nucleotide sequencing. In the phylogenetic analysis, five RVA strains presented the G6P[11] genotype, and one presented the G10P[11] genotype. The G6 genotype present in all RVA field strains clustered into a distinct phylogenetic arrangement (lineage III) of the UK vaccine strain (lineage IV), characterizing the emergence of a phylogenetically distant G6 strain. In addition, we observed the emergence of strains with G10 and P[11] genotypes characterizing failure in heterologous immune protection. These results show the epidemiological importance of constant monitoring of RVA strains in vaccinated cattle herds and the low frequencies of diarrhea and diagnosis of RVA suggest that a regular vaccination program reduces the frequency and severity of RVA diarrhea in suckling calves.",Unicompartmental versus total knee arthroplasty for knee osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535643,European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,2019 04 19,"In the last couple of years, a significant amount of studies comparing the UKA and TKA for unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis have been published.

The non-classical MHC-I molecule Qa-1b is the ligand for mouse CD94/NKG2A, presenting alternative non-americ fragment of leader peptides (Qa-1 determinant modifier (Qdm)) from classical MHC-I molecules. Here, we report a novel allele identified in free-living house mice captured in Norway, living among individuals carrying the canonical Cd94 allele. The novel Cd94LocA allele encodes 12 amino acid substitutions in the extracellular lectin-like domain. Flow cytometric analysis of primary NK cells and transfected cells indicates that the substitutions prevent binding of CD94 mAb and Qa-1b/Qdm tetramers. Our data further indicate correlation of Cd94 polymorphism with the two major subspecies of house mice in Europe. Together, these findings suggest that the Cd94LocA/NKG2A heterodimeric receptor is widely expressed among M. musculus subspecies musculus, with ligand-binding properties different from mice of subspecies domesticus, such as the C57BL/6 strain.","Selection criteria for linear regression models to estimate individual tree biomasses in the Atlantic Rain Forest, Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535635,Carbon balance and management,2018 12 27,"Biomass models are useful for several purposes, especially for quantifying carbon stocks and dynamics in forests. Selecting appropriate equations from a fitted model is a process which can involves several criteria, some widely used and others used to a lesser extent. This study analyzes six selection criteria for models fitted to six sets of individual biomass collected from woody indigenous species of the Tropical Atlantic Rain Forest in Brazil. Six models were examined and the respective fitted equations evaluated by the residual sum of squares, adjusted coefficient of determination, absolute and relative estimates of the standard error of estimate, and Akaike and Schwartz (Bayesian) information criteria. The aim of this study was to analyze the numeric behavior of these model selection criteria and discuss the ease of interpretation of them. The importance of residual analysis in model selection is stressed."

Participants were drawn from the Seattle Social Development Project (N = 808), a gender-balanced, ethnically diverse longitudinal panel. Structural equation modeling was used to examine risk factors for comorbid substance use and internalizing problems in family and peer social environments; substance use- and mental health-specific social environments (family tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use; family history of depression); and individual risk factors (behavioral disinhibition). Latent factors were created for comorbid substance use and mental health problems at ages 13-14 and comorbidity of substance abuse and dependence symptoms and mental health disorder symptoms at ages 30-33 and included indicators of anxiety, depression, alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana problems. Comorbid problems in adolescence predicted later comorbidity of disorders in adulthood. In addition, family tobacco environment and behavioral disinhibition predicted adolescent comorbidity, while family history of depression was associated with adult comorbidity. Finally, family and peer substance use in adolescence predicted substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana) both in adolescence and adulthood. The pattern of results suggests that comorbidity in adolescence continues into adulthood and is predicted by both general and behavior-specific environmental experiences during adolescence. Findings clarify the etiology of comorbid internalizing and substance use problems and suggest potential preventive intervention targets in adolescence to curb the development of comorbidity in adulthood.",MnO2-loaded microorganism-derived carbon for U(VI) adsorption from aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535621,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 03 25,"A low-cost industrial microorganism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was employed as a precursor to synthesize carbon/MnO2 composites (MMCs) via an oxidation-reduction reaction and one-step carbonization method for U(VI) adsorption. Scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption measurement indicated that the microorganism's carbonization could form surface porous structure and increase the specific surface area. Batch experiments showed that the maximum U(VI) adsorption capacity of MMCs reached 207 mg g-1 at [U(VI)]initial = 25 mg L-1 and pHinitial = 4.5. The obtained thermodynamic and kinetic parameters suggested that the process is endothermic, spontaneous, and chemisorption. FTIR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated that the surface hydroxyl groups of composites might be the reactive adsorption sites for U(VI). Additionally, 0.5 mol L-1 HNO3 solution could desorb ~ 95% uranium from U(VI)-loaded MMCs, and materials exhibited good regenerated availability. This study suggests that MMCs can be a potential adsorbent for U(VI) preconcentration and removal from radioactive wastewater.",Factors influencing attrition in 35 Alzheimer's Disease Centers across the USA: a longitudinal examination of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535620,Aging clinical and experimental research,2019 06 11,"A lack of understanding of the causes of attrition in longitudinal studies of older adults may lead to higher attrition rates and bias longitudinal study results.

Hence, in this study, we assessed the implications of aging, hyperglycemia, and also the dietary effect of n-3 fatty acids (α-linolenic acid (ALA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) on OS and inflammation in dyslipidemic rats. Dyslipidemia was induced in young and aged rats by feeding high-fat lard (HFL) diet. Diabetes was induced in young dyslipidemic rats by administering streptozotocin 30 days after the induction of dyslipidemia. Experimental groups received diets containing canola oil (HF + CNO) and fish oil (HF + FO) as a source of ALA and EPA + DHA respectively. After 60 days of feeding rats with their respective diets, OS and inflammatory markers in serum were assessed. Dyslipidemia caused significant (p < 0.05) increase in OS (lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide, and protein carbonyl), pro-inflammatory cytokine (CRP, IL-1β, MCP-1, and TNF-α), and eicosanoid (PGE2, LTB4, and LTC4) level in serum of both young and aged rats. Aged dyslipidemic rats presented significantly (p < 0.05) higher level of these markers compared to young dyslipidemic rats. Hyperglycemia onset further augmented OS and inflammatory markers in young dyslipidemic rats significantly (p < 0.05). Administration of n-3 fatty acids downregulated the serum markers of OS and inflammation in all the three experimental models. Thus, aging and hyperglycemia onset intensified dyslipidemia-induced OS and inflammation. Dietary preformed EPA + DHA presented larger restorative potentials than precursor ALA in countering OS and inflammation in all the three experimental models.",Neurons in rat orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex exhibit distinct responses in reward and strategy-update in a risk-based decision-making task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535618,Metabolic brain disease,2019 04 03,"The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are known to participate in risk-based decision-making. However, whether neuronal activities of these two brain regions play similar or differential roles during different stages of risk-based decision-making process remains unknown. Here we conducted multi-channel in vivo recordings in the OFC and mPFC simultaneously when rats were performing a gambling task. Rats were trained to update strategy as the task was shifted in two stages. Behavioral testing suggests that rats exhibited different risk preferences and response latencies to food rewards during stage-1 and stage-2. Indeed, the firing patterns and numbers of non-specific neurons and nosepoking-predicting neurons were similar in OFC and mPFC. However, there were no reward-expecting neurons and significantly more reward-excitatory neurons (fired as rats received rewards) in the mPFC. Further analyses suggested that nosepoking-predicting neurons may encode the overall value of reward and strategy, whereas reward-expecting neurons show more intensive firing to a big food reward in the OFC. Nosepoking-predicting neurons in mPFC showed no correlation with decision-making strategy updating, whereas the response of reward-excitatory neurons in mPFC, which were barely observed in OFC, were inhibited during nosepoking, but were enhanced in the post-nosepoking period. These findings indicate that neurons in the OFC and mPFC exhibit distinct responses in decision-making process during reward consumption and strategy updating. Specifically, OFC encodes the overall value of a choice and is thus important for learning and strategy updating, whereas mPFC plays a key role in monitoring and execution of a strategy.",Comparative transcriptome analysis in the hepatopancreas of Helice tientsinensis exposed to the toxic metal cadmium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535617,Genes & genomics,2019 05 20,"The mudflat crab Helice tientsinensis is one of the most commercially valuable species for crabmeat production due to its delicious taste.

We aimed to validate a previously developed seizure quality index (SQI) that delivers a clinically relevant outcome prediction early in the treatment course and can be used within common clinical setting. Therefore, a prospective study was conducted. Patients (n = 26) below the age of 65 years with a depressive episode and the clinical decision for ECT (right unilateral, brief pulse) were included and several ictal parameters, the SQI for non-response and non-remission, and the clinical outcome of the patients were documented. Logistic regression analysis revealed a statistically significant association between the SQI and non-response (p = 0.035). A significant association between the clinical outcome of non-response and the classified outcome of non-response was detected (p = 0.041). The overall classification accuracy regarding response/non-response was 71.3%, and the model revealed a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 61.5% for non-response. In this study, we could validate the SQI for the clinical outcome of non-response, but not for non-remission.

The literature offers few frameworks that systematically characterize these collaborations. To fill this gap, we developed a typology of BSSR approaches within biomedical HIV prevention research. Focusing on trials that had safety and/or efficacy endpoints, we identified five approaches for combining BSSR and clinical research: formative, embedded, parallel, explanatory, and implications. We describe each approach and provide illustrative examples. By offering a shared vocabulary for distinguishing the timing and design of collaborative BSSR and clinical research, this typology can facilitate greater transparency in collaborators' expectations and responsibilities, and help collaborators address challenges likely to be associated with such interdisciplinary research.",Therapeutic abortion and ectopic pregnancy: alternative sources for fetal stem cell research and therapy in Iran as an Islamic country.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535614,Cell and tissue banking,2019 04 16,"Regenerative medicine as a background of stem cell research and therapy has a long history. A wide variety of diseases including Parkinson's disease, heart diseases, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diabetes mellitus and etc. are candidate to be treated using different types of stem cells. There are several sources of stem cells such as bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood, germ cells and the embryo/fetus tissues. Fetal stem cells (FSCs) and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have been described as the most potent stem cell source. Although their pluri- or multipotent properties leads to promising reports for their clinical applications, owning to some ethical and legal obstacles in different communities such as Muslim countries, care should be taken for therapeutic applications of FSCs and ESCs. Derivation of these cell types needs termination of pregnancy and embryo or fetus life that is prohibited according to almost all rules and teaches in Muslim communities. Abortion and termination of pregnancy under a normal condition for the procurement of stem cell materials is forbidden by nearly all the major world religions such as Islam. Legislated laws in the most of Muslim countries permit termination of pregnancy and abortion only when the life of the mother is severely threatened or when continuing pregnancy may lead to the birth of a mentally retarded, genetically or anatomically malformed child. Based on the rules and conditions in Islamic countries, finding an alternative and biologically normal source for embryonic or fetal stem cell isolation will be too difficult. On the one hand, Muslim scientists have the feasibility for finding of genetically and anatomically normal embryonic or fetal stem cell sources for research or therapy, but on the other hand they should adhere to the law and related regional and local rules in all parts of their investigation. The authors suggest that the utilization of ectopic pregnancy (EP) conceptus, extra-embryonic tissues, and therapeutic abortion materials as a valuable source of stem cells for research and medical purposes can overcome limitations associated with finding the appropriate stem cell source. Pregnancy termination because of the mentioned subjects is accepted by almost all Islamic laws because of maternal lifesaving. Also, there are no ethical or legal obstacles in the use of extra-embryonic or EP derived tissues which lead to candidate FSCs as a valuable source for stem cell researches and therapeutic applications.",Sequential backbone resonance assignment of AT-rich interaction domain of human BAF200.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535613,Biomolecular NMR assignments,2019 04 25,"BAF200 is a subunit of PBAF chromatin remodeling complex that contains an N-terminal AT-rich interaction domain (ARID).

During pathogen-host coevolution, they develop strategy to manipulate cellular machinery particularly in subverting mitochondrion function. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that constantly remodel their structure. In particular, shaping and cellular distribution of the mitochondrial network is maintained in large part by the conserved activities of mitochondrial division, fusion, motility, and tethering. Mitochondria have been long recognized for their role in providing energy production, calcium metabolism, and apoptosis. More recently, mitochondria have been also shown to serve as a platform for innate immune response. In this context, mitochondrial dynamics and shaping is not only essential to maintain cristae structure and bioenergetic to fuel cellular demands but contribute to regulate cellular function such as innate immune response and mitochondrial permeabilization. Due to their key role in cell survival, mitochondria represent attractive targets for pathogens. Therefore, microbes by manipulating mitochondrial dynamics may escape to host cellular control. Herein, we describe how mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics, and shaping are impacted during microbe infections and how this interplay benefits to pathogens contributing to the diseases.",Alterations on Cellular Redox States upon Infection and Implications for Host Cell Homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535600,Experientia supplementum (2012),2019 05 16,"The cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its phosphate form, NADP+, are crucial molecules present in all living cells.

A recent cluster of data has highlighted the importance of the intracellular NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH ratios during host-pathogen interactions, as fluctuations in the levels of these cofactors and in precursors' bioavailability may condition host response and, therefore, pathogen persistence or elimination. Furthermore, an increasing interest has been given towards how pathogens are capable of hijacking host cell proteins in their own advantage and, consequently, alter cellular redox states and immune function.

However, the subsets of the same cell type differ to distinctively associate specific immune function to a particular metabolic profile. The response is mounted as a joint function of metabolic receptor and immune receptor signaling that target various metabolic pathways: glycolysis the pentose phosphate pathway; oxidative phosphorylation; beta-oxidation of fatty acids and transamination. The products from these cycles are integrated in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, many more pathways lead to many secondary metabolites that are not directly related to energy derivation or maintaining structure of the cells.

Through these coordinated actions, living organisms acquire energy and biosynthetic precursors to maintain cellular homeostasis and function. Metabolism relies on the breaking down of macromolecules to produce energy [catabolism] and/or intermediary metabolites that are then used to construct essential building blocks for macromolecule production [anabolism]. Overall, these metabolic processes are controlled by cellular energy status: when the energy released from catabolic processes exceeds the cellular demands the storage of metabolites in the form of lipids and glycogen takes place. These phenomena have been vastly associated with the genesis of metabolic disorders, such as obesity. In recent years, we have assisted to a rediscovery of metabolism through the identification of metabolic intermediaries that act as key players on differentiation, proliferation, and function of immune cells. This recent acknowledgement of the impact of metabolism in the overall immune response originated the ground-breaking field of immunometabolism.

Metabolic activity between individual cells of B. velezensis and P. vermicola towards CMC ranged from approximately 8 to 27% and 6 to 16%, respectively, clearly indicating heterogeneous degradation activities among isogenic populations. Linear correlation between % C-D and specific endoglucanase activity validated Raman results on CMC-degrading activity. Also, % C-D obtained from bacteria cultivated with only glucose was around 60% higher than that obtained from CMC, indicating the preference of bacteria for simple sugar glucose than CMC. In conclusion, Raman spectroscopy combined with heavy water is a sensitive analytical technique to reveal cellulose degraders and their degrading activities.",Suhuai suckling piglet hindgut microbiome-metabolome responses to different dietary copper levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535578,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 05 15,"Unabsorbed copper accumulates in the hindgut of pigs that consume high levels of dietary copper, which enhances the coselection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is considered detrimental to the environment and to porcine health. In our study, a combination of 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and nontargeted metabolomics was used to investigate the microbiome-metabolome responses to dietary copper levels in the hindgut of suckling piglets. The results showed that the dietary copper level affected the abundance of several Clostridia genera and that the relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, such as Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Acidaminococcus, was reduced in the 300 mg kg-1 (high) Cu group. Metabolomic analysis revealed that dietary copper levels affected protein and carbohydrate metabolites, protein biosynthesis, the urea cycle, galactose metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism (including the metabolism of arginine, proline, β-alanine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and methionine). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the abundance levels of Coprococcus (family Lachnospiraceae) and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) 18 (family Ruminococcaceae) were positively correlated with energy metabolism pathways (gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway). The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways (protein biosynthesis, glycine, serine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine metabolism), and OTU583 and OTU1067 (family Rikenellaceae) were positively correlated with amino acid metabolism pathways. These results suggest that the copper levels consumed by LC (low-copper group) versus HC (high-copper group) animals alter the composition of the gut microbiota and modulate microbial metabolic pathways, which may further affect the health of suckling piglets.",Cultivar and phosphorus effects on switchgrass yield and rhizosphere microbial diversity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535577,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 05 28,"Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a native perennial grass identified as a promising biofuel crop for production on marginal agricultural lands. As such, research into switchgrass fertility and the switchgrass rhizosphere microbiome has been ongoing in an effort to increase production sustainability. We examined the effects of cultivar and phosphorus (P) fertilization on biomass yield, P removal, and rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community structure in three switchgrass cultivars: Sunburst, Shawnee, and Liberty. The Liberty cv. is the first lowland-type bioenergy switchgrass adapted to USDA hardiness zones 4, 5, and 6. On a medium soil test P clay loam soil, biomass yield response to applied P was linear, increasing 135 kg ha-1 for every kilogram of P applied prior to establishment. Average post-frost biomass yield was 9.6 Mg ha-1 year-1 when unfertilized, and maximum biomass yield was 10.3 Mg ha-1 year-1 when fertilized at 58.6 kg ha-1 P, suggesting that P application on medium soil test P soils is beneficial for switchgrass establishment and early growth. Switchgrass cv. Shawnee was more productive than cvs. Liberty or Sunburst (11.3, 10.2, and 8.6 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively). Both bacterial and fungal communities were significantly shaped by cultivar. These shifts, while inconsistent between year and cultivar, may reflect a selection of the microbial community from that present in soil to maximize total nutrient uptake, regardless of additional P amendments. Phosphorus fertilization did not affect microbial community structure. Results of this study suggest that the cultivar-associated selection of particular microbial taxa may have implications for increased productivity.",International external quality assurance of JAK2 V617F quantification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535576,Annals of hematology,2019 05 05,"External quality assurance (EQA) programs are vital to ensure high quality and standardized results in molecular diagnostics. It is important that EQA for quantitative analysis takes into account the variation in methodology. Results cannot be expected to be more accurate than limits of the technology used, and it is essential to recognize factors causing substantial outlier results. The present study aimed to identify parameters of specific importance for JAK2 V617F quantification by quantitative PCR, using different starting materials, assays, and technical platforms. Sixteen samples were issued to participating laboratories in two EQA rounds. In the first round, 19 laboratories from 11 European countries analyzing JAK2 V617F as part of their routine diagnostics returned results from in-house assays. In the second round, 25 laboratories from 17 countries participated. Despite variations in starting material, assay set-up and instrumentation the laboratories were generally well aligned in the EQA program. However, EQA based on a single technology appears to be a valuable tool to achieve standardization of the quantification of JAK2 V617F allelic burden.",Does narrative drive dynamic attention to a prolonged stimulus?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535574,Cognitive research: principles and implications,2018 12 27,"Attention in the ""real world"" fluctuates over time, but these fluctuations are hard to examine using a timed trial-based experimental paradigm. Here we use film to study attention. To achieve short-term engagement, filmmakers make use of low-level cinematic techniques such as color, movement and sound design to influence attention. To engage audiences over prolonged periods of time, narrative structure is used. In this experiment, participants performed a secondary auditory choice reaction time (RT) task to measure attention while watching a film. In order to explore the role of narrative on attention, we manipulated the order that film segments were presented. The influence of narrative was then compared to the contribution of low-level features (extracted using a computer-based saliency model) in a multiple regression analysis predicting choice RT. The regression model successfully predicted 28% of the variance in choice RT: 13% was due to low-level saliency, and 8% due to the narrative. This study shows the importance of narrative in determining attention and the value of studying attention with a prolonged stimulus such as film.",Bone Marrow Transplantation for Treatment of the Col1a2+/G610C Osteogenesis Imperfecta Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535573,Calcified tissue international,2019 03 28,"Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) of healthy donor cells has been postulated as a strategy for treating osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and other bone fragility disorders. The effect of engraftment by tail vein injection and/or marrow ablation by 6 Gy whole body irradiation were tested in Col1a2+/G610C (OI) mice as a model of mild-moderate OI. Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry, microCT, and 4-point bending were used to measure bone volume (BV), bone mineral density (BMD), and biomechanical strength. BV, BMD, and mechanical strength were reduced in OI mice compared to wild type (WT) controls. BMT with and without irradiation yielded no difference in BV and BMD outcomes for both OI and WT mice, at 3 weeks. Transplantation of OI cells into OI mice to test for paracrine effects of BMT also showed no difference with non-transplanted OI mice. In a parallel cell tracking study, donor marrow was taken from transgenic mice constitutively expressing tdTomato and transplanted into WT mice. Lineage tracking demonstrated that irradiation considerably enhanced engraftment of tdTomato+ cells. However, tdTomato+ cells predominantly expressed TRAP and not AP, indicating engrafted donor cells were chiefly from the hematopoietic lineages. These data show that whole marrow transplantation fails to rescue the bone phenotype of Col1a2+/G610C (OI) mice and that osteopoietic engraftment is not significantly enhanced by irradiation. These findings are highly relevant to modern approaches focused on the gene repair of patient cells ex vivo and their subsequent reintroduction into the osteopoietic compartment via the circulation.",2-Methoxyestradiol attenuates liver fibrosis in mice: implications for M2 macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535572,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2019 06 16,"Liver fibrosis is a major health problem worldwide due to its serious complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is an end metabolite of estradiol with anti-proliferative, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the protective role of 2-ME in liver fibrosis has not been fully investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of 2-ME in carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in mice. Animals were injected intraperitoneally with CCl4 twice weekly for 6 weeks. 2-ME 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg was administrated intraperitoneally every day over the same period. Our data showed that 2-ME reduced the extent of liver toxicity and fibrosis due to CCl4 exposure. It restored the elevated serum liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and ameliorated oxidative status. In addition, 2-ME significantly reduced collagen deposition and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) protein expressions. Furthermore, 2-ME markedly lowered macrophage infiltration and macrophage alternative activation marker chitinase-like molecules (CHI3L3/YM1). The results of this study indicate an important protective activity of 2-ME in liver fibrosis and highlight the role of macrophage recruitment and alternative activation as a possible target.",Side effects of frequently used oral antidiabetics on wound healing in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535571,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2019 06 16,"Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and arteriosclerosis are rising in the increasingly aging society, and the number of patients with daily intake of glucose-lowering medication has also increased. Interestingly, knowledge about oral antidiabetics with regard to wound healing is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify possible (side) effects of the most frequently prescribed oral antidiabetics on skin cells and wound healing. Four oral antidiabetics of different substance classes (i.e., metformin, glibenclamide, sitagliptin, repaglinide) were investigated with regard to the promotion of cell metabolism and migration of human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes by XTT and scratch assays. In addition, histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed in a 3D wound model to address the impact of the antidiabetics on regeneration processes, such as cell migration, fibroblast activity, epidermal thickness, and cell apoptosis. In comparison to systemic application, metformin displayed the most adverse effects in vitro in nearly all analyses, interestingly at serum equivalent concentrations. In contrast, sitagliptin and glibenclamide had a slight but insignificant effect on fibroblasts compared with keratinocytes. Repaglinide tended to have a negative influence on keratinocyte metabolism. Interestingly, antidiabetics generally induced a significantly enhanced rate of apoptosis in fibroblasts, with the exception of repaglinide.Antidiabetics influenced key players in wound healing, namely, keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Particularly, metformin impaired human skin cells. These findings should be kept in mind in further studies because of their putative relevance in patients suffering from chronic wounds that do not respond to various wound therapies.","Body Mass Index, waist circumference, and health-related quality of life in adults with chronic kidney disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535570,"Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2019 05 07,"Obesity is linked to poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the general population, but its role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain."

Targeted therapy is of increasing interest and already, targeted hormone treatment for breast and prostate cancer has improved survival. The aim of this literature review is to summarise the role of hormones in CRC prognosis and treatment. A literature review of all human and animal in vivo and in vitro studies in the last 20 years, which assessed the role of hormones in CRC treatment or prognosis, was carried out. The hormones described in this review have been subdivided according to their secretion origin. Most of the studies are based on in vitro or animal models. The main findings point to adipokines, insulin and the insulin growth factor axis as key players in the link between obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and a subset of CRC. Gut-derived hormones, especially uroguanylin and guanylin are being increasingly investigated as therapeutic targets, with promising results. Using hormones as prognostic and therapeutic markers in CRC is still in the preliminary stages for only a fraction of the hormones affecting the GIT. In light of the increasing interest in tailoring treatment strategies, hormones are an important area of focus in the future of CRC management.",Genomic alterations associated with HER2+ breast cancer risk and clinical outcome in response to trastuzumab.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535550,Molecular biology reports,2019 03 29,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) is an aggressive BC subtype characterized by HER2 overexpression/amplification. Genomic alterations of HER2 and others have been reported to be associated with, HER2 overexpression and prediction of trastuzumab-response. Here, we aimed at identifying germline and somatic alterations associated with HER2+ BC and evaluating their association with clinical outcome in response to trastuzumab therapy given to HER2+ BC patients. Global Sequencing Array (GSA) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques were used to determine alterations in HER2 and other HER2-interacting as well as signaling-related genes in HER2+ BC. In addition, 20 formalin fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were also evaluated by GSA for identifying significant variations associated with HER + BC as well as response to trastuzumab therapy. A germline variant in HER2 (I655V) was found to be significantly associated with the risk of the disease (p < 0.01). A nonsense mutation in PTPN11 (K99X), a pathogenic CCND1 splice site variant (P241P), a hotspot missense mutation in PIK3CA (E542K) and a hotspot missense mutation in TP53 (R249S); were observed in 25%, 75%, 30% and 40% of the HER2+ BC tissue samples, respectively.

These results indicate that HER2, PTPN11, CCND1 and PIK3CA genes are important biomarkers in HER2+ BC. Moreover, the patients harboring mutant CCND1 and PIK3CA exhibit a poorer clinical outcome as compared to those carrying wild-type CCND1 and PIK3CA.",Pesticides and Related Toxicants in the Atmosphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535549,Reviews of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 04 18,"Pesticides and other toxicants released into the environment can contaminate air, water, soil, and biota. This review focuses on sources, exposures, fate, analysis, and trends. The potential for exposures due to atmospheric transport and deposition of pesticides and related contaminants may pose risks to humans and wildlife. Emissions of chemicals to air are related to physicochemical properties (e.g., vapor pressure and chemical stability). Experimental design and computer-based modeling, as related to emissions and dispersion of pesticides along transects downwind from release sources, will be discussed using the example of pesticide volatilization and drift in California agriculture that results in the transport and deposition downwind to the Sierra Nevada mountains, where much work has been done to refine exposure data for use in risk assessment and management. Predictably, those chemicals found frequently in air are those used most extensively, have multiple emission sources, and resist degradation. Yet to be determined are definitive connections with adverse impacts to humans and wildlife, although the accumulating evidence suggests that endocrine disrupting chemicals, ChE inhibitors, and others warrant further attention. Steps that are being taken to limit emissions, such as in pest control and fuel combustion, offer promising opportunities for improving the quality of air and of the overall environment. Chemical degradation rates and products from trace organics in the air merit more attention, as do the potential for activation by photooxidation and bioaccumulation in food chains. The potential effect of climate change, on atmospheric processes affecting contaminant behavior, is an area ripe for further study.",Posterior tibial slope angle is associated with flexion-type Salter-Harris II and Watson-Jones type IV fractures of the proximal tibia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535547,"Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",2018 12 11,"Flexion-type Salter-Harris (SH) II fractures of the proximal tibia, also described as Watson-Jones (WJ) IV fractures, are rare injuries reported among adolescent athletes who are close to skeletal maturity and remain elusive.

For this purpose, constructed wetlands are attracting great concern owing to their low cost and less operation and maintenance requirements. The main aim of this work was to study the effectiveness of constructed wetlands utilizing Phragmites australis plants and Gambusia fish in the treatment of textile effluent. The constructed wetlands are located in the eastern part of a wastewater treatment plant near a grit chamber unit. This research was carried out in four polyethene rectangular tanks with a capacity of 80 L. The tanks were filled to about 20% with sand with a porosity of 48% and the diameter of the gravel bed used in the horizontal sub-surface flow unit varied between 5 and 25 mm. The results of different tanks showed the highest and lowest removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were in the tanks containing Phragmites australis/Gambusia fish and Phragmites australis, respectively. The best tank for the removal of total suspended solids (TSS) was the tank containing the Phragmites australis and the Gambusia fish. In the tank containing the Phragmites australis plants, the removal efficiency of NO3-, COD, and TSS was in the range of 40-70, 68-72, and 49-71%, respectively. The maximum increase of nitrate, approximately 78%, was observed in tank 2, which contained only fish. In the control tank, the removal efficiency of NO3-, COD, and TSS was in the range of 0-10, 10-18, and 15-25%, respectively. The results of this study showed that if these systems were properly designed and operated, they could be used to treat various wastewaters, especially in developing countries.","Effects of steel slag and biochar amendments on CO2, CH4, and N2O flux, and rice productivity in a subtropical Chinese paddy field.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535544,Environmental geochemistry and health,2018 12 11,"Steel slag, a by-product of the steel industry, contains high amounts of active iron oxide and silica which can act as an oxidizing agent in agricultural soils. Biochar is a rich source of carbon, and the combined application of biochar and steel slag is assumed to have positive impacts on soil properties as well as plant growth, which are yet to be validated scientifically. We conducted a field experiment for two rice paddies (early and late paddy) to determine the individual and combined effects of steel slag and biochar amendments on CO2, CH4, and N2O emission, and rice productivity in a subtropical paddy field of China. The amendments did not significantly affect rice yield. It was observed that CO2 was the main greenhouse gas emitted from all treatments of both paddies. Steel slag decreased the cumulative CO2 flux in the late paddy. Biochar as well as steel slag + biochar treatment decreased the cumulative CO2 flux in the late paddy and for the complete year (early and late paddy), while steel slag + biochar treatment also decreased the cumulative CH4 flux in the early paddy. The biochar, and steel slag + biochar amendments decreased the global warming potential (GWP). Interestingly, the cumulative annual GWP was lower for the biochar (55,422 kg CO2-eq ha-1), and steel slag + biochar (53,965 kg CO2-eq ha-1) treatments than the control (68,962 kg CO2-eq ha-1). Total GWP per unit yield was lower for the combined application of steel slag + biochar (8951 kg CO2-eq Mg-1 yield) compared to the control (12,805 kg CO2-eq Mg-1 yield). This study suggested that the combined application of steel slag and biochar could be an effective long-term strategy to reduce greenhouse gases emission from paddies without any detrimental effect on the yield."

Abnormal signaling, uncontrolled proliferation and high interstitial pressure all contribute to a chaotic, non-hierarchical vascular organization. Using an immune competent 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma murine model, this study fully characterizes the architecture and immunocyte milieu of the tumor microenvironment. Heterogeneous vessel distribution, chaotic connectivity, limited perfusion, cancer cell density, immune phenotype, and biological responses to immune therapy are presented. Cancer cell density mirrored the distribution of large, perfusable vessels, both predominately in the tumor periphery. Intratumoral administration of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 led to an increase in CD45+ leukocytes, with a specific increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and a decrease in the percentage of Gr-llo myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Concomitantly, serum G-CSF, IL-10 and VEGF decreased, while CXCR9 and interferon gamma increased. The distribution pattern of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, visualized using a fluorescent perfluorocarbon emulsion, indicated that macrophages predominately localize in the vicinity of large blood vessels. Electron microscopy supports the presence of dense tumor cell masses throughout the tumor, with the largest vessels present in the surrounding mammary fat pad.

The recombinant analgesic-antitumor peptide (rAGAP), a protein consisting of small ubiquitin-related modifier linked with a hexa-histidine tag, exhibited the antitumor activity in HepG2 tumors in our previous study. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of its antitumor activity was still elusive. In this work, we found that treatment with rAGAP reduced phosphorylation of AKT at non-toxic doses in HepG2 cells in vitro. More importantly, treatment of HepG2 cells with rAGAP downregulated protein expression of HIF-1α, suppressed activities of HIF, reduced secretion of VEGF and IL-8, and suppressed HepG2-induced tube formation by HUVEC, which was reversed by co-incubation with SC-79 (an AKT activator). Furthermore, in tumors of athymic mice with HepG2, treatment with rAGAP reduced phosphorylation of AKT, downregulated protein expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, and microvessel density marked by positive CD31 staining. Collectively, rAGAP inhibited angiogenesis by suppressing AKT activation, which partly explained its antitumor activity in HCC.",Capillary zone electrophoresis coupled to drift tube ion mobility-mass spectrometry for the analysis of native and APTS-labeled N-glycans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535529,Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2018 12 11,"Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) based on electrophoretic mobility in the liquid phase and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) based on mobilities in the gas phase are both powerful techniques for the separation of complex samples. Protein glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications associated with a wide range of biological functions and human diseases. Due to their high structural variability, the analysis of glycans still represents a challenging task. In this work, the first on-line coupling of CZE with drift tube ion mobility-mass spectrometry (DTIM-MS) has been perfomed to further improve separation capabilities for the analysis of native and 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS)-labeled N-glycans. In this way, a complexity of glycan signals was revealed which could not be resolved by these techniques individually, shown for both native and APTS-labeled glycans. Each individual glycan signal separated in CZE exhibited an unexpectedly high number of peaks observed in the IMS dimension. This observation could potentially be explained by the presence of isomeric forms, including different linkages, and/or gas-phase conformers. In addition, the type of sialic acid attached to glycans has a significant impact on the obtained drift time profile. Furthermore, the application of α2-3 neuraminidase enabled the partial assignment of peaks in the arrival time distribution considering their sialic acid linkages (α2-3/α2-6). This work is a showcase for the high potential of CZE-DTIM-MS, which is expected to find various applications in the future.

This probe (λex = 401 nm, λem = 527 nm) displayed high specificity for sensing thiophenols over other biologically related species. Besides, this probe possessed capabilities of monitoring thiophenols with rapid response rate (3 min), a large Stokes shift (126 nm), and high sensitivity (2.7 nM). The sensing mechanism was considered to be that thiophenols triggered thiolysis of the probe and the ESIPT fluorophore was released, as confirmed by means of HPLC and HRMS. Most notably, this probe was successfully applied to monitor levels of thiophenols in realistic samples and MDA-MB-231 cells.

In this work, we present a novel method for the detection and quantification at trace levels of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in environmental water samples. The detection and quantification of the analytes was performed by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Chromatographic separation was achieved with an ion-exchange column and a pH-gradient elution of a solution of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium acetate. The limit of detection for glyphosate and AMPA was 0.25 μg L-1 and the limit of quantification was 0.5 μg L-1with a 20-μL injection. The method was used to investigate the levels of glyphosate and AMPA in surface water samples from the Yarra River catchment area and urban constructed stormwater wetlands. The results indicate that at the time of sampling, no glyphosate or AMPA was present in the samples from the Yarra River catchment area (n = 10). However, glyphosate was detected above the limit of quantification in 33% of the wetland samples (n = 12), with concentrations ranging from 1.95 to 2.96 μg L-1. Similarly, AMPA was quantified in 83% of the wetland samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.55 to 2.42 μg L-1. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pH-gradient LC-MS/MS method for glyphosate and AMPA analysis at ultratrace levels, with minimal sample processing, avoiding costly, time-consuming derivatization and preconcentration steps.

The viral genome contains five open reading frames encoding three unknown proteins (ORF I, II and III), a putative glycoprotein (G), and a large (L) protein. Phylogenetic analysis placed LsNSRV-1 in the recently established mononegaviral family Artoviridae. LsNSRV-1 showed a prevalence of around 97% and was detected in all L. salmonis developmental stages. Viral genomic and antigenomic RNA was localized to nerve tissue, connective tissue, epithelial cells of the gut, subepidermal tissue, exocrine and cement glands, as well as the testis, vas deferens and spermatophore sac of male L. salmonis and the ovaries and oocytes of females. Viral RNA was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleoli of infected cells, and putative nuclear export and localization signals were found within the ORF I, III and L proteins, suggesting nuclear replication of LsNSRV-1. RNA interference (RNAi) was induced twice during development by the introduction of a double-stranded RNA fragment of ORF I, resulting in a transient knockdown of viral RNA. A large variation in the knockdown level was seen in adult males and off springs of knockdown animals, whereas the RNA level was more stable in adult females. Together with the localization of viral RNA within the male spermatophore and female oocytes and the amplification of viral RNA in developing embryos, this suggests that LsNSRV-1 is transmitted both maternally and paternally. Small amounts of viral RNA were detected at the site where chalimi were attached to the skin of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). However, as the RNAi-mediated treatment did not result in LsNSRV-1-negative offspring and the virus failed to replicate in the tested fish cell cultures, it is difficult to investigate the influence of secreted LsNSRV-1 on the salmon immune response.",Comprehensive cancer control planning in the Pacific: the Cancer Council of the Pacific Islands a multi-national regional coalition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535525,Cancer causes & control : CCC,2019 02 15,"In the early 1990s, a comprehensive cancer control (CCC) approach was developed in the United States (US).

These thermodynamic parameters of the protein-ligand association reaction are usually determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Here, the repeatability, precision, and accuracy of the measurement of the affinity and the change in enthalpy upon acetazolamide (AZM) interaction with human carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) are discussed based on the measurements using several ITC instruments. The AZM-CA II reaction was performed at decreasing protein-ligand concentrations until the determination of ∆G and ΔH was not possible, indicating a lower limit for accuracy. To obtain the confidence intervals (CI) of the ∆G and ΔH of AZM binding to CA II, the binding reaction was repeated numerous times at the optimal concentration of 10 µM and 25 °C temperature. The CI (at a confidence level α = 0.95) for ΔH = - 51.2 ± 1.0 kJ/mol and ∆G = - 45.4 ± 0.5 kJ/mol was determined by averaging the results of multiple repeats.",Introgression reshapes recombination distribution in grapevine interspecific hybrids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535509,TAG. Theoretical and applied genetics. Theoretische und angewandte Genetik,2019 04 08,"In grapevine interspecific hybrids, meiotic recombination is suppressed in homeologous regions and enhanced in homologous regions of recombined chromosomes, whereas crossover rate remains unchanged when chromosome pairs are entirely homeologous. Vitis rotundifolia, an American species related to the cultivated European grapevine Vitis vinifera, has a high level of resistance to several grapevine major diseases and is consequently a valuable resource for grape breeding. However, crosses between both species most often lead to very few poorly fertile hybrids. In this context, identifying genetic and genomic features that make cross-breeding between both species difficult is essential. To this end, three mapping populations were generated by pseudo-backcrosses using V. rotundifolia as the donor parent and several V. vinifera cultivars as the recurrent parents. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to establish high-density genetic linkage maps and to determine the genetic composition of the chromosomes of each individual. A good collinearity of the SNP positions was observed between parental maps, confirming the synteny between both species, except on lower arm of chromosome 7. Interestingly, recombination rate in V. rotundifolia × V. vinifera interspecific hybrids depends on the length of the introgressed region. It is similar to grapevine for chromosome pairs entirely homeologous. Conversely, for chromosome pairs partly homeologous, recombination is suppressed in the homeologous regions, whereas it is enhanced in the homologous ones. This balance leads to the conservation of the total genetic length of each chromosome between V. vinifera and hybrid maps, whatever the backcross level and the proportion of homeologous region. Altogether, these results provide new insight to optimize the use of V. rotundifolia in grape breeding and, more generally, to improve the introgression of gene of interest from wild species related to crops.",Prenatal developmental toxicity testing of petroleum substances using the zebrafish embryotoxicity test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535508,ALTEX,2018 12 11,"The present study evaluates the applicability of the zebrafish embryotoxicity test (ZET) to assess prenatal developmental toxicity (PDT) potency of the DMSO-extracts of 9 petroleum substances (PS), with variable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content, and 2 gas-to-liquid (GTL) products, without any PAHs but otherwise similar properties to PS. The results showed that all PS extracts induced concentration-dependent in vitro PDT, as quantified in the ZET and that this potency is associated with their 3-5 ring PAH content. In contrast and as expected, GTL products did not induce any effect at all. The potencies obtained in the ZET correlated with those previously reported for the embryonic stem cell test (EST) (R2=0.61), while the correlation with potencies reported in in vivo studies were higher for the EST (R2=0.85) than the ZET (R2=0.69). Combining the results of the ZET with those previously reported for the EST (Kamelia et al., 2017), the aryl hydrocarbon (AhR) CALUX assay (Kamelia et al., 2018), and the PAH content, ranked and clustered the test compounds in line with their in vivo potencies and chemical characteristics. To conclude, our findings indicate that the ZET does not outperform the EST as a stand-alone assay for testing PDT of PS, but confirms the hypothesis that PAHs are the major inducers of PDT by some PS, while they also indicate that the ZET is a useful addition to a battery of in vitro tests able to predict the in vivo PDT of PS.",MicroRNA‑98/PTEN/AKT pathway inhibits cell proliferation and malignant progression of hypopharyngeal carcinoma by MTDH.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535507,Oncology reports,2019 01 31,"Laryngeal carcinoma is one of the most common tumors concerning otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery, however, the pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinoma remains unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play vital roles in the pathogenesis of laryngeal carcinoma Herein, the present study was designed to explore the function and mechanism of miRNA‑98 in hypopharyngeal carcinoma. In brief, qRT‑PCR, MTT assay, western blot analysis, Transwell assay and luciferase reporter assay were performed. Based on the results, miRNA‑98 expression was downregulated in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Downregulation of miRNA‑98 promoted cell growth and migration, and decreased the apoptotic rate of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Overexpression of miRNA‑98 increased the apoptotic rate, and inhibited cell growth and migration of hypopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays revealed that MTDH is a direct target of miRNA‑98 and overexpression of miRNA‑98 induced the protein expression of PTEN and suppressed that of PI3K and p‑Akt. si‑MTDH attenuated the anticancer effects of miRNA‑98 on hypopharyngeal carcinoma via the PTEN/AKT pathway.

However, the therapeutic effect of gefitinib is often limited by the development of gefitinib resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non‑coding RNAs, have been demonstrated to be frequently dysregulated in human malignancies. For instance, the downregulation of miR‑506‑3p has been reported in NSCLC patients. The aim of the present study was to determine the role and underlying molecular mechanism of miR‑506‑3p in the regulation of gefitinib sensitivity in NSCLC. A gefitinib‑resistant PC‑9 (PC‑9GR) cell line was established, and reduced miR‑506‑3p expression was observed in PC‑9GR cells as compared with that in parental cells. The results of cell cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis assays indicated that PC‑9GR cells were more sensitive to gefitinib following the transfection with an miR‑506‑3p mimic, while transfection with an miR‑506‑3p antagonist reduced the sensitivity of PC‑9GR cells to gefitinib. It was further revealed that Yes‑associated protein 1 (YAP1) was directly suppressed by miR‑506‑3p in PC‑9GR cells. The elevated sensitivity of PC‑9GR cells to gefitinib following transfection with the miR‑506‑3p mimic was counteracted by the overexpression of YAP1. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between the miR‑506‑3p and YAP1 mRNA levels was detected in lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that the downregulation of miR‑506‑3p contributes to gefitinib resistance, and thus, the restoration of miR‑506‑3p may be a potential therapeutic approach for overcoming NSCLC gefitinib resistance.",Ginsenoside Rg1 protects against H2O2‑induced neuronal damage due to inhibition of the NLRP1 inflammasome signalling pathway in hippocampal neurons in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535505,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 05 03,"Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are important in the pathogenesis of ageing and age‑related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain. The nucleotide‑binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)‑like receptor protein 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome is responsible for the formation of pro‑inflammatory molecules in neurons. Whether the NOX2‑NLRP1 inflammasome signalling pathway is involved in neuronal ageing and age‑related damage remains to be elucidated. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is a steroidal saponin found in ginseng. In the present study, the primary hippocampal neurons were treated with H2O2 (200 µM) and Rg1 (1, 5 and 10 µM) for 24 h to investigate the protective effects and mechanisms of Rg1 on H2O2‑induced hippocampal neuron damage, which mimics age‑related damage. The results showed that H2O2 treatment significantly increased ROS production and upregulated the expression of NOX2 and the NLRP1 inflammasome, and led to neuronal senescence and damage to hippocampal neurons. Rg1 decreased ROS production, reducing the expression of NOX2 and the NLRP1 inflammasome in H2O2‑treated hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, Rg1 and tempol treatment significantly decreased neuronal apoptosis and the expression of β‑galactosidase, and alleviated the neuronal senescence and damage induced by H2O2.

MEK inhibition by U0126 significantly decreased the growth of SW48 cells that harbored the MEK1 Q56P mutation, although it did not evidently affect the growth of NCI‑H508 cells with MEK1 wild‑type. In addition, U0126 increased the sensitivity of SW48 cells to 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU) and oxaliplatin by producing more γH2AX foci and decreasing the expression of excision repair cross‑complementation group 1 and thymidylate synthase. The results suggested that MEK inhibitors in combination with oxaliplatin/5‑FU may offer an improved therapeutic effect in patients with MEK‑mutant CRC.","Expression levels and co‑targets of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p in lung adenocarcinoma tissues: Αn exploration with RT‑qPCR, microarray and bioinformatic analyses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535503,Oncology reports,2019 01 31,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological subtype of lung cancer.

The present study used real‑time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) to explore the expression values of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p in 101 LUAD and 101 normal lung tissues. Ten relevant microarray datasets were screened to further validate the expression levels of miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p in LUAD. Twelve prediction tools were employed to obtain potential targets of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p. The results showed that both miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p were expressed significantly lower in LUAD. A significant positive correlation was also present between miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p expression in LUAD. In addition, lower expression of miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p was indicative of vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis (LNM), and a later tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stage of LUAD. The authors obtained 167 targets of miRNA‑126‑3p and 212 targets of miRNA‑126‑5p; 44 targets were co‑targets of both. Eight co‑target genes (IGF2BP1, TRPM8, DUSP4, SOX11, PLOD2, LIN28A, LIN28B and SLC7A11) were initially identified as key genes in LUAD. The results of the present study indicated that the co‑regulation of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p plays a key role in the development of LUAD, which also suggests a fail‑proof mode between miRNA‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p.",MicroRNA‑143‑3p suppresses cell growth and invasion in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma via targeting the k‑Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535502,International journal of oncology,2019 04 01,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have been identified as an important regulator in carcinogenesis and other pathological processes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the function of miRNAs in the progression and development of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the miRNA expression pattern in LSCC tissues was profiled using miRNA microarray analysis. It was found that a large set of miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in LSCC tissues and that miR‑143‑3p was the most markedly downregulated compared with normal tissues. The low expression of miR‑143‑3p was associated with poor prognosis in LSCC. The overexpression of miR‑143‑3p repressed cellular proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The upregulation of miR‑143‑3p suppressed cell migration and invasion through inhibiting the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition cascade. In addition, it was verified that the oncogene k‑Ras is a target of miR‑143‑3p in LSCC cells, and the suppressive effects of miR‑143‑3p on LSCC cells were abrogated by the overexpression of k‑Ras. It was also revealed that miR‑143‑3p may inhibit cell growth and metastasis through targeting the k‑Ras/Raf/mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal‑regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Taken together, the data indicated that the miR‑143‑3p/k‑Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK axis serves a key regulator in the development and progression of LSCC, suggesting that miR‑143‑3p may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in the treatment of LSCC.",MicroRNA‑223 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell resistance to sorafenib by targeting FBW7.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535501,Oncology reports,2018 12 20,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a globally prevalent malignancy associated with a poor patient prognosis. We investigated the relationship between microRNA‑223 (miR‑223) expression and the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib treatment. miR‑223 expression was determined in HCC cell lines with differential sorafenib sensitivity using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. miR‑223 inhibitor, miR‑223 mimic, and F‑box and WD repeat domain‑containing 7 (FBW7) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were transfected into the HCC cells to regulate the expression levels of miR‑223 and FBW7. Cell proliferation was evaluated using an ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay and Cell Counting Kit‑8. FBW7 protein expression levels were observed using western blotting. miR‑223 expression was increased in the HCC cells with sorafenib resistance. HCC cells with miR‑223 knockdown had significantly increased sorafenib sensitivity, but the miR‑223 mimic had the opposite effect. The TargetScan web server predicted that FBW7 is a target of miR‑223, which was confirmed by western blotting. Furthermore, FBW7 siRNA transfection increased HCC cell resistance to sorafenib in an obvious manner, and entirely eliminated the effect of the miR‑223 inhibitor on enhancing sorafenib sensitivity. To conclude, miR‑223 expression is upregulated in sorafenib‑resistant HCC cells, and miR‑223 knockdown significantly enhances HCC cell sensitivity to sorafenib by increasing expression of the target gene, FBW7, suggesting that miR‑223 may be a new therapeutic target for overcoming sorafenib resistance."

Emerging evidence suggests that ROS may be involved in the induction of epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has been reported to promote cancer stem‑like cell (CSC) generation. Recent data indicate that altered accumulation of ROS is associated with CSC generation, EMT and hypoxia exposure, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study, we derived CSCs from Panc‑1 human pancreatic cancer cells and characterized them using serial replating assays and western blot analysis. Functional identification of viable cells was performed using the CCK‑8 assay and colony formation assays. The expression of various antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), was measured by western blot analysis in Panc‑1 CSCs. The role of GPX4 in regulating biological processes of Panc‑1 CSCs was assessed by proliferation, sphere formation and invasion assays with or without oxidative stress. Manipulation of GPX4 expression by siRNA knockdown or an overexpression vector was performed to assess functions including proliferation, colony formation and invasion. EMT hallmark genes were detected after GPX4 alteration by RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. Panc‑1 CSCs displayed more resistance to hypoxia exposure. Compared with the parental Panc‑1 cells, Panc‑1 CSCs expressed an obviously higher endogenous GPX4 level, indicating their role in maintaining homeostasis. During GPX4 knockdown, ROS accumulation was promoted following oxidative stress exposure to either H2O2 or erastin. Additionally, overexpression of GPX4 eliminated ROS induction by oxidative stress exposure and thus, exerted protective effects on physiological processes in the Panc‑1 CSCs. Knockdown of GPX4 arrested cell cycle progression at the G1/G0 phase; inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and the stemness phenotype in the Panc‑1 CSCs; and decreased the EMT phenotype. Collectively, GPX4 plays a critical role in maintaining oxidative homeostasis and regulates several biological processes, including stemness and EMT, in Panc‑1 CSCs.",MicroRNA‑363‑3p inhibits hepatocarcinogenesis by targeting HMGA2 and is associated with liver cancer stage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535489,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 28,"The importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer development has been widely recognized in recent decades. In the present study, the function and mechanism of miRNA‑363‑3p (miR‑363‑3p), formerly characterized as a tumor suppressor, in the hepatocarcinogenesis of liver cancer cells was investigated. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was applied to detect the expression of miR‑363‑3p in liver cancer tissues. Cell proliferation, survival and migration capacities were determined by MTT, colony formation and wound‑healing assays, respectively. The targeting of high mobility group AT‑hook 2 (HMGA2) mRNA by miR‑363‑3p was confirmed by bioinformatics analysis, and RT‑qPCR, luciferase reporter and western blot assays. The correlation between the expression levels of HMGA2 and miR‑363‑3p was analyzed. The RT‑qPCR results revealed that the levels of miR‑363‑3p were downregulated in liver cancer tissues. Cellular assays validated that miR‑363‑3p exerted tumor suppressing functions, including the inhibition of cell proliferation, survival and migration abilities in two liver cancer cell lines. Bioinformatics prediction and subsequent experiments demonstrated that HMGA2 was a direct target of miR‑363‑3p. Restoration of the expression of HMGA2 in miR‑363‑3p mimic‑transfected cells reversed the tumor suppressing effects caused by miR‑363‑3p. Finally, there was a significant negative correlation between the expression levels of HMGA2 and miR‑363‑3p in liver cancer tissues. miR‑363‑3p was identified as an important tumor suppressor in liver cancer via targeting HMGA2, which may have potential benefits in liver cancer therapy.",Adipose extracellular matrix promotes skin wound healing by inducing the differentiation of adipose‑derived stem cells into fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535488,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 05 20,"Fibroblasts are the major effector cells of skin wound healing. Adipose‑derived stem cells can differentiate into fibroblasts under certain conditions. In the present study, it was hypothesized that adipose‑derived stem cells (ADSCs) could be induced by the adipose extracellular matrix (ECM) to differentiate into fibroblasts in order to promote skin wound healing. First, flow cytometry was used to detect the ratio of fibroblasts and relative expression of the fibroblast markers cytokeratin 19 (CK19) and vimentin in ADSCs. Then, the effect of the adipose ECM during the differentiation of ADSCs into fibroblasts was investigated by detecting the total amount of collagen fibers and degree of fibrosis, and the proliferation and cell cycle of differentiated fibroblasts, using the MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis respectively. Finally, a mouse skin wound model was established and treated with PBS, ADSC suspension or ECM + ADSCs to compare wound healing rate and expression of collagen I and collagen III by immunohistochemistry. Following induction of ADSCs with the adipose ECM, more fibroblasts were found, expression of CK19 and vimentin increased, and a greater degree of fibrosis occurred, which revealed the positive effect of the adipose ECM on the differentiation of ADSCs into fibroblasts. In addition, the induced fibroblasts had enhanced proliferation activity, with more cells in the S phase and fewer in the G2/M phase. The in vivo experiment indicated that the ECM produced by the ADSCs had a faster wound healing rate and increased expression of collagen I and collagen III compared with mice injected with PBS or ADSCs alone, which verified that ADSCs induced by the adipose ECM had a positive effect on skin wound healing. The present study demonstrated that the adipose ECM in combination with ADSCs may be a novel therapeutic target for the repair of skin injury, due to the ability of the adipose ECM to induce the differentiation of ADSCs into fibroblasts and to facilitate the wound healing process.",Long non‑coding RNA DANCR promotes HMGA2‑mediated invasion in lung adenocarcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535487,Oncology reports,2019 02 15,"Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to be key regulators in various types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). The roles of the lncRNA differentiation antagonizing non‑protein coding RNA (DANCR) and high mobility group AT‑hook 2 (HMGA2) in LAD remain unclear. In the present study, it was revealed that the lncRNA DANCR was upregulated in LAD tissue and cell lines, compared with para‑tumor tissue and a normal lung cell line. Additionally, elevated DANCR expression was associated with poor prognosis in the patients with LAD. Functionally, the study revealed that knockdown of DANCR inhibited invasion and HMGA2 expression in the LAD cell lines, SPCA1 and A549. Furthermore, HMGA2 was overexpressed in LAD tissue and in SPCA1 and A549 cells, compared with para‑tumor tissue and a normal lung cell line. Inhibition of HMGA2 suppressed the invasive ability of SPCA1 and A549 cells, and DANCR promoted the invasive ability via regulation of HMGA2 in SPCA1 and A549 cells. The findings of the present study revealed that DANCR promoted the invasion of LAD cells by positively regulating HMGA2. Thus, a DANCR/HMGA2 axis may be a novel potential target in the molecular treatment of LAD.",Intranasal instillation of miR‑410 targeting IL‑4/IL‑13 attenuates airway inflammation in OVA‑induced asthmatic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535486,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 28,"Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory respiratory disease characterised by airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness. The present study was designed to clarify the effect of intranasal miR‑410 administration in an ovalbumin (OVA)‑induced murine model of asthma. It was found that miR‑410 expression was significantly decreased in the lungs of OVA‑induced asthmatic mice (P<0.05) and miR‑410 was overexpressed via intranasal instillation. Bioinformatics indicated that the 3'‑untranslated regions of interleukin (IL)‑4 and IL‑13 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) contain miR‑410 binding sites. The IL‑4 and IL‑13 genes were confirmed to be miR‑410‑regulated using the dual‑luciferase reporter assay. Additionally, intranasal administration of miR‑410 markedly attenuated airway inflammation and reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (P<0.05) as determined by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis. Moreover, miR‑410 significantly decreased the lung expression of IL‑4 and IL‑13 (P<0.05), although the levels of mRNAs encoding IL‑4 and IL‑13 in lungs did not change significantly as determined by real‑time PCR analysis. In conclusion, we found that intranasal administration of miR‑410 effectively inhibited airway inflammation in OVA‑induced asthmatic mice by targeting IL‑4 and IL‑13 at the post‑transcriptional level. miR‑410 is thus a promising treatment for allergic asthma.",Overexpression of ID1 promotes tumor progression in penile squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535485,Oncology reports,2019 02 15,"Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) occurs more frequently in developing countries, and is commonly diagnosed at an advanced stage with an unfavorable prognosis. At present, few biomarkers for PSCC have been identified and used in clinical practice. Aberrant expression of inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) has been suggested as a potential regulator of tumor progression in various types cancer. Herein, we evaluated ID1 expression in PSCC and analyzed its association with the clinicopathological parameters of PSCC. Our findings indicated that ID1 overexpression is associated with histological subtype and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis showed that the overexpression of ID1 is associated with unfavorable cancer‑specific survival. In Cox proportional hazard models, ID1 overexpression was found to be an independent predictor of cancer‑specific survival. Furthermore, we investigated the function of ID1 in PSCC using a PSCC cell line Penl1. Silencing of ID1 expression retarded cell growth, inhibited clonogenesis, and attenuated cell migration and invasion in Penl1 cells. ID1 may regulate key oncogenic and metastasis‑related molecules, as depletion of ID1 expression affected the levels of p‑AKT, p16, PTEN and cleaved caspase‑3, and reduced MMP2/9 secretion in Penl1 cells. Nevertheless, the mRNA expression of p16 and PTEN increased following ID1 knockdown, suggesting that ID1 may repress p16 and PTEN expression in Penl1 cells. Therefore, overexpression of ID1 could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for the clinical management of PSCC. Strategies targeting ID1‑regulated signaling pathways may have therapeutic benefit in PSCC.",Wnt/β‑catenin inhibition reverses multidrug resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535484,Oncology reports,2018 12 20,"Although ~80% of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) become disease‑free following appropriate treatment, relapses frequently occur, with dismal prognosis. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel therapeutic modalities. Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the treatment of relapsed ALL. It has been indicated that Wnt pathway is potentially associated with leukemia recurrence. In the current study, a vincristine (VCR)‑resistant variant of the human ALL cell line BALL‑1 (BALL‑1/VCR) that also had relatively specific resistance to both doxorubicin and etoposide was generated. Over‑activation of the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway was observed in BALL‑1/VCR cells, whereas Dickkopf‑related protein 1 selectively suppressed the Wnt signaling pathway and sensitized the response of BALL‑1/VCR to anticancer agents. In addition, prednisolone exposure in combination with Wnt inhibition restored chemo‑sensitivity in relapsed ALL blasts. Since the resistance of BALL‑1/VCR cells is potentially attributed to the overexpression of MDR‑associated protein 1 (MRP1), the development of drug resistance in relapsed ALL may associated with the overexpression of MRP1 and P‑glycoprotein. The results of this study demonstrated that, as a potential candidate to mimic relapsed ALL, BALL‑1/VCR could be used in further research, while Wnt‑inhibition may become a promising therapeutic approach for treating ALL.","Salvianolic acid B, an antioxidant derived from Salvia militarize, protects mice against γ‑radiation‑induced damage through Nrf2/Bach1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535483,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 28,"Salvianolic acid B (SB) is an antioxidant derived from Salvia militarize, and is one of the most widely used herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. SB is a potent antioxidant that has been well documented as a scavenger of oxygen free radicals, and has been used for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis‑associated disorders. To explore its potential therapeutic effects in treating radiation damage, in this study, mice were treated with SB at different doses of 5, 12.5 and 20 mg/kg, subsequent to receiving γ‑irradiation. The effects of SB on peripheral blood, bone marrow nucleated cells, spleen and thymus indices, and oxidation resistance were evaluated in both radiated mice and control groups. The results indicated that SB significantly increased the counts of peripheral white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets. The number of nucleated cells in the bone marrow and the level of protein increased as well. In addition, improved spleen and thymus indices in the bone marrow were observed. SB treatment additionally reversed the deterioration of both the thymus and spleen indices, which is associated with increased serum superoxide dismutase activity and decreasing malondialdehyde levels via nuclear factor (erythroid‑derived 2)‑like 2 protein/BTB and CNC homology 1 mediated antioxidant effect. Furthermore, ROS levels and Bax protein expression were also suppressed by SB. The data suggested that SB is effective in protecting mice from γ‑radiation injury, and could potentially be applicable for clinical use. Notably, the present study identified a promising candidate drug for enhancing the hematopoietic and immune systems.",Melatonin attenuates renal fibrosis in diabetic mice by activating the AMPK/PGC1α signaling pathway and rescuing mitochondrial function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535482,Molecular medicine reports,2019 05 28,"Mitochondrial homeostasis is a highly regulated process that serves a critical role in the maintenance of renal structure and function. The growing interest in the field of mitochondrial homeostasis promises to provide more information regarding the mechanisms involved in diabetic renal fibrosis, and aid in the development of novel strategies to combat the disease. In the present study, the effects of melatonin on renal damage in mice with diabetes were evaluated and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Cellular apoptosis was determined using TUNEL assay and western blotting. Mitochondrial function was measured using fluorescence assay and western blotting. The results indicated that diabetic renal fibrosis was associated with 5'adenosine monophosphate‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) downregulation. However, melatonin administration rescued AMPK activity, reduced diabetic renal fibrosis, alleviated glomerular apoptosis and preserved kidney function. The functional experiments demonstrated that melatonin‑induced AMPK activation enhanced peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor γ coactivator 1‑α (PGC1α) expression, sustained mitochondrial function and blocked mitochondrial apoptosis, leading to protection of the glomerulus against glucotoxicity. However, loss of AMPK and PGC1α negated the protective effects of melatonin on mitochondrial homeostasis, glomerular survival and diabetic renal fibrosis. In summary, the present study revealed that melatonin rescued impaired mitochondrial function and reduced glomerular apoptosis in the context of diabetic renal fibrosis by activating the AMPK/PGC1α pathway.",Astragaloside IV promotes the proliferation and migration of osteoblast-like cells through the hedgehog signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535481,International journal of molecular medicine,2019 05 03,"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of astragaloside IV on osteoblast‑like cell proliferation and migration, in addition to the underlying signaling pathway. In order to observe the effect on proliferation, a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and flow cytometry were used. To detect cell migration ability, cell scratch and Transwell cell migration assays were performed. The RNA and protein expression levels of hedgehog signaling molecules, including Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), were examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. To inhibit the hedgehog signaling pathway, cyclopamine was used. Astragaloside IV, at a dosage of 1x10‑2 µg/ml in MG‑63 cells and 1x10‑3 µg/ml in U‑2OS cells, resulted in the enhanced proliferation and migration of cells, and the gene expression levels of the SHH and GLI1 were significantly increased. The combination of astragaloside IV and cyclopamine reduced MG‑63 and U‑2OS cell proliferation and migration, and inhibited the gene expression of SHH and GLI1. Astragaloside IV enhanced the proliferation and migration of human osteoblast‑like cells through activating the hedgehog signaling pathway. The results of the present study provide a rational for the mechanistic link in astragaloside IV promoting the proliferation and migration of osteoblasts via the hedgehog signaling pathway."
