Structurally, Rb is a very large, multifunctional protein organized in different domains connected by intrinsically disordered regions. Due to the complex structure of Rb, biochemical manipulation is difficult. The Rb protein has been implicated in many different cellular processes, such as the cell cycle control, senescence and even apoptosis. The activity of Rb is regulated by phosphorylation, and many different sites of phosphorylation have been described. However, the oncoprotein HDM2, can promote Rb degradation by the proteasome. This form of Rb regulation is largely unknown. Here we report the expression and purification of the full-length Rb protein and its phosphomimetic form, Rb(S567D), in a recombinant system. We also produced and purified the HDM2 protein and its phosphomimetic mutant, HDM2(S395D). The proteins interacted strongly when we used the phosphomimetic mutants, mimicking damaged DNA conditions. The expression of the proteins in E. coli allowed us to control the phosphorylation status of the proteins."

This study was designed to elucidate the comparative efficacy of white tea and pure EGCG in containing benzo (a) pyrene (BaP)-induced pulmonary stress. Rats were treated with white tea extract (WT) (1%) and pure EGCG at a dose of 80μg/ml in drinking water on alternate days for 12 weeks (4 weeks prior, during and after BaP treatment). BaP(50 mg/kg b. wt) was administered to rats orally in olive oil twice a week for four weeks. The indices such as stress biomarkers (LPO, PCC & ROS), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH, GST, GR, GPx) activities and lung histoarchitecture were assessed. BaP administration enhanced the levels of inflammatory markers (NO and citrulline) and reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes. We observed similar antioxidant efficacy by both WT and EGCG as seen by their ameliorative action in restoring BaP induced oxidative and inflammatory stress as well as lung histoarchitecture. Our findings suggest that WT is equally beneficial as EGCG in maintaining the integrity of alveoli and is a potential candidate to be used as a cost effective and protective agent in conditions of BaP-induced lung damage.",Prediction of the skin permeability of topical drugs using in silico and in vitro models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163216,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 06 16,"The main challenge of topically applied drugs is to overcome the skin barrier to reach the site of action at the concentration needed for efficacy. In the research of new topical drugs, design of molecules with optimized properties for skin penetration is a key factor and assays for its characterization are needed. A group of 20 representative topical molecules of clinical use were studied in two in silico models (Potts & Guy and Barratt), and an in vitro assay with artificial membrane (Skin-PAMPA). A subset of 9 drugs were also evaluated in the Franz cells assay, formulated in a solvent and in a marketed formulation. Each assay allowed us to grade compounds according to their permeability value. Globally good alignments were found for the studied compounds when comparing models, although discrepancies for some compounds such as tazarotene, tacrolimus, ketoconazole and metronidazole were observed. Overall, the studied in silico and the in vitro models are useful tools to support selection and characterization of research compounds in terms of skin permeability.",Inhibition of human cytochrome P450 2A6 by 7-hydroxycoumarin analogues: Analysis of the structure-activity relationship and isoform selectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163215,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 06 04,"Compared with coumarin, 7-hydroxycoumarin could serve as a better hit for developing CYP2A6 inhibitors. In this study, a series of 7-hydroxycoumarin and its structural analogues were collected to study their structure-activity relationship (SAR) and isoform selectivity for inhibiting CYP2A6. All tested coumarins except a C4 phenyl derivative (11) showed higher inhibitory activities for CYP2A6 over the other CYP isoforms, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9. Of these coumarins, 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin (1) and 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin (9) were found to be potent inhibitors of CYP2A6 with IC50/Ki value of 0.39/0.25 and 4.61/3.02 μM, respectively, compared to methoxalen as positive control (IC50/Ki = 0.43/0.26 μM). In contrast, other coumarins showed low or decreased CYP2A6-inhibiting activities. SAR analysis showed that hydroxy groups might be important for CYP2A6 inhibition, and the rank order of sites for hydroxy substitution was C6 > C7 > C8. In addition, either hydrophobic or hydrophilic substituents introduced into C4, C6 and C8 led to a reduction in CYP2A6-inhibiting activity, and the degree of influence was dependent on the size and electrical charge of substituents. Furthermore, inhibition kinetic analysis and docking simulations demonstrated that the 8-O-glucosylated coumarin derivative (17) exhibited noncompetitive inhibition against CYP2A6, while competitive inhibition patterns were noted for the other tested coumarins. The mechanisms underlying the inhibitors binding to CYP2A6 were further investigated by molecular docking study. The findings presented herein are very helpful for developing highly selective and more potent CYP2A6 inhibitors.",Effects of SSRIs on peripheral inflammatory cytokines in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163212,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 06 07,"Extensive research into psychoneuroimmunology has led to substantial advances in our understanding of the reciprocal interactions between the central nervous system and the immune system in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Here, we have characterized the conformational dynamics of ErbB transmembrane homo-dimers and hetero-dimers by using a coarse-grain simulation framework. All dimers, except ErbB4-4 and ErbB1-4, exhibit at least two conformations. The reported NMR structures correspond to one of these conformations, representing the N-terminal active state in ErbB1-1 (RH2), ErbB2-2 (RH1) and ErbB4-4 (RH) homo-dimers and the LH dimer in ErbB3-3 homo-dimer, validating the computational approach. Further, we predict a right-handed ErbB3-3 dimer conformer that warrants experimental testing. The five hetero-dimers that have not yet been experimentally resolved display prominent right-handed dimers associating by the SmXXXSm motif. Our results provide insights into the constitutive signaling of ErbB4 after cleavage of the extracellular region. The presence of the inactive-like dimer conformers leading to symmetric kinase domains gives clues on the autoinhibition of the receptor dimers. The dimer states characterized here represent an important step towards understanding the combinatorial cross associations in the ErbB family.",M100907 and BD 1047 attenuate the acute toxic effects of methamphetamine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163210,Neurotoxicology,2019 06 15,"There are no Food and Drug Administration approved pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine (METH) overdose, thus identifying novel drug targets to prevent this devastating adverse event is a public-health imperative. Previous research suggests that serotonin and sigma receptors may contribute to the adverse effects of METH. The present study assessed whether pretreatment with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 or the sigma 1 (σ1) receptor antagonist BD 1047 attenuated METH-induced lethality, hyperthermia, convulsions, and seizures. Male, Swiss-Webster mice received intraperitoneal injections of M100907 (1 and 10 mg/kg), BD 1047 (10 mg/kg), or a combination of M100907 (1 mg/kg) and BD 1047 (10 mg/kg) prior to treatment with METH (78 mg/kg). Convulsions and lethality were assessed by observation, core body temperature was assessed by surgically implanted telemetric probes, and seizures were assessed by electroencephalography. M100907 reduced METH-elicited lethality from 67% to 33%, BD1047 reduced METH-elicited lethality from 67% to 50%, and combined administration of both agents eliminated lethality in all mice tested. Similarly, both agents and their combination reduced METH-elicited seizures and convulsions. None of the treatments decreased METH-induced hyperthermia. This research suggests that reducing METH-induced seizures is an important factor in reducing lethality associated with METH overdose. However, future studies should examine whether M100907 and BD 1047 modulate METH-induced hypertension and other adverse effects that may also contribute to METH overdose. Our data support the continued investigation of compounds that target 5-HT2A and σ1 receptors in METH-induced overdose, including their potential to yield emergency reversal agents.",FBN1 gene mutations in 26 Hungarian patients with suspected Marfan syndrome or related fibrillinopathies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163209,Journal of biotechnology,2019 06 04,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder mainly affecting the cardiovascular, ocular and musculo-skeletal systems. FBN1 gene mutations lead to MFS and related connective tissue disorders. In this work we described clinical and molecular data of 26 unrelated individuals with suspected MFS who were referred for FBN1 mutation analysis. FBN1 gene sequencing was performed by next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing methods. We identified 23 causal or potentially causal (including variants of uncertain significance) FBN1 variants, seven of them was novel (˜30%). About 30% of the cases were sporadic. FBN1 mutations were associated with MFS in the majority of the patients, in two cases with severe and early onset manifestation of the syndrome. Missense mutations were detected in 69.6% (16/23), the majority of them were located in one of the cbEGF motifs and ˜70% of them substituted conserved cystein residues. Small deletions/duplications were identified in 13% of the cases (3/23), while splice site variants were detected in 17.4% (4/23). In three unrelated patients a low frequency recurrent silent variant (c.3294C > T (p.Asp1098=) was identified. FBN1 mRNA analysis showed that the mutation does not lead to aberrant splicing, based on available data the mutation was classified as benign.","WITHDRAWN: Corrigendum to ""Biomarkers of cadmium, lead and mercury exposure in relation with early biomarkers of renal dysfunction and diabetes: Results from a pilot study among aging Canadian"" [Toxicol.

Stress is also associated with alterations in central nervous system astrocytes and oligodendrocytes that involve connexins and myelin proteins. Corticosteroid elevation seems a major factor in stress-induced neuropathology. Changes in astrocyte connexins and myelin components may be important mediators for the neurological effects of corticosteroid elevations. Two primary cell culture models, myelination culture from rat embryonic spinal cord (SC) or cerebral cortex (CC) consisting of neurons and glial cells (oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes), and mixed astrocyte-and-oligodendrocyte culture prepared from postnatal rat CC, were used in this study. Cell cultures were treated with either vehicle, corticosterone (CORT) with or without glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone, or dexamethasone (DEX) during the period of in vitro myelination. Immunoreactivity of astrocyte connexin 43 (Cx43) and oligodendrocyte myelin basic protein (MBP), or the myelination index (co-localization of MBP and phosphorylated neurofilament) was determined by double immunofluorescent labeling. Oligodendrocyte morphology was evaluated by Sholl analysis. Prolonged exposure to CORT or DEX induced dose-dependent reduction of the myelination index, and immunostaining for MBP and Cx43 in SC and CC myelination cultures, which was prevented by mifepristone. In glial cultures single CORT or DEX exposure caused shrinkage and simplification in MBP- or CNPase-positive oligodendrocyte processes. The results support that concurrent effects of glucocorticoids on myelination and astrocyte Cx43 immunoreactivity are mediated by glucocorticoid receptors and may partially account for the involvement of CNS glia in the pathological effects of prolonged stress.",Understanding the link between childhood trauma and schizophrenia: a systematic review of neuroimaging studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163206,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 06 04,"Increasing evidence suggests that childhood trauma (CT) is a major risk factor for schizophrenia but the underpinning mechanisms of their association remain unclear. Our aim is to review the literature on the association between CT and brain imaging measurements in adult schizophrenia subjects. We conducted a systematic review of the existing neuroimaging literature on CT and schizophrenia. We reviewed studies considering adult subjects with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or first episode schizophrenia. A total of 15 studies were included. The most replicated result was the association in schizophrenia patients between CT and decreased total cerebral grey matter, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, studies suggest a different sensitivity to early stressors between schizophrenia subjects, their sibling and healthy unrelated subjects. In schizophrenia, CT is associated with alterations of white matter integrity in the inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the forceps major. Functional connectivity studies suggest an association between CT and a network including the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex, the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex region and the temporo-parietal junction."

In the present study, we employed a miR-16-responsive luciferase reporter to screen candidate compounds that modulate miR-16 expression from a natural product library. One compound, sanguinarine (SG), was capable of activating miR-16 in HCC cells with wildtype or mutated p53 expression but not in p53-deleted HCC cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SG increased p53 occupancy on the miR-16-2 promoter and decreased the expression of miR-16 target genes, including Bcl-2 and cyclin D1. Moreover, SG significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner by inducing cell cycle arrest and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated apoptosis. Silencing miR-16 by treatment with anti-miR16 miRNA inhibitors rescued the cell viability repression effect caused by SG. Importantly, SG dramatically suppressed tumor growth in an HCC xenograft model, with little cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results provide a preclinical proof-of-concept for SG as a potential strategy for HCC treatment based on the restoration of miR-16 tumor suppressor function.",Sequence diverse miRNAs converge to induce mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in ovarian cancer cells through direct and indirect regulatory controls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163194,Cancer letters,2019 06 16,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been shown to be similarly regulated by multiple miRNAs, some displaying little or no sequence identity. While alternate models have been proposed to explain the functional convergence of sequence divergent miRNAs, little experimental evidence exists to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. Representative members of the miR-200 family of miRNAs and the sequence divergent miR-205 miRNA were independently over expressed in mesenchymal-like ovarian cancer (OC) cells resulting in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). The miR-205 and the miR-200 family of miRNAs were found to coordinately induce MET in mesenchymal-like OC cells by affecting both direct and indirect changes in the expression of genes previously associated with EMT/MET. Only two direct targets of these miRNAs (ZEB 1 and WNT5A) are commonly down regulated in response to over-expression of miR-205 and/or the miR-200 family of miRNAs. Down-regulation of these genes, alone or in combination, only partially recapitulates the changes induced by the miRNAs indicating an additional contribution of indirect changes regulated by the miRNAs. Combined gene expression analyses and phylogenetic comparisons suggest an evolutionarily more recent involvement of miR-205 in the EMT/MET process.",Parametric investigation of static and dynamic cell culture conditions and their impact on hCMEC/D3 barrier properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163193,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 16,"In brain research, the hCMEC/D3 cell line is widely used for the establishment of a human in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model. However, its barrier integrity seems to be insufficient for drug permeability studies, represented by rather low transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and high permeability of small molecules. Therefore, this study covers a parametric investigation of static and dynamic cell culture conditions to improve barrier functionality of hCMEC/D3. The effect of basal media was investigated by analyzing changes in proliferation rate, barrier integrity and gene expression of cellular junction proteins. The cells were able to grow in different cell culture media, including serum-free media. However, none of these media enhanced strongly the growth rate or barrier integrity compared to the microvascular endothelial cell growth medium-2 (EGM™-2 MV). Furthermore, hCMEC/D3 cells did not respond positively regarding TEER to any tested parameter neither supplements, coating materials nor co-cultures with the human immortalized astrocyte cell line SVGmm. Furthermore, the impact of dynamic conditions was examined by using the Dynamic Micro Tissue Engineering System (DynaMiTES). Cultivation conditions were successfully adapted to the DynaMiTES design and no negative effect was detected by analyzing cell viability and cell count, albeit TEER remained also unchanged. Consequently, the hCMEC/D3 model has considerable limitations and further improvements or alternative cell lines are required.",Estrogen receptor α and β gene polymorphism in relation to bone mineral density and lipid profile in Northeast Indian women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163192,Gene,2019 06 16,"Estrogen regulates bone homeostasis and has a cardio-protective effect. Its physiological functions are mediated through receptors (ER) whose expression can be regulated by presence or absence of polymorphisms. However, the association between ER polymorphisms and BMD as well as lipids are inconsistent. The aim of the study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in ESR are associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and lipids in a cohort of Indian women. We studied PvuII, XbaI polymorphisms in ESR1 and AluI, RsaI polymorphisms in ESR2 genes and their association with bone mineral density (BMD) and lipids in premenopausal (n = 293, mean age: 33.01 ± 5.23 years) and postmenopausal (n = 145, mean age: 56.91 ± 7.1 years) women from Northeast India. AluI and RsaI polymorphisms in ESR2 gene were associated with BMD in postmenopausal women. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, BMI, tobacco and alcohol consumption revealed that xx genotype in XbaI polymorphism is associated with osteopenia at spine (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.067-10.204) in postmenopausal women suggesting that allele X is protective (OR = 0.419, 95% CI = 0.177-0.991).

Translational biomarkers are needed that can both validate these models and facilitate behavioral testing paradigms for ASD in humans. Automated video tracking of movement patterns and positions recorded from overhead cameras is routinely applied in behavioral paradigms designed to elicit core behavioral manifestations of ASD in rodent models. In humans, laboratory-based observations are a common semi-naturalistic context for assessing a variety of behaviors relevant to ASD such as social engagement, play, and attention. We present information learned and suggest guidelines for designing, recording, acquiring, and evaluating video tracking data of human movement patterns based on our experience in a multi-site video tracking study of children with ASD in the context of a parent-child, laboratory-based play interaction.",Interoceptive awareness mitigates deficits in emotional prosody recognition in Autism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163190,Biological psychology,2019 06 04,"The sensing of internal bodily signals, a process known as interoception, contributes to subjective emotional feeling states that can guide empathic understanding of the emotions of others. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) typically show an attenuated intuitive capacity to recognise and interpret other peoples' emotional signals. Here we test directly if differences in interoceptive processing relate to the ability to perceive emotional signals from the intonation of speech (affective prosody) in ASC adults. We employed a novel prosody paradigm to compare emotional prosody recognition in ASC individuals and a group of neurotypical controls. Then, in a larger group of ASC individuals, we tested how recognition of affective prosody related to objective, subjective and metacognitive (awareness) psychological dimensions of interoception. ASC individuals showed reduced recognition of affective prosody compared to controls. Deficits in performance on the prosody task were mitigated by greater interoceptive awareness, so that ASC individuals were better able to judge the prosodic emotion if they had better insight into their own interoceptive abilities. This data links the ability to access interoceptive representations consciously to the recognition of emotional expression in others, suggesting a crossmodal target for interventions to enhance interpersonal skills.",Shape-appearance constrained segmentation and separation of vein and artery in pulsatile tinnitus patients based on MR angiography and flow MRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163188,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 06 15,"This study reports on the development and evaluation of a novel segmentation method for extracting the internal jugular vein and the adjacent carotid artery from magnetic resonance (MR) images of patients with pulsatile tinnitus. A narrow band level set method with combined shape and appearance constraints was developed and applied to high-resolution MR images from 17 pulsatile tinnitus patients (age 52 ± 23 years, 10 females). The proposed method was validated by comparing with the manual segmentation as well as by identifying the jugular vein and carotid artery based on 4D flow MRI in which the two types of vessels have opposing flow. Our study showed that the vein and artery are in contact with each other on 30.2% of all the slices. Dice value, Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), Hausdorff distance and mean sum of square distance (MSSD) between automatic and manual segmentation were 89.13 ± 2.84%, 27.36 ± 2.39%, 17.2 ± 6.9 mm, 7.4 ± 5.5 mm, demonstrating good segmentation accuracy. The average Dice similarity coefficient and the coefficient of variation compared with 4D flow MRI was 91.42 ± 1.63% and 89.28 ± 4.54% for the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery. The present pipeline for automatic internal jugular vein quantification holds promise for efficient image interpretation in large-scale cohort studies.",Understanding the influence of nanocarrier-mediated brain delivery on therapeutic performance through pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163187,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 04,"This study aimed at evaluating how encapsulation in a regular nanocarrier (NC) (providing extended circulation time), or in a brain-targeting NC (providing prolonged circulation time and increased brain uptake) may influence the therapeutic index compared to unformulated drug, and to explore the key parameters affecting therapeutic performance using a model-based approach. Pharmacokinetic (PK) models were built with chosen PK parameters. For a scenario where central effect depends on area under the unbound brain concentration curve and peripheral toxicity relates to peak unbound plasma concentration, dose-effect/side effect curves were constructed and the therapeutic index was evaluated. Regular NC improved the therapeutic index compared to unformulated drug due to reduced peripheral toxicity, while brain-targeting NC enhanced the therapeutic index by lowering peripheral toxicity and increasing central effect. Decreasing the drug release rate or systemic clearance of NC with drug still encapsulated could increase the therapeutic index. Also, a drug with shorter half-life would therapeutically benefit more from a NC encapsulation. This work provides insights into how a NC for brain delivery should be optimized to maximize the therapeutic performance, and is helpful to predict if and to what extent a drug with certain PK properties would obtain therapeutic benefit from nanoencapsulation.",Some Preformulation Studies of Pyruvic Acid and Other α-Keto Carboxylic Acids in Aqueous Solution: Pharmaceutical Formulation Implications for These Peroxide Scavengers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163186,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 04,"The purpose of this study is to assess some of the variables determining the aldol-like condensation of pyruvic acid (1), a peroxide scavenger, in aqueous solution to parapyruvic acid and higher oligomers. Its stability is compared to three other α-keto carboxylic acids, two with sterically hindered methylene groups alpha to the keto functionality (2-3) and phenylglyoxylic acid (4) with no methylene group. High performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance and liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy techniques are used to follow the kinetics and product analyses. 1 condensation is concentration dependent and base catalyzed above pH 7 consistent with the reaction mechanism proceeding through the attack of the fraction of the methylene group, alpha to the keto group, in its anionic form, at the keto group of a second molecule of 1. The major product is confirmed to be parapyruvic acid but higher order oligomers are also observed. All three of the other α-keto carboxylic acids 2-4 are considerably less reactive with 4 being completely stable. Stable solutions of 1 can be prepared by the use of relatively dilute solutions maintained at slightly acidic pH values. 1 prevents the oxidation of methionine on addition of hydrogen peroxide.",Nilotinib alters the efflux transporter-mediated pharmacokinetics of afatinib in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163185,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 04,"Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are novel anticancer agents with enhanced selectivity and superior safety profiles than conventional chemotherapeutics. A major shortcoming in TKI therapy is the development of acquired resistance. An important resistance mechanism is reduced intracellular drug accumulation due to an overexpression of efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) in cancer cells. TKIs have dual roles as substrates and inhibitors of Pgp and BCRP, thus combination TKI therapy could potentially reverse efflux transporter-mediated TKI resistance. In the current study, the effect of 14 TKIs on Pgp-, Bcrp1- and BCRP- mediated afatinib efflux was investigated in-vitro. Nilotinib was a potent inhibitor of Pgp, Bcrp1 and BCRP, with EC50 values of 2.22, 2.47 and 0.692μM, respectively. Consequently, the pharmacokinetics of afatinib with and without the co-administration of nilotinib was determined in mice plasma and various tissues. Nilotinib increased afatinib AUC by 188% in plasma and this altered tissue AUC by -38.8 to +221%. Nilotinib also decreased the clearance of afatinib by 65.3%, from 609 to 211mL/hr. Further studies are warranted to assess nilotinib's chemosensitizing effect in tumor xenograft models."

Many traits have evolved based solely on their effects upon other community members, yet even individually beneficial traits often create social side effects that are mediated by spatial population structure. Predicting the evolution of many microbial traits thus requires a comprehensive understanding of their social consequences. In this review, we examine the critical role of population spatial structure in microbial social evolution. We briefly review key mechanisms structuring microbial communities, focusing primarily on the universal roles of cellular death and reproduction. Finally, we explain how spatial assortment can be efficiently calculated in two-dimensional, surface-attached populations.",Understanding Competition and Cooperation within the Mammalian Gut Microbiome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163167,Current biology : CB,2019 06 04,"The mammalian gut harbors a vast community of microorganisms - termed the microbiota - whose composition and dynamics are considered to be critical drivers of host health. These factors depend, in part, upon the manner in which microbes interact with one another. Microbes are known to engage in a myriad of different ways, ranging from unprovoked aggression to actively feeding each other. However, the relative extent to which these different interactions occur between microbes within the gut is unclear. In this minireview we assess our current knowledge of microbe-microbe interactions within the mammalian gut microbiota, and the array of methods used to uncover them. In particular, we highlight the discrepancies between different methodologies: some studies have revealed rich networks of cross-feeding interactions between microbes, whereas others suggest that microbes are more typically locked in conflict and actively cooperate only rarely. We argue that to reconcile these contradictions we must recognize that interactions between members of the microbiota can vary across condition, space, and time - and that only through embracing this dynamism will we be able to comprehensively understand the ecology of our gut communities.",The Evolution and Ecology of Bacterial Warfare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163166,Current biology : CB,2019 06 04,"Bacteria have evolved a wide range of mechanisms to harm and kill their competitors, including chemical, mechanical and biological weapons. Here we review the incredible diversity of bacterial weapon systems, which comprise antibiotics, toxic proteins, mechanical weapons that stab and pierce, viruses, and more. The evolution of bacterial weapons is shaped by many factors, including cell density and nutrient abundance, and how strains are arranged in space. Bacteria also employ a diverse range of combat behaviours, including pre-emptive attacks, suicidal attacks, and reciprocation (tit-for-tat). However, why bacteria carry so many weapons, and why they are so often used, remains poorly understood. By comparison with animals, we argue that the way that bacteria live - often in dense and genetically diverse communities - is likely to be key to their aggression as it encourages them to dig in and fight alongside their clonemates. The intensity of bacterial aggression is such that it can strongly affect communities, via complex coevolutionary and eco-evolutionary dynamics, which influence species over space and time. Bacterial warfare is a fascinating topic for ecology and evolution, as well as one of increasing relevance. Understanding how bacteria win wars is important for the goal of manipulating the human microbiome and other important microbial systems.",Fertility Costs of Meiotic Drivers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163165,Current biology : CB,2019 06 04,"In sexual reproduction, opportunities are limited and the stakes are high. This inevitably leads to conflict. One pervasive conflict occurs within genomes between alternative alleles at heterozygous loci. Each gamete and thus each offspring will inherit only one of the two alleles from a heterozygous parent. Most alleles 'play fair' and have a 50% chance of being included in any given gamete. However, alleles can gain an enormous advantage if they act selfishly to force their own transmission into more than half, sometimes even all, of the functional gametes. These selfish alleles are known as 'meiotic drivers', and their cheating often incurs a high cost on the fertility of eukaryotes ranging from plants to mammals. Here, we review how several types of meiotic drivers directly and indirectly contribute to infertility, and argue that a complete picture of the genetics of infertility will require focusing on both the standard alleles - those that play fair - as well as selfish alleles involved in genetic conflict.",Selfish Mitonuclear Conflict.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163164,Current biology : CB,2019 06 04,"Mitochondria, a nearly ubiquitous feature of eukaryotes, are derived from an ancient symbiosis. Despite billions of years of cooperative coevolution - in what is arguably the most important mutualism in the history of life - the persistence of mitochondrial genomes also creates conditions for genetic conflict with the nucleus. Because mitochondrial genomes are present in numerous copies per cell, they are subject to both within- and among-organism levels of selection. Accordingly, 'selfish' genotypes that increase their own proliferation can rise to high frequencies even if they decrease organismal fitness. It has been argued that uniparental (often maternal) inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes evolved to curtail such selfish replication by minimizing within-individual variation and, hence, within-individual selection. However, uniparental inheritance creates conditions for cytonuclear conflict over sex determination and sex ratio, as well as conditions for sexual antagonism when mitochondrial variants increase transmission by enhancing maternal fitness but have the side-effect of being harmful to males (i.e., 'mother's curse'). Here, we review recent advances in understanding selfish replication and sexual antagonism in the evolution of mitochondrial genomes and the mechanisms that suppress selfish interactions, drawing parallels and contrasts with other organelles (plastids) and bacterial endosymbionts that arose more recently. Although cytonuclear conflict is widespread across eukaryotes, it can be cryptic due to nuclear suppression, highly variable, and lineage-specific, reflecting the diverse biology of eukaryotes and the varying architectures of their cytoplasmic genomes.",The Life of an Insect Endosymbiont from the Cradle to the Grave.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163163,Current biology : CB,2019 06 04,"Host-beneficial endosymbioses, which are formed when a microorganism takes up residence inside another cell and provides a fitness advantage to the host, have had a dramatic influence on the evolution of life. These intimate relationships have yielded the mitochondrion and the plastid (chloroplast) - the ancient organelles that in part define eukaryotic life - along with many more recent associations involving a wide variety of hosts and microbial partners. These relationships are often envisioned as stable associations that appear cooperative and persist for extremely long periods of time. But recent evidence suggests that this stable state is often born from turbulent and conflicting origins, and that the apparent stability of many beneficial endosymbiotic relationships - although certainly real in many cases - is not an inevitable outcome of these associations. Here we review how stable endosymbioses form, how they are maintained, and how they sometimes break down and are reborn. We focus on relationships formed by insects and their resident microorganisms because these symbioses have been the focus of significant empirical work over the last two decades. We review these relationships over five life stages: origin, birth, middle age, old age, and death."

To overcome these limitations, we used a γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, to disrupt Notch signaling and force proliferating retinal progenitor cells to rapidly adopt neuronal identity. We treated mouse retinal explants at the peak of cone genesis with DAPT and examined tissues at several time-points by histology and bulk RNA-sequencing. We found that this treatment caused supernumerary cone formation in an overwhelmingly synchronized fashion. This analysis revealed several categorical patterns of gene expression changes over time relative to DMSO treated control explants. These were placed in the temporal context of the activation of Otx2, a transcription factor that is expressed at the onset of photoreceptor development and that is required for both rod and cone formation. One group of interest had genes, such as Mybl1, Ascl1, Neurog2, and Olig2, that became upregulated by DAPT treatment before Otx2. Two other groups showed upregulated gene expression shortly after Otx2, either transiently or permanently. This included genes such as Mybl1, Meis2, and Podxl. Our data provide a developmental timeline of the gene expression events that underlie the initial steps of cone genesis and maturation. Applying this strategy to human retinal organoid cultures was also sufficient to induce a massive increase in cone genesis. Taken together, our results provide a temporal framework that can be used to elucidate the gene regulatory logic controlling cone photoreceptor development.",Hypoxia differentially regulates estrogen receptor alpha in 2D and 3D culture formats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163125,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,2019 06 15,"Hypoxia is a common feature in solid tumors. Clinical samples show a positive correlation between the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and a negative correlation between HIF-1α and hormone sensitivity. Results from monolayer cultures are in contention with clinical observations, showing that ER (+) cell lines no longer express ERα under hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Here, we compared the impact of hypoxia on the ERα signaling pathway for T47D cells in a 2D and 3D culture format. In the 2D format, the cells were cultured as monolayers. In the 3D format, paper-based scaffolds supported cells suspended in a collagen matrix. Using ELISA, Western blot, and immunofluorescence measurements, we show that hypoxia differentially regulates ERα protein levels in a culture environment-dependent manner. In the 2D format, the protein levels are significantly decreased in hypoxia. In the 3D format, the protein levels are maintained in hypoxia. Hypoxia reduced ERα transcriptional activation in both culture formats. These results highlight the importance of considering tissue dimensionality for in vitro studies. They also show that ERα protein levels in hypoxia are not an accurate indicator of ERα transcriptional activity, and confirm that a positive stain for ERα in a clinical sample may not necessarily indicate hormone sensitivity.",Effects of PPARs/20-HETE on the renal impairment under diabetic conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163124,Experimental cell research,2019 06 15,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus. The pathomolecular events behind DN remain uncertain. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play essential functions in the development of DN. Meanwhile, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) also plays central roles in the regulation of renal function. However, the relationship between PPARs and 20-HETE is rarely studied in DN. It was revealed in our study that both PPARs expression and CYP4A-20-HETE level were decreased under DN conditions in vivo and in vitro. Supplementation with bezafibrate, a PPAR pan-agonist, improved the damage of kidney in DN mice and in high glucose-induced NRK-52E cells, following the up-regulation of PPARs and the increase of CYP4A-20-HETE. PPARα antagonist (MK886), PPARβ antagonist (GSK0660), and PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) reversed the protection of bezafibrate in NRK-52E, and abrogated the up-regulation of CYP4A-20-HETE produced by bezafibrate. Noteworthily, 20-HETE synthetase inhibitor, HET0016, also blocked the bezafibrate-mediated improvement of NRK-52E, and abolished the up-regulation of PPARs expression. Collectively, our data suggest that the concurrent down-regulation and interaction of PPARs and 20-HETE play crucial roles in the pathogenesis process of DN, and we provide a novel evidence that PPARs/20-HETE signaling may be served as a therapeutic target for DN patients.",Application of lL-methionine-lyase in chiral amino acid analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163123,Analytical biochemistry,2019 06 04,"Here, a conventional chiral amino acid analysis method using high-performance liquid chromatography was coupled with a sample pretreatment using lL-methionine γ-lyase from Pseudomonas putida ICR 3460 for the selective analysis of lL-methionine and lL-tryptophan.

The lL-tryptophan in the sample was then eluted as a clearly separated peak and analyzed further. Since the lL-methionine γ-lyase did not act on lL-tryptophan, we were able to calculate the lL-methionine or lL-tryptophan concentration based on the data obtained from 2 individual runs: the sample with and without lL-methionine γ-lyase pretreatment. The concentration of lL-tryptophan was calculated from the data obtained from the sample with lL-methionine γ-lyase pretreatment, while the concentration of lL-methionine was calculated using the following equation: lL-methionine concentration = {the data from the sample without lL-methionine γ-lyase pretreatment}-{the data from the sample with lL-methionine γ-lyase pretreatment}. Model samples containing authentic amino acids and a fermented food sample were analyzed by our method, and the calculated concentrations of lL-methionine and lL-tryptophan were consistently in agreement with the theoretical values.","Collaborative patterns, authorship practices and scientific success in biomedical research: a network analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163118,Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,2019 06 04,To investigate the relationship between biomedical researchers' collaborative and authorship practices and scientific success.,Arterial stiffness and haemodynamic regulation in adolescent anorexia nervosa vs. obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163115,"Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme",2019 06 04,"Cardiovascular complications contribute to higher morbidity and mortality in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). We aimed to study biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in anorexic, normal-weight, and obese adolescents with focus on complex cardiovascular autonomic regulation and early arteriosclerotic damage. We examined 20 adolescent girls with AN, 20 obese girls, and 20 healthy normal-weight controls. Collected data: body composition analysis, 5 min recordings of RR-intervals and beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP), arterial stiffness index cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI). Evaluated parameters: beat-to-beat heart rate and BP variability, haemodynamic parameters (total peripheral resistance - TPR, cardiac output), CAVI, anthropometric indices including novel body roundness index (BRI). Adolescents with AN had increased CAVI associated with lower arterial constriction indexed by low-frequency band of BP variability (LnLF-BPV) compared to normal-weight peers (p=0.03, p=0.04, respectively) and obese adolescents (p<0.01, p=0.01, respectively). After normalisation of CAVI and TPR by BRI, the relationship between CAVI and TPR was significant for all groups with the highest slope in AN group (R2=0.724, p<0.01). This is the first study revealing early arteriosclerotic damage in anorexic girls with increased CAVI. Complex analysis of cardiovascular autonomic regulation, early arteriosclerotic, hemodynamic and anthropometric changes in spectrum anorexia nervosa - normal weight - obesity could help to understand the mechanisms of increased cardiovascular risk in malnutrition. Novelty: • Anorexic girls showed signs of early arteriosclerotic damage indexed by CAVI • Insufficient sympathetic cardiovascular control was found already in anorexic adolescents • The effect of body composition on CAVI was best predicted by novel body roundness index.",Parental Incarceration and Child Overweight: Results From a Sample of Disadvantaged Children in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163114,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2019 06 04,Rates of childhood obesity and parental incarceration have been increasing in the United States since the 1970s.

In this work, beliefs about whether or not sodium supplements should be made available at ultramarathons were assessed during 2018 among 1,152 participants of the Ultrarunners Longitudinal TRAcking (ULTRA) Study, of which 85.2% had completed an ultramarathon during 2014-2018. Two-thirds (66.4%) of study participants indicated that sodium supplements should be made available at ultramarathons, supported by beliefs that they prevent EAH (65.5%) and muscle cramping (59.1%). Of those indicating that sodium supplements should not be made available, 85.0% indicated it is because runners can provide their own, 27.9% indicated it is because they are not necessary, and 12.1% indicated they could increase thirst drive and cause overhydration. In general, there was a tendency for those who were older, less active in running ultramarathons in recent years, and with a longer history of ultramarathon running to be less likely to know that sodium supplements do not help prevent EAH, muscle cramping and nausea. Novelty: •Ultramarathon runners continue to have misunderstandings about the need for sodium supplementation during ultramarathons •Few ultramarathon runners recognize that supplementing sodium intake beyond that in food and drink is generally not necessary during ultramarathons or that it could result in overhydration •Continued educational efforts are warranted to help ensure safe participation in the sport."

Monometallic Fe (catalyst A) and Co (catalyst F) were also prepared along with mixed-metal Fe/Co catalysts (B-E) by changing Fe/Co ratio. For mixed-metal catalysts (B-E) SEM-EDX analysis confirmed the incorporation of both Fe and Co in the catalysts. However, a spindle-shaped morphology typically known for a Fe-MIL-88B structure and confirmed by PXRD analysis was only observed for catalysts A-D. To test the catalytic potential of mixed-metal MOFs, reduction of nitroarenes was selected as a benchmark reaction. Incorporation of Co enhanced the activity of the catalysts as compared to the parent NH2-BDC-Fe catalyst. These MOFs were also tested as electro-catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) with best activity exhibited by equimolar Fe/Co-MOF with a current density of 10 mA.cm-2 at 410 mV overpotential, which is comparable to the benchmark OER catalyst (i.e. RuO2). Moreover, it showed long-run stability in 1M KOH. In a third catalytic test, dehydrogenation of sodium borohydride showed high activity (TOF: 157/min) and hydrogen generation rate (121 L/min/g catalyst). This is the very first example of the synthesis of bimetallic MOFs as multifunctional catalysts particularly for catalytic reduction of nitroarenes and dehydrogenation reactions.",Association of Metformin Use With End-Stage Renal Disease in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Nationwide Cohort Study Under the Pay-for-Performance Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163098,Journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 06 04,"Animal studies have demonstrated that metformin exerts a renoprotective effect. Human studies of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) regarding the association of metformin use with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are lacking. Patients with type 2 DM and without a history of kidney disease who were enrolled under the pay-for-performance program of the National Health Insurance in Taiwan were identified. Those who received ≥90 cumulative defined daily doses of metformin within 1 year were selected (metformin users) and compared with a 1:1 propensity score-matched metformin nonuser cohort. Primary and secondary outcomes were development of ESRD and chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively. Independent predictors were investigated using Cox regression analysis. A total of 24 158 pairs of metformin users and nonusers were enrolled, with an incidence of ESRD of 1908 and 1723 and CKD of 1095 and 1056 cases per 100 000 person-years, respectively.

TcCGT1 could efficiently and regio-specifically catalyze 8-C-glycosylation of 36 flavones and other flavonoids, and could also catalyze the O-glycosylation of diverse phenolics. Moreover, the crystal structure of TcCGT1 in complex with uridine diphosphate was determined at 1.85 Å resolution. Structural analysis with molecular docking revealed a new model for catalytic mechanism of TcCGT1, which was initiated by substrate spontaneous deprotonation. The spacious binding pocket explains the robust substrate promiscuity, and binding pose of the substrate determines C- or O-glycosylation activity. Site-directed mutagenesis at two residues (I94E and G284K) switched C- to O-glycosylation. This work highlights TcCGT1 as the first plant CGT with a crystal structure and the first flavone 8-C-glycosyltransferase, and provides a basis for protein engineering to design efficient glycosylation biocatalysts for drug discovery.",Content validation of the Quality of Life Inventory - Disability (QI-Disability).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163096,"Child: care, health and development",2019 06 04,"Focus is shifting to better understand the lived experiences of children with intellectual disability in relation to their quality of life (QOL).

However belowground microbial community response to drought in temperate maize agroecosystems, as well as how these responses to water-stress are shaped by host genotype are poorly understood. Ten maize hybrids (six newer and four older) were grown in a replicated field trial. The endosphere, rhizosphere and soil bacterial and archaeal communities were sampled and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sampling was done at two developmental stages in a water-limited environment with and without supplemental irrigation. Significant shifts in microbial community composition (β-diversity) were measured between two sampling times during the season, in well-watered and water-stressed conditions and in newer and older generation maize hybrids. The microbial community diversity within samples (α-diversity) was not affected by drought stress or host factors. The phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were more abundant in the rhizosphere of newer hybrids under water stress. These results highlight the importance of temporal variation, environmental stress and plant genetics as influenced by breeding history in shaping the composition of root associated microbial communities. These insights may provide new approaches to the improvement of crop stress tolerance through optimizing microbial communities. This article is protected by copyright.

However, in many of those applications and most notably in drug delivery, their stability and function may be compromised by the biological media. A particularly important issue for medical applications is their interaction with proteins such as endonucleases, which may degrade the well-defined nanoscale shapes. Here we provide fundamental insights into this interaction by monitoring DNase I digestion of four structurally distinct DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) in real-time and at a single-structure level using high-speed atomic force microscopy. We also assess the effect of the solid-liquid interface on DONs digestion by comparison with experiments in bulk solution. We show that DONs digestion is strongly dependent on its superstructure and flexibility and also on the local topology of the individual structure.",Explicit finite element models accurately predict subject-specific and velocity-dependent kinetics of sideways fall impact.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163090,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2019 06 04,"The majority of hip fractures in the elderly are the result of a fall from standing or from a lower height. Current injury models focus mostly on femur strength while neglecting subject-specific loading. This article presents an injury modelling strategy for hip fractures related to sideways falls that takes subject-specific impact loading into account. Finite element models (FEMs) of the human body were used to predict the experienced load and the femoral strength in a single model. We validated these models for their predicted peak force, effective pelvic stiffness, and fracture status against matching ex vivo sideways fall impacts (N=11) with a trochanter velocity of 3.1 m/s. Furthermore, they were compared to sideways impacts of volunteers with lower impact velocities that were previously conducted by another group. Good agreement was found between the ex vivo experiments and the FEMs with respect to peak force (RMSE=10.7 %, R2=0.85) and effective pelvic stiffness (R2 =0.92, RMSE=12.9 %). The FEMs were predictive for the fracture status of ten out of elven specimens. Compared to the volunteer experiments from low height, the FEMs overestimated the peak force by 25% for low BMI subjects and 8% for high BMI subjects. The effective pelvic stiffness values that were derived from the FEMs were comparable to those derived from impacts with volunteers. The force attenuation from the impact surface to the femur ranged between 27-54% and was highly dependent on soft tissue thickness (R2 =0.86). The energy balance in the FEMS showed that at the time of peak force 79 - 93 % of the total energy is either kinetic or was transformed to soft tissue deformation. The presented FEMs allow for direct discrimination between fracture and non-fracture outcome for sideways falls and bridge the gap between impact testing with volunteers and impact conditions representative of real life falls.

Yet no prior research has examined how immigration enforcement might inhibit reproductive justice and limit individual's reproductive autonomy. We utilized data from an existing study that consisted of a partnership with a Latino community in Michigan in which an immigration raid resulted in multiple arrests and deportations midway through data collection. Using cross-sectional survey data (n = 192) where no one was re-interviewed, we used ordinal logistic regression to compare desired pregnancy timing of individuals surveyed prior to and after the raid to determine the impact of an immigration raid on desired timing of next pregnancy. We then used qualitative data-including 21 in-depth interviews and participant observation-collected in the community after the raid to contextualize our findings. Controlling for socio-demographic characteristics, we found that Latinos surveyed in the aftermath of the raid were more likely to report a greater desire to delay childbearing than Latinos surveyed before the raid occurred. Our qualitative data showed that an immigration raid has financial and psychological effects on immigrant families and that a raid may impact reproductive autonomy because people are fearful of these impacts. These finding suggest that current immigration enforcement efforts may influence reproductive decision-making, impede Latinos reproductive autonomy, and that family-friendly immigration policy reform is needed.",Split4Blank: Maintaining consistency while improving efficiency of loading RDF data with blank nodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163073,PloS one,2019 06 04,"In life sciences, accompanied by the rapid growth of sequencing technology and the advancement of research, vast amounts of data are being generated. It is known that as the size of Resource Description Framework (RDF) datasets increases, the more efficient loading to triple stores is crucial. For example, UniProt's RDF version contains 44 billion triples as of December 2018. PubChem also has an RDF dataset with 137 billion triples. As data sizes become extremely large, loading them to a triple store consumes time. To improve the efficiency of this task, parallel loading has been recommended for several stores. However, with parallel loading, dataset consistency must be considered if the dataset contains blank nodes. By definition, blank nodes do not have global identifiers; thus, pairs of identical blank nodes in the original dataset are recognized as different if they reside in separate files after the dataset is split for parallel loading. To address this issue, we propose the Split4Blank tool, which splits a dataset into multiple files under the condition that identical blank nodes are not separated. The proposed tool uses connected component and multiprocessor scheduling algorithms and satisfies the above condition. Furthermore, to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied Split4Blank to two life sciences RDF datasets. In addition, we generated synthetic RDF datasets to evaluate scalability based on the properties of various graphs, such as a scale-free and random graph.","Stress and strain among merchant seafarers differs across the three voyage episodes of port stay, river passage and sea passage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163071,PloS one,2019 06 04,"A sea voyage is characterized by a variety of work requirements for the ship's crew, basically reflected in three voyage episodes: port stay, river passage and sea passage.

We presented subjects with 15 interpersonal distances ranging from 40 to 250 cm and obtained verbal and joystick-based ratings of discomfort. Whereas discomfort rose immediately when personal space was entered, the gradient was less steep for distances that exceeded the comfort region of personal space. Thus, personal space is anisotropic with regard to experienced discomfort."

The data presented in this paper is of high clinical translational value and may find application in the treatment of bone infections.",How to radiologically identify a spontaneous regression of sporadic vestibular schwannoma?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163048,PloS one,2019 06 04,"The natural history of sporadic vestibular schwannoma is unpredictable, with tumors growing, non-growing and even showing spontaneous regression in some rare cases.",Through the eye of a Gobi khulan - Application of camera collars for ecological research of far-ranging species in remote and highly variable ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163047,PloS one,2019 06 04,"The Mongolian Gobi-Eastern Steppe Ecosystem is one of the largest remaining natural drylands and home to a unique assemblage of migratory ungulates. Connectivity and integrity of this ecosystem are at risk if increasing human activities are not carefully planned and regulated. The Gobi part supports the largest remaining population of the Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus; locally called ""khulan""). Individual khulan roam over areas of thousands of square kilometers and the scale of their movements is among the largest described for terrestrial mammals, making them particularly difficult to monitor. Although GPS satellite telemetry makes it possible to track animals in near-real time and remote sensing provides environmental data at the landscape scale, remotely collected data also harbors the risk of missing important abiotic or biotic environmental variables or life history events. We tested the potential of animal born camera systems (""camera collars"") to improve our understanding of the drivers and limitations of khulan movements. Deployment of a camera collar on an adult khulan mare resulted in 7,881 images over a one-year period. Over half of the images showed other khulan and 1,630 images showed enough of the collared khulan to classify the behaviour of the animals seen into several main categories. These khulan images provided us with: i) new insights into important life history events and grouping dynamics, ii) allowed us to calculate time budgets for many more animals than the collared khulan alone, and iii) provided us with a training dataset for calibrating data from accelerometer and tilt sensors in the collar. The images also allowed to document khulan behaviour near infrastructure and to obtain a day-time encounter rate between a specific khulan with semi-nomadic herders and their livestock. Lastly, the images allowed us to ground truth the availability of water by: i) confirming waterpoints predicted from other analyses, ii) detecting new waterpoints, and iii) compare precipitation records for rain and snow from landscape scale climate products with those documented by the camera collar. We discuss the added value of deploying camera collars on a subset of animals in remote, highly variable ecosystems for research and conservation.","Declining seroprevalence of hepatitis A in Vojvodina, Serbia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163046,PloS one,2019 06 04,"To assess the current hepatitis A virus (HAV) endemicity in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia, we examined the seroprevalence and susceptibility profiles of the general population. A serum bank of 3466 residual samples, collected in 2015-16 as per the specifications of the European Sero-Epidemiology Network 2 project (ESEN2), was tested for anti-HAV antibodies with an enzyme immunoassay. Relationships between anti-HAV positivity and demographic features of respondents were examined by univariable and multivariable analyses. Present-day HAV seroprevalence was compared with that obtained in 1978-79. Surveillance data for hepatitis A recorded between 2008 and 2017 were also analyzed. Age was the only demographic variable found to be independently associated with a HAV seropositive status. Seropositivity (17% overall vs. 79% in 1978-79) increased with age to a maximum of 90% in the elderly ≥60 years. Only 5% of subjects <30 years were seropositive, unlike the 44% of seropositives ≥30 years. The estimated age at midpoint of population immunity (AMPI) increased markedly from 14 years in the late 70s to 55 years in 2015-16. Meanwhile, disease incidence decreased noticeably in recent years (from 11 in 2008 to 2 per 100,000 population in 2017). In the ongoing pre-vaccine era, natural infection provides immunity for merely a third (31%) and two thirds (57%) of people in their 40s and 50s, respectively. Hence, the majority of people ≤40 years (94%) and middle-aged adults 40-49 years (69%) are susceptible to HAV. Older susceptible individuals, particularly those ≥50 years (24%), are prone to severe symptoms. Taken together, these changes reflect the epidemiological transition of Vojvodina and Serbia from high to very low HAV endemicity, thereby supporting the current national policy of immunization of only high-risk groups.",The prediction of early preeclampsia: Results from a longitudinal proteomics study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163045,PloS one,2019 06 04,To identify maternal plasma protein markers for early preeclampsia (delivery <34 weeks of gestation) and to determine whether the prediction performance is affected by disease severity and presence of placental lesions consistent with maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) among cases.,Characterizing the cellular attachment receptor for Langat virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163044,PloS one,2019 06 04,"Tick-borne encephalitis infections have increased the last 30 years. The mortality associated to this viral infection is 0.5 to 30% with a risk of permanent neurological sequelae, however, no therapeutic is currently available. The first steps of virus-cell interaction, such as attachment and entry, are of importance to understand pathogenesis and tropism. Several molecules have been shown to interact with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) at the plasma membrane surface, yet, no studies have proven that these are specific entry receptors. In this study, we set out to characterize the cellular attachment receptor(s) for TBEV using the naturally attenuated member of the TBEV complex, Langat virus (LGTV), as a model. Inhibiting or cleaving different molecules from the surface of A549 cells, combined with inhibition assays using peptide extracts from high LGTV binding cells, revealed that LGTV attachment to host cells is dependent on plasma membrane proteins, but not on glycans or glycolipids, and suggested that LGTV might use different cellular attachment factors on different cell types. Based on this, we developed a transcriptomic approach to generate a list of candidate attachment and entry receptors. Our findings shed light on the first step of the flavivirus life-cycle and provide candidate receptors that might serve as a starting point for future functional studies to identify the specific attachment and/or entry receptor for LGTV and TBEV.","Wildlife usage indicates increased similarity between reclaimed upland habitat and mature boreal forest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region of Alberta, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163043,PloS one,2019 06 04,"While there is no denying that oil sands development in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) has large impacts upon the habitat it disturbs, developers are legally required to return this land to ""an equivalent land capability."" While still early in the process of reclamation, land undergoing reclamation offers an opportunity to study factors influencing reclamation success, as well as how reclaimed ecosystems function. As such, an Early Successional Wildlife Dynamics (ESWD) program was created to study how wildlife return to and use reclaimed upland boreal habitat in the AOSR. Wildlife data comprising 182 taxa of mammals, birds, and amphibians, collected between 2011 and 2017 and from five oil sands leases, were compared from multiple habitat types (burned [BRN], cleared [CLR], compensation lakes [COMP], logged [LOG], mature forest [MF], and reclaimed sites [REC]). Overall, similarity of wildlife communities in REC and MF plots varied greatly, even at 33 years since reclamation (31-62% with an average of 52%). However, an average community similarity of 52% so early in the successional process suggests that current reclamation efforts are progressing towards increased similarity compared to mature forest plots. Conversely, our data suggest that REC plots are recovering differently than plots impacted by natural (BRN) or other anthropogenic disturbances (LOG), which is likely due to differences associated with soil reconstruction and development on reclaimed plots. Regardless of the developmental trajectory of reclaimed habitats, progression towards increased wildlife community similarity at REC and MF plots is apparent in our data. While there is no expectation that reclaimed upland habitats will resemble or function identically to naturally occurring boreal forest, the degree of similarity observed in our study suggests that comparable ecological functionality is possible, increasing the probability that oil sands operators will be able to fulfill their regulatory requirements and duty to reclaim regarding wildlife and wildlife habitat.",Assessing systemic and non-systemic transmission risk of tick-borne encephalitis virus in Hungary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163042,PloS one,2019 06 04,"Estimating the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) infection risk under substantial uncertainties of the vector abundance, environmental condition and human-tick interaction is important for evidence-informed public health intervention strategies. Estimating this risk is computationally challenging since the data we observe, i.e., the human incidence of TBE, is only the final outcome of the tick-host transmission and tick-human contact processes. The challenge also increases since the complex TBE virus (TBEV) transmission cycle involves the non-systemic route of transmission between co-feeding ticks. Here, we describe the hidden Markov transition process, using a novel TBEV transmission-human case reporting cascade model that couples the susceptible-infected compartmental model describing the TBEV transmission dynamics among ticks, animal hosts and humans, with the stochastic observation process of human TBE reporting given infection. By fitting human incidence data in Hungary to the transmission model, we estimate key parameters relevant to the tick-host interaction and tick-human transmission. We then use the parametrized cascade model to assess the transmission potential of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with respect to the climate change, and to evaluate the contribution of non-systemic transmission. We show that the TBEV transmission potential in the enzootic cycle has been increasing along with the increased temperature though the TBE human incidence has dropped since 1990s, emphasizing the importance of persistent public health interventions. By demonstrating that non-systemic transmission pathway is a significant factor in the transmission of TBEV in Hungary, we conclude that the risk of TBE infection will be highly underestimated if the non-systemic transmission route is neglected in the risk assessment."

The assembly of adhesions is mediated by several types of integrins. These integrins differ in physical properties, including rate of diffusion on the plasma membrane, rapidity of changing conformation from bent to extended, affinity for extracellular matrix ligands, and lifetimes of their ligand-bound states. However, the way in which nanoscale physical properties of integrins ensure proper adhesion assembly remains elusive. We observe experimentally that both β-1 and β-3 integrins localize in nascent adhesions at the cell leading edge. In order to understand how different nanoscale parameters of β-1 and β-3 integrins mediate proper adhesion assembly, we therefore develop a coarse-grained computational model. Results from the model demonstrate that morphology and distribution of nascent adhesions depend on ligand binding affinity and strength of pairwise interactions. Organization of nascent adhesions depends on the relative amounts of integrins with different bond kinetics. Moreover, the model shows that the architecture of an actin filament network does not perturb the total amount of integrin clustering and ligand binding; however, only bundled actin architectures favor adhesion stability and ultimately maturation. Together, our results support the view that cells can finely tune the expression of different integrin types to determine both structural and dynamic properties of adhesions.",Plan U: Universal access to scientific and medical research via funder preprint mandates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163026,PLoS biology,2019 06 04,"Preprint servers such as arXiv and bioRxiv represent a highly successful and relatively low cost mechanism for providing free access to research findings. By decoupling the dissemination of manuscripts from the much slower process of evaluation and certification by journals, preprints also significantly accelerate the pace of research itself by allowing other researchers to begin building on new results immediately. If all funding agencies were to mandate posting of preprints by grantees-an approach we term Plan U (for ""universal"")-free access to the world's scientific output for everyone would be achieved with minimal effort. Moreover, the existence of all articles as preprints would create a fertile environment for experimentation with new peer review and research evaluation initiatives, which would benefit from a reduced barrier to entry because hosting and archiving costs were already covered.","On lifestyle trends, health and mosquitoes: Formulating welfare levels for control of the Asian tiger mosquito in Greece.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163025,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 06 14,"The expansion of urban ecosystems and climate change, both outcomes of massive lifestyle changes, contribute to a series of side effects such as environmental deterioration, spread of diseases, increased greenhouse gas emissions and introduction of invasive species. In the case of the Athens metropolitan area, an invasive mosquito species-the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus)-has spread widely in the last decade. This spread is favoured within urban environments and is also affected by changing climatic trends. The Asian tiger mosquito is accompanied by risks of mosquito-borne diseases, greater nuisance levels, and increased expenses incurring for its confrontation. The main aims of this paper are (i) to estimate the various costs associated with the control of this invasive species, as well as its health and nuisance impacts, (ii) to evaluate the level of citizens' well-being from averting these impacts and (iii) to record citizens' and experts' perceptions regarding alternative control measures. Evidence shows that experts tend to place a high value on mosquito control when associated with serious health risks, while citizens are more sensitive and concerned about the environmental impacts of control methods.

In dendritic spines receiving synaptic inputs, we show here that in the presence of a spine apparatus (SA), which is an extension of the smooth ER, a calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) is triggered at the base of the spine by the fastest calcium ions arriving at a Ryanodyne receptor (RyR). The mechanism relies on the asymmetric distributions of RyRs and sarco/ER calcium-ATPase (SERCA) pumps that we predict using a computational model and further confirm experimentally in culture and slice hippocampal neurons. The present mechanism for which the statistics of the fastest particles arriving at a small target, followed by an amplification, is likely to be generic in molecular transduction across cellular microcompartments, such as thin neuronal processes, astrocytes, endfeets, or protrusions.",The controlled direct effect of temperament at 2-3 years on cognitive and academic outcomes at 6-7 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163023,PloS one,2019 06 04,"There is widespread interest in temperament and its impact upon cognitive and academic outcomes. Parents adjust their parenting according to their child's temperament, however, few studies have accounted for parenting while estimating the association between temperament and academic outcomes. We examined the associations between temperament (2-3 years) and cognitive and academic outcomes (6-7 years) when mediation by parenting practices (4-5 years) was held constant, by estimating the controlled direct effect. Participants were from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 5107). Cognitive abilities were measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (verbal) and the Matrix Reasoning test (non-verbal). Literacy and numeracy were reported by teachers using the Academic Rating Scale. Mothers reported children's temperament using the Short Temperament Scale for Toddlers (subscales: reactivity, approach, and persistence). Parenting practices included items about engagement in activities with children. Marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weights were used to estimate the controlled direct effect of temperament, when setting parenting to the mean. All temperament subscales were associated with cognitive abilities, with persistence showing the largest associations with verbal (PPVT; β = 0.58; 95%CI 0.27, 0.89) and non-verbal (Matrix Reasoning: β = 0.19; 0.02, 0.34) abilities. Higher persistence was associated with better literacy (β = 0.08; 0.03, 0.13) and numeracy (β = 0.08; 0.03, 0.13), and higher reactivity with lower literacy (β = -0.08; -0.11, -0.05) and numeracy (β = -0.07; -0.10, -0.04). There was little evidence that temperamental approach influenced literacy or numeracy.

Thus, the development of alternative therapies is imperative. In the current work, two oxadiazole compounds (LMM5 and LMM11) presented fungicidal activity against Paracoccidioides spp. The minimum inhibitory and fungicidal concentration values ranged from 1 to 32 μg/mL, and a synergic effect was observed for both compounds when combined with Amphotericin B. LMM5 and LMM11 were able to reduce CFU counts (≥2 log10) on the 5th and 7th days of time-kill curve, respectively. The fungicide effect was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy (FUN-1/FUN-2). The hippocratic screening and biochemical analysis were performed in Balb/c male mice that received a high dose of each compound, and the compounds showed no in vivo toxicity. The treatment of experimental PCM with the new oxadiazoles led to significant reduction in CFU (≥1 log10). Histopathological analysis of the groups treated exhibited control of inflammation, as well as preserved lung areas. These findings suggest that LMM5 and LMM11 are promising hits structures, opening the door for implementing new PCM therapies.",Identification and characterization of putative Aeromonas spp. T3SS effectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163020,PloS one,2019 06 04,"The genetic determinants of bacterial pathogenicity are highly variable between species and strains. However, a factor that is commonly associated with virulent Gram-negative bacteria, including many Aeromonas spp., is the type 3 secretion system (T3SS), which is used to inject effector proteins into target eukaryotic cells. In this study, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify T3SS effector proteins, applied this approach to the genomes of 105 Aeromonas strains isolated from environmental, mutualistic, or pathogenic contexts and evaluated the cytotoxicity of the identified effectors through their heterologous expression in yeast. The developed pipeline uses a two-step approach, where candidate Aeromonas gene families are initially selected using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile searches against the Virulence Factors DataBase (VFDB), followed by strict comparisons against positive and negative control datasets, greatly reducing the number of false positives. This approach identified 21 Aeromonas T3SS likely effector families, of which 8 represent known or characterized effectors, while the remaining 13 have not previously been described in Aeromonas. We experimentally validated our in silico findings by assessing the cytotoxicity of representative effectors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, with 15 out of 21 assayed proteins eliciting a cytotoxic effect in yeast. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of our approach, combining a novel in silico search method with in vivo experimental validation, and will be useful in future research aimed at identifying and authenticating bacterial effector proteins from other genera.",Biomechanical Effect of Different Graft Heights on Adjacent Segment and Graft Segment Following C4/C5 Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion: A Finite Element Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163019,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 06 04,"BACKGROUND The finite element analysis (FEA) was used to explore the effect of different graft heights on adjacent segment and graft segment stress after C4/5 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). MATERIAL AND METHODS A detailed, geometrically accurate 3-dimensional cervical spine model was successfully built from computed tomography (CT) scanning of a healthy adult male. We changed the graft height in C4-C5 to be 90%, 150%, 175%, and 200% of the preoperative disc height and simulated the postoperative scenarios with different bone graft height, respectively. A stress analysis was conducted on the adjacent segment and graft segment. RESULTS The maximum von Mises stress on C3-C4 showed that when the graft height was 200%, the values were 0.99 MPa, 0.85 MPa, 0.91 MPa, and 0.89 MPa in different loading conditions. For C5-C6, the maximum von Mises stress was 0.77 MPa, 0.83 MPa, 0.91 MPa, and 0.81 MPa, observed when the graft height was 175%, except in extension condition. With regard to graft segment (C4-C5), the biggest von Mises stress was 1.25 MPa, 1.77 MPa, 1.75 MPa, and 1.81 MPa observed at 200% graft height. For these 3 segments, the smallest von Mises stress was found at 150% graft height under the 4 loading conditions. CONCLUSIONS The graft height makes an important difference on the stress on the adjacent segment and the graft segment after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. A 150% graft height was considered the proper graft height in C4/C5 ACDF, with the lowest stress on the adjacent segment and the graft segment.",Tumor-suppressive miR-3650 inhibits tumor metastasis by directly targeting NFASC in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31163018,Aging,2019 06 04,"In recent years, a growing body of evidence has provided support for the important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the progression of human cancers. A recent study showed that a novel miRNA miR-3650 expression was significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the precise role of miR-3650 in HCC have remained poorly understood. In this study, we found that miR-3650 expression was frequently decreased in HCC tissues. Low expression of miR-3650 is positively associated with tumor metastasis and poor survival of HCC patients. Forced expression of miR-3650 significantly inhibited the migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HCC cells. Through bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assays, we confirmed that neurofascin (NFASC) is a directly target mRNA of miR-3650. Rescue experiment demonstrated that NAFSC overexpression could partially counteracted the inhibitory effect of miR-3650 in HCC metastasis and EMT. In conclusion, our findings are the first time to demonstrate that reduced expression of miR-3650 in HCC was correlated with tumor metastasis and poor survival. MiR-3650 repressed HCC migration and EMT by directly targeting NFASC. Our findings suggested that miR-3650 may serve as a potential prognostic marker and promising application in HCC therapy."

However its role as a prognostic factor has not been studied. Our aim was to determine the weight of disc configuration as a risk and a prognostic factor for NAION. Methods: Case control study. Forty eyes of 40 patients who were diagnosed with NAION between 2008 and 2017, and 120 controls (3 controls for each patient) were included in the study. Disc diameter (DD), cup to disc ratio (CDR), and peripapillar retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) of the non-affected eye were measured using optic coherence tomography (3D OCT 2000, Topcon). Crowding index (CI) was defined as the quotient of average RNFLT and disc area. Mean deviation (MD) at the time of diagnosis and at least three months later was determined using a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (SITA standard 24-2 strategy). Visual acuity (VA) was measured using Snellen charts and transformed into LogMAR values. Results: Only CDR was found to be a risk factor for NAION. No correlationship was found between CI and visual loss. Conclusions: DD and CI did not show value as either prognostic or risk factors. Glial tissue may be a part of the content of the optic disc as important as axons. Our results are in line with the latest studies about NAION pathophysiology.

Methods: The GFR was determined by three methods in the same day: (a) Tc-99m-DTPA dual plasma sample clearance method (mGFR); (b) FAS equation (eGFR1); (c) Tc-99m-DTPA renal dynamic imaging method (eGFR2). The mGFR was used as the reference standard. The Bland-Altman method, concordance correlation coefficient and regression equation were applied to evaluate the validity of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The bias, precision and accuracy were analyzed to compare the performances of eGFR1 and eGFR2. Results: A total of 162 subjects were enrolled in this study. The eGFR1 was correlated well with mGFR (concordance correlation coefficient was 0.896, p < 0.0001) and the regression equation was mGFR = -0.374 + 1.029eGFR1 (p < 0001). The Bland-Altman analysis proved good agreement between the eGFR1 and mGFR. In comparison with eGFR2, the eGFR1 showed better performance on bias (-1.22 vs. 8.92, p < 0001), precision (15.69 vs. 18.36, p  =  0.047) and 30% accuracy (75.31% vs. 59.26%, p  =  0.0009) in all participants. Conclusions: The FAS equation is valid in determining the glomerular filtration rate in Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease. The Tc-99m-DTPA renal dynamic imaging method is less accurate than the FAS equation and cannot be employed as the reference method in assessing the performance of FAS equation.","An explorative study on Staphyloccocus aureus MurE inhibitor: induced fit docking, binding free energy calculation, and molecular dynamics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162992,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,2019 06 04,"Staphyloccocus aureus MurE enzyme catalyzes the addition of l-lysine as third residue of the peptidoglycan peptide moiety. Due to the high substrate specificity and its ubiquitous nature among bacteria, MurE enzyme is considered as one of the potential target for the development of new therapeutic agents. In the present work, induced fit docking (IFD), binding free energy calculation, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were carried out to elucidate the inhibition potential of 2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one based inhibitor 1 against S. aureus MurE enzyme. The inhibitor 1 formed majority of hydrogen bonds with the C-terminal domain residues Asn151, Thr152, Ser180, Arg187, and Lys219. Binding free-energy calculation by MM-GBSA approach showed that van der Waals (ΔGvdW, -57.30 kcal/mol) and electrostatic solvation (ΔGsolv, -36.86 kcal/mol) energy terms are major contributors for the inhibitor binding. Further, 30-ns MD simulation was performed to validate the stability of ligand-protein complex and also to get structural insight into mode of binding. Based on the IFD and MD simulation results, we designed four new compounds D1-D4 with promising binding affinity for the S. aureus MurE enzyme. The designed compounds were subjected to the extra-precision docking and binding free energy was calculated for complexes. Further, a 30-ns MD simulation was performed for D1/4C13 complex.",Effect of ammonium to nitrite ratio on reactor performance and microbial population structure in anammox reactors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162991,Environmental technology,2019 06 13,"Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) presents an efficient alternative for conventional nitrogen removal process.

Similarly, using quantitative PCR, an overall variation in the population of anammox bacteria, ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB), Nitrospira and copy numbers of nirS, hzo and hzs genes were observed with varying degrees of expression. High throughput sequencing analysis further showed a shift in microbial community structure with an overall increase in population of Planctomycetia from 0.76% to (3%, 25% and 26%) and Betaproteobacteria from 5.38% to (19%, 21% and 43%) within Reactors 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In conclusion, different substrates ratio showed a significant influence on the overall nitrogen removal rate as well as the abundances of the different microbial groups.",The association of overhydration with megafistulas in hemodialysis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162990,Renal failure,2019 06 04,"Objectives: Diffuse enlargements of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas customarily attributed to either excessive arterial inflow or central outflow stenosis. The relationship between volume status and clinically enlarged (arteriovenous) fistula (CEF) formation in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is not well understood. Methods: We assessed the pre-dialysis bioimpedance spectroscopy-measured percentage of overhydration (OH%) in 13 prevalent dialysis patients with CEF development and negative angiography and compared the results with those of 52 control dialysis patients (CONTR). All patients were prevalent ESRD patients receiving thrice-weekly maintenance hemodiafiltration at an academic outpatient dialysis unit. Results: 10/13 CEF patients had OH% ≥15% as compared to 20/52 control patients (Chi square p: .02). The degree of OH% was 20.2 ± 7.4% among the CEF vs. 14.4 ± 7.1% in the control group (Student's t-test p: .01), representing 4.2 ± 3.2 vs. 2.8 ± 1.6 L of excess fluid pre-dialysis (p: .03). Patients with CEF development took an average of 1.7 ± 1.4 vs. 0.8 ± 0.8 (p: .002) antihypertensive medications compared to the CONTR patients, yet their blood pressure was higher: 156/91 vs. 141/78 mmHg (systolic/diastolic p: .03<.0001). We found no difference in fistula vintage, body mass index, age, diabetes status, or diuretic use. The odds ratio of having a CEF in patients with ≥15% OH status was 5.3 (95% CI: 1.3-21.7; p: .01), the Number Needed to Harm with overhydration was 4. Conclusions: There is an association between bioimpedance spectroscopy-measured overhydrated clinical state and the presence of CEF; either as an increased volume capacitance or as a potential cause.","Adapting an evidence-based gender, livelihoods, and HIV prevention intervention with street-connected young people in Eldoret, Kenya.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162989,Global public health,2019 06 04,"Despite being highly vulnerable to acquiring HIV, no effective evidence-based interventions (EBI) exist for street-connected young people (SCY) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, this paper describes the research process of adapting an existing EBI in Eldoret, Kenya using a modified ADAPT-ITT model with a young key population. From May to August 2018 we adapted the combined Stepping Stones and Creating Futures interventions. We used community-based participatory methods, focus group discussions, and working groups with four Peer Facilitators and 24 SCY aged 16-24 years. At the inception of this project, a matched-savings programme was integrated into the intervention to further address structural drivers of HIV. Numerous adaptations came forth through the participatory process. Engaging SCY in the adaptation process ensured the programme was responsive to their needs, relevant to the street context, and respected their right to participate in the research process.",Degeneration of Corneal Sensation and Innervation in Patients with Facial Paralysis: a cross-sectional study using in vivo confocal microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162988,Current eye research,2019 06 04,"Purpose: Facial paralysis (FP) leads to diverse periocular complications which threats visual acuity and affects corneal nerve functionally and morphologically. This study aims to summarize the clinical ophthalmic outcomes, corneal sensation, and morphological alterations of subbasal nerve and dendritic cells (DCs) in facial paralysis. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of 48 consecutive patients with facial paralysis at one tertiary hospital. Forty-eight healthy participants were enrolled as controls. The images of corneal nerves and epithelial DCs were detected by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Each patient received thorough ophthalmic examination, tear film function tests and Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometry test. Clinical and morphologic data were compared with controls. Results: 83.3% of the patients showed corneal injuries from punctate epithelial defect to corneal ulcers and scars. Visual impairment and eyelid malposition were observed. Corneal sensitivity were remarkably decreased (25.1±23.8mm) in the affected eyes and was correlated to diminished subbasal nerve density (P=0.019, r=0.387). Number of corneal main nerve trucks and branches were significantly reduced (P<0.0001) while DCs were increased (P<0.0001) in patients with FP when compared with controls. Nerve fiber density showed inverse association with DC density (P=0.019, r= -0.389). Normal corneal innervation in patients with corneal anesthesia were observed in three cases. Conclusions: Ocular complications including corneal erosions, loss of corneal sensation, visual impairment and eyelid malposition have largely affected patients with facial paralysis. Morphological changes of diminished corneal subbasal nerve and increased DCs were detected by IVCM. Corneal epithelial defect, corneal opacity, corneal sensation, dendritic cell density are factors associated with corneal subbasal nerve density. Patients with FP are suggested to have complete ophthalmic evaluation and early instruction on ocular prevention.",Risk factors for diabetic kidney disease in adults with longstanding type 1 diabetes: results from the Canadian Study of Longevity in Diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162987,Renal failure,2019 06 04,"Objectives: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in type 1 diabetes (T1D). We aimed to explore clinical and biochemical factors, including the achievement of American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended targets associated with DKD in people living with T1D for ≥50 years. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study of 75 participants enrolled in the Canadian Study of Longevity in T1D. We explored diabetes-related complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and DKD. Study participants were dichotomized based on the achievement of ADA recommended targets as the low-target group (achieving ≤4 targets, n = 31) and high-target group (achieving >4 targets, n = 44). The outcome of interest was DKD defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values <60/mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or 24-h albumin excretion >30 mg. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for DKD with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of the 75 participants with prolonged T1D duration (45% male, mean age 66 years), 25 participants had DKD and 50 did not. There was no statistical difference between the high- and low-target groups in terms of age and body mass index. eGFR was significantly higher and the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was significantly lower in the high-target group. Older age at diagnosis of T1D and lower frequency component to high-frequency component ratio increased the odds of having DKD. Conclusions: In adults with prolonged T1D duration, older age at diagnosis and lower heart rate variability may be associated with DKD.","Time Intervals From Onset of Clinical Manifestations to Treatment in Patients With Cancer at Hospital General San Felipe, Tegucigalpa, Honduras.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162986,Journal of global oncology,2019 06 04,"In cancer, clinical staging is related to outcomes, and this is linked to the evolution of the disease over time.

We studied the role of IL-1β in neuroinflammation-induced impairment of the following different types of learning and memory: novel object recognition (NOR), novel object location (NOL), spatial learning, reference memory (RM), and working memory (WM). All these processes are impaired in hyperammonemic rats. We assessed which of these types of learning and memory are restored by blocking the IL-1 receptor in vivo in hyperammonemic rats and the possible mechanisms involved. Blocking the IL-1 receptor reversed microglial activation in the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and prefrontal cortex but not in the postrhinal cortex. This was associated with the restoration of NOR and WM but not of tasks involving a spatial component (NOL and RM). This suggests that IL-1β would be involved in neuroinflammation-induced nonspatial memory impairment, whereas spatial memory impairment would be IL-1β-independent and would be mediated by other proinflammatory factors.-Taoro-González, L., Cabrera-Pastor, A., Sancho-Alonso, M., Arenas, Y.

In this study, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) mediates the degradation of Apc11, the catalytic core subunit of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). In vitro studies have shown that Apc11, together with its E2 enzyme, is sufficient to ubiquitinate substrates independently of the APC/C. Here, we establish that this can occur in living yeast cells. We show that the tight controls regulating the function of the fully assembled APC/C can be circumvented when its substrates are ubiquitinated by the excess levels of Apc11 independently of the assembled complex. We thus suggest that the UPS-mediated degradation of Apc11 is an overlooked mechanism ensuring that proper function of the APC/C is limited to suitably delimited holoenzymes and that an imbalance in protein expression may result in detrimental gain-of-function activity, rather than merely the disruption of protein complex stoichiometry.-Volpe, M., Levinton, N., Rosenstein, N., Prag, G., Ben-Aroya, S.

The aim of this study was to determine whether binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFRβ enhanced crosstalk among the various components of the neurovascular unit, leading to synaptic recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The soluble PDGF-BB from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SAH was measured. The relationship between PDGF-BB treatment and astrocytic PDGFRβ signaling was further explored in vivo and in vitro in experimental SAH models. Compared with the levels in the control samples, the PDGF-BB protein levels in the CSF of patients with SAH were significantly increased. After the generation of experimental SAH, astrocyte activation markers were markedly induced by the binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFRβ, accompanied by improved levels of synaptic recovery and cognitive function.

Background:
 Determining trends in the nutritional status of children may guide care prevention beyond this age in an effort to reduce the prevalence and incidence of overweight and/or obese children. The objective of this study is to evaluate the evolution of the nutritional status of preschool children in two moments, with an interval of 2 years. 
Methods:
 This is a cohort study of a random probabilistic sample of preschool children attending public schools within an urban area of high human development index city, in the hinterland of São Paulo state. In 2016, we reassessed the nutritional status of 351 preschoolers evaluated in 2014, comparing the prevalence of overweight according to BMI >1 z-score. 
Results:
 The prevalence of overweight was 31.05% (2014) and 31.06% (2016) and mean BMI z-scores were 0.58 and 0.57, respectively. The nutritional status classification of the preschool children showed almost no agreement between the two time points (κ = 0.053). Nevertheless, children with overweight in 2014 had a relative risk of 1.96 of being overweight or obese in 2016 (p = 0.0473). 
Conclusions:
 Prevalence of overweight among preschoolers was the same at 2 and 5 years of age, with no tendency to grow. Despite this, 2-year-old preschoolers with overweight present a twofold higher relative risk for excessive weight at 5 years of age. These changes of nutritional status at preschool age evince the great flexibility of their nutritional condition during this period of life.",Prevalence and Characteristics of Asthma-COPD Overlap in Routine Primary Care Practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162945,Annals of the American Thoracic Society,2019 06 04,"Adults may exhibit characteristics of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a situation recently described as asthma-COPD overlap (ACO).

Here, we identify methyltransferase-like 21e (Mettl21e), a member of newly classified nonhistone methyltransferases, as a gene enriched in type IIb myofibers. The expression of Mettl21e was strikingly up-regulated in hypertrophic muscles and during myogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown (KD) of Mettl21e led to atrophy of cultured myotubes, and targeted mutation of Mettl21e in mice reduced the size of IIb myofibers without affecting the composition of myofiber types. Mass spectrometry and methyltransferase assay revealed that Mettl21e methylated valosin-containing protein (Vcp/p97), a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. KD or knockout of Mettl21e resulted in elevated 26S proteasome activity, and inhibition of proteasome activity prevented atrophy of Mettl21e KD myotubes. These results demonstrate that Mettl21e functions to maintain myofiber size through inhibiting proteasome-mediated protein degradation.-Wang, C., Zhang, B., Ratliff, A.

We present an updated model of CAI that aims to synthesize the current understanding of its causes and serves as a framework for the clinical assessment and rehabilitation of patients with LASs or CAI. Our goal was to describe how primary injury to the lateral ankle ligaments from an acute LAS may lead to a collection of interrelated pathomechanical, sensory-perceptual, and motor-behavioral impairments that influence a patient's clinical outcome. With an underpinning of the biopsychosocial model, the concepts of self-organization and perception-action cycles derived from dynamic systems theory, and a patient-specific neurosignature, stemming from the Melzack neuromatrix of pain theory, are used to describe these interrelationships."

The widespread introduction into the clinical practice of test for prostate specific antigen (PSA) led to an increase in the number of prostate biopsies performed. At the same time, a decrease in the threshold of age-specific PSA standards has resulted in an increase in the number of unnecessary biopsies. In this regard, a need has arisen for new prostate cancer biomarkers. PCA3 is a non-coding mRNA that is exclusively expressed by prostate cells. Currently, three generations of test diagnostic systems based on the quantitative analysis of the PCA3 mRNA in the urine or its cell sediment has already developed, and they differ in the type of material studied and the method for estimating the amount of PCA3 mRNA. Clinical studies of the developed test systems have shown that a high level of PCA3 expression in the patients urine correlates with the probability of detecting prostate cancer. PCA3 test has higher positive and negative predictive values than previously used PSA test. These data are repeatedly confirmed by studies conducted in different clinics. Thus, the introduction of the method of quantitative determination of PCA3 in clinical practice can significantly improve the efficiency of diagnosis of prostate cancer and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.",[Biomarkers of prostate cancer and potential for using ace produced in prostate gland for diagnosis of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162906,"Urologiia (Moscow, Russia : 1999)",2019 06 04,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the 4th most commonly diagnosed cancer in the male population and incidence of different stages is increasing every year.

GAS6-AS2 was a recently identified cancer-related lncRNA. However, the expression, roles, and functional mechanisms of GAS6-AS2 in melanoma remain unknown. In this study, we found that lncRNA GAS6-AS2 is significantly elevated in melanoma tissues and cells. Elevated expression of GAS6-AS2 is positively correlated with advanced stages and poor prognosis in melanoma. Functional assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of GAS6-AS2 promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of melanoma cells. In contrast, knockdown of GAS6-AS2 inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis of melanoma cells. Furthermore, in vivo functional assays showed that GAS6-AS2 promotes melanoma xenograft growth. Mechanistically, we found that GAS6-AS2 upregulates GAS6 expression, promotes GAS6 secretion, and activates AXL/AKT/ERK signals. The expression of GAS6 was positively correlated with that of GAS6-AS2 in melanoma tissues. In addition, deficiency of GAS6 reverses the biological roles of GAS6-AS2 overexpression in melanoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. Collectively, our data identified GAS6-AS2 as an oncogenic lncRNA in melanoma via activation of GAS6/AXL/AKT/ERK signals.

However, in plants, high among-taxa variance in inbreeding depression results in no difference in the mean inbreeding depression between outcrossing and mixed-mating taxa. Selective interference likely explains high inbreeding depression among mixed-mating taxa, whereas low levels of inbreeding depression among mixed-mating taxa are not as stressed. Among animal hermaphrodites, primarily molluscs, there is little data on mixed-mating systems. To fill a taxonomic and mating system gap, we tested for inbreeding depression in a mixed-mating tapeworm, Oochoristica javaensis. We provide a direct estimate of inbreeding depression across infection of an intermediate host by comparing selfing rates at two life history stages. We found little to no evidence for inbreeding depression and, the level of inbreeding depression falls in line with what is reported for highly selfing species even though O. javaensis has mixed-mating. We discuss this result within the context of kin mating in O. javaensis. Our results emphasize that primary selfing rates alone may be insufficient to classify the inbreeding history in all species when testing for a relationship to inbreeding depression. Mixed-mating taxa, and possibly some outcrossing taxa, may exhibit low levels of inbreeding depression if biparental inbreeding is also driving purging. We advocate that inbreeding depression studies report estimates of inbreeding history (e.g. FIS or identity disequilibrium) from nature-derived adult samples to provide context rather than relying on primary selfing rates alone.

In physiological conditions iron turnover is a delicate process which is dependent on global iron supply and local autonomous regulatory mechanisms. Though less is known about the autonomous regulatory mechanisms, data suggest that these mechanisms can preserve cellular iron turnover even in the presence of systemic iron disturbance. Therefore activity of local iron protein machinery and its relationship with global iron metabolism is important to understand cardiac iron metabolism in physiological conditions and in cardiac disease. Our knowledge in this respect has helped in designing therapeutic strategies for different cardiac diseases. This review is a synthesis of our current knowledge concerning the regulation of cardiac iron metabolism. In addition, different models of cardiac iron dysmetabolism will be discussed through the examples of heart failure (cardiomyocyte iron deficiency), myocardial infarction (acute changes in cardiac iron turnover), doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity (cardiomyocyte iron overload in mitochondria), thalassemia (cardiomyocyte cytosolic and mitochondrial iron overload), friedreich ataxia (assymetric cytosolic/mitochondrial cardiac iron dysmetabolism). Finally, future perspectives will be discussed in order to resolve actual gaps in knowledge, which should be helpful in finding new treatment possibilities in different cardiac diseases.

Here, we analyzed the clonal and plasmid diversity of 97 Efs isolates from wild migratory birds. We found a high diversity, with most sequence types (STs) being firstly described here, while others were found in other hosts including some predominant in poultry. We found that pheromone-responsive plasmids predominate in wild bird Efs while 35% of the isolates entirely lack plasmids. Then, to better understand the ecology of the species, five strains of known STs (ST82, ST170, ST16, ST55) were sequenced and compared with all the Efs genomes available in public databases. Using several methods to analyze core and accessory genomes (AccNET, PLACNET, hierBAPS, PANINI), we detected differences in the accessory genome of some lineages (e.g. ST82) demonstrating specific associations with birds. Conversely, the genomes of other Efs lineages exhibited divergence in core and accessory genomes, reflecting different adaptive trajectories in various hosts. This pangenome divergence, horizontal gene transfer events and occasional epidemic peaks could explain the population structure of the species. This article is protected by copyright.

This study aimed to explore the impact of circulating exosomes on HCC development and recurrence. One-shot transfusion of hepatoma serum to naïve rats induced liver cancer development with gradual elevation of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), but exosome-free hepatoma serum failed to induce AFP elevation. The microarray analysis revealed miR-92b as one of the highly expressing microRNAs in hepatoma serum exosomes. Overexpression of miR-92b enhanced the migration ability of liver cancer cell lines with active release of exosomal miR-92b. The hepatoma-derived exosomal miR-92b transferred to natural killer (NK) cells, resulting in the downregulation of CD69 and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, higher expression of miR-92b in serum exosomes was confirmed in HCC patients before LDLT, and its value at one month after LDLT was maintained at a higher level in the patients with posttransplant HCC recurrence. In summary, we demonstrated the impact of circulating exosomes on liver cancer development, partly through the suppression of CD69 on NK cells by hepatoma-derived exosomal miR-92b. The value of circulating exosomal miR-92b may predict the risk of posttransplant HCC recurrence. This article is protected by copyright.

For the direct system, control and lignin-doped films were added to oil vials which were stored at dark under 40 °C whereas for indirect, films were used to cover oil-containing glass vials stored under standard commercial lighting conditions. Autoxidation of oil samples in the direct contact system was determined by peroxide value (PV), color, headspace oxygen, and volatile compounds, while for the indirect contact system photoxidation was determined by using PV and color. For the direct contact system with soybean oil, the PV was significantly lower during storage for both lignins used compared to the control (packaging system without lignin film). There was not a significant effect of lignin on the color of the oils (P > 0.05). Modified films tested in this study did not have a significant effect on headspace oxygen contents of oil samples; however, it resulted in reduced volatile compounds for both soybean oil and fish oil samples. Based on our observation, soybean protein films with lignin showed a greater impact on soybean oil than fish oil, possibly because of high initial oxidation levels in the fish oil. Enzymatic modified soy protein films with lignin are alternative active packaging materials for highly sensitive to oxidation by radical and UV light. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Plastic packaging materials require the use of petroleum oil and are not biodegradable. Packaging materials made from renewable, biodegradable biopolymers are of great interest but often suffer from performance problems, such as weak mechanical properties compared to petroleum-based plastics. Applying modified biopolymeric film with lignin in the inner layer of food packaging system improved some aspects of their performance during storage, not only by preventing the migration of chemical compounds from the package to the food but also by radical scavenging activity and UV-blocking ability of the packaging system.",Exploring Women's Health Care Experiences Through an Equity Lens: Findings from a Community Clinic Serving Marginalized Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162864,Journal of clinical nursing,2019 06 04,To explore how marginalized women perceive and rate equity oriented health care at a primary care clinic using items that evaluate patients' experiences of care.,"""You only have time for so much in 12 hours"" Unmet Social Needs of Hospitalized Patients: A Qualitative Study of Acute Care Nurse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162863,Journal of clinical nursing,2019 06 04,To explore the experiences of nurses caring for socially at-risk patients and gain an understanding of the challenges nurses face when providing care.,Risk factors for a difficult intravenous access: a multicentre study comparing nurses' beliefs to evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162862,Journal of clinical nursing,2019 06 04,"This study aimed at summarizing the evidence about patient-related risk factors for difficult intravenous access (DIVA) in adults, and at identifying nurses' beliefs and their consistency with evidence.",Instruments measuring behavioral aspects of the nurse-patient relationship: A scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162861,Journal of clinical nursing,2019 06 04,To identify and map tools measuring behavioural aspects of the nurse-patient relationship.

There is no heart pump with the design innovation to support dysfunctional states of heart failure and the anatomic heterogeneity of cardiac defects in pediatric patients. To address this unmet need, we are developing a versatile MCS technology with two separate blood pumps under one housing, whereby a centrifugal pump rotates around an axial pump. In this study, we advanced the design with a new inducer for the axial pump component and flat inlet volute for the centrifugal pump component. We conducted computational modeling of the design iterations, built prototypes, and tested their performance. The axial pump component was able to generate pressure rises of 1-112 mmHg for 2-5 L/min at 10,000-14,000 RPM, and the centrifugal pump component produced pressure rises of 1-184 mmHg for 2-5 L/min at 1750-3000 RPM. Shear stresses and blood damage estimations were less than 425 Pa and 0.5%, respectively. Axial and radial forces were also estimated to be less than 5 N for the axially and radially centered impellers. Data sets were repeatable, and data trends followed theoretical expectations. The new designs for the axial and centrifugal pumps enabled us to reduce the height of the pump while maintaining performance expectations. These findings support the continued development of this new medical device for pediatric patients. This article is protected by copyright.

Under acidic and/or anaerobic conditions, most bacteria utilize the Feo system in order to acquire ferrous iron (Fe2+ ) from their host environment. The mechanism of this process, including its regulation, remains poorly understood. In this work, we have determined the crystal structure of FeoA from the nosocomial agent Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpFeoA). Our structure reveals an SH3-like domain that mediates interactions between neighboring polypeptides via hydrophobic intercalations into a Leu-rich surface ridge. Using docking of a small peptide corresponding to a postulated FeoB partner binding site, we demonstrate the KpFeoA can assume both ""open"" and ""closed"" conformations, controlled by binding at this Leu-rich ridge. We propose a model in which a ""C-shaped"" clamp along the FeoA surface mediates interactions with its partner protein, FeoB. These findings are the first to demonstrate atomic-level details of FeoA-based protein-protein interactions and provide a future framework to test for FeoA-FeoB interactions, which could be exploited for future antibiotic developments.

All previous reports on EBVaGC were retrospective. Prospective study is warrant to evaluate the exact role of EBV status in predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer. It is of special interest to figure out whether dynamic detection of plasma EBV-DNA load could be a feasible biomarker for the monitor of EBVaGC. From October 2014 to September 2017, we consecutively collected GC patients (N=2,760) from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center for EBER examination. We detected EBV-DNA load in plasma and tissue samples of EBVaGC patients at baseline. Subsequently, plasma EBV-DNA load was dynamically monitored in EBVaGC patients. The overall prevalence of EBVaGC is 5.1% (140/2760). The incidence rate of EBVaGC decreased with advanced AJCC 7th TNM stage (P<0.001), with the corresponding percentages of 9.3%, 9.9%, 6.7% and 1.4% for stage I, II, III and IV patients. EBVaGC patients were predominately young males with better histologic differentiation, and earlier TNM stage than EBV negative GC (EBVnGC) patients. EBVaGC patients were confirmed to had a favorable 3-year survival rate (EBVaGC vs. EBVnGC: 76.8% vs. 58.2%, P=0.0001). Though only 52.1% (73/140) EBVaGC patients gained detectable EBV DNA and 43.6% (61/140) reached a positive cutoff of 100 copies/ml, we found the plasma EBV-DNA load in EBVaGC decreased when patients got response, while it increased when disease progressed. Our results suggested that plasma EBV-DNA is a good marker in predicting recurrence and chemotherapy response for EBVaGC patients. This article is protected by copyright.

We saw that N-Methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM), a G4 DNA binding drug affected normal growth as well as the gamma radiation resistance of the wild type bacterium. Interestingly, NMM treatment and recQ deletion showed additive effect on normal growth but there was no effect of NMM on gamma radiation resistance of recQ mutant. The recombinant drRecQ showed ~400 times higher affinity to G4 DNA (Kd =11.74 ± 1.77 nM) as compared to dsDNA (Kd= 4.88 ± 1.30 μM). drRecQ showed ATP independent helicase function on G4 DNA, which was higher than ATP dependent helicase activity on dsDNA. Unlike wild type cells that sparingly stained for G4 structure with Thioflavin T (ThT), recQ mutant showed very high-density of ThT fluorescence foci on DNA indicating an important role of drRecQ in regulation of G4 DNA structure dynamics in vivo. These results together suggested that drRecQ is an ATP independent G4 DNA helicase that plays an important role in the regulation of G4 DNA structure dynamics and its impact on radioresistance in D. radiodurans.

EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-targeted therapy has become the standard treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, acquired resistance to these agents remains a major obstacle for managing NSCLC. Here, we investigated a novel strategy to overcome EGFR TKI resistance by targeting the stanniocalcin 2 (STC2)-JUN-AXL pathway. We revealed that STC2 was expressed at significantly higher levels in EGFR TKI-resistant cells. Further, clinical analysis showed that STC2 expression was increased after the development of EGFR TKI resistance, and that higher levels were correlated with shorter progression-free survival in EGFR TKI-treated lung cancer patients. Moreover, STC2 overexpression in EGFR TKI-sensitive cells resulted in EGFR TKI resistance. Conversely, genetic silencing of STC2 rendered EGFR TKI-resistant cells more sensitive to EGFR TKIs. Mechanically, STC2 enhanced AXL promoter activity by increasing the phosphorylation of c-Jun, which is an indispensable transcription factor that transactivates AXL. STC2 promoted activation of the JUN-AXL-ERK signaling axis in lung cancer cells. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of AXL-ERK activity inhibited STC2-mediated EGFR TKI resistance. We also demonstrated that PE2988 cells, a C797S-independent osimertinib-resistant primary cancer cell line from a lung cancer patient, responded to combined AXL inhibitor and osimertinib treatment. In conclusion, our research indicates that STC2 overexpression is important for acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, and that STC2-JUN-AXL-ERK signaling might be a potential therapeutic target to overcome resistance to EGFR TKIs.

Expression of 119 genes and PAM50 scores by nCounter were available in 306/336 pre-therapeutic samples. Interim survival analysis was planned after 36 months median follow-up. Basal-like (83.3%) compared to other subtypes was positively associated with pCR (38% vs. 20%, p = .015), as was lower HER2 score (p < .001). Proliferation biomarkers were positively associated with pCR: i.e., PAM50 proliferation, ROR scores (all p < .004), higher Ki-67 (IHC) (p < .001). For nab-pac/carbo, expression of immunological (CD8, PD1, PFDL1) genes and proliferation markers (proliferation and ROR scores, MKI67, CDC20, NUF2, KIF2C, CENPF, EMP3, TYMS) were positively associated with pCR (p < .05 for all).

In early TNBC, basal-like subtype, higher Ki-67 (IHC), and lower HER2 score were associated with chemo-sensitivity. Chemo-resistance pathways differed between the two taxane-based combinations. Combination of proliferation/immune markers and PAM50 subtype could allow patient selection for further de-escalated chemotherapy and/or immune treatment approaches.

The very same factors are now operating in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) undergoing rapid socioeconomic transition. A parallel is drawn between the past cancer trends in the U.S. and those anticipated in LMIC transitioning towards higher levels of socioeconomic development. We expect to see a major upsurge in the (still low to intermediate) cancer incidence and mortality rates in LMIC over the next decades, which coupled with population aging and growth, would translate to a scale of individuals diagnosed with, living and dying from cancer unparalleled in history. On account of resource constraints and organizational limitations, prevention strategies need to be prioritized in LMIC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

In this respect, metal deficiencies are usually readily corrected by treatment with supplements, whereas metal overload can be overcome by the use of metal-selective chelation therapy. Deferasirox, 4-[(3Z,5E)-3,5-bis(6-oxo-1-cyclohexa-2,4-dienylidene)-1,2,4-triazolidin-1-yl]benzoic acid, Exjade, or ICL670, is used clinically to treat hemosiderosis (iron overload), which often results from multiple blood transfusions.

However, the study of PSMD4 in esophageal cancer (EC) is relatively rare. Here, we found that the expression of PSMD4 was markedly enhanced in EC tissues and cell lines. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay showed that overexpression of PSMD4 significantly enhanced Eca109 cell viability, while inhibition of PSMD4 reduced Eca109 cell viability. Knockdown of PSMD4 induced Eca109 cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. More importantly, knockdown of PSMD4 significantly enhanced the expression of glucose regulated protein 78, activating transcription factor 6, and p-protein kinase R-like ER kinase, indicating an enhanced ERS response in esophageal cancer cells. Compared with the control cells, brefeldin A significantly inhibited the expression of PSMD4 and increased the expression of p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis. However, such effects were largely reversed after overexpressing PSMD4 in Eca109 cells, suggesting that silencing PSMD4 could enhance ERS-induced cell apoptosis. In summary, upregulation of PSMD4 promoted the progression of esophageal cancer mainly by reducing ERS-induced cell apoptosis.",In Situ Fabrication of Branched TiO2 /C Nanofibers as Binder-Free and Free-Standing Anodes for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162819,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 06 04,"Herein, 1D free-standing and binder-free hierarchically branched TiO2 /C nanofibers (denoted as BT/C NFs) based on an in situ fabrication method as an anode for sodium-ion batteries are reported. The in situ fabrication endows this material with large surface area and strong structural stability, providing this material with abundant active sites and smooth channels for fast ion transportation. As a result, BT/C NFs with the character of free-standing membranes are directly used as binder-free anode for sodium-ion batteries, delivering a capacity of 284 mA h g-1 at a current density of 200 mA g-1 after 1000 cycles. Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g-1 , the reversible capacity can still achieve as high as 204 mA h g-1 . By means of kinetic analysis, it is demonstrated that the remarkable surface pseudocapacitive behavior is also a major factor to achieve excellent performance. The rationally designed structure coupled with the inherent pseudocapacitive behavior gives this material potential for sodium-ion batteries.",Proximal fate marker homothorax marks the lateral extension of stalk-eyed fly Cyrtodopsis whitei.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162816,"Genesis (New York, N.Y. : 2000)",2019 06 04,"The placement of eyes on insect head is an important evolutionary trait. The stalk-eyed fly, Cyrtodopsis whitei, exhibits a hypercephaly phenotype where compound eyes are located on lateral extension from the head while the antennal segments are placed inwardly on this stalk. This stalk-eyed phenotype is characteristic of the family Diopsidae in the Diptera order and dramatically deviates from other dipterans, such as Drosophila. Like other insects, the adult eye and antenna of stalk-eyed fly develop from a complex eye-antennal imaginal disc. We analyzed the markers involved in proximo-distal (PD) axis of the developing eye imaginal disc of the stalk-eyed flies. We used homothorax (hth) and distalless (dll), two highly conserved genes as the marker for proximal and distal fate, respectively. We found that lateral extensions between eye and antennal field of the stalk-eyed fly's eye-antennal imaginal disc exhibit robust Hth expression. Hth marks the head specific fate in the eye- and proximal fate in the antenna-disc. Thus, the proximal fate marker Hth expression evolves in the stalk-eyed flies to generate lateral extensions for the placement of the eye on the head. Moreover, during pupal eye metamorphosis, the lateral extension folds back on itself to place the antenna inside and the adult compound eye on the distal tip. Interestingly, the compound eye in other insects does not have a prominent PD axis as observed in the stalk-eyed fly.",Biochemical properties of a Pseudomonas aminotransferase involved in caprolactam metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162815,The FEBS journal,2019 06 04,"The biodegradation of the nylon-6 precursor caprolactam by a strain of Pseudomonas jessenii proceeds via ATP-dependent hydrolytic ring-opening to 6-aminohexanoate. This non-natural ω-amino acid is converted to 6-oxohexanoic acid by an aminotransferase (PjAT) belonging to the fold type I PLP enzymes. To understand the structural basis of 6-aminohexanoatate conversion, we solved different crystal structures and determined the substrate scope with a range of aliphatic and aromatic amines. Comparison with the homologous aminotransferases from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvAT) and Vibrio fluvialis (VfAT) showed that the PjAT enzyme has the lowest KM values (highest affinity) and highest specificity constant (kcat /KM ) with the caprolactam degradation intermediates 6-aminohexanoate and 6-oxohexanoic acid, in accordance with its proposed in vivo function. Five distinct three-dimensional structures of PjAT were solved by protein crystallography. The structure of the aldimine intermediate formed from 6-aminohexanoate and the PLP cofactor revealed the presence of a narrow hydrophobic substrate-binding tunnel leading to the cofactor and covered by a flexible arginine, which explains the high activity and selectivity of the PjAT with 6-aminohexanoate. The results suggest that the degradation pathway for caprolactam has recruited an aminotransferase that is well adapted to 6-aminohexanoate degradation. This article is protected by copyright.

Several factors have been shown to be associated with PDR. However, whether the moderate sedation is a factor for polyp detection remains controversial. This study aims to assess factors associated with polyp detection including the moderate sedation factor during colonoscopy. Patients who underwent colonoscopy from June 1, 2014 to May 31, 2015 were enrolled into this retrospective study. Patients with poor colon preparation and failure to reach the cecum were excluded. The clinical factors, including patient's sex, age, midazolam/fentanyl sedation, indications, endoscopist colonoscopy volume, and use of antispasmodic agent were evaluated by multivariate analysis. A total of 3373 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 55.8 years, and 1980 patients (58.7%) were male. Among the 3373 patients, 2513 (74.5%) underwent midazolam/fentanyl-based sedated colonoscopy. The multivariate analysis showed that male sex, age over 50 years old, midazolam/fentanyl sedation and indications of screening and surveillance were significantly associated with polyp detection. Moreover, when stratified by sex and age, the midazolam/fentanyl sedation was associated with polyp detection in male patients and patients over 50 years old. This study has highlighted the role of midazolam/fentanyl sedation administered by colonoscopists as a modifiable factor that may increase polyp detection during colonoscopy.",Majorana Vortex Photons a Form of Entangled Photons Propagation through Brain Tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162813,Journal of biophotonics,2019 06 04,"This paper extends the concept of entangled vector vortex beams as a form of Majorana -like photons. Majorana photon quasi particles are introduced and attributed to a class of entangled vector beams and show higher transmission. These photons and the anti-photons are identical. A Majorana photon has within itself both right and left handed twists. These majorana beams travel at speeds other than speed of light, c in free space. Light transmission of Majorana photon vortex beams with orbital angular momentum are investigated in a mouse brain at different local regions showing enhanced transmission and properties of being entangled. This work is new interpretation of our past JPB paper of mixed photon beam states. The transmission change observed with Majorana structured light other than linear polarization is attributed to the non-separable and mixed nature of radial and azimuthal polarizations with orbital angular momentum and the handedness of the light passing through chiral brain media. These mixed non homogeneous beams are entangled in OAM and polarization. Majorana photons may play an important role in the future for quantum and optical computing and sub and super luminal speeds due to its traversal wave vector, k.

The transition of these analytical platforms into clinical ones has led to challenges in product development as well as regulatory strategies for the approval of diagnostic products with these platforms. Regulatory strategies for liquid biopsy diagnostics depend on a framework which has been developed over the past few years by the US FDA. This framework includes both guidances which cover enrichment biomarkers and companion diagnostics, as well as regulatory approval precedents which can be used to design regulatory strategies for new liquid biopsy diagnostic products. However, the regulatory paths for these liquid biopsy diagnostics can also be tortuous, as is the example of CTC - platform liquid biopsies. The ultimate success of regulatory pathways of liquid biopsy diagnostics has been driven by the incremental value of FDA approval for CLIA-developed tests and by the inherent complexity of these diagnostics, which are practical barriers for the widespread replication of these tests throughout CLIA labs. The framework for FDA approval of sequence information from these liquid biopsies has been focused on single-site approvals of diagnostics where sequencing information is considered at different diagnostic risk levels, ranging from novel or follow-on companion diagnostics to variant calls in genomic targets considered independently valuable for therapeutic decision-making.

In this study, by performing miRNA genomics and loss- and gain-of-function assays in dibutyryl-cAMP (dbcAMP)-treated GBM cells, we identified a critical negative regulator, hsa-miR-1275, that modulates a set of genes involved in cancer progression, stem cell maintenance, and cell maturation and differentiation. Additionally, we confirmed that miR-1275 directly and negatively regulates the protein expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of mature astrocytes. Of note, tri-methyl-histone H3 (Lys27) (H3K27me3), downstream of the PKA/polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) pathway, accounts for the downregulation of miR-1275. Furthermore, decreased miR-1275 expression and induction of GFAP expression were also observed in dbcAMP-treated primary cultured GBM cells. In a patient-derived GSC tumor model, a cAMP elevator and an inhibitor of H3K27me3 methyltransferase inhibited tumor growth, induced differentiation and reduced expression of miR-1275. In summary, our study shows that epigenetic inhibition of miR-1275 by the cAMP/PKA/PRC2/H3K27me3 pathway mediates glial induction of GBM cells, providing a new mechanism and novel targets for differentiation-inducing therapy.","APOLLO-2: A Randomized, Placebo and Active-Controlled Phase III Study Investigating Oliceridine (TRV130), a G Protein-Biased Ligand at the μ-Opioid Receptor, for Management of Moderate to Severe Acute Pain Following Abdominoplasty.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162798,Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,2019 06 04,"The clinical utility of conventional intravenous opioids is limited by the occurrence of opioid-related adverse events (ORAEs).

The use of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) based vectors has reduced the traditional reliance on viral methods and their associated obstacles in terms of scale up and safety. Studies utilising magnetic assistive platforms for MNP-mediated gene delivery have found transfection efficiency in astrocytes (a major transplant and homeostatic neural cell type) to be both frequency and amplitude-dependent. It is widely assumed that increased intracellular particle load will enhance transfection efficiency in a cell population. Therefore, we tested repeat delivery of MNP:plasmid complexes in conjunction with oscillating magnetic field parameters- a process termed 'magneto-multifection'- in astrocytes of primary origin in an attempt to enhance transfection levels. We show i) levels of transfection using magneto-multifection equal that seen with viral methods; ii) reporter protein expression using two reporter plasmids shows a diverse profile of single/dual transfected cells with implications for delivery of a 'cocktail' of neurotherapeutic proteins and, iii) contrary to expectation, an inverse relationship exists between particle load and reporter protein expression.",Gene expression profiles define molecular subtypes of prostate cancer bone metastases with different outcomes and morphology traceable back to the primary tumor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162796,Molecular oncology,2019 06 04,"Bone metastasis is the lethal end-stage of prostate cancer (PC), but the biology of bone metastasis is poorly understood. The overall aim of this study was therefore to explore molecular variability in PC bone metastases of potential importance for therapy. Specifically, genome-wide expression profiles of bone metastases from untreated patients (n = 12) and patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT, n = 60) were analyzed in relation to patient outcome, and to morphological characteristics in metastases and paired primary tumors. Principal component analysis and unsupervised classification were used to identify sample clusters based on mRNA profiles. Clusters were characterized by gene set enrichment analysis and related to histological and clinical parameters using univariate and multivariate statistics. Selected proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in metastases and matched primary tumors (n = 52), and in transurethral resected prostate (TUR-P) tissue of a separate cohort (n = 59). Three molecular subtypes (MetA-C) characterized by differences in gene expression pattern, morphology, and clinical behavior were identified. MetA (71% of the cases) showed increased expression of androgen receptor regulated genes, including prostate specific antigen (PSA), and glandular structures indicating a luminal cell phenotype. MetB (17%) showed expression profiles related to cell cycle activity and DNA damage, and a pronounced cellular atypia. MetC (12%) exhibited enriched stroma-epithelial cell interactions. MetB patients had the lowest serum PSA levels and the poorest prognosis after ADT. Combined analysis of PSA and Ki67 immunoreactivity (proliferation) in bone metastases, paired primary tumors, and TUR-P samples was able to differentiate MetA-like (high PSA, low ki67) from MetB-like (low PSA, high Ki67) tumors and demonstrate their different prognosis. In conclusion, bone metastases from PC patients are separated based on gene expression profiles into molecular subtypes with different morphology, biology and clinical outcome.

As results, clinical data showed the changes of some blood lipid molecules in VPA-treated epileptic patients. In lipidomic assays, all 3797 annotated positive ions were identified prior to the data validation. In addition, the number of differentially expressed lipids were identified. And the 133 lipid molecules in VPA-treated cases were significantly up-regulated when compared to those in controls, while other 250 lipid metabolites were down-regulated. Further, these lipid metabolites were mainly constituted with glycerolipids, glycerophopholipids, fatty acyls, sterol lipids. In addition, the most significant elevations of metabolite molecules of triglyceride, sphingomyelin, phosphorylcholine, ceramides, phenolic phthiocerol, as well as topped reductions of phosphoethanolamines, diradylglycerols, 1α,25-dihydroxy-24-oxo-22-oxavitamin D3, 2-deoxy-20-hydroxy-5alpha-ecdysone 3-acetate, dolichyl-4 phosphate were identified respectively.

The organism forms methane from the reduction of methylamines or methanol using molecular hydrogen as reductant. The energy-conserving system in M. luminyensis is unique and the enzymes involved in this process are not found in this combination in members of the other methanogenic orders. In this context our central question was how the organism is able to generate ATP. Energy transduction was dependent on a membrane-bound ferredoxin: heterodisulfide oxidoreductase composed of reduced ferredoxin as an electron donor, at least one protein in the membrane fraction and the heterodisulfide reductase HdrD, which reduced the electron acceptor CoM-S-S-CoB. Electron transfer of this respiratory chain proceeded with a rate of 145 nmol reduced heterodisulfide min-1 ·mg-1 membrane protein. Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis is the first example of a methanogenic archaeon that does not require Na+ ions for energy conservation. Only protons were used as coupling ions for the generation of the electrochemical ion gradient. The membrane-bound F420 H2 :phenazine oxidoreductase complex (without the electron input module FpoF) probably catalyzed the oxidation of reduced ferredoxin and potentially acted as primary proton pump in this electron transport system. In summary, the energy-conserving system of M. luminyensis possesses features found in the pathways of hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic/aceticlastic methanogenesis. Consequently, the composition of the enzymes involved in ion translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane is different from all other methanogenic archaea.",Feedstock Reagents in Metal-Catalyzed Carbonyl Reductive Coupling: Minimizing Preactivation for Efficiency in Target-Oriented Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162793,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 06 04,"Use of abundant feedstock pronucleophiles in catalytic carbonyl reductive coupling minimizes preactivation, enhancing efficiency in target-oriented synthesis.

This nanochain probe exhibits higher capability of cancer cell detection compared with that of RGD functionalized Ag2S QDs (Ag2S-RGD) in the same concentration, which was attributed to the flexible geometry and multivalent targeting properties of APP-Ag2S-RGD. Upon intraperitoneal (IP) injection, superior tumor-to-normal tissue signal ratio is successfully achieved and non-vascularized tiny tumor metastatic focis as small as ~0.2 mm in diameter could be facilely eliminated under NIR-II fluorescence imaging guidance.

The only two drugs accepted for the treatment of this infection are benznidazole and nifurtimox, which are of limited use in the predominant chronic phase. On the search for new drugs, the intracellular Ca2+ regulation has been postulated as a possible target, due to differences found between host cells and the parasite. The mechanisms involved in the intracellular Ca2+ regulation of T. cruzi have been partially elucidated. However, nothing is known about a putative channel responsible for the Ca2+ entry into this parasite. In contrast, in Leishmania spp, a closely related hemoflagelate, a sphingosine-activated plasma membrane Ca2+ channel has been recently described. The latter resembles the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel present in humans, but with distinct characteristics. This channel is one of the main targets concerning the mechanism of action of miltefosine, the unique oral drug approved against leishmaniasis. In the present work, we describe for the first time, the electrophysiological characterization of a sphingosine-activated Ca2+ channel of T. cruzi by reconstituting plasma membrane vesicles into giant liposomes and patch clamp. This channel shares some characteristic as activation by Bay K8644 and inhibition by channels blockers such as nifedipine. However, the T. cruzi channel differs from the L-type VGCC in its activation by sphingosine and/or miltefosine. Albeit the conductance for Ba2+ , Ca2+ and Sr2+ was similar, the parasite channel appears not to be voltage-dependent. A gene that presents homology in critical amino acids with its human orthologue Ca2+ channel was identified. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study is to determine and analyze the drug resistance-related miRNA in colorectal cancer. We established four types of 5-FU resistant colon cancer cell line in vitro and in vivo. We then analyzed miRNA expression profile by miRNA array in these 4 cell lines, and identified the drug resistance-related miRNAs. We examined the expression levels of the identified miRNA in 112 colorectal tumor samples from the patients. We identified possible 12 miRNAs to be involved in 5-FU resistance by miRNA arrays. We then examined the relationship between miR-31, which was most promising among them, and drug resistance. The ectopic expression of mimic miR-31 showed a significant 5-FU resistance in the parental DLD-1 cells, while anti-miR-31 caused significantly growth inhibition in DLD/F cells that is 5-FU resistant colon cancer cell line DLD-1 under exposure of 5-FU. When we exposed high dose of 5-FU to parent or 5-FU resistant cells, the expression levels of miR-31 were raised higher than those of controls. Notably, the expression levels of miR-31 were positively correlated with the grade of clinical stages of colorectal tumors. The protein expression levels of factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (FHI-1) were downregulated by transfection of mimic miR-31 into DLD-1 cells. This study provides evidence supporting the association of miR-31 with 5-FU drug resistance and clinical stages of colorectal tumors. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we, using concentrated electrolyte design, demonstrated that formation of a robust inorganic-rich passivation layer on the graphite anode could resolve these dilemmas. Consequently, the PIBs with graphite anode could operate for over 2000 cycles (running time of over 17 months) with negligible capacity decay, and could exhibit high area capacity over 7.36 mAh cm-2 with a high mass loading of 28.56 mg cm-2. These unprecedented performances of graphite are comparable to that of traditional lithium ion batteries, and may promote the rapidly development of high performance PIBs.",Consistency analysis of microRNA-arm expression reveals microRNA-369-5p/3p as tumor suppressors in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162777,Molecular oncology,2019 06 04,"The 5p and 3p arms of microRNA (miRNA) are typically generated from the same precursor, and one arm influences protein output, while the other has a short half-life. However, a few miR-5p/3p pairs have been reported to co-exist in cancer cells. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of miRNA expression in gastric cancer (GC) cells to systematically investigate the co-expression profile of miR-5p/3p in gastric tumorigenesis. We discovered that only 41 miR-5p/3p pairs out of 1749 analyzed miRNAs were co-expressed. Specifically, abnormal expression of miR-369-5p and miR-369-3p was correlated with GC progression. Importantly, both in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that miR-369-5p and miR-369-3p exhibited tumor suppressive roles by regulating c-Jun and AKT1 function in GC cells, respectively. Moreover, we observed that miR-369 was inactivated in GC tissues due to DNA methylation. We also showed that inhibition of miR-369-5p/3p attenuated the effect of azacitidine treatment on suppressing cell growth and invasion. These results suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of azacitidine in GC is at least partly attributable to miR-369 activation. Overall, our findings provide convincing evidence that both the 5p and 3p arms of miRNA co-expressed in GC and DNA methylation-induced miR-369 signaling contribute to GC progression.","Commentary on ""Cognitive Functional Therapy in Patients with Non Specific Chronic Low Back Pain"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162776,"European journal of pain (London, England)",2019 06 04,"In this issue you will find a paper by Vibe Fersum et al., entitled ""Cognitive Functional Therapy in Patients with Non Specific Chronic Low Back Pain: A Randomized Controlled Trial 3-year Follow Up"" (Vibe Fersum 2019).

However, high-resolution printing of adaptive materials that change shape in response to external stimuli remains a significant technical challenge. The article presents a new approach of printing thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) into macroscopic structures that dynamically reconfigure in response to heating and cooling cycles. The printing process is performed using an external laser source, which enables thermal cross-linking of the polymer ink consisting of monomer, cross-linker, initiator, and inorganic nanoparticles. It is shown that the addition of silica nanoparticles enhances the mechanical properties of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) while maintaining its thermoresponsiveness at micrometer-scale resolution, which otherwise is not feasible by extrusion-based three-dimensional printing techniques. It is demonstrated that spatial reconfiguration of the printed monolayers upon increasing temperature is governed by the local geometry, which enables mimicking the reconfiguration of plant leaves in a natural environment. The study lays a foundation for developing a new fabrication platform to print thermoresponsive structures that may find applications in biomedical implants, sensors, and other multi-responsive materials.",Serum CA-125 levels in preeclampsia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162767,International journal of clinical practice,2019 06 04,"Preeclampsia is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity, although an optimal screening model is still under investigation.

However, the nature of the interactions between CagA and KLF4 in GC development has not been elucidated. Therefore, we focused on the CagA-mediated promotion of the malignant transformation of gastric epithelial cells. Herein, we first examined the expression of KLF4 in both human cancer and paracarcinoma tissues with or without H. pylori infection and found that KLF4 expression was significantly decreased in H. pylori-positive GC cells compared with the H. pylori-negative GC cells. Further functional studies revealed that the increased expression of CagA could suppress KLF4 expression and promote the malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells. Subsequently, we found that CagA could upregulate miR-155 and further restrict the expression of downstream KLF4. More importantly, the overexpression of miR-155 in GES-1 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition and eventually facilitated tumor growth in vivo. Overall, the identification of the CagA/miR-155/KLF4 signaling pathway provided a new insight into the development and treatment of GC.",Development and Validation of the Moral Injury Scales for Youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162746,Journal of traumatic stress,2019 06 04,"This paper describes the development and preliminary psychometric properties of the Moral Injury Scales for Youth (MISY).

F1 seed germination and seedling growth were influenced by treatments experienced by F0 plants (p < 0.05). Seeds produced from plants in F0 treatment with nCuO 50 mg/L had the lowest germination percentage and shortest seedling shoot length (SL) and root length (RL), in F1control and F1As alone treatment (p < 0.05). The SL and RL were decreased while the number of root branches (NRB) was increased in F1As treatment compared with F1control (p < 0.001). Interaction of As and nCuO also caused differential seed germination and seedling growth at various nCuO concentrations in quasi-F0 treatment (seeds receiving the same exposure as F0 plants) (p < 0.05). Copper and As uptake in F1control seedlings was not affected by seeds' F0 exposure, which indicated the transgenerational effects on rice seedling growth were not dependent on total Cu or As uptake in seedlings. The enhanced effects on seedlings from quasi-F0 treatment were influenced by additional exposure to nCuO and As, which also interacted to affect Cu and As uptake in seedlings.

Primary varicella is an uncommon complication post-solid-organ transplant (SOT), except among pediatric transplant patients and those seronegative for VZV. As the majority of SOT recipients are seropositive for VZV, herpes zoster (HZ) occurs frequently following SOT, particularly among recipients who are older (≥65 years of age) and those receiving more intensive immunosuppression. Transplant providers should aware of the increased risk for HZ-related complications such as dissemination, organ-specific involvement and post-herpetic neuralgia. Treatment for localized zoster is primarily given as oral regimens, but those with more complicated presentations or those at risk for dissemination should be treated initially with IV therapy. Available antiviral prophylaxis regimens and vaccination strategies for varicella and HZ among these immunosuppressed patients remain a mainstay for prevention in the pre and post-transplant periods. Finally, we discuss important approaches to addressing post-exposure prophylaxis and infection control practices for those SOT patients with documented VZV infections.

To regulate genes encoding enzymes of the multi-enzyme cellulosome complex, certain clostridia contain alternative sigma I (σI ) factors that have cognate membrane associated anti-σI factors (RsgIs) which act as polysaccharide sensors. In this work, we analyzed the structure-function relationship of the extracellular sensory elements of Clostridium (Ruminiclostridium) thermocellum and Clostridium clariflavum (RsgI3 and RsgI4, respectively). These elements were selected for comparison as each comprised two tandem PA14-superfamily motifs. The X-ray structures of the PA14 modular dyads from the two bactrerial species were determined, both of which showed a high degree of structural and sequence similarity, although their binding preferences differed. Bioinformatic approaches indicated that the DNA sequence of promoter of sigI/rsgI operons represents a strong signature which helps differentiate binding specificity of the structurally similar modules. The σI4 -dependent C. clariflavum promoter sequence correlates with binding of RsgI4_PA14 to xylan and was identified in genes encoding xylanases, whereas the σI3 -dependent C. thermocellum promoter sequence correlates with RsgI3_PA14 binding to pectin and regulates pectin degradation-related genes. Structural similarity between clostridial PA14 dyads to PA14-containing proteins in yeast helped identify another crucial signature element: the Calcium Binding Loop 2 (CBL2), which governs binding specificity. Variations in the five amino acids that constitute this loop distinguishes the pectin versus xylan specificities. We propose that the first module (PA14A ) is dominant in directing the binding to the ligand in both bacteria. The two X-ray structures of the different PA14 dyads represent the first reported structures of tandem PA14 modules. This article is protected by copyright.

In the current work, we used the dID model in transgenic mice expressing green fluorescence protein under the CNPase promoter allowing the identification of cells belonging to the oligodendroglial lineage, and the visualization of the entire myelin structure and single OL morphology. The present work evaluates dID effects on OL complexity in different brain areas. Control animals showed an increase in OL complexity both during development and along the anterior-posterior axis. In contrast, dID animals exhibited an initial increase in CNPase+ cells with prevalence of immature-OL (i-OL), an effect later compensated during development by selective death of those i-OL. As a consequence, developmental behavior was impaired in terms of body balance, muscle response, and sensorimotor functions. To explore why i-OL fail to mature in dID, expression levels of transcriptional factors involved in the maturation of the OL lineage were studied. In nuclear fractions, dID animals showed an increase in Hes5, which prevents the maturation of i-OL, and a decrease in Sox10, a positive regulator of OL maturation. The cytoplasmic fractions showed a decrease in Olig1, which is critical for precursor cell differentiation into premyelinating OL. Overall, the expression levels of Hes5, Sox10, and Olig1 in dID conditions correlated with an unfavorable OL maturation profile. In sum, the current results provide further evidence of dID impact on myelination, keeping OL away from the maturational path.",Exploring patient preferences for involvement in medication management in hospitals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162718,Journal of advanced nursing,2019 06 04,To identify patient preferences for involvement in medication management during hospitalisation.,Contrast media and cutaneous reactions.

In this regard, a simple yet effective in silico screening methodology was applied in the present study to evaluate a potential 867 pentapeptide library based on known BSB peptide, LPFFD, for destabilizing Aβ42 protofibrils. The molecular docking based virtual screening was used to filter out pentapeptides having binding affinities stronger than LPFFD. In the next step, binding free energies of the top 10 pentapeptides were evaluated using the MM-PBSA method. The residue-wise binding free energy analysis reveals that two pentapeptides, PVFFE, and PPFYE, bind to the surface of Aβ42 protofibril and another pentapeptide, PPFFE, bind in the core region of Aβ42 protofibril. By employing molecular dynamics simulation as a post filter for the top-hit peptides from MM-PBSA, the pentapeptides, PPFFE, PVFFE, and PPFYE, have been identified as potential BSB peptides for destabilizing Aβ42 protofibril structure. The conformational microstate analysis, a significant decrease in the β-sheet content of Aβ42 protofibril, a loss in the total number of hydrogen bonds in Aβ42 protofibril, Asp23-Lys28 salt bridge destabilization and analysis of the free energy surfaces highlight Aβ42 protofibril structure destabilization in presence of pentapeptides. Among three top-hit pentapeptides, PPFFE displayed the most potent Aβ42 protofibril destabilization effect that shifted the energy minima toward lowest value of β-sheet content as well as lowest number of hydrogen bonds in Aβ42 protofibril. The in silico screening workflow presented in the study highlight an alternative tool for designing novel peptides with enhanced BSB ability as potential therapeutic agents for AD."

To investigate the effect of salidroside on tumorigenesis of BxPC-3 cells and whether HIF-1α and LXCL2 were involved in this process, cells transfected with or without LOXL2 overexpression vector, were treated with 50 μg/mL of salidroside or 50 μM of KC7F2 (a HIF-1α inhibitor) under hypoxia. Cell viability and invasion were assessed using CCK-8 and Transwell chamber assay, respectively. Expression of E-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase 2/9 (MMP 2/9) was determined, by Western blot analysis, to assess cell mobility at molecular levels. We confirmed that hypoxia increased LOXL2 and induced tumorigenesis of BxPC-3 cells, as evidenced by promoted cell proliferation and invasion, enhanced MMP2/9 while reduced E-cadherin. Interestingly, hypoxia-induced carcinogenesis was significantly retarded by both salidroside and KC7F2, however, enhanced with LOXL2 overexpression. Besides, salidroside and KC7F2 reduced LOXL2, and reversed the tumorigenesis of BxPC-3 cells induced by LOXL2 overexpression. Given the inhibitory effect of salidroside on HIF-1α expression, our data suggested that: (1) LOXL2 was the mechanism, whereby salidroside and KC7F2 showed inhibitory effect on cancer progression of BxPC-3 cells; (2) salidroside exerted its anticancer effect, most likely, by a HIF-1α/LOXL2 pathway. In conclusion, salidroside was a novel therapeutic drug in pancreatic cancer, and downregulation of HIF-1α and LXCL2 was the underlying mechanism.",A convenient synthesis of the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist (R)-[N-methyl-3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate methiodide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162696,Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals,2019 06 04,"A useful synthesis of (R)-[N-methyl-3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate methiodide is described with the product characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), tritium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS).

The discovery of virophages, satellite-like DNA viruses that depend on lytic giant viruses that infect protists, revealed a genetically diverse group of viruses with high genome mobility. Virophages can act as strong inhibitors of their associated giant viruses, and the resulting beneficial effects on their unicellular hosts resemble a population-based antiviral defense mechanism. By comparing various aspects of genome-integrating virophages, in particular the virophage mavirus, with other mobile genetic elements and parasite-derived defense mechanisms in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, we show that virophages share many features with other host-parasite systems.

A striking feature of the binding of a fluorescent analogue of VEGF165 a to NanoLuciferase-tagged VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in living cells is that the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) signal is not sustained and declines over time.

Here we use a mesocosm experiment to test for the effects of a larval dragonfly functional trait on community and ecosystem dynamics by creating artificial populations to mirror within- and between-population trait variation observed in our study area. Specifically, we manipulate variation in activity rate, a key functional trait shaping food webs, across three levels of biological organization: within-populations (differences in trait variation in a population), among-populations (differences in population mean trait values), and among-species (species-level differences of co-occurring dragonflies). We show that differences in activity rate alter prey communities, trophic cascades, and multiple ecosystem processes. However, trait variation among populations had much larger effects than differences between co-occurring species or even the presence of a predator, whereas within-population variation had a relatively minor impact. Interestingly, combined with earlier work in the same system, our study suggests that the relative importance of species versus individual level differences for ecosystem functioning will depend on the spatial scale considered. Ecological processes, including biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, cannot be understood without accounting for trait variation across biological scales of organization, including at fine scales.

For example, early life quality might (1) positively associate with fitness (a silver spoon effect), (2) stimulate a predictive adaptive response (by adjusting the phenotype to the quality of the environment to maximize fitness) or (3) be obscured by subsequent plasticity. Potentially, the effects of the early life environment can persist beyond one generation, though the intergenerational plasticity on fitness traits of a subsequent generation is unclear. 2.To study both intra- and inter-generational effects of the early life environment, we exposed a first generation of bank voles to two early life stimuli (variation in food and social environment) in a controlled environment. To assess possible intra-generational effects, the reproductive success of female individuals was investigated by placing them in large outdoor enclosures in two different, ecologically relevant environments (population densities). 3.Resulting offspring were raised in the same population densities where they were conceived and their growth was recorded. When adult, half of the offspring were transferred to opposite population densities to evaluate their winter survival, a crucial fitness trait for bank voles. 4.Our setup allowed us to assess: (1) do early life population density cues elicit an intra-generational adaptive response i.e. a higher reproductive success when the density matches the early life cues and (2) can early life stimuli of one generation elicit an intergenerational adaptive response in their offspring i.e. a higher growth and winter survival when the density matches the early life cues of their mother. 5.Our results show that the early life environment directly affects the phenotype and reproductive success of the focal generation, but adaptive responses are only evident in the offspring. Growth of the offspring is maintained only when the environment matches their mother's early life environment. Furthermore, winter survival of offspring also tended to be higher in high population densities if their mothers experienced an competitive early life. These results show that the early life environment can contribute to maintain high fitness in challenging environments, but not necessarily in the generation experiencing the early life cues.

This could offer an alternative to the conventional ""foie gras"" production system based on overfeeding. The present work aimed at comparing the compositional characteristics, sensory profile, and acceptability by a consumer panel of fatty livers obtained by overfeeding and spontaneous fattening. In all, 210 male geese were used: 125 geese were raised over a 31-wk period to produce fatty liver without overfeeding (""alternative livers"") and 85 were raised using conventional methods with overfeeding (""conventional livers""). Mean liver weight was over 1 kg (1,102 g) in the conventional group and 445 g in the alternative group. The characteristics of the livers were studied in 2 subpopulations: 44 conventional livers representative of the experimental population (mean liver weight 1,064 g) and 42 alternative livers weighing more than 400 g (mean 702 g). Compared with the alternative livers, livers from the conventional group showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher dry matter and lipid contents, lighter color (L*), and lower yellowness (b*). The neutral lipids of alternative livers contained significantly less triglycerides and free fatty acids and significantly more cholesterol and cholesterol esters than those from conventional livers. Detailed analysis of the fatty acid composition of triglycerides showed that the proportion of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher in the alternative livers. However, covariance analysis suggested that these differences in lipid composition were mainly due to differences in lipid content between both types of livers. The evaluation of cooked livers by a trained expert panel revealed significant differences in the sensory profile between the conventional and alternative livers. The acceptability by a consumer panel was significantly lower in alternative compared to conventional livers. This difference was not related to weight and/or lipid content since livers of similar weight range (800 to 1,000 g) were compared and showed clear-cut differences for hedonic scores.",Alleviation of infectious-bursal-disease-virus-induced bursal injury by betaine is associated with DNA methylation in IL-6 and interferon regulatory factor 7 promoter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162616,Poultry science,2019 06 04,"Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) often infects young chickens and causes severe immunosuppression and inflammatory injury. Betaine is an antiviral and anti-inflammatory ingredient that may exert functions through epigenetic regulation. However, the effects of betaine on an IBDV-induced bursal injury and their underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. In this study, betaine was supplemented to the drinking water of newly hatched commercial broilers for 3 wk. Afterward, the chickens were infected with the IBDV. After 5 D of infection, the bursal lesions were examined. The mRNA expression levels of IBDV VP2 gene, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and interferons were detected. Furthermore, the 5-methylcytosine level of the CpG island in the promoter region of IL-6 and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) were determined. The IBDV induced the depletion of lymphocytes and inflammation in the bursal follicles. IBDV infection considerably elevated the mRNA levels of VP2, IL-6, types I (IFNα and IFNβ) and II (IFNγ) interferons, and IRF7. The CpG island methylation in the promoter regions of IL-6 and IRF7 were substantially decreased after IBDV infection. Betaine administration attenuated the IBDV-induced bursal lesions. Meanwhile, the IBDV-induced mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IFNβ, and IRF7 were suppressed by betaine consumption. Furthermore, the hypomethylation effects of IBDV infection to the promoter regions of IL-6 and IRF7 genes were eliminated and relieved by betaine administration. Our results indicated that the IBDV-induced expression levels of IL-6 and IRF7 genes are associated with the suppression of methylation in the promoter region. Betaine administration through drinking water may alleviate the IBDV-induced bursal injury via epigenetic regulation."

However, the species of termites were not identified. As a first step to investigate causal relationships between termites and ironwood tree death, we assigned termites collected from ironwood trees to species using a combination of morphological characters and DNA barcoding of the 12S, 16S, COI, COII, and ITS2 regions. Based on morphology and comparisons to reference sequences in NCBI GenBank, the most likely species assignments were Nasutitermes takasagoensis (Nawa) (Blattodea: Termitidae) found to infest 45 trees, followed by Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) (2 trees), Microcerotermes crassus Snyder (Blattodea: Termitidae) (2 trees), and an additional unidentified Microcerotermes species (1 tree) with no close sequence match to identified species in NCBI GenBank.

Objective of this study was to assess the acceptability, feasibility, and perceived utility of photovoice in a diabetes self-management intervention for Latinos. Thirty-seven adults with diabetes attended a church-based self-management education program that included a photovoice exercise where participants were asked to take photographs to illustrate their successes and challenges in diabetes management. Participants discussed their photographs in the group classes and evaluated the exercise in an exit survey. Photographs and discussion notes were analyzed for prevalent themes. We measured participant participation in the photovoice activity, content of photographs, themes of the discussions that were prompted by the photographs in class, and participants' satisfaction with the photovoice exercise. Of the 37 participants, 70% took photos and 65% shared them in class. Photos depicted family, social gatherings, diet, exercise, the neighborhood, diabetes supplies and medications, and home life. Almost all the group discussions involved aspects of social support, including giving advice, empathizing, or providing motivation for self-care to one another. Eighty-six percent reported learning how to better manage their diabetes from others' photos; 93% noted sharing photos made them feel connected to the group. In a diabetes self-management education program, photovoice was well received by Latino adults and provided a vehicle to receive and provide social support in self-care.

She was admitted for sudden onset of left-sided hemiplegia and aphasia. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 20/42 before the operation. Computed tomography (CT) cerebral angiogram showed right internal cerebral artery (ICA) occlusion from the cervical portion. Urgent intra-arterial (IA) thrombectomy was started 2 h after symptom onset, but failed despite the use of a stentriver and a large-bore aspiration catheter together. Emergency rescue open thrombectomy was performed with right pterional craniotomy 6 h after symptom onset. Sylvian fissure was dissected to expose the supraclinoid ICA, ICA bifurcation, A1, and M1. A transverse arteriotomy was made at the ICA bifurcation and open surgical thrombectomy was performed. Reperfusion was established in 86 min after skin incision.

RNA editing, the process that alters individual bases of RNA, may contribute to AD pathogenesis due to its roles in neuronal development and immune regulation. Here, we pursued one of the first transcriptome-wide RNA editing studies in AD by examining RNA sequencing data from individuals of both African-American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) ethnicities. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing and RNA editing analysis were performed on peripheral blood specimens from 216 AD cases (105 AA, 111 NHW) and 212 gender matched controls (105 AA, 107 NHW). 449 positions in 254 genes and 723 positions in 371 genes were differentially edited in AA and NHW, respectively. While most differentially edited sites localized to different genes in AA and NHW populations, these events converged on the same pathways across both ethnicities, especially endocytic and inflammatory response pathways. Furthermore, these differentially edited sites were preferentially predicted to disrupt miRNA binding and induce nonsynonymous coding changes in genes previously associated with AD in molecular studies, including PAFAH1B2 and HNRNPA1.

Based on the hypothesis that VS makes the virus untransmittable, we extend a previous model and we develop a time-varying ordinary differential equation model with immigration and treatment, where the naive and non-naive populations of infected are distinguished, and different compartments account for treated subjects virally suppressed and not suppressed. Moreover, naive and non-naive individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are considered separately. Clinical data stored in the nationwide database Antiviral Response Cohort Analysis are used to reconstruct the history of the fraction of virally suppressed patients since highly active ART introduction, as well as to assess some model parameters. Other parameters are set according to the literature and the final model calibration is obtained by fitting epidemic data over the years 2003-2015. Predictions on the evolution of the HIV epidemic up to the end of 2035 are made assuming different future trends of the fraction of virally suppressed patients and different eligibility criteria for treatment. Increasing the VS fraction is found to reduce the incidence, the new cases of AIDS and the deaths from AIDS per year, especially in combination with early ART initiation. The asymptotic properties of a time-invariant formulation of the model are studied, and the existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique positive equilibrium are proved."

Post-synthetic modification was achieved by the aldimine condensation reaction between MIL-53-NH2 and 2,3,4-trihydroxy benzaldehyde. The post-synthetically modified compound was successfully characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) experiments. The material has huge potential to detect bilirubin in HEPES buffer medium (pH = 7.4) by a fluorescence ""turn-off"" mechanism. The drastic quenching in the fluorescence emission intensity of the MOF material in the presence of bilirubin is due to the inner filter effect as well as molecular interactions between the MOF material and bilirubin. The probe displayed ultra-fast response (30 s), low detection limit (1.26 pM) and high selectivity towards bilirubin with the co-existence of several metal ions and biomolecules. Moreover, the real field application of the probe was thoroughly investigated in human bio-fluids (blood serum and urine samples) by the standard addition method.

In addition, formation of inclusion complexes for diazirines with cucurbit[7]uril, β- and γ-cyclodextrin (β- and γ-CD) was investigated by 1H NMR spectroscopy, isothermal microcalorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy, followed by the investigation of photochemical reactivity of the formed complexes. Diazirines undergo efficient photochemical elimination of nitrogen (ΦR > 0.5) and deliver the corresponding singlet carbenes. Singlet carbenes react in intra- and intermolecular reactions and we found a rare singlet carbene pathway in CH3OH involving protonation and formation of a carbocation, detected due to the specific rearrangement of the pentacycloundecane skeleton. Singlet diazirines undergo intersystem crossing and deliver triplet carbenes that react with oxygen to form ketones which were isolated after irradiation. Our main finding is that the formation of diazirine inclusion complexes with β-CD and γ-CD changes the relative ratio of singlet vs. triplet pathways, with singlet carbene products being dominant from the chemistry of the irradiated complexes.

Bi3TaO7 is a stable tantalate under acidic or alkaline conditions, with a band gap suitable for visible light absorption. However, the photocatalytic properties of Bi3TaO7 are only reported based on the dye degradation reactions, probably due to the fast electron/hole recombination losses. 2D crystal-like nanosheets with a thickness of a few nanometers show unique features such as high carrier mobility, the quantum Hall effect, high specific surface area, and excellent electrical/thermal conductivity. 2D structures can also enhance the photocatalytic properties because photo-generated charge carriers in nanosheets are less prone to fast recombinations as compared to their bulk counterparts.

Strict avoidance of peanuts is the most effective means to prevent the development of an allergic reaction. Physical or chemical strategies employing autoclaving can represent a valid alternative to produce a final food with a decreased allergenic power as in the case of peanuts. Thermal processing might induce protein modifications in foods and affect protein digestibility or absorption of nutrients across the intestinal mucosa. Besides, the type of processing could also alter food protein allergenicity thus influencing the interplay with the biological system at the gut level. In this paper, we investigated the influence of autoclaving based treatments on the proliferation of epithelial cells at the intestinal level. Extractable proteins of raw and autoclaved peanuts were analysed by SDS-PAGE and untargeted LC-high resolution-MS/MS to investigate the peptide composition. Our findings show that when raw peanuts were assayed on Caco 2 cell lines, an antiproliferative effect was observed. By contrast, peanuts subjected to hydration and autoclaving did not show an inhibition of proliferation on Caco-2 cells. In parallel, extensive fragmentation induced by autoclaving treatments on the original peanut proteins was also recorded by LC-MS/MS analysis with a consequent increase in the number of peptides detected. These results indicate that the processing applied to peanuts can have an influence on both the nutritional and allergological sides, and more investigations will be required on this issue to understand the alteration of inflammatory mediators induced by the treatment applied.",Enhanced two-photon absorption of ligated silver and gold nanoclusters: theoretical and experimental assessments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162509,Nanoscale,2019 06 04,"Ligated silver and gold nanoclusters belonging to a non-scalable size regime with molecular-like discrete electronic states represent an emerging class of extremely interesting optical materials. Nonlinear optical (NLO) characteristics of such quantum clusters have revealed remarkable features. The two-photon absorption (TPA) cross section of ligated noble metal nanoclusters is several orders of magnitude larger than that of commercially-available dyes. Several such case studies on NLO properties of ligated silver and gold nanoclusters have been reported, making them promising candidates for various bio-imaging techniques such as multiphoton-excited fluorescence microscopy. However, the structure-property relationship is of great importance and needs to be properly addressed in order to design new nonlinear optical materials. Using small ligated silver nanoclusters as test systems, we illustrate how theoretical approaches together with experimental findings can contribute to the understanding of structure-property relationships that might ultimately guide nanocluster synthesis.","Anomalous interplay of slip, shear and wettability in nanoconfined water.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162505,Nanoscale,2019 06 13,"Slip of liquid over nanometer scales is traditionally believed to be augmented with interfacial shear. In sharp contrast to this intuitive paradigm, here we show that a reverse of this phenomenon may also be possible, by exploiting a rich and non-trivial interplay between interfacial wettability and shear distribution in nano-confined water. This may be attributed to the complex overlapping effect of the local hydrodynamic fields imposed by the opposing boundaries, in the case of highly confined water molecules. The net effect culminates in the form of intriguing molecular layering that can by no means be intuitively estimated, as unveiled from the present molecular dynamics simulations. The consequent complex nature of the interfacial friction is observed to depend not only on the chemical and physical signature of the interface but also on the distribution of the shear rate. We also provide a simple continuum-based theory, in an effort to capture the essential aspects of the underlying physico-chemical interactions. These results are likely to open up new windows for control of slippery and sticky flows in nanofluidic channels."

While PtNPs may be absorbed by the respiratory and digestive tract, and can penetrate through the epidermis, there is no evidence concerning their absorption through the skin. Platinum nanoparticles accumulate mainly in the liver and spleen although they also reach other internal organs, such as lungs, kidneys or heart. Toxicokinetics of platinum nanoparticles depends strongly on the particle size. Only few studies regarding platinum nanoparticles toxicity have been conducted. Animals intratracheally exposed to platinum nanoparticles have demonstrated an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage which confirms inflammatory response in the lungs. Oral administration of PtNPs can cause inflammatory response and induce oxidative stress. Nanoplatinum has been found to induce hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity via the intravenous route. It can cause DNA damage and cellular apoptosis without significant cytotoxicity. There are no research studies on its carcinogenicity. Fetal or maternal toxicity has not been observed, but an increased mortality and a decreased growth of the offspring have been demonstrated. Platinum nanoparticles may permeate the skin barrier but there is no evidence for their absorption. Due to the insufficient number of tests that have been carried out to date, it is not possible to clearly determine the occupational exposure limit value; however, caution is recommended to employees exposed to their effects.

Loganin, an iridoid glycoside present in several herbs, including Flos lonicerae, Cornus mas L, and Strychnos nux vomica, is a valuable medication with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. Our study examines these effects and explores the potential benefits of loganin in the OA treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS To clarify the roles of loganin in OA and its specific signaling pathway, chondrocytes were administrated with IL-1ß and supplemented with or without LY294002 (a classic PI3K/Akt inhibitor). The apoptotic level, catabolic factors (MMP-3 and MMP-13 and ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5), extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway were evaluated using western blotting, PCR, and an immunofluorescent assay. The degenerative condition of the cartilage was evaluated using the Safranin O assay in vivo. The expression of cleaved-caspase-3 (C-caspase-3) was measured using immunochemistry. RESULTS The data suggested that loganin suppressed the apoptotic level, reduced the release of catabolic enzymes, and decreased the ECM degradation of IL-1ß-induced chondrocytes. However, suppressing PI3K/Akt signaling using LY294002 alleviated the therapeutic effects of loganin in chondrocytes. Our in vivo experiment showed that loganin partially attenuated cartilage degradation while inhibiting the apoptotic level. CONCLUSIONS This work revealed that loganin treatment attenuated IL-1ß-treated apoptosis and ECM catabolism in rat chondrocytes via regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling, revealing that loganin is a potentially useful treatment for OA.",gP for What is Common between Developing Intelligence and Personality: Response to the Commentators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162481,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Three are the main postulates of our article under discussion: First, both human intelligence and personality are hierarchically organized, with a general factor at the apex of each hierarchy, i.

All three studies showed that general cognitive ability and the general factor of personality are significantly related throughout this age span. This relation was expressed in several ways across studies. The first investigated developmental relations between three reasoning domains (inductive, deductive, and scientific) and Eysenck's four personality dimensions in a longitudinal-sequential design where 260 participants received the cognitive tests three times, and the personality test two times, covering the span from 9 to 16 years. It was found that initial social likeability significantly shapes developmental momentum in cognition and vice versa, especially in the 9- to 11-year period. The second study involved 438 participants from 7 to 17 years, tested twice on attention control, working memory, reasoning in different domains, and once by a Big Five Factors inventory. Extending the findings of the first, this study showed that progression in reasoning is affected negatively by conscientiousness and positively by openness, on top of attention control and working memory influences. The third study tested the relations between reasoning in several domains, the ability to evaluate one's own cognitive performance, self-representation about the reasoning, the Big Five, and several aspects of emotional intelligence, from 9 to 20 years of age (N = 247). Network, hierarchical network, and structural equation modeling showed that cognition and personality are mediated by the ability of self-knowing. Emotional intelligence was not an autonomous dimension. All dimensions except emotional intelligence influenced academic performance. A developmental model for mind-personality relations is proposed.",Does Intraindividual Variability of Personality States Improve Perspective Taking? An Ecological Approach Integrating Personality and Social Cognition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162477,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Research integrating cognitive abilities and personality has focused on the role of personality traits. We propose a theory on the role of intraindividual variability of personality states (hereafter state variability) on perspective taking, in particular, the ability to infer other peoples' mental states. First, we review the relevant research on personality psychology and social cognition. Second, we propose two complementary routes by which state variability relates to anchoring and adjustment in perspective taking. The first route, termed ego-dispersion, suggests that an increased state variability decreases egocentric bias, which reduces anchoring. The second route, termed perspective-pooling, suggests that an increased state variability facilitates efficient adjustment. We also discuss how our theory can be investigated empirically. The theory is rooted in an ecological interpretation of personality and social cognition, and flags new ways for integrating these fields of research.","Stronger Together: Personality, Intelligence and the Assessment of Career Potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162476,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Personality and intelligence have a long history in applied psychology, with research dating back more than 100 years.

This paper discusses the value of personality and intelligence to understand individual differences in career potential, and how to increase the adoption of theories and tools for evaluating personality and intelligence in real-world organizational contexts. Although personality and intelligence are distinct constructs, the assessment of career potential is incomplete without both."

Given their use in determining whether students have access to special education and related services, it is important that any method used to identify SLD have supporting evidence. A review of the DD/C evidence indicates it cannot currently be classified as an evidence-based method for identifying individuals with a SLD. We show that the DD/C method is unsound for three major reasons: (a) it requires test scores have properties that they fundamentally lack, (b) lack of experimental utility evidence supporting its use, and (c) evidence supporting the inability of the method to identify SLD accurately.",The Enriching Interplay between Openness and Interest: A Theoretical Elaboration of the OFCI Model and a First Empirical Test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162462,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"The Openness-Fluid-Crystallized-Intelligence (OFCI) model posits long-term relations between Openness and cognitive abilities and has been successfully tested with longitudinal data. However, research on the developmental interplay between cognitive abilities and personality exists only sparsely. The current paper focuses on a theoretical development of the OFCI model which suggests micro-level mechanisms underlying the long-term development. Specifically, within-situation relations between Openness, interests, situational perception, cognitive abilities, and emotions are proposed to explain longitudinal relations between Openness and cognitive abilities. Using experience sampling, selected parts of this elaboration were empirically scrutinized in a first test of the proposed ideas. Openness and specific interest both varied substantially across situations and covaried systematically. In interaction with an indicator of fluid intelligence, this covariation was related to an indicator of crystallized intelligence. The paper contributes to theorizing the intertwined development of personality and cognitive abilities, and highlights the importance of within-situation research for explaining long-term development.",Cognitive Models in Intelligence Research: Advantages and Recommendations for Their Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162461,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Mathematical models of cognition measure individual differences in cognitive processes, such as processing speed, working memory capacity, and executive functions, that may underlie general intelligence. As such, cognitive models allow identifying associations between specific cognitive processes and tracking the effect of experimental interventions aimed at the enhancement of intelligence on mediating process parameters. Moreover, cognitive models provide an explicit theoretical formalization of theories regarding specific cognitive processes that may help in overcoming ambiguities in the interpretation of fuzzy verbal theories. In this paper, we give an overview of the advantages of cognitive modeling in intelligence research and present models in the domains of processing speed, working memory, and selective attention that may be of particular interest for intelligence research. Moreover, we provide guidelines for the application of cognitive models in intelligence research, including data collection, the evaluation of model fit, and statistical analyses.","Inequality, Education, Workforce Preparedness, and Complex Problem Solving.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162460,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Economic inequality has been described as the defining challenge of our time, responsible for a host of potential negative societal and individual outcomes including reduced opportunity, decreased health and life expectancy, and the destabilization of democracy. Education has been proposed as the ""great equalizer"" that has and can continue to play a role in reducing inequality. One means by which education does so is through the development of complex problem solving skills in students, skills used to solve novel, ill-defined problems in complex, real-world settings. These are highly valued in the workforce and will likely continue to be so in the future workforce. Their importance is evident in results from employer surveys, as well as by their inclusion in large scale international and domestic comparative assessments. In this paper, I review various definitions of complex problem solving and approaches for measuring it, along with findings from PISA 2003, 2012, and 2015. I also discuss prospects for teaching, assessing, and reporting on it, and discuss the emerging importance of collaborative problem solving. Developing and monitoring complex problem solving skills, broadly defined, is a critical challenge in preparing students for the future workforce, and in overcoming the negative effects of inequality and the diminishment of individual opportunity.","Ability Tests Measure Personality, Personality Tests Measure Ability: Disentangling Construct and Method in Evaluating the Relationship between Personality and Ability.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162459,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Although personality and cognitive ability are separate (sets of) constructs, we argue and demonstrate in this article that their effects are difficult to tease apart, because personality affects the performance on cognitive tests and cognitive ability affects the item responses on personality assessments. Cognitive ability is typically measured with tests of items with correct answers; personality is typically measured with rating-scale self-reports. Oftentimes conclusions regarding the personality-ability relationship have as much to do with measurement methods as with the construct similarities and differences. In this article, we review key issues that touch on the relationship between cognitive ability and personality. These include the construct-method distinction, sources of test score variance, the maximal vs. typical performance distinction, and the special role for motivation in low-stakes testing. We review a general response model for cognitive and personality tests that recognizes those sources of test score variance. We then review the approaches for measuring personality through performance (objective personality tests, grit game, coding speed, economic preferences, and confidence), test and survey behavior (survey effort, response time, and item position effects), and real-world behavior (study time, registration latency, behavior residue, and social media). We also discuss ability effects on personality tests, indicated by age and cognitive ability effects, anchoring vignette rating errors, and instructions to 'fake good'. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for our understanding of personality and ability differences, and suggestions for integrating the fields.",The Dissociation between Adult Intelligence and Personality with Respect to Maltreatment Episodes and Externalizing Behaviors Occurring in Childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162458,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Here we analyze the simultaneous relationships among five variables. Two refer to childhood (episodes of various forms of maltreatment and externalizing behaviors), whereas three refer to early adulthood (intelligence, personality, and socialization difficulties). The 120 individuals considered for the present report were invited from the 650 schoolchildren participating in the Longitudinal Study of Intelligence and Personality (Minas Gerais, Brazil). The complete sample was recruited in 2002 (T1; mean age = 10.0; standard deviation (SD) = 2.2) and 120 were tested again in 2014-17 (T2; mean age = 23.5; SD = 2.2). Externalizing behaviors were registered at T1, whereas the remaining variables were obtained at T2. These were the main results: (1) externalizing behaviors predict future social effectiveness (as estimated by the general factor of personality derived from the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) and socialization difficulties computed from the socialization scale (SOC)) and future intelligence performance (as assessed by a set of fluid and crystallized tests); (2) episodes of self-reported childhood maltreatment predict social effectiveness, but not intelligence; (3) maltreatment and externalizing behaviors are unrelated; and (4) social effectiveness (personality) and intelligence are unrelated. Therefore, the findings support the dissociation between adult intelligence and personality with respect to maltreatment episodes and externalizing behaviors occurring in childhood. Implications of these findings for social policies aimed at preventing adult socially ineffective personalities are underscored.",The Relation of Personality and Intelligence-What Can the Brunswik Symmetry Principle Tell Us?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162457,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"Personality and intelligence are defined as hierarchical constructs, ranging from broad g-factors to (domain-)specific constructs. The present study investigated whether different combinations of hierarchical levels lead to different personality-intelligence correlations. Based on the integrative data analysis approach, we combined a total of five data sets. The focus of the first study (N = 682) was an elaborated measurement of personality (NEO-PI-R), which was applied with a relatively short intelligence test (Intelligence Structure Test 2000 R). In the second study (N = 413), a comprehensive measurement of intelligence (Berlin Intelligence Structure test) was used with a shorter personality questionnaire (NEO-FFI). In line with the Brunswik symmetry principle, the findings emphasize that personality-intelligence correlations varied greatly across the hierarchical levels of constructs considered in the analysis. On average, Openness showed the largest relation with intelligence. We recommend for future studies to investigate personality-intelligence relations at more fine-grained levels based on elaborated measurements of both personality and intelligence.",When Irrational Biases Are Smart: A Fuzzy-Trace Theory of Complex Decision Making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162456,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"I take a decision-making approach to consider ways of addressing the ""unresolved and dramatic problems in the world"". Traditional approaches to good decision-making are reviewed. These approaches reduce complex decisions to tradeoffs between magnitudes of probabilities, and outcomes in which the quantity and precision of information are key to making good decisions. I discuss a contrasting framework, called ""fuzzy-trace theory"", which emphasizes understanding the simple gist of options and applying core social and moral values. Importantly, the tendency to rely on meaningful but simple gist increases from childhood to adulthood (or, in adulthood, as people gain experience in a domain), so that specific irrational biases grow with knowledge and experience. As predicted theoretically, these violations of rationality in the traditional sense are associated empirically with healthier and more adaptive outcomes. Thus, interventions that help decision makers understand the essential gist of their options and how it connects to core values are practical approaches to reducing ""unresolved and dramatic problems in the world"" one decision at a time.",Relationships between Personality and Cognitive Ability: A Facet-Level Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162455,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 10,"A growing body of research supports the notion that cognitive abilities and personality are systematically related. However, this research has focused largely on global personality dimensions and single-often equally global-markers of cognitive ability. The present study offers a more fine-grained perspective. Specifically, it is one of the first studies to comprehensively investigate the associations between both fluid and crystallized intelligence with Big Five personality domains as well as their facets. Based on a heterogeneous sample of the adult population in Germany (N = 365), our study yielded three key findings. First, personality was more strongly related to crystallized intelligence than to fluid intelligence. This applied both to the total variance explained and to the effect sizes of most of the Big Five domains and facets. Second, facets explained a larger share of variance in both crystallized and fluid intelligence than did domains. Third, the associations of different facets of the same domain with cognitive ability differed, often quite markedly. These differential associations may substantially reduce-or even suppress-the domain-level associations. Our findings clearly attest to the added value of a facet-level perspective on the personality-cognitive ability interface. We discuss how such a fine-grained perspective can further theoretical understanding and enhance prediction.",On the Locus of the Practice Effect in Sustained Attention Tests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162391,Journal of Intelligence,2019 06 04,"The present study set out to explore the locus of the poorly understood but frequently reported and comparatively large practice effect in sustained attention tests. Drawing on a recently proposed process model of sustained attention tests, several cognitive tasks were administered twice in order to examine which specific component of test performance benefitted from practice and to which extent. It was shown that the tasks representing the three sub-components of sustained attention tests, namely the perception of an item, the simple mental operation to solve an item, and the motor reaction to indicate a response to an item, benefitted from practice. Importantly, the largest practice gain was observed for the task that required item-solving processes in addition to perceptual and motor processes. Two additional postulated mechanisms in sustained attention tests-the deliberate shifting between items and the preprocessing of upcoming items-did not become more efficient through practice. Altogether, the present study shows that the practice effect in sustained attention tests seems to be primarily due to faster item-solving processes and, to a limited extent, due to a faster perception of the item, as well as a faster motor response. Moreover, besides the sub-components, it is likely that also the coordination of perceptual, item-solving, and motor processes benefitted from practice. Altogether, the present paper may have taken a first step towards a better understanding of the specific processes that cause the large practice gains in sustained attention tests."

If water or electricity services were to be throttled up and down or commoditized, it would be important for health care leaders to understand and prepare for the resulting disruptions. In 2017, the Federal Communications Commission voted to eliminate consumer protection regulations that stopped Internet service providers from interfering with Internet service put in place under President Bush and maintained during the Obama administration. The elimination of these protections threatens to disrupt the Internet as the platform on which our health care industry builds capacity for health information exchange. The ability of Internet service providers to throttle up and down speed based on their own interests threatens our ability to meet community needs and increases the likelihood of health care disparities, just as would happen if city water providers could ration water based on their own economic interests. Proponents for net in-neutrality argue that not all Internet traffic should be equal. For instance, there could be an advantage for health care if data traffic related to health care operations was prioritized over video streaming a movie or uploading a video, but if health care companies would be required to pay for that speed, there would be financial considerations.

Such activity does not have a characteristic temporal periodicity but can exhibit statistical similarities, most commonly power-law scaling behavior, which is indicative of scale-free dynamics. The recurrence of scaling laws across many different systems and its manifestation in behavior has prompted a search for unifying principles in human brain function. With this in mind, a focused search for abnormities in scale-free dynamics is of considerable clinical relevance to migraine and other clinical pain disorders. Here we examined the scale-free properties of the resting-state fMRI signal in the broadband frequency range known to be related to spontaneous neural activity (0.01-0.1Hz). In a large cohort of episodic migraine patients (N=40), we observed that the strength of long-range temporal correlations in the fMRI signal (captured by the scaling exponent α) was significantly higher in the sensorimotor network compared to healthy controls. Increases in the scaling exponent were positively correlated with fMRI signal variance and negatively correlated with patient's self-reported headache intensity. These changes in the fMRI signal suggest that the temporal structure of amplitude fluctuations carries valuable information about the dynamic state of the underlying neuronal networks and ensuing sensory impairments in migraine. The demonstrated scaling laws pose a novel quantitative approach for examining clinically relevant inter-individual variability in migraine and other pain disorders.",Can self-reported pain characteristics and bedside test be used for the assessment of pain mechanisms?

The aim of this study was to determine to what extent LANSS and NPS data are congruent with findings upon quantitative Sensory Testing (QST).Self-reported presence of dynamic mechanical allodynia (DMA) and descriptors of hot, cold or deep ongoing pain (NPS, LANSS) as well as bedside findings of mechanical allodynia (LANSS) were compared to signs of DMA and thermal hyperalgesia upon QST in 617 neuropathic pain patients.Self-reported abnormal skin sensitivity (LANSS) showed a moderate concordance with DMA during bedside test (67.9%, k=0.391) or QST (52.8%, k=0.165). Receiver operating curve analysis for self-reported DMA yielded similar area-under-the-curve values for LANSS (0.65, CI: 0.59-0.97%) and NPS (0.71, CI: 0.66-0.75%) with high sensitivity but low specificity. Self-reported deep pain intensity was higher in patients with blunt pressure hyperalgesia, but not in patients with DMA or thermal hyperalgesia. No correlations were observed between self-reported hot or cold pain quality and thermal hyperalgesia upon QST.Self-reported abnormal skin sensitivity has a high sensitivity to identify patients with DMA, but its low specificity indicates that many patients mean something other than DMA when reporting this symptom. Self-reported deep pain is related to deep-tissue hypersensitivity, but thermal qualities of ongoing pain are not related to thermal hyperalgesia. Questionnaires mostly evaluate the ongoing pain experience while QST mirrors sensory functions. Therefore, both methods are complementary for pain assessment.",The NLRP2 inflammasome in dorsal root ganglion as a novel molecular platform that produces inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162334,Pain,2019 06 04,"Inflammatory pain hypersensitivity is associated with activation of primary afferent neurons. The present study investigated the existence of the inflammasome in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and the functional significance in the development of inflammatory pain hypersensitivity.Tissue inflammation was induced in male C57BL/6 mice with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or ceramide injection into the hind paw. Behavioral testing was performed to investigate inflammation-induced pain hypersensitivity. Ipsilateral L5 DRG were obtained for analysis. Expression of nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) was analyzed with real-time PCR. Cleaved interleukin (IL)-1β and NLRP2 expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Caspase1 activity was also measured. A caspase1 inhibitor and NLRP2 siRNA were intrathecally administered to inhibit NLRP2 inflammasome signaling in DRG.Cleaved IL-1β expression was significantly increased after CFA injection in small sized DRG neurons. The amount of cleaved IL-1β and caspase1 activity were also increased. Among several NLRs, NLRP2 mRNA was significantly increased in DRG after CFA injection. NLRP2 was expressed in small sized DRG neurons. Intrathecal injection of a caspase1 inhibitor or NLRP2 siRNA reduced CFA-induced pain hypersensitivity and cleaved IL-1β expression in DRG. Induction of cleaved IL-1β and NLRP2 in DRG neurons was similarly observed after ceramide injection. NLRP2 siRNA inhibited ceramide-induced pain hypersensitivity.These results confirmed the existence of NLRP2 inflammasome in DRG neurons. Activation of the NLRP2 inflammasome leads to activation of DRG neurons and subsequent development of pain hypersensitivity in various types of tissue inflammation.",Systematic Review of Oxygenation and Clinical Outcomes to Inform Oxygen Targets in Critically Ill Trauma Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162333,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,2019 06 04,"Oxygen therapy is frequently administered to critically ill trauma patients to avoid hypoxia, but optimal oxygenation strategies are not clear.",Effect of Mass Shootings on Gun Sales - A 20 Year Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162332,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,2019 06 04,"Granular data on gun sales has been historically difficult to obtain.

Clinicians should consider, not only musculoskeletal pathologies, but also vascular and neurological disorders in older patients with foot pain. Fortunately, a majority of patients improve with physiatric, non-operative interventions involving biomechanical analysis, function oriented rehabilitation programs and therapeutic exercise, the use of proper footwear and orthoses, and selected percutaneous interventions, as indicated.

This study aimed to map evidence on methods and procedures of tracheostomy decannulation in adults and assessment of readiness for decannulation, to reveal knowledge gaps and inform further research. We conducted a systematic search of peer reviewed and grey literature on PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Union Catalogue of Theses and Dissertations via SABINET Online, World Cat Dissertations and Theses via OCLC, WHO library and governmental websites from 1985 to present. Following title screening, abstract and full article screening was performed by two independent reviewers guided by the eligibility criteria. Data from included studies were extracted, collated, summarized and synthesized into the following themes: assessment, removal, monitoring and definition of failure of decannulation. Quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool version 2011. Twenty-five out of 51 screened articles were eligible for data extraction. There was wide variation in the assessment methods employed across and within similar patient groups. The common themes that emerged in the assessment for readiness for decannulation are informed consent, clinical stability, airway patency, physiological decannulation, swallowing assessment, level of consciousness, effectiveness of cough and clearance of secretions. In conclusion, the current body of evidence is inadequate and requires further research, particularly validation of different parameters used.

However, its mechanism of action in atrial fibroblasts is unknown. In this study, we investigated the autophagy pathway and molecular changes in angiotensin II (AngII)-stimulated atrial fibroblasts in response to puerarin treatment. Atrial fibroblasts were cultured and then subjected to stimulation with AngII and puerarin or other chemical drugs (3-MA, CQ, and SP600125). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot experiments were used to quantify the expression levels of mRNA and protein. mCherry-GFP-LC3 adenovirus was applied to reflect the autophagic flux. The results showed aggravating levels of autophagy and collagen deposit in the presence of AngII. Puerarin inhibited autophagy and decreased collagen secretion in a dose-dependent manner in atrial fibroblasts. Furthermore, phosphorylation of JNK was down-regulated in response to puerarin, whereas phosphorylation of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was upregulated. Interestingly, reduced autophagy and collagen secretion were observed when the JNK signaling pathway was blocked using SP600125. We also observed upregulation of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation in the presence of SP600125. These results suggest that puerarin exerts its antifibrotic effect in atrial fibroblasts partly through the inhibition of autophagy. Furthermore, the mechanism of action of puerarin in fibroblast autophagy seems to be mediated partly through JNK-Akt-mTOR signaling."

The biological mechanisms leading to BPD are not fully understood, although an arrest in lung development has been implicated. The current study aimed to investigate the occurrence of autophagy in the developing mouse lung and its regulatory role in airway branching and terminal sacculi formation. We found 2 windows of epithelial autophagy activation in the developing mouse lung, both resulting from AMPK activation. Inhibition of AMPK-mediated autophagy led to reduced lung branching in vitro. Conditional deletion of beclin 1 (Becn1) in mouse lung epithelial cells (Becn1Epi-KO), either at early (E10.5) or late (E16.5) gestation, resulted in lethal respiratory distress at birth or shortly after. E10.5 Becn1Epi-KO lungs displayed reduced airway branching and sacculi formation accompanied by impaired vascularization, excessive epithelial cell death, reduced mesenchymal thinning of the interstitial walls, and delayed epithelial maturation. E16.5 Becn1Epi-KO lungs had reduced terminal air sac formation and vascularization and delayed distal epithelial differentiation, a pathology similar to that seen in infants with BPD.

The detection of bone and bone marrow lesions is crucial in the investigation of multiple myeloma and often dictates the decision to start treatment. Furthermore, detection of minimal residual disease is important for prognosis determination and treatment planning, and it has underscored an unmet need for sensitive imaging methods that accurately assess patient response to multiple myeloma treatment. Low-dose whole-body CT has increased sensitivity compared with conventional skeletal survey in the detection of bone disease, which can reveal information leading to changes in therapy and disease management that could prevent or delay the onset of clinically significant morbidity and mortality as a result of skeletal-related events. Given the multiple options available for the detection of bone and bone marrow lesions, ranging from conventional skeletal survey to whole-body CT, PET/CT, and MRI, the International Myeloma Working Group decided to establish guidelines on optimal use of imaging methods at different disease stages.

Successive national and international policy documents emphasise the need to improve preconception health, but resources and action have not followed through with these goals. We argue for a dual intervention strategy at both the public health level (eg, by improving the food environment) and at the individual level (eg, by better identification of those planning a pregnancy who would benefit from support to optimise health before conception) in order to raise awareness of preconception health and to normalise the notion of planning and preparing for pregnancy. Existing strategies that target common risks factors, such as obesity and smoking, should recognise the preconception period as one that offers special opportunity for intervention, based on evidence from life-course epidemiology, developmental (embryo) programming around the time of conception, and maternal motivation. To describe and monitor preconception health in England, we propose an annual report card using metrics from multiple routine data sources. Such a report card should serve to hold governments and other relevant agencies to account for delivering interventions to improve preconception health.",Disentangling strictly self-serving mutations from win-win mutations in a mutualistic microbial community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162049,eLife,2019 06 13,"Mutualisms can be promoted by pleiotropic win-win mutations which directly benefit self (self-serving) and partner (partner-serving). Intuitively, partner-serving phenotype could be quantified as an individual's benefit supply rate to partners. Here, we demonstrate the inadequacy of this thinking, and propose an alternative. Specifically, we evolved well-mixed mutualistic communities where two engineered yeast strains exchanged essential metabolites lysine and hypoxanthine. Among cells that consumed lysine and released hypoxanthine, a chromosome duplication mutation seemed win-win: it improved cell's affinity for lysine (self-serving), and increased hypoxanthine release rate per cell (partner-serving). However, increased release rate was due to increased cell size accompanied by increased lysine utilization per birth. Consequently, total hypoxanthine release rate per lysine utilization (defined as 'exchange ratio') remained unchanged. Indeed, this mutation did not increase the steady state growth rate of partner, and is thus solely self-serving during long-term growth. By extension, reduced benefit production rate by an individual may not imply cheating.",Communication between distinct subunit interfaces of the cohesin complex promotes its topological entrapment of DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162048,eLife,2019 06 04,"Cohesin mediates higher-order chromosome structure. Its biological activities require topological entrapment of DNA within a lumen(s) formed by cohesin subunits. The reversible dissociation of cohesin's Smc3p and Mcd1p subunits is postulated to form a regulated gate that allows DNA entry and exit into the lumen. We assessed gate-independent functions of this interface in yeast using a fusion protein that joins Smc3p to Mcd1p. We show that in vivo all the regulators of cohesin promote DNA binding of cohesion by mechanisms independent of opening this gate. Furthermore, we show that this interface has a gate-independent activity essential for cohesin to bind chromosomes. We propose this interface regulates DNA entrapment by controlling the opening and closing of one or more distal interfaces formed by cohesin subunits, likely by inducing a conformation change in cohesin. Furthermore, cohesin regulators modulate the interface to control both DNA entrapment and cohesin functions after DNA binding.",Compound-V formations in shorebird flocks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162047,eLife,2019 06 13,"Animal groups have emergent properties that result from simple interactions among individuals. However, we know little about why animals adopt different interaction rules because of sparse sampling among species. Here, we identify an interaction rule that holds across single and mixed-species flocks of four migratory shorebird species spanning a seven-fold range of body masses. The rule, aligning with a one-wingspan lateral distance to nearest neighbors in the same horizontal plane, scales linearly with wingspan but is independent of nearest neighbor distance and neighbor species. This rule propagates outward to create a global flock structure that we term the compound-V formation. We propose that this formation represents an intermediary between the cluster flocks of starlings and the simple-V formations of geese and other large migratory birds. We explore multiple hypotheses regarding the benefit of this flock structure and how it differs from structures observed in other flocking species.",Detailed analysis of chick optic fissure closure reveals Netrin-1 as an essential mediator of epithelial fusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162046,eLife,2019 06 04,"Epithelial fusion underlies many vital organogenic processes during embryogenesis.

We performed complementary transcriptomic profiling and show that Netrin-1 (NTN1) is precisely expressed in the chick fissure margin at the fusion plate but is immediately downregulated after fusion. We further provide a combination of protein localisation and phenotypic evidence in chick, humans, mice and zebrafish that Netrin-1 has an evolutionarily conserved and essential requirement for OFC, and is likely to have an important role in palate fusion. Our data suggest that NTN1 is a strong candidate locus for human coloboma and other multi-system developmental fusion defects, and show that chick OFC is a powerful model for epithelial fusion research.",Bedside nursing handover and organisational will to achieve personalisation within an Italian Cardiac SurgeryUnit: the nurses' viewpoint through a qualitative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162044,Professioni infermieristiche,2019 06 04,"Bedside nursing handover may be an efficient way to achieve quality nursing outcomes, supporting the personalization of care.

In this study, we present a first characterization of two proteins with cytotoxic effect in corynebacteria. A putative ribosome-binding protein (AEG80717, CULC809_00177), first annotated in a genome sequencing project of C. ulcerans strain 809, was investigated in detail together with a homologous protein identified in C. diphtheriae strain HC04 (AEX80148, CDHC04_0155) in this study. The corresponding proteins show striking structural similarity to Shiga-like toxins. Interaction of wild-type, mutant and complementation as well as overexpression strains with invertebrate model systems and cell lines were investigated. Depending on the presence of the corresponding genes, detrimental effects were observed in vivo in two invertebrate model systems, Caenorhabditis elegans and Galleria mellonella, and on various animal and human epithelial and macrophage cell lines in vitro. Taken together, our results support the idea that pathogenicity of corynebacteria is a multifactorial process and that new virulence factors may influence the outcome of potentially fatal corynebacterial infections.","Multidrug- and colistin-resistant Salmonella enterica 4,[5],12:i:- sequence type 34 carrying the mcr-3.1 gene on the IncHI2 plasmid recovered from a human.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162025,Journal of medical microbiology,2019 06 04,"A colistin-resistant Salmonella enterica 4, [5],12:i:- sequence type (ST) 34 harbouring mcr-3.1 was recovered from a patient who travelled to China 2 weeks prior to diarrhoea onset.

Our data showed that the years 2013 and 2014 recorded a surge in the recorded number of both cutaneous leishmaniases (CL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases. This surge coincided with the massive internal displacement waves that struck Latakia governorate during that time. Subsequently, after 2015, the number of recorded CL and VL cases gradually decreased. This drop coincided with a reduced influx of internally displaced persons into Latakia governorate.

In this commentary, we draw attention to the limitations and challenges with use of currently available rapid antigen-antibody (Ag/Ab) combination tests for detection of acute HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Laboratory-based HIV-1 Ag/Ab immunoassays are complex, requiring specialized equipment and handling that are currently not affordable in many settings in Africa. The point-of-care Ag/Ab platform on the other hand is easier to deploy and potentially more accessible in resource-limited settings. However, available fourth-generation HIV-1 rapid diagnostic tests have demonstrated poor performance characteristics in field studies where non-B subtypes of HIV-1 dominate. The potential for point-of-care HIV-1 Ag/Ab diagnostics to significantly improve detection of acute HIV infection remains yet to be realized in sub-Saharan Africa.

We have previously reported that the interventions did not reduce diarrhea-associated hospitalization for children aged ≤ 5 years in this trial. We randomly allocated 90 geographic clusters comprising > 60,000 low-income households into three groups: cholera vaccine only, vaccine plus behavior change (cholera vaccine and handwashing plus drinking water chlorination promotion), and control. We calculated reported diarrhea prevalence within the last 2 days using data collected from two different survey methods. The ""census"" data were collected from each household every 6 months for updating household demographic information. The ""monthly survey"" data were collected every month from a subset of randomly selected study households for monitoring the uptake of behavior change interventions. We used binomial regression with a logarithmic link accounting for clustering to compare diarrhea prevalence across intervention and control groups separately for both census and monthly survey data. No intervention impact was detected in the census (vaccine only versus control: 2.32% versus 2.53%; P = 0.49; vaccine plus behavior change versus control: 2.44% versus 2.53%; P = 0.78) or in the vaccine only versus control in the monthly survey (3.39% versus 3.80%; P = 0.69). However, diarrhea prevalence was lower in the vaccine-plus-behavior-change group than control in the monthly survey (2.08% versus 3.80%; P = 0.02).

Twenty-two National Health Service healthcare providers participated in a bespoke survey asking about usual care in their area. RESULTS: All sites offered smoking cessation support; however, service provider and service type varied substantially. In some cases services were not streamlined, meaning that people received smoking cessation counselling from one organisation and smoking cessation medication from another.Clinical implicationsTo better implement the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline PH48, clearer referral pathways need to be implemented and communicated to patients, staff and carers.

However, little attention has been given to the role of adherence to national nutrition guidelines in that context. This study aimed to investigate the prospective association between adherence to the French nutrition guidelines and HA. The authors analysed data from 21 407 participants of the NutriNet-Santé study with a median baseline age of 55·6 years (2009-2014) and initially free of major chronic diseases. HA was defined as not developing major chronic disease, no depressive symptoms, no function-limiting pain, independence in instrumental activities of daily living, good physical, cognitive and social functioning, as well as good self-perceived health. Adherence to guidelines of the French Nutrition and Health Programme (Programme National Nutrition Santé or PNNS) was measured via the PNNS Guideline Score (PNNS-GS), using baseline data from repeated 24-h dietary records and physical activity questionnaires. After a median follow-up of 5·7 years, 46·3 % of participants met our HA criteria. Robust-error-variance Poisson regression revealed that higher PNNS-GS scores, reflecting higher adherence to nutrition recommendations (including both diet and physical activity guidelines), were associated with a higher probability to age healthily (relative riskquartile 4 v. quartile 1 = 1·17 (95 % CI 1·12, 1·22)). Supplementary analyses revealed that this association may, to a small part, be mediated by weight status.

These structures are widely formed and eliminated throughout the whole lifespan via processes termed synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning, respectively. Whilst the first process is needed for ensuring proper connectivity between brain regions and also with the periphery, the second phenomenon is important for their refinement by eliminating weaker and unnecessary synapses and, at the same time, maintaining and favoring the stronger ones, thus ensuring proper synaptic transmission. It is well-known that synaptic elimination is modulated by neuronal activity. However, only recently the role of the classical complement cascade in promoting this phenomenon has been demonstrated. Specifically, microglial cells recognize activated complement component 3 (C3) bound to synapses targeted for elimination, triggering their engulfment. As this is a highly relevant process for adequate neuronal functioning, disruptions or exacerbations in synaptic pruning could lead to severe circuitry alterations that could underlie neuropathological alterations typical of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this review, we focus on discussing the possible involvement of excessive synaptic elimination in Alzheimer's disease, as it has already been reported dendritic spine loss in post-synaptic neurons, increased association of complement proteins with its synapses and, hence, augmented microglia-mediated pruning in animal models of this disorder. In addition, we briefly discuss how this phenomenon could be related to other neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia.",Differential S-acylation of Enveloped Viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161979,Protein and peptide letters,2019 06 04,"Post-translational modifications often regulate protein functioning.

In this review we outline modern methods to study S-acylation of viral proteins and to characterize palmitoyl-proteomes of virus infected cells. The palmitoylation site predictor CSS-palm is critically tested against the Class I enveloped virus proteins. We further focus on identifying the S-acylation sites directly within acyl-peptides and the specific fatty acid (e.g, palmitate, stearate) bound to them using MALDI-TOF MS-based approaches.

Purpose To compare performance of surveillance mammography with breast MRI. Materials and Methods This observational cohort study used prospectively collected data and included 13 266 women age 18 years and older (mean age, 60 years ± 13) with stage 0-III breast cancer who underwent 33 938 mammographic examinations and 2506 breast MRI examinations from 2005 to 2012 in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Women were categorized into two groups: mammography alone (n = 11 745) or breast MRI (n = 1521). Performance measures were calculated by using end-of-day assessment and occurrence of second breast cancer events within 1 year of imaging. Logistic regression was used to compare performance for breast MRI versus mammography alone, adjusting for women, examination, and primary breast cancer characteristics. Analysis was conducted on a per-examination basis. Results Breast MRI was associated with younger age at diagnosis, chemotherapy, and higher education and income. Raw performance measures for breast MRI versus mammography were as follows, respectively: cancer detection rates, 10.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.7, 14.8) versus 8.2 (95% CI: 7.3, 9.2) per 1000 examinations; sensitivity, 61.4% (27 of 44; 95% CI: 46.5%, 76.2%) versus 70.3% (279 of 397; 95% CI: 65.8%, 74.8%); and biopsy rate, 10.1% (253 of 2506; 95% CI: 8.9%, 11.3%) versus 4.0% (1343 of 33 938; 95% CI: 3.7%, 4.2%). In multivariable models, breast MRI was associated with higher biopsy rate (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% CI: 1.9, 2.7; P < .001) and cancer detection rate (OR, 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.7; P = .03) than mammography alone. However, there were no differences in sensitivity (OR, 1.1; 95% CI: 0.4, 2.9; P = .84) or interval cancer rate (OR, 1.1; 95% CI: 0.6, 2.2; P = .70). Conclusion Comparison of the performance of surveillance breast MRI with mammography must account for patient characteristics. Whereas breast MRI leads to higher biopsy and cancer detection rates, there were no significant differences in sensitivity or interval cancers compared with mammography. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

The relationship between histologic findings of ILAs and their influence on patient prognosis remains unknown. Purpose To evaluate the percentage of ILAs at preoperative CT, as measured by radiologists and a computer-aided detection (CAD) software, as a predictor of disease-free survival in patients with lung cancer. Materials and Methods This retrospective study evaluated 217 consecutive patients who underwent complete resection of lung cancer from April 2010 to December 2015. Two radiologists, blinded to the patients' clinical information, scored percentage fibrosis extent and determined whether ILAs and the usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern were present. They assessed ILA progression at follow-up CT. Two pathologists determined the presence of an UIP pattern. Percentage fibrosis extent was also measured by using CAD. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine whether the CAD percentage fibrosis extent was associated with ILA at CT. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the significance of CAD percentage fibrosis extent as a predictor of prognosis. Results The radiologists classified 47 patients with ILAs and 24 patients with a UIP pattern at chest CT. The pathologists detected a UIP pattern in 25 patients. CT abnormalities showed progression over a 2-year period in all patients with histologic evidence of UIP. After adjustment for age, sex, and smoking index, the CAD percentage fibrosis extent was independently associated with ILA (odds ratio: 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1, 4.7; P < .001). After adjustment for age, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (percentage predicted) radiologist-assessed percentage fibrosis extent, and pathologic stage, CAD percentage fibrosis extent was independently associated with worse disease-free survival (hazard ratio: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.6; P < .001). Conclusion Greater computer-aided detection percentage fibrosis extent at preoperative CT independently predicted worse disease-free survival in patients with lung cancer. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Yet, personalized medicine in the 21st century is far from being ""future-proof."" Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and changing human values and preferences, call for anticipatory, rather than reactive, approaches to the governance of precision medicine futures. In this context, anticipatory governance is an innovative approach to understanding technology and innovation futures. Anticipatory governance and its corollary anticipatory ethics on emerging technologies require interdisciplinary collaboration and communication to cultivate shared language, imagination, and orientation toward plausible sociotechnical innovation trajectories. This study reports, for the first time in the literature to the best of our knowledge, an anticipatory governance experiment on ""implementation precision medicine (IPM)"" using scenario analysis and design fiction. Participants were undergraduate students and experts who collaboratively imagined the plausible futures of precision medicine. Given the long history of the precision medicine field, and recent calls for translating big data to real-life clinical applications, implementation was chosen as a key focus area of precision medicine futures. We report here several plausible future innovation scenarios of interest to precision medicine scientists and engineers and researchers in the fields of emerging technology governance, responsible innovation, and social studies of science. Of importance, we found that the playful quality of the design fiction methodology and the pedagogical orientation facilitated by undergraduate student involvement created an engaging creative safe space to build transdisciplinary dialog examining the social and anticipatory ethics dimensions of IPM. Demonstrating the possibilities of such cross-disciplinary dialog and differential expertise, this article is conceptualized and coauthored by all participants further attesting to the importance of co-designing and co-imagining innovation futures in IPM.","An Exploratory Study of Veterinary Professionals' Self-Reported Support of Bereaved Clients Before, During, and After Companion Animal Euthanasia in Southwestern Ontario, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161959,Omega,2019 06 04,"Veterinary professionals are recognized as an important source of support for many veterinary clients, particularly during companion animal euthanasia and end-of-life care. While many veterinary professionals recognize the importance of their role, many also report feeling unsure about what methods of support are most effective. Furthermore, few evidence-based guidelines currently exist to inform veterinary professionals on the support of grieving clients. To begin bridging this gap, this study qualitatively explored how veterinary professionals currently report supporting grieving clients before, during, and after companion animal euthanasia. Findings suggest that veterinary participants in this study strive to be meaningful sources of support for grieving clients and employ an array of support practice to do so. However, opportunities exist for veterinary professionals to better explore clients' needs, expectations, and feelings as they relate to companion animal euthanasia, including offering more grief-related resources and access to professional counseling services.",Samuel Tissot's Traité de l'épilepsie-250 years old.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161958,Journal of the history of the neurosciences,2019 06 04,"A quarter of a millennium ago, Samuel Tissot (1728-1797), a Swiss physician who had achieved a substantial European reputation, authored a monograph entitled Traité de l'épilepsie. The book was translated into several European languages and appeared in various editions over the following 70 years, although an English-language version was never published. In his Traité, Tissot provided a thorough account and critical analysis of the previous relevant literature concerning epilepsy, added data from his own experience in practice, and raised issues, some of which remain important today. The appearance of the book was propitious, occurring during the period of the European Enlightenment, when medicine was increasingly divesting itself of ancient modes of thinking and veneration for the opinions of great names from the remote past. At least in Western Europe, the Traité de l'épilepsie became an intellectual launching pad for the considerable expansion in knowledge of epilepsy that occurred over the century or longer that followed its publication.",Reactivation of Microbial Strains and Synthetic Communities After a Spaceflight to the International Space Station: Corroborating the Feasibility of Essential Conversions in the MELiSSA Loop.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161957,Astrobiology,2019 06 04,"To sustain human deep space exploration or extra-terrestrial settlements where no resupply from the Earth or other planets is possible, technologies for in situ food production, water, air, and waste recovery need to be developed. The Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative (MELiSSA) is such a Regenerative Life Support System (RLSS) and it builds on several bacterial bioprocesses. However, alterations in gravity, temperature, and radiation associated with the space environment can affect survival and functionality of the microorganisms. In this study, representative strains of different carbon and nitrogen metabolisms with application in the MELiSSA were selected for launch and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) exposure. An edible photoautotrophic strain (Arthrospira sp. PCC 8005), a photoheterotrophic strain (Rhodospirillum rubrum S1H), a ureolytic heterotrophic strain (Cupriavidus pinatubonensis 1245), and combinations of C. pinatubonensis 1245 and autotrophic ammonia and nitrite oxidizing strains (Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC19718, Nitrosomonas ureae Nm10, and Nitrobacter winogradskyi Nb255) were sent to the International Space Station (ISS) for 7 days. There, the samples were exposed to 2.8 mGy, a dose 140 times higher than on the Earth, and a temperature of 22°C ± 1°C. On return to the Earth, the cultures were reactivated and their growth and activity were compared with terrestrial controls stored under refrigerated (5°C ± 2°C) or room temperature (22°C ± 1°C and 21°C ± 0°C) conditions. Overall, no difference was observed between terrestrial and ISS samples. Most cultures presented lower cell viability after the test, regardless of the type of exposure, indicating a harsher effect of the storage and sample preparation than the spaceflight itself. Postmission analysis revealed the successful survival and proliferation of all cultures except for Arthrospira, which suffered from the premission depressurization test. These observations validate the possibility of launching, storing, and reactivating bacteria with essential functionalities for microbial bioprocesses in RLSS.",Development of Acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like Syndrome during the Treatment Course with Vemurafenib for Metastatic Melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161956,Ocular immunology and inflammation,2019 06 04,"Purpose: To report on ocular Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH)-like syndrome under vemurafenib treatment for metastatic melanoma. Design: A case report. Method: Description of clinical and imaging manifestations including fundus photography, fluorescein, and indocyanine green angiography. Results: A 46-year-old Thai female was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma of the skin and had been treated with multiple surgical excisions, radiotherapy, and vemurafenib (initial dose 480 mg orally twice daily, subsequently increased to maximum dose of 960 mg twice daily). After 6 months of vemurafenib use, she complained of bilateral redness and photophobia and was diagnosed with bilateral anterior uveitis, which was topically treated. Two weeks later, her visual acuity (VA) sharply deteriorated to 20/80 and counting fingers. Ocular examination at that stage stronly resembled acute VKH disease. She exhibited intraocular inflammation, and her fundus examination revealed bilateral optic disc swelling and serous retinal detachment. Fluorescein angiogram showed disc leakage and multiple pinpoint hyperfluorescence leakage spots and indocyanine green demonstrated multiple hypofluorescent spots. Oral prednisolone 30 mg/day was commenced while vemurafenib medication was ceased. Three weeks later, her vision improved, and serous retinal detachment subsided. However, her cutaneous melanoma recurred. Conclusions: Vemurafenib, a potential adjunct treatment for metastatic melanoma, was complicated by the development of panuveitis, papillitis, and multiple serous detachments. These ocular symptoms were similar to the presentation of acute VKH syndrome.",The persistence versus interchangeability of migraine and tension-type headaches in a 5-year population-based validated survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161955,Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,2019 06 04,The aim of this population-based validated study was to determine the course of tension-type headache and migraine and to evaluate the predictors of persistence.,The Genetic Association of IFN-λs with Human Inflammatory Disorders Remains a Conundrum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161954,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,2019 06 04,"Type III Interferons (IFNs) or lambda IFNs (IFN-λs or IFNLs) although are primarily antiviral cytokines, may have roles to play in shaping immune responses, including those during inflammation.

The mechanism behind these genetic associations is not clear. Appropriate data analysis methods and functional evidence should be complimentarily used to identify the causal variants and mechanisms.","The ""Twitching Technique"": A New Space-Irrespective Laparoscopic Ligation Technique Using a JAiMY Needle Holder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161953,Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques. Part A,2019 06 04,"
Background:
 Laparoscopic intracorporeal sutures and knots require advanced techniques in children. The JAiMY® needle holder (Endocontrol Company, Grenoble, France), a flexible jaw with both clockwise and anticlockwise revolving functions, enables the placement of sutures in very small working spaces. Using this tool, a novel new ligation method, which we named ""twitching technique,"" can be performed. 
Methods:
 To perform the ""twitching technique,"" first grasp the long tail of the thread with the JAiMY and the forceps on the needle side. Then, rotate the tip of the needle holder halfway in either direction and bring the forceps closer to the needle holder to make a ring using the thread. Grasp the thread at the crossing point with the forceps, and then catch the short tail through the ring with the needle holder. 
Results (Case Presentation):
 A 1-year-old boy presented with vomiting because of esophageal hiatal hernia. He was being treated for single ventricle and asplenia at our hospital. Laparoscopic esophageal hiatus plication was performed. Although the working space was extremely limited, the JAiMY and the ""twitching technique"" enabled steady suture placement and ligation. 
Conclusions:
 The ""twitching technique"" is an easy, steady, and safe method for performing ligation in difficult situations and may facilitate the performance of many laparoscopic surgeries in pediatric fields."

Methods: Aqueous humor samples from patients with active uveitis associated with Behçet's disease (BD), sarcoidosis, HLA-B27-related inflammation, and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease and control patients were assayed with a multiplex assay. Results: Comparing all patients to controls, GM-CSF, IL-11, IL-12p40, APRIL, and BAFF were significantly increased, whereas LIGHT was significantly decreased. IL-11 and BAFF were the most strongly upregulated, being elevated 19.7-fold and 14.1-fold, respectively, compared with controls. IL-11 was significantly highest in HLA-B27 uveitis. GM-CSF, IL-11, and IL-12p40 were significantly higher in nongranulomatous uveitis (BD and HLA-B27) than in granulomatous uveitis (sarcoidosis and VKH), whereas APRIL and TWEAK were significantly higher in granulomatous uveitis. Conclusions: IL-11-driven immune responses might be more potent in nongranulomatous uveitis, particularly in HLA-B27 uveitis. BAFF and APRIL might contribute to B cell-driven autoimmune response in uveitis.",Detection and Quantification of the 16SrIV-D Phytoplasma in Leaf Tissue of Common Ornamental Palm Species in Florida using qPCR and dPCR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161934,Plant disease,2019 06 04,"Lethal bronzing disease (LBD) is a lethal decline of various palm species caused by the 16SrIV-D phytoplasma. The disease was described in Texas in 2002 but found in Florida in 2006. Since its introduction, the phytoplasma has spread throughout much of the state. Typically, sampling of infected palms involves taking trunk tissue; however, in some instances this is not possible so alternative protocols are needed. In this study, phytoplasma titers were measured in different leaf tissues of infected palm in order to provide stakeholders with more sampling options. In addition, understanding the phytoplasma distribution in the palm canopy can shed light on the pathogen's biology and aid in vector studies. Three species of palm, Phoenix roebelinii, Sabal palmetto, and Syagrus romanzoffiana, were identified and confirmed positive for infection by qPCR analysis. Leaf tissue from these species that represented different stages of decay were sampled and tested by qPCR and dPCR. For each species, phytoplasma was only detectable in the spear leaf tissue that was connected directly to the apical meristem by both qPCR and dPCR. These data are useful by demonstrating that the 16SrIV-D phytoplasma appears to be restricted to the spear leaf so stakeholders who wish to sample palms but cannot sample trunk tissue due to palm size or lack of permission to drill into the trunk have an alternative tissue type to reliably sample. In addition, this information will help improve vector research by knowing where to collect insects that have a higher probably of possessing the phytoplasma.","Virulence of Puccinia triticina, the Wheat Leaf Rust Fungus, in the United States in 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161933,Plant disease,2019 06 04,"Samples of wheat leaves infected with the leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina, were obtained in 2017 from agricultural experiment station plots, demonstration plots, and farm fields in the Great Plains, the Ohio Valley, the southeastern states, California, and Washington in order to determine the prevalent virulence phenotypes present in the United States. A total of 65 virulence phenotypes were identified among the 469 single uredinial isolates that were tested on 20 near-isogenic lines of Thatcher wheat that differ for leaf rust resistance genes. Virulence phenotypes MBTNB at 11.3% of the overall population, and MCTNB at 7.0%, were the first and third most common phenotypes. Both phenotypes were found mostly in the southeastern states and Ohio Valley region. Phenotype TFTSB at 10.9% was the second most common phenotype and was found mostly in southern Texas. Virulence to leaf rust resistance gene Lr39, which is present in hard red winter wheat cultivars, was highest in the Great Plains region. Virulence to Lr11 and Lr18, which are present in soft red winter wheat cultivars, was highest in the southeastern states and Ohio Valley region. Virulence to Lr21, which is present in hard red spring wheat cultivars, was highest in the northern Great Plains region. The predominate P. triticina phenotypes from the soft red winter wheat regions of the southeastern states and Ohio Valley area differed from those in the hard red winter and hard red spring wheat areas of the Great Plains region. Collections from Washington had unique virulence phenotypes that had not been previously detected.",Spatial Distribution of Soybean Cyst Nematode in Research Plots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161932,Plant disease,2019 06 04,"Soybean cyst nematode (SCN; Heterodera glycines Ichinohe) is a major pathogen of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] in the United States. The spatial distribution of SCN in 10 naturally infested research sites in North Dakota was examined between 2006 and 2009. Egg densities were measured in plots and expressed as arithmetic means or grouped into classes using two categorical scales based on the effect of SCN on yield. Data were used to determine spatial distribution, egg cluster sizes, minimum plot sizes, and replications in field experiments. SCN populations varied among plots from undetected to 25,800 eggs/100 cm3 of soil, and differences between adjacent plots were as high as sixfold. Mean to median ratios and Lloyd's index of patchiness suggested an aggregated distribution in nine of the 10 sites. SCN cluster sizes varied in five of the 10 sites and optimum plot size over all sites varied depending on calculation methods. The minimum number of replications needed to detect specific differences among plots varied between field sites. Grouping data into either of the two categories generally increased the ability to detect differences between plots. The spatial distribution of SCN can be a critical factor affecting design and outcomes of field experiments.",Effects of SHAM on the Sensitivity of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea to QoI Fungicides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161931,Plant disease,2019 06 04,"It is a common practice to add salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) into artificial medium in the in vitro sensitivity assay of fungal phytopathogens to the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides. The rationale for adding SHAM is to inhibit fungal alternative oxidase, which is presumed to be inhibited by secondary metabolites of plants. Therefore, the ideal characteristics of SHAM should be almost nontoxic to phytopathogens and have no significant effect on control efficacy of fungicides. However, this study showed that the average effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC50) of mycelial growth values of SHAM were 97.5 and 401.4 μg/ml for Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Botrytis cinerea, respectively. EC50 values of the three QoI fungicides azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, and trifloxystrobin in the presence of SHAM at 20 and 80 μg/ml for S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea, respectively, declined by 52.7 to 78.1% compared with those without SHAM. For the dicarboximide fungicide dimethachlone, the average EC50 values in the presence of SHAM declined by 18.2% (P = 0.008) for S. sclerotiorum and 35.9% (P = 0.012) for B. cinerea. Pot experiments showed that SHAM increased control efficacy of the three QoI fungicides against the two pathogens by 43 to 83%. For dimethachlone, SHAM increased control efficacy by 134% for S. sclerotiorum and 86% for B. cinerea. Biochemical studies showed that SHAM significantly inhibited peroxidase activity (P = 0.024) of B. cinerea and esterase activity (P = 0.015) of S. sclerotiorum. The strong inhibitions of SHAM per se on mycelial growth of B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum and significant influences on the sensitivity of the two pathogens to both the QoI fungicides and dimethachlone as well as inhibitions on peroxidase and esterase indicate that SHAM should not be added in the in vitro assay of sensitivity to the QoI fungicides.",Youth Perspectives regarding the Regulating of Bathroom Use by Transgender Individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161930,Journal of homosexuality,2019 06 04,"Regulations regarding bathroom use by transgender people affect youth across the United States.

Youth were recruited nationally at community events and online; Southeast Michigan was overrepresented. Mixed methods analysis was performed using grounded theory methodology. The majority of respondents (n = 683) were white (71.4%) and had education beyond high school (56.5%). Most (79%) stated that bathroom use by transgender people should not be restricted, rationalizing: 1) bathroom use is private and should be a personal decision; 2) choosing bathrooms is a matter of equality, freedom, and human rights; 3) transgender people are not sexual perpetrators; and 4) forcing transgender people to use particular bathrooms puts them at risk. Contrary to the current policy in many schools, respondents do not support restrictions on bathroom use by transgender people.",Effects of Lycopene in Hyperoxia-Induced Lung Injury in Newborn Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161929,International journal for vitamin and nutrition research. Internationale Zeitschrift fur Vitamin- und Ernahrungsforschung. Journal international de vitaminologie et de nutrition,2019 06 04," The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of lycopene on a hyperoxia-induced lung injury model in rat pups. Full-term rat pups were included in the study 12-24 h after delivery. The pups were separated into 4 groups: normoxia control (NC), hyperoxia control (HC), hyperoxia + lycopene (HL), and normoxia lycopene (NL). The normoxia groups were housed in ambient air, and the hyperoxia groups in > 85% O2. HL and NL groups received 50 mg lycopene in oil/kg body weight/day delivered intraperitoneally (i.p.), the other groups received oil alone. On day 11, the rat pups were sacrificed and their lungs removed. Statistically significant injury was observed in all histological parameters measured (MLI, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and apoptosis) in the HC group (HC vs NC, p = 0.001). This injury could not be reversed with lycopene treatment (HC vs HL, 0.05; NC vs HL, p = 0.001). With hyperoxia, statistically significant decreases were observed in biochemical parameters in terms of SOD, MDA, and IL-6 values (HC vs NC: SOD, p = 0.02; MDA, p = 0.043; IL-6, p = 0.001). The use of lycopene did not provide any improvement in these values (HC vs HL, p > 0.05). Hyperoxia or lycopene had no effect on IL-1β and GPx (p > 0.05). When comparing NC and NL groups, negative effects were observed in the group given lycopene in terms of MLI, PCNA, apoptosis, and IL-6 (all parameters, p = 0.001). We observed that 50 mg lycopene in oil/kg body weight/day given via i.p. had no curative effect on the hyperoxia-induced lung injury in newborn rats and may even induce adverse effects.",Bridging the dichotomous gap between expectations and perceptions in quantifying hospice care quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161928,Health marketing quarterly,2019 06 04,"This study uses a fuzzy logic and neural network to ascertain how service quality dimensions of the SERVQUAL model (reliability, assurance, empathy, responsiveness, and tangibility) affect overall customer satisfaction.

We demonstrated that in type I obese humans, shilajit supplementation significantly upregulated extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes in the skeletal muscle. Such an effect was highly synergistic with exercise. The present study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT02762032) aimed to evaluate the effects of shilajit supplementation on skin gene expression profile and microperfusion in healthy adult females. Methods: The study design comprised six total study visits including a baseline visit (V1) and a final 14-week visit (V6) following oral shilajit supplementation (125 or 250 mg bid). A skin biopsy of the left inner upper arm of each subject was collected at visit 2 and visit 6 for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix Clariom™ D Assay. Skin perfusion was determined by MATLAB processing of dermascopic images. Transcriptome data were normalized and subjected to statistical analysis. The differentially regulated genes were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®). The expression of the differentially regulated genes identified by IPA® were verified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Supplementation with shilajit for 14 weeks was not associated with any reported adverse effect within this period. At a higher dose (250 mg bid), shilajit improved skin perfusion when compared to baseline or the placebo. Pathway analysis identified shilajit-inducible genes relevant to endothelial cell migration, growth of blood vessels, and ECM which were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Conclusions: This work provides maiden evidence demonstrating that oral shilajit supplementation in adult healthy women induced genes relevant to endothelial cell migration and growth of blood vessels. Shilajit supplementation improved skin microperfusion.",Guided Imagery for Total Knee Replacement: Responses to an Audiobook Placebo Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161926,Western journal of nursing research,2019 06 04,"The use of a placebo is the gold standard for establishing the efficacy of new treatments in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Placebo treatments are inert; this allows specific effects of the experimental treatment to be separated from nonspecific physiological, psychological, and social effects. The aim of this study was to scrutinize the workings of an audiobook (AB) placebo treatment, which was used in a placebo-controlled, investigator-blinded, RCT of the effect of guided imagery (GI) to improve pain and function in persons undergoing total knee replacement. A secondary analysis of quantitative and narrative data collected during the RCT was performed. The AB treatment provided attention control. Participants in the AB group identified benefits-pleasant get-away, new knowledge, quiet time-out, and inspiration; however, there was also evidence of resentful demoralization, especially in the postoperative period. The use of ABs as a placebo treatment in GI RCTs should be executed with caution."

Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"Since the early 1990s, ocean temperatures have increased and blooms of the icthyotoxic dinoflagellate Cochlodinium polykrikoides (a.k.a. Margalefidinium polykrikoides) have become more widespread across the Northern Hemisphere. This study used high-resolution (1-30 km), satellite-based sea surface temperature records since 1982 to model trends in growth and bloom season length for strains of C. polykrikoides inhabiting North American and East Asian coastlines to understand how warming has altered blooms in these regions. Methods provided approximately 180× greater spatial resolution than previous studies of the impacts of warming on harmful algae, providing novel insight into near shore, coastal environments. Along the US East Coast, significant increases in potential growth rates and bloom season length for North American ribotypes were observed with bloom-favourable conditions becoming established earlier and persisting longer from Chesapeake Bay through Cape Cod, areas where blooms have become newly established and/or intensified this century. Within the Sea of Japan, modelled mean potential growth rates and bloom season length of East Asian ribotypes displayed a significant positive correlation with rising sea surface temperatures since 1982, a period during which observed maximal cell densities of C. polykrikoides blooms have significantly increased. Results suggest that warming has contributed, in part, to altering the phenology of C. polykrikoides populations, potentially expanding its realized niche in temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere.",Sexual antagonism drives the displacement of polymorphism across gene regulatory cascades.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161912,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"Males and females have different reproductive roles and are often subject to contrasting selection pressures. This sexual antagonism can lead, at a given locus, to different alleles being favoured in each sex and, consequently, to genetic variation being maintained in a population. Although the presence of sexually antagonistic (SA) polymorphisms has been documented across a range of species, their evolutionary dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we study SA selection on gene expression, which is fundamental to sexual dimorphism, via the evolution of regulatory binding sites. We show that for sites longer than 1 nucleotide, expression polymorphism is maintained only when intermediate expression levels are deleterious to both sexes. We then show that, in a regulatory cascade, expression polymorphism tends to become displaced over evolutionary time from the target of SA selection to upstream regulators. Our results have consequences for understanding the evolution of sexual dimorphism, and provide specific empirical predictions for the regulatory architecture of genes under SA selection.",Habitat preference modulates trans-oceanic dispersal in a terrestrial vertebrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161911,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"The importance of long-distance dispersal (LDD) in shaping geographical distributions has been debated since the nineteenth century. In terrestrial vertebrates, LDD events across large water bodies are considered highly improbable, but organismal traits affecting dispersal capacity are generally not taken into account. Here, we focus on a recent lizard radiation and combine a summary-coalescent species tree based on 1225 exons with a probabilistic model that links dispersal capacity to an evolving trait, to investigate whether ecological specialization has influenced the probability of trans-oceanic dispersal. Cryptoblepharus species that occur in coastal habitats have on average dispersed 13 to 14 times more frequently than non-coastal species and coastal specialization has, therefore, led to an extraordinarily widespread distribution that includes multiple continents and distant island archipelagoes. Furthermore, their presence across the Pacific substantially predates the age of human colonization and we can explicitly reject the possibility that these patterns are solely shaped by human-mediated dispersal. Overall, by combining new analytical methods with a comprehensive phylogenomic dataset, we use a quantitative framework to show how coastal specialization can influence dispersal capacity and eventually shape geographical distributions at a macroevolutionary scale.",Conserving evolutionary history does not result in greater diversity over geological time scales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161910,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"Alternative prioritization strategies have been proposed to safeguard biodiversity over macroevolutionary time scales. The first prioritizes the most distantly related species-maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD)-in the hopes of capturing at least some lineages that will successfully diversify into the future. The second prioritizes lineages that are currently speciating, in the hopes that successful lineages will continue to generate species into the future. These contrasting schemes also map onto contrasting predictions about the role of slow diversifiers in the production of biodiversity over palaeontological time scales. We consider the performance of the two schemes across 10 dated species-level palaeo-phylogenetic trees ranging from Foraminifera to dinosaurs. We find that prioritizing PD for conservation generally led to fewer subsequent lineages, while prioritizing diversifiers led to modestly more subsequent diversity, compared with random sets of lineages. Importantly for conservation, the tree shape when decisions are made cannot predict which scheme will be most successful. These patterns are inconsistent with the notion that long-lived lineages are the source of new species. While there may be sound reasons for prioritizing PD for conservation, long-term species production might not be one of them.",Geographical and host species barriers differentially affect generalist and specialist parasite community structure in a tropical sky-island archipelago.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161909,Proceedings.

By contrast, birds on continental islands share long coevolutionary histories with both Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, and are thus ideal model systems to elucidate eco-evolutionary endpoints associated with these parasites in oceanic islands. Here, we examine eco-evolutionary dynamics of avian haemosporidian in the Shola sky-island archipelago of the Western Ghats, India. Our analyses reveal that compared to Plasmodium, Haemoproteus lineages were highly host-specific and diversified via co-speciation with their hosts. We show that community structure of host-generalist Plasmodium was primarily driven by geographical factors (e.g. biogeographic barriers), while that of host-specialist Haemoproteus was driven by host species barriers (e.g. phylogenetic distance). Consequently, a few host species can harbour a high diversity of Plasmodium lineages which, in turn, are capable of infecting multiple host species. These two mechanisms can act in concert to increase the risk of introduction, establishment, and emergence of novel Plasmodium lineages in island systems.",High-fidelity copying is not necessarily the key to cumulative cultural evolution: a study in monkeys and children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161908,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"The unique cumulative nature of human culture has often been explained by high-fidelity copying mechanisms found only in human social learning. However, transmission chain experiments in human and non-human primates suggest that cumulative cultural evolution (CCE) might not necessarily depend on high-fidelity copying after all. In this study, we test whether defining properties of CCE can emerge in a non-copying task. We performed transmission chain experiments in Guinea baboons and human children where individuals observed and produced visual patterns composed of four squares on touchscreen devices. In order to be rewarded, participants had to avoid touching squares that were touched by a previous participant. In other words, they were rewarded for innovation rather than copying. Results nevertheless exhibited fundamental properties of CCE: an increase over generations in task performance and the emergence of systematic structure. However, these properties arose from different mechanisms across species: children, unlike baboons, converged in behaviour over generations by copying specific patterns in a different location, thus introducing alternative copying mechanisms into the non-copying task. In children, prior biases towards specific shapes led to convergence in behaviour across chains, while baboon chains showed signs of lineage specificity. We conclude that CCE can result from mechanisms with varying degrees of fidelity in transmission and thus that high-fidelity copying is not necessarily the key to CCE.",CRISPR/CAS9 mutagenesis of a single r-opsin gene blocks phototaxis in a marine larva.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161907,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"Many marine animals depend upon a larval phase of their life cycle to locate suitable habitat, and larvae use light detection to influence swimming behaviour and dispersal. Light detection is mediated by the opsin genes, which encode light-sensitive transmembrane proteins. Previous studies suggest that r-opsins in the eyes mediate locomotory behaviour in marine protostomes, but few have provided direct evidence through gene mutagenesis. Larvae of the marine annelid Capitella teleta have simple eyespots and are positively phototactic, although the molecular components that mediate this behaviour are unknown. Here, we characterize the spatio-temporal expression of the rhabdomeric opsin genes in C. teleta and show that a single rhabdomeric opsin gene, Ct-r-opsin1, is expressed in the larval photoreceptor cells. To investigate its function, Ct-r-opsin1 was disrupted using CRISPR/CAS9 mutagenesis. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing demonstrated efficient editing of the Ct-r-opsin1 locus. In addition, the pattern of Ct-r-opsin1 expression in photoreceptor cells was altered. Notably, there was a significant decrease in larval phototaxis, although the eyespot photoreceptor cell and associated pigment cell formed normally and persisted in Ct-r-opsin1-mutant animals. The loss of phototaxis owing to mutations in Ct-r-opsin1 is similar to that observed when the entire photoreceptor and pigment cell are deleted, demonstrating that a single r-opsin gene is sufficient to mediate phototaxis in C. teleta. These results establish the feasibility of gene editing in animals like C. teleta, and extend previous work on the development, evolution and function of the C. teleta visual system . Our study represents one example of disruption of animal behaviour by gene editing through CRISPR/CAS9 mutagenesis, and has broad implications for performing genome editing studies in a wide variety of other understudied animals.",Environmental heterogeneity decreases reproductive success via effects on foraging behaviour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161906,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"Environmental heterogeneity shapes the uneven distribution of resources available to foragers, and is ubiquitous in nature. Optimal foraging theory predicts that an animal's ability to exploit resource patches is key to foraging success. However, the potential fitness costs and benefits of foraging in a heterogeneous environment are difficult to measure empirically. Heterogeneity may provide higher-quality foraging opportunities, or alternatively could increase the cost of resource acquisition because of reduced patch density or increased competition. Here, we study the influence of physical environmental heterogeneity on behaviour and reproductive success of black-legged kittiwakes, Rissa tridactyla. From GPS tracking data at 15 colonies throughout their British and Irish range, we found that environments that were physically more heterogeneous were associated with longer trip duration, more time spent foraging while away from the colony, increased overlap of foraging areas between individuals and lower breeding success. These results suggest that there is greater competition between individuals for finite resources in more heterogeneous environments, which comes at a cost to reproduction. Resource hotspots are often considered beneficial, as individuals can learn to exploit them if sufficiently predictable. However, we demonstrate here that such fitness gains can be countered by greater competition in more heterogeneous environments.",Efferocytosis perpetuates substance accumulation inside macrophage populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161905,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"In both cells and animals, cannibalism can transfer harmful substances from the consumed to the consumer. Macrophages are immune cells that consume their own dead via a process called cannibalistic efferocytosis. Macrophages that contain harmful substances are found at sites of chronic inflammation, yet the role of cannibalism in this context remains unexplored. Here we take mathematical and experimental approaches to study the relationship between cannibalistic efferocytosis and substance accumulation in macrophages. Through mathematical modelling, we deduce that substances which transfer between individuals through cannibalism will concentrate inside the population via a coalescence process. This prediction was confirmed for macrophage populations inside a closed system. We used image analysis of whole slide photomicrographs to measure both latex microbead and neutral lipid accumulation inside murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (104-[Formula: see text]) following their stimulation into an inflammatory state ex vivo. While the total number of phagocytosed beads remained constant, cell death reduced cell numbers and efferocytosis concentrated the beads among the surviving macrophages. As lipids are also conserved during efferocytosis, these cells accumulated lipid derived from the membranes of dead and consumed macrophages (becoming macrophage foam cells). Consequently, enhanced macrophage cell death increased the rate and extent of foam cell formation. Our results demonstrate that cannibalistic efferocytosis perpetuates exogenous (e.g. beads) and endogenous (e.g. lipids) substance accumulation inside macrophage populations. As such, cannibalism has similar detrimental consequences in both cells and animals.",A natural point mutation in the bitter taste receptor TAS2R16 causes inverse agonism of arbutin in lemur gustation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161904,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 06 04,"Bitter taste enables the detection of potentially harmful substances and is mediated by bitter taste receptors, TAS2Rs, in vertebrates. Few antagonists and inverse agonists of TAS2Rs have been identified, especially natural compounds. TAS2R16s in humans, apes and Old World monkeys (Catarrhini, Anthropoidea) recognize β-glucoside analogues as specific agonists. Here, we investigated responses of TAS2R16 to β-glucosides in non-anthropoid primates, namely lemurs (Lemuriformes, Strepsirrhini). Salicin acted as an agonist on lemur TAS2R16. Arbutin acted as an agonist in the ring-tailed lemur ( Lemur catta) but as an inverse agonist in black lemur ( Eulemur macaco) and black-and-white ruffed lemur ( Varecia variegata). We identified a strepsirrhine-specific amino acid substitution responsible for the inverse agonism of arbutin. In a food preference test, salicin bitterness was inhibited by arbutin in the black lemur. Structural modelling revealed this locus was important for a rearrangement of the intracellular end of transmembrane helix 7 (TM7). Accordingly, arbutin is the first known natural inverse agonist of TAS2Rs, contributing to our understanding of receptor-ligand interactions and the molecular basis of the unique feeding habit diversification in lemurs. Furthermore, the identification of a causal point mutation suggests that TAS2R can acquire functional changes according to feeding habits and environmental conditions."

Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 06 04,"Insects are promising sources of protein and lipid in feeds for farmed animals. In the European Union, the use of insect meal (IM) and insect oil is permitted in fish feed. However, the European Food Safety Authority has highlighted the lack of data regarding the chemical safety of insects and products thereof. In this study, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were fed diets in which fish meal (FM) was partially or fully substituted with IM, resulting in four diets with an FM replacement of 0%, 33%, 66% and 100% by IM. The IM was produced from Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae fed media containing 60% seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum). After 16 weeks of feeding, fish fillet samples were collected. The concentrations of undesirable substances, e.g., heavy metals, arsenic, dioxins, mycotoxins, pesticides, in the IM, the diets and fillets were determined. The concentrations of the analysed compounds in the IM were all below EU maximum levels for feed ingredients, except for arsenic. However, for complete feeds the concentrations of these compounds in the feeds, including arsenic, were all below EU MLs. Arsenic was transferred from seaweed to IM, resulting in arsenic levels in IM similar to what has been documented for FM. Transfer of arsenic from feed to fillet was observed; however, total arsenic concentrations in the fillet significantly decreased when fish were fed diets with more IM and less FM. Arsenic speciation analysis of the diets showed that although total arsenic levels were similar, the arsenic species were different. Arsenobetaine was the major organoarsenic species in the diets containing FM, while in diets containing IM several unidentified arsenic species were detected. The results suggest that the lower feed-to-fillet transfer of arsenic when FM is replaced by IM may be due to the presence of arsenic species with low bioavailability in the IM.","Phylogeny and taxonomy of Podosphaera cerasi, sp. nov., and Podosphaera prunicola sensu lato.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161891,Mycologia,2019 06 04,"Powdery mildew of Prunus spp. is a significant disease in most cherry growing regions of Washington, USA. Powdery mildews on Prunus virginiana and Pr. avium were previously assigned to Podosphaera clandestina s. lat. (= Po. oxyacanthae) or Po. prunicola. In this report, we confirm the presence of two distinct Podosphaera species on these hosts. Phylogenetic analyses of nuc rDNA sequences from the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS) and 28S subunit confirmed the presence of two distinct species. A morphological comparison with type material of Po. prunicola and additional collections demonstrated that the powdery mildew on Pr. virginiana (including var. demissa and var. melanocarpa) is in fact Po. prunicola. The powdery mildew on Pr. avium is genetically, morphologically, and biologically distinct from Po. prunicola and is described here as the new species Po. cerasi. Cross-inoculation experiments confirmed that these two species are host specific. Podosphaera prunicola was unable to colonize Pr. avium, whereas Po. cerasi was unable to colonize Pr. virginiana. Morphological reexamination of numerous specimens identified as Po. prunicola on a broad range of Prunus species suggests that Po. prunicola is probably confined to species in Prunus subgen.Padus (= Prunus subgen. Cerasus sect. Laurocerasus, including sect. Padus), with Pr. virginiana as the principal host. Podosphaera cerasi occurs on hosts in Prunus subgen.

Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 06 04,"Mussels, a marine filter organism, constitute a food product and an established sentinel organism for marine pollution. An analytical method following a QuEChERS extraction and clean-up protocol has been developed for the determination of phthalic acid esters (PAE), including di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), di-(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di-methyl phthalate (DMP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), as well as 3,4-dichloroaniline and 3,5-dichloroaniline in lyophilised mussels samples. A gradient elution program starting from 40% A (methanol-0.1% formic acid) - 60% B (H2O-0.1% formic acid) up to 100% A was applied, with a total duration of 15 min, at a flow rate of 200 μL min-1 using a 1.8 μm particle size C18 analytical column. All target analytes were detected with a triple quadrupole MS, using electrospray ionisation (ESI) in positive ionisation mode, in SRM mode under optimised conditions. Sample preparation consisted of lyophilisation of the mussels sample and grinding, followed by a QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) protocol. Among the different dispersants evaluated for sample clean-up effectiveness, primary secondary amine (PSA) was found to be the most efficient. Results indicated good chromatographic separation, fast sample preparation procedure, low LODs and LOQs, good trueness expressed as recovery and good precision as evaluated by RSD. In the mussels samples examined DEHP was the most abundant PAE, reaching a maximal concentration of 280 μg/kg of lyophilised weight whereas the levels of DnBP were at approximately 36% of the legal migration limit in foods determined by the EU.",Fellow Eye Deficits in Amblyopia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161888,Journal of binocular vision and ocular motility,2019 06 04,"Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of the visual system, as a result of discordant visual experience during infancy or early childhood. Because amblyopia is typically defined as monocularly reduced visual acuity accompanied by one or more known amblyogenic factors, it is often assumed that the fellow eye is normal and sufficient for tasks like reading and eye-hand coordination. Recent scientific evidence of ocular motor, visual, and visuomotor deficits that are present with fellow eye monocular viewing and with binocular viewing calls this assumption into question. This clinical update reviews the research that has revealed fellow ocular motor and visual deficits and the effect that these deficits have on an amblyopic child's visuomotor and visuocognitive skills.

Muscle overuse induces an increase in uric acid, which stimulates the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR). This receptor contains the pyrin domain NLRP-3 inflammasome which when activated, results in the secretion of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of inflammasome activation via the elevation of uric acid level in nociception in a mouse model of muscle pain. The right hind leg muscles of BALB/c mice were stimulated electrically to induce excessive muscle contraction. The left hind leg muscles were not stimulated as a control. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds (MWTs), levels of uric acid, IL-1β, and NLRP3, caspase-1 activity, and the number of macrophages were investigated. Furthermore, the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as Brilliant Blue G, caspase-1 inhibitor, and clodronate liposome, on pain were investigated. In the stimulated muscles, MWTs decreased, and the levels of uric acid, NLRP3, and IL-1β, caspase-1 activity, and the number of macrophages increased compared to that in the non-stimulated muscles. Administration of the inhibitors attenuated hyperalgesia caused by excessive muscle contraction. These results suggested that IL-1β secretion and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages produced mechanical hyperalgesia by elevating uric acid level, and xanthine oxidase inhibitors may potentially reduce over-exercised muscle pain.","Development of a synthesis method for odor sesquiterpenoid, (-)-rotundone, using non-heme Fe2+-chelate catalyst and ferric-chelate reductase.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161886,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",2019 06 04,"(-)-Rotundone, a sesquiterpenoid that has a characteristic woody and peppery odor, is a key aroma component of spicy foodstuffs, such as black pepper and Australian Shiraz wine.

To develop a method for the synthesis of (-)-rotundone, we focused on non-heme Fe2+-chelates, which are biomimetic catalysts of the active center of oxygenases and enzymatic supply and regeneration of those catalysts. That is, we constructed a unique combination system composed of the oxidative synthesis of (-)-rotundone using the non-heme Fe2+-chelate catalyst, Fe(II)-EDTA, and the enzymatic supply and regeneration of Fe2+-chelate by ferric-chelate reductase, YqjH, from Escherichia coli.

At the end of the treatment, the animals were anesthetized and the soleus and extensor digitorium longus (EDL) muscles were harvested for the assessment of contractile function and examination of muscle morphology. A subset of animals was used to examine the impact of a single HT session on the expression of genes involved in myogenesis and the regulation of muscle mass. Relative soleus muscle mass was significantly higher in animals exposed to HT at 39ºC as compared to the control group (Control: 0.36±0.01mg/g vs. 39ºC: 0.40±0.01mg/g, p=0.024). Maximal absolute force of the soleus was also significantly higher in animals treated with HT at 37ºC and 39ºC (Control: 274.7±6.6mN, 37ºC: 300.1±7.7mN, 39ºC: 299.5±10mN, p<0.05). In the soleus, but not the EDL muscle, a single session of HT enhanced the mRNA expression of myogenic factors as well as of both positive and negative regulators of muscle mass. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of HT are muscle-specific and dependent on the treatment temperature in a model of PAD.",Heart and musculoskeletal hemodynamic responses to repetitive bouts of quadriceps static stretching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161884,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 06 04,"The role of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity in relation to the repetitive exposure to static stretching (SS) on heart and musculoskeletal hemodynamics in stretched and resting muscles is still a matter of debate. The aim of the study was to determine cardiac and musculoskeletal hemodynamics to repetitive-bouts of unilateral SS. Sympathetic and parasympathetic activity contribution to the central hemodynamics and local difference in circulation of stretched and resting muscles were also investigated. In eight participants, heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), blood flow in passively stretched limb (SL) and control (CL, resting limb) were measured during 5 bouts of unilateral SS (45s of knee flexion and 15s of knee extension). SS increased sympathetic (≈20%) and decreased parasympathetic activity (≈30%) with a prevalence of parasympathetic withdrawal. During SS, HR, CO, and MAP increased by ≈18 BPM, ≈0.29 l∙min-1, ≈12 mmHg, respectively. Peak blood flow in response to the 1st stretching manoeuvre increased significantly (+377±95 ml⋅min-1) in the SL, and reduced significantly (-57±48 ml⋅min-1) in the CL. This between-limb difference in local circulation response to SS disappeared after the 2nd SS bout. These results indicate that heart hemodynamic responses to SS are primarily influenced by the parasympathetic withdrawal rather than by the increase in sympathetic activity. The balance between neural and local factors contributing to blood flow regulation was affected by the level of SS exposure, likely associated with differences in the bioavailability of local vasoactive factors throughout the stretching bouts."

Cognitive data included composite scores from the WISC-IV. An RCI z-score was calculated for each participant on each composite score based on two different test-retest reliability coefficients.

In all, 27 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in the scoping review. Case studies in the occupational therapy literature have explored phenomena relating to the delivery of intervention, theoretical concepts, clinical reasoning, and education and research methods and were situated in a range of different practice areas and contexts.

However, the extent to which TRPA1 induces nitric oxide (NO) production in CMs, and whether this signaling cascade mediates physiological or pathophysiological events in cardiac tissue remains elusive. Freshly isolated CMs from wild-type (WT) or TRPA1 knockout (TRPA1-/-) mouse hearts were treated with AITC (100 µM) and prepared for immunoblot, NO detection or ischemia protocols. Our findings demonstrate that TRPA1 stimulation with AITC results in phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and endothelial NOS (eNOS) concomitantly with NO production in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Additionally, we found that TRPA1 induced increases in CM [Ca2+]i and contractility occur independently of Akt and eNOS activation mechanisms. Further analysis revealed that the presence and activation of TRPA1 promotes CM survival and viability following ischemic insult via a mechanism partially dependent upon eNOS. Therefore, activation of the TRPA1/Akt/eNOS pathway attenuates ischemia-induced CM cell death."

The transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) has been described as an EGFR-TKI resistance often associated with aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. In this study, we report an unexpected favorable response to etoposide and cisplatin (EP) from an EGFR-mutant patient who developed SCLC transformation at disease progression after the administration of erlotinib with a progression-free survivalof 7.7 months. At disease progression (PD) after erlotinib, rebiopsy showed typical SCLC histology accompanied by positive expressions of CD56, TTF-1, CK7, and synaptophysin. Subsequently, he was switched to standard SCLC treatment regimen EP in combination with erlotinib due to the retention of EGFR 19 del and achieved PR four cycles after the treatment. His disease progressed again 7.7 months after the initiation of EP treatment, with an enlargement of both primary and metastatic lesions.

It is hypothesized that they harbour new bioactive chemicals. This hypothesis is based on the large percentage of currently approved medicines that originated from soil-inhabiting micro-organisms Objectives: To investigate the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of Fusarium solani ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract selected based on its broad spectrum of antimicrobial potential in an overlay experiment with seven other soil fungi strains. Materials and methods: Fungus number 6 (F6), identified by molecular characterization as Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc (Nectriaceae) was selected for studies from eight purified soil fungi due to its superior broad-spectrum antibiotics producing potential following agar overlay experiment. F6 was fermented for 21 d and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of its EtOAc fermentation extract (dose range: 12.5-100 µg/mL) was determined using agar dilution method for Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and anti-inflammatory properties determined using rat-paw (250-500 mg/kg) and xylene induced oedema (250-500 µg/kg) (in Swiss albino rats and mice) models, respectively. The ability of the extract to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme was also determined in vitro using Cayman test kit-760111. Result: The MIC of the EtOAc extract was <12.5 µg/mL for S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. It inhibited xylene induced oedema by 65% compared with 61% observed for diclofenac and was significantly (p < 0.05) better than diclofenac in rat-paw-oedema model within the first phase of inflammation. The extract inhibited COX-1 peroxidase-mediated activities with an IC50 below 5 µg/mL. Conclusions: The extract exhibited strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, warranting further investigations into therapeutic potential of this fungus. This study design can be adapted in soil fungi metabolomic investigations. We report for the first time the potent anti-inflammatory property of the ethyl acetate extract of soil strain of F. solani with a possible mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of COX enzyme.",Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation -effect of dabigatran using automated platelet aggregometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161848,Platelets,2019 06 04,"Dabigatran, a direct oral thrombin inhibitor, has two therapeutic effects: anticoagulation; and antiplatelet activity. In the clinical field, evaluation of the effect of dabigatran on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation is difficult because of fibrin clot formation and platelet aggregation. The aim of this study was to establish a new platelet aggregation method and to investigate the effects of dabigatran on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation with thrombin was performed with automated light transmission aggregometry (CS2400; Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) in 40 healthy subjects. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was performed using thrombin and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), and thrombin-induced fibrin polymerization was inhibited by adding the peptide Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro (GPRP). The effect of dabigatran was then evaluated using the above method. Thrombin at < 0.2 U/mL did not induce platelet aggregation in most normal subjects. Median maximum aggregation percent (MA%) (25th-75th percentile) with 0.5 and 1.0 U/mL of thrombin was 87.0% (79.3-90.8%), and 90.2% (86.5-92.2%), respectively. The anti-platelet effects of dabigatran were then evaluated with these concentrations of thrombin. Dabigatran (final concentration, 2.5-1000 nM) inhibited platelet aggregation by 0.2-1.0 U/mL of thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. Dabigatran showed potent inhibitory effects against platelet aggregation induced by 0.5 and 1.0 U/mL thrombin with half maximal inhibitory concentrations of 10.5 and 40.4 nM, respectively.

Despite the use of chemotherapy and androgen synthesis inhibitors in the castration-resistant setting, this remains a lethal disease. The advent of immune checkpoint blockade has changed the outlook for cancer treatment and survival for several tumors since its first approval in 2011; however, the clinical benefit in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is rather limited. Currently, Sipuleucel-T remains the only immune modality to be approved in CRPC setting. Such immune resistance likely exists due to low immunogenicity of prostate tumor cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this review, we describe the early experiences of immune checkpoint blockade and therapeutic vaccines in CRPC. We then outline strategies currently being implemented to overcome immune resistance, as well as genomic biomarker investigation to identify patients that may harbor more immunogenic tumors.

Distal renal tubular acidosis is an important clinical symptom observed in C.collinus poisoning, and renal V-ATPases may be potential targets of damage. However, a lack of understanding of molecular mediators involved hampers medical management, which is mainly supportive. We hypothesized that C.collinus poisoning induces renal oxidative stress; probably by inducing mitochondrial uncoupling, which compromises V-ATPase activity to ultimately produce distal renal tubular acidosis. This was tested by exposing renal BBMV, kidney cells in culture and Wistar rats to C.collinus poisoning. Exposure to C. collinus aqueous extract resulted in significant elevations in the lipid peroxidation marker, conjugated dienes, in cell culture and in vivo. A significant decrease in mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was observed in kidneys from C. collinus treated animals suggesting that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled. This was accompanied by significant increase in ADP levels and a decrease in proton pump activity. Thus, these results demonstrate that C. collinus poisoning induces oxidative stress which influences proton pump activity, probably due to feedback inhibition by elevated ADP levels because of mitochondrial dysfunction in the rat kidney.",Common pathways and communication between the brain and heart: connecting post-traumatic stress disorder and heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161843,"Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 13,"Psychiatric illnesses and cardiovascular disease (CVD) contribute to significant overall morbidity, mortality, and health care costs, and are predicted to reach epidemic proportions with the aging population. Within the Veterans Administration (VA) health care system, psychiatric illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and CVD such as heart failure (HF), are leading causes of hospital admissions, prolonged hospital stays, and resource utilization. Numerous studies have demonstrated associations between PTSD symptoms and CVD endpoints, particularly in the Veteran population. Not only does PTSD increase the risk of HF, but this relationship is bi-directional. Accordingly, a VA-sponsored conference entitled ""Cardiovascular Comorbidities in PTSD: The Brain-Heart Consortium"" was convened to explore potential relationships and common biological pathways between PTSD and HF. The conference was framed around the hypothesis that specific common systems are dysregulated in both PTSD and HF, resulting in a synergistic acceleration and amplification of both disease processes. The conference was not intended to identify all independent pathways that give rise to PTSD and HF, but rather identify shared systems, pathways, and biological mediators that would be modifiable in both disease processes. The results from this conference identified specific endocrine, autonomic, immune, structural, genetic, and physiological changes that may contribute to shared PTSD-CVD pathophysiology and could represent unique opportunities to develop therapies for both PTSD and HF.

Methods: Carotid ultrasound was prospectively performed, at baseline and during follow-up, in 63 consecutive SLE patients asymptomatic for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 18 volunteer health workers. Serum sCD163 level was determined at baseline using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome was the presence of a carotid plaque. Factors associated with carotid plaques were identified through multivariate analysis. Results: Despite a low risk for cardiovascular events according to Framingham score in both groups (2.1 ± 3.8% in SLE vs 2.1 ± 2.9% in controls; p = 0.416), ultrasound at baseline showed a carotid plaque in 23 SLE patients (36.5%) and two controls (11.1%) (p = 0.039). Multivariate analysis showed that SLE status increased the risk for carotid plaque by a factor of 9 (p = 0.017). In SLE patients, sCD163 level was high (483.7 ± 260.8 ng/mL vs 282.1 ± 97.5 ng/mL in controls; p < 0.001) and independently associated with carotid plaques, as assessed by stratification based on sCD163 quartile values (p = 0.009), receiver operating characteristics (p = 0.001), and multivariate analysis (p = 0.015). sCD163 at baseline was associated with the onset of carotid plaque during follow-up (3 ± 1.4 years) in SLE patients who had no carotid plaque at the first evaluation (p = 0.041). Conclusion: sCD163 is associated with progressing carotid plaque in SLE and may be a useful biomarker for accelerated atherosclerosis in SLE patients at apparent low risk for CVD.",Impact of IL12B Polymorphisms on Genetic Susceptibility and IL-12p40 and IL-23 Serum Levels in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161840,Immunological investigations,2019 06 04,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association of IL12B gene polymorphisms with serum levels of IL-12p40, IL-23 and genetic susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the Bulgarian population. Genotyping for IL12Bpro (rs17860508) and IL12B A/C - 3' UTR (rs3212227) polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods in 125 RA patients and 239 healthy controls. The IL-23 and IL-12p40 serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An association was established between the rs17860508 polymorphism and RA susceptibility in Bulgarian population with an increased frequency of rs17860508 minor allele-2 and homozygous genotype-22 in RA patients. The rs17860508 risk RA genotype-22 was also significantly correlated to elevated serum IL-23 in RA patients. Although, there was no association between the rs3212227 and genetic predisposition to RA, significantly increased serum levels of both Il-12p40 and IL-23 were observed in RA patients with the rs3212227 AA genotype. Furthermore, the distribution of haplotypes and genotype combination in our cohort indicated increased RA risk in individuals carrying the rs17860508/rs3212227 2/A haplotype or 2.2/AC+CC combination, while 1/A haplotype or 1.1/AA combination may be protective for RA. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a functional effect of IL12B polymorphisms on IL-12p40 and IL-23 cytokine levels in RA patients and suggests a leading role for IL12B rs17860508 in the genetic predisposition to RA, while IL12B rs3212227 significantly modify the RA risk in Bulgarian population."

Background:
 Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects nearly 50% of the diabetic population. Advanced glycation end products, measured through skin autofluorescence (SAF), play an important role in the diagnosis and prevention of DPN. To date, however, no relevant study has discussed the relationship between SAF and the Chinese population. 
Objective:
 We conducted this study to evaluate the association between DPN and SAF among the Chinese population. 
Methods:
 In this cross-sectional study, we recruited a total of 820 patients with type 2 diabetes. All of the patients underwent SAF measurements and a nerve conduction study (NCS). Post-SAF characterization, the patients were divided into three groups according to the first and third quartiles of their SAF values (AU) (SAF ≤ 2.2; 2.2 < SAF ≤ 2.7; SAF > 2.7). Based on the results of the NCS, patients were divided into two groups: DPN and non-DPN. 
Results:
 When compared with the non-DPN group (n = 275) with the DNP group. The latter had higher SAF values (2.72 ± 0.55 AU vs. 2.17 ± 0.71 AU, P < 0.01). There were significant differences in age, the percentage of DPN, and NCS parameters, including motor nerve conduction velocity, sensory nerve conduction velocity, distal latency, and sensory nerve action potential among the three SAF groups (p < 0.05). The SAF value was positively associated with DPN (r = 0.11, p < 0.01). After adjusting for all potential confounders, the SAF values were still associated with an increased risk of DPN (odds ratio 5.15; 95% confidence interval [1.48-4.53]) (p < 0.01). A receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that an SAF value >2.57 ng/mL predicts a threefold increased risk of DPN (p < 0.01). 
Conclusions:
 SAF is an independent risk factor for DPN, which might be of potential value for screening DPN in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.",Promoter Polymorphism (-308G/A) of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α) Gene and Asthma Risk: An Updated Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161819,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,2019 06 04,"
Background and Aims:
 The relationship between the promoter polymorphism (-308G/A) of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene and the susceptibility to asthma has been tested in several studies. However, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, we performed an updated meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between this promoter polymorphism of the TNF-α gene and the risk of asthma. 
Methods:
 Fifty case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis which provided 17,937 controls and 9961 asthma patients. The pooled p-value, odds ratio (OR), and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to investigate the strength of the association of this polymorphism of the TNF-α gene with the risk of asthma. The meta-analysis was carried out by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. 
Results:
 The results of our meta-analysis revealed that the TNF-α polymorphism (-308, G/A) was strongly associated with the risk of asthma (p < 0.05 in the allelic, dominant, and recessive models, respectively). In further analyses, based on age group and ethnicity, we observed this association for all subpopulations examined (p < 0.05 in allelic, dominant, and recessive models, respectively). 
Conclusion:
 This large-scale meta-analysis supports a strong association between the TNF-α gene promoter polymorphism (-308G/A) and the development to asthma in both children and adults.","FBXW7 Mutations Promote Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion in Cervical Cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161818,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,2019 06 04,"
Aim:
 Cervical cancer is the most common gynecological cancer. Recent studies have revealed that the F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBXW7) gene, which encodes a subunit of Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase, is frequently mutated in cervical squamous cell carcinomas. In this study, we investigated whether Chinese cervical cancer cells also harbor these mutations. 
Methods:
 Using PCR and sequencing assays, a total of 190 specimens from Han Chinese patients with cervical cancer were analyzed for FBXW7 mutations. 
Results:
 Two FBXW7 mutations (p.R479P and p.L443H), were identified from a study of 145 (1.4%) cervical squamous cell carcinomas. The p.L443H somatic mutation has not been previously reported. Functional assays showed that both of these FBXW7 mutations could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. 
Conclusion:
 A low frequency (1.4%) of cervical squamous cell carcinomas were identified with FBXW7 mutations. We did, however, identify a novel FBXW7 mutation. Our results also demonstrated that the identified FBXW7 mutations could promote cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in cervical cancer cells.",Cross-cultural applicability of the episodic disability framework with adults living with HIV in Ireland: a qualitative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161816,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 06 04,"Purpose: To explore the cross-cultural applicability of the Episodic Disability Framework with people living with HIV in Ireland. Methods: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews. We recruited adults with HIV from a hospital clinic and community-based organization in Dublin, Ireland. We asked participants to describe their health-related challenges, the extent to which these challenges were episodic in nature, and the impact on their overall health. We analyzed data using content analytical techniques. Results: Of the 12 participants (9 men; 3 women), with a median time since HIV diagnosis of 12 years, 83% had an undetectable viral load. Participants described multi-dimensional and episodic health challenges that spanned disability dimensions in the Episodic Disability Framework including: physical, cognitive, and mental-emotional symptoms and impairments, challenges to social inclusion, and uncertainty or worrying about future health with HIV. Contextual factors that exacerbated disability included stigma and fear of HIV disclosure whereas living strategies (lifestyle, positive outlook, resiliency) and social support (family, friends, health services and providers) mitigated disability. Conclusions: The Episodic Disability Framework is pertinent to adults living with HIV in Ireland. Contextual factors are critical for understanding cross-cultural distinctions of the disability experience across varying political, economic, socio-cultural, and environmental contexts and should be considered by rehabilitation professionals to address disability for people with HIV. Implications for rehabilitation The Episodic Disability Framework, originally derived and validated from perspectives of adults living with HIV in Canada, is pertinent to people living with HIV in Ireland. The Episodic Disability Framework can be used to describe disability experienced by people living with HIV, and to better understand the contextual factors that may exacerbate or alleviate dimensions of disability over time. Contextual factors are critical for understanding cross-cultural distinctions of the disability experience across varying political, economic, sociocultural, and environmental contexts, and should be considered by rehabilitation professionals to better address disability for people with HIV.",The Utility of Healthcare Providers' Online Biographies for First-Time Patients: A Year-Long Study within a Clinical Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161815,Health communication,2019 06 04,"Despite recommendations to provide patient-centered care (i.e., empowering patients to take a greater role in their care), healthcare systems still lag behind in helping patients make arguably one of their most important decisions - their initial selection of a primary care provider. While prior highly-controlled, theoretically-guided, experimental research has tested how various presentations of provider information may impact patients' decision-making processes, no studies to date have taken the next step to actually roll out improvements to providers' online information in a real-world healthcare organization and assess their effects. Over the course of a year, the current study made improvements to the website of a health clinic (i.e., adding biographies of primary care providers, & including short video introductions). Post-consultation questionnaires completed by first-time patients revealed patients who naturally viewed online biographies prior to setting appointments indicated less uncertainty - which was mediated through increases in perceived similarity - and were more likely to purposely select their providers. Patients who purposely selected their providers also reported greater patient satisfaction, and were more likely to choose providers with whom they perceived greater similarity. Similarity and patient satisfaction were also positively related. Overall, findings indicate online provider biographies can help patients become more purposive participants in their care, which can lead to greater patient satisfaction.",Consequences of Changing the GOLD Reports (2007-2011-2017) on the Treatment Regimen of Patients with COPD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161814,COPD,2019 06 04,"Detailed treatment regimens for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were developed by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). Every few years the method of classification of COPD severity and the treatment recommendations are significantly revised. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical implications of changing GOLD reports (2007-2011-2017) and the impact that these changes would have on pharmacological treatment regimens of patients with COPD. A group of 500 randomly chosen primary care physicians in Poland each provided information on 10 consecutive patients diagnosed with COPD. This data was used to simulate the therapeutic consequences of the update of the GOLD 2007 report to GOLD 2011 and GOLD 2017. Pharmacological treatment algorithms from the GOLD 2007 report prefer the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and short-acting bronchodilators (60.2% and 50%, respectively). Compared to the GOLD 2007 report, there would be an almost eightfold reduction in the frequency of short-acting bronchodilator using the GOLD 2011 report and over fourfold decrease using the GOLD 2017 report. With each subsequent update of the GOLD report, the frequency of use of ICS would be significantly (p < 0.001) reduced. Pharmacological treatment by the GOLD 2011 and 2017 reports would be dominated by the use of long-acting bronchodilators from the group β2-agonists and muscarinic antagonist groups. Updates from the GOLD 2007 COPD report to GOLD 2011 and 2017 would have a significant impact on everyday clinical practice. Changes would result in a reduction of treatment intensity.",The influence of body dissatisfaction on cardiovascular and strength-based physical activity by gender: a self-determination theory approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161813,Psychology & health,2019 06 04,Physical activity-or lack thereof-is one behaviour that may help explain why individuals who are dissatisfied with their bodies experience poor health outcomes.,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Noninvasive Ventilation with Pressure Support Ventilation and Adaptive Support Ventilation in Acute Exacerbation of COPD: A Feasibility Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161812,COPD,2019 06 04,"Whether the use of adaptive support ventilation (ASV) during noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is as effective as pressure support ventilation (PSV) remains unknown. In this exploratory study, we compared the delivery of NIV with PSV vs. ASV. We randomized consecutive subjects with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) to receive NIV either with the PSV or the ASV mode. The primary outcome was NIV failure (endotracheal intubation, re-institution of NIV within 48 h of discontinuation or mortality). The secondary outcomes were the duration of mechanical ventilation (invasive and noninvasive), the number of NIV manipulations, the visual analogue score (VAS) for physician's ease of use and patient's comfort, and the complications of NIV use. We enrolled 74 subjects (n = 38, PSV; n = 36, ASV; 78.4% males) with a mean (SD) age of 60.5 (9.5) years. The baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. The overall NIV failure rate was 28.4% and was similar between the two groups (PSV vs. ASV: 34.2% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.31). There was a 9% reduction in the intubation rate with ASV. There were six deaths (PSV vs. ASV: 2 vs 4, p =0.311). There was no difference in the secondary outcomes. The application of NIV using ASV was associated with a similar success rate as PSV in subjects with AECOPD. Due to the small sample size, the results of our study should be confirmed in a larger trial.

SPD has been identified as the celebration during which college students consume more alcohol than any other point during the school year. Intervention opportunities can be more successful with an understanding of the factors associated with alcohol consumption at specific times on particular celebrations. This study examined the factors associated with celebration drinking at different time periods on SPD which included perceived descriptive and injunctive norms, the numbers of close friends and acquaintances present, social media relationships, demographic variables, past drinking behavior, and intent to drink on SPD at the three time points of interest. Findings showed variability in the predictive factors on SPD celebration drinking at different times of the day. The theoretical and practical intervention implications of the findings are discussed.",Site-specific metastases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and its impact on survival: a population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161810,"Future oncology (London, England)",2019 06 04,"Aim: Limited data exist on impact of the metastatic sites on survival in patients with metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Methods: Patients with metastatic ICC were identified in the SEER from 2010 to 2015. Results: A total of 981 patients were identified, of this population, liver (57.9%) is the most common site of ICC metastases, followed by lung, bone and brain. Respective median overall survival and cancer-specific survival were 6 and 9 months in entire population. Further analysis suggested that patients treated by surgery to primary and/or metastatic lesions had a better survival outcome than patients had no surgery (p ≤ 0.001). Conclusion: Liver is the most common site for ICC metastases, local treatment such as surgery to primary or metastatic lesions obviously benefit patients."

SGLT-2 inhibitors act in the proximal tubule to reduce glucose reabsorption. They also have mild natriuretic and diuretic effects, combining properties of proximal tubule diuretics and osmotic diuretics, which are expected to reduce BP. Several lines of evidence suggests that SGLT-2 inhibitors produce mild but meaningful reductions in BP and also decrease the incidence of renal outcomes, cardiovascular events and mortality. Thus, recent guidelines for type 2 diabetes suggest that among oral agents to use together with metformin, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be preferred in patients at increased cardiovascular risk, kidney disease or heart failure. This review summarizes current literature on the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on BP, and its potential relationships with cardio- and nephroprotection.",Chemical constituents of the aerial parts of Salvia judaica Boiss. from Jordan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161797,Natural product research,2019 06 04,"Investigation of the chemical constituents of Salvia judaica growing wild in Jordan led to the isolation and identification of 15 known compounds.

To profile the kinetic variation of immune cells and cytokines after exposure to A. fumigatus thoroughly, we established a pulmonary A. fumigatus infection model in temporarily immunosuppressed mice. Materials & Methods: Systematic and kinetic studies of different immune cells and cytokines were performed. Results: We observed that the granulocytes and macrophages recruited to the site of infection played an important role in the infectious phase. There was a significant increase in the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α as well as the chemokines CXCL1, MIP-1α, MIP-2 and CCL5 after infection. IL-10 was found to participate in balancing the anti-inflammatory response in the recovery phases. The immune response mediated by T cells was mainly presented by the Th1-type on day 7 after exposure with a high proportion of IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD44highCD62Llow effector T cells. Conclusion: These kinetic parameters of the immune response might provide diagnostic clues for A. fumigatus infection.","Novel 2,6-diketopiperazine-derived acetohydroxamic acids as promising anti-Trypanosoma brucei agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161793,Future medicinal chemistry,2019 06 04,"Aim: Identification of new, effective and selective trypanocidal agents. Materials & methods: Twelve novel acetohydroxamic acid derivatives based on 2-alkyl-2-aryl-2,6-diketopiperazine scaffolds have been synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their growth inhibitory activity against bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei. Results: All the analogs were remarkably potent inhibitors, with low micromolar to submicromolar activities. Structure-activity relationship studies demonstrated that the presence of an alkyl substituent at the N(4)-position of the 2,6-diketopiperazine ring portion was, in general, beneficial to trypanocidal activity in this series. Conclusion: The highest activity resulted from the introduction of a methyl, n-propyl or n-butyl substituent to the N(4)-position of the parent compound.

M., and Pavlov, I. Nat. Commun. 10, 1225. doi:10.1038/s41467-019-08933-4. Although cortical interneurons are apparently well-placed to suppress seizures, several recent reports have highlighted a paradoxical role of perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in ictogenesis. Here, we use an acute in vivo model of focal cortical seizures in awake behaving mice, together with closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of PV+ interneurons, to investigate their function during seizures. We show that photo-depolarization of PV+ interneurons rapidly switches from an anti-ictal to a pro-ictal effect within a few seconds of seizure initiation. The pro-ictal effect of delayed photostimulation of PV+ interneurons was not shared with dendrite-targeting somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons. We also show that this switch can be prevented by overexpression of the neuronal potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2 in principal cortical neurons. These results suggest that strategies aimed at improving the ability of principal neurons to maintain a trans-membrane chloride gradient in the face of excessive network activity can prevent interneurons from contributing to seizure perpetuation."

Careful evaluation of other hematologic disorders is important in using a well-known oncology treatment. Whereas extreme concentrations of VCR were shown to alter red cell viability, data did not show negative effects in patients treated. Our data show that under conditions of increased hematopoiesis, hemoglobin in the circulation drops rapidly requiring transfusion.

We sampled pollen and fungal spores daily in the air during 2016 using a volumetric spore trap Hirst-type sampler. We used simple linear correlation to investigate the association between pollen and spore counts and daily weather conditions. We found an Annual Pollen Integral of 16,243 pollen day/m3 and an Annual Spore Integral higher 222,365 spore day/m3. We identified 32 pollen taxa and 15 different spores. We found two periods of higher pollen and spore concentrations: March to May and August to October, the latter was the most severe. Spore and pollen concentrations in the air increased at higher temperature and higher relative humidity but decreased at higher precipitation. We detected negative impacts during summer and fall on population health, with 13,454 cases of people who presented diseases related to allergies.

Many survivors experience poor long-term outcomes, including new or worsened neuropsychological impairment, physical disability, and vulnerability to further health deterioration, including recurrent infection, cardiovascular events, and acute renal failure. However, clinical trials and guidelines have focused on shorter-term survival, so there are few data on promoting longer-term recovery. To address this unmet need, the International Sepsis Forum convened a Colloquium in February 2018 on ""Understanding and Enhancing Sepsis Survivorship"". The goals were to identify (1) gaps and limitations of current research, (2) shorter-term priorities, and (3) longer-term priorities for understanding and enhancing sepsis survivorship. Twenty-six experts from eight countries participated. The top short-term priorities identified by nominal group technique culminating in formal voting were to better leverage existing databases for research, develop and disseminate educational resources on post-sepsis morbidity, and partner with sepsis survivors to define and achieve research priorities. The top longer-term priorities were to study mechanisms of long-term morbidity through large cohort studies with deep phenotyping, build a harmonized global sepsis registry to facilitate enrollment into cohorts and trials, and complete detailed longitudinal follow-up to characterize the diversity of recovery experiences.

However, administration an excess of recombinant GnRH protein results in the formation of anti-GnRH. We evaluated the efficacy of the recombinant Salmonella typhimurium flagellin fljB (STF2)-GnRH vaccine in inducing infertility in 17 intact male cats. The first vaccination and a boosting vaccine was injected for examination. Serum was obtained from blood collected at monthly intervals and anti-GnRH antibodies and testosterone concentrations were determined. Six months after the vaccination, testicular samples are obtained and used for histological examination. Compared with sham control group, the injection groups showed an increase in anti-GnRH antibody titers and testosterone concentrations tended to be reduced in the injection groups and increased in the control group. Histological evaluations and Johnsen's testicular biopsy scores revealed testicular hypoplasia in the 2 injection groups. Consequently, normal sexual maturation with sperm production was observed in the control group. In contrast, the cats that received the GnRH vaccine showed weak (2 of 7 cats) or moderate (4 out of 7 cats) dose-dependent infertility effects.

The effective prevention of this disease requires the use of high-quality vaccines to meet the criteria that enable customers to use them simply. The administration of FMD vaccines containing oil-based adjuvants in pigs can induce the formation of granuloma in the muscle of the vaccinated, which makes these vaccines a less preferable option. Therefore, it is important to establish an FMD vaccine and vaccine delivery tool that offers better immunity and safer application. This study compared the immune responses of intramuscular and needleless intradermal vaccination in pigs. When the same amount of an FMD virus (FMDV) antigen was administered to pigs, both the intradermally and intramuscularly vaccinated groups were protected completely against a challenge of the homologous FMDV, but the intramuscularly vaccinated group showed an overall higher level of neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, the formation of granuloma in muscle could be excluded in the intradermally vaccinated group. Of the oil-based adjuvants selected in this study, ISA 207 was effective in eliciting immunogenicity in intradermal vaccination. In conclusion, a new vaccine formula can be chosen for the delivery of intradermal route to exclude the possibility of local reactions in the muscle and generate protective immunity against an FMDV challenge.",Histopathological and microbiological findings in buffalo chronic mastitis: evidence of tertiary lymphoid structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161746,Journal of veterinary science,2019 06 10,"Buffalo mastitis is an important economic problem in southern Italy, causing qualitative/quantitative alterations in milk and resulting in economic losses due to the sub-clinical course and chronic evolution.

Numerous Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from all samples, majority of which were environmental mastitis pathogens. Histological features referable to chronic mastitis were observed in 92% udders. Lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages were found to evolve into aggregates in 48% udders, which often organized to form tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs). A predominance of interstitial CD8+ over CD4+ lymphocytes and, in TLSs, scattered CD8+ lymphocytes in the mantle cells and CD79+ lymphocytes in germinal centers, were evidenced. Environmental pathogens are known to persist and cause chronic inflammatory changes in buffaloes, where CD8+ lymphocytes play an important role by controlling the local immune response. Moreover, the TLSs evidenced here for the first time in buffalo mastitis, could play a role in maintaining immune responses against persistent antigens, thereby contributing in determining the chronic course of mastitis.",Pathogenicity of clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in three chicken breeds from South Korea in 2016/2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161745,Journal of veterinary science,2019 06 10,"In 2016, novel H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus emerged in Korea.

Virulence of Enterococcus spp. is associated with several putative virulence genes including fsr, efm, esp, cylA, cad1, ace, gelE, and asa1. In this study, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the simultaneous detection of these virulence genes in Enterococcus spp. was developed, and detection limits for E. faecium, E. faecalis, and E. hirae were 64.0 pg/μL, 320.0 pg/μL, and 1.6 ng/μL DNA, respectively. Among 80 Enterococcus isolates tested, efm and cad1 were detected in all 26 E. faecium samples, and only cad1 was observed in E. hirae. Additionally, the presence of virulence genes in 25 E. faecalis isolates were 100% for cad1, 88.0% for gelE, 64.0% for fsr, 44.0% for asa1, 16.0% for cylA, and 4.0% for esp. No virulence genes were found in E. gallinarum isolates. A total of 49 isolates were resistant to tigecycline and to at least 2 different classes of antibiotics.

Additionally, we report the prevalence of virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance in Enterococcus isolates from commercial broiler chickens suffering lameness.",An attenuated Salmonella vaccine secreting Lawsonia intracellularis immunogenic antigens confers dual protection against porcine proliferative enteropathy and salmonellosis in a murine model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161742,Journal of veterinary science,2019 06 10,"Porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE) caused by Lawsonia intracellularis (LI) is a global cause for substantial economic losses in the swine industry. Here, we constructed live attenuated Salmonella typhimurium (ST) mutant strains expressing and secreting 4 selected immunogenic LI antigens, namely, optA, optB, Lawsonia flagellin (LfliC), and Lawsonia hemolysin (Lhly); the resultant recombinant strains were designated Sal-optA, Sal-optB, Sal-LfliC, or Sal-Lhly, respectively. Using the BALB/c mouse model, we demonstrate that mice vaccinated once orally, either with a mixture of all 4 recombinant strains or with an individual recombinant strain, show significant (p < 0.05) production of LI-specific systemic immunoglobulin (Ig) G and mucosal IgA responses compared to the Salmonella alone group. Upon restimulation of vaccinated splenocytes with the LI-specific antigens, significant (p < 0.05) and comparable production of interferon-γ responses are found in all vaccinated groups, except the Sal-Lhly group, which shows non-significant levels. Challenge studies were performed in C57BL/6 vaccinated mice. On challenge with the LI (106.9 50% tissue culture infectious dose) 14 days post-vaccination, 20% (1/5) of mice in all vaccinated groups, except Sal-Lhly group, show the presence of the LI-specific genomic DNA (gDNA) in stool samples. In contrast, 40% (2/5) and 60% (3/5) of mice vaccinated with the Sal-Lhly strain and the attenuated Salmonella alone, respectively, were found positive for the LI-specific gDNA. Furthermore, 0% mortality was observed in mice vaccinated against the ST challenge compared to the 30% mortality observed in the unvaccinated control group. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the Salmonella-based LI-vaccines induce LI-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunities, and encompass the potential to offer dual protection against PPE and salmonellosis.",The length of guide RNA and target DNA heteroduplex effects on CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing efficiency in porcine cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161741,Journal of veterinary science,2019 06 10,"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is a versatile genome editing tool with high efficiency. A guide sequence of 20 nucleotides (nt) is commonly used in application of CRISPR/Cas9; however, the relationship between the length of the guide sequence and the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 in porcine cells is still not clear. To illustrate this issue, guide RNAs of different lengths targeting the EGFP gene were designed. Specifically, guide RNAs of 17 nt or longer were sufficient to direct the Cas9 protein to cleave target DNA sequences, while 15 nt or shorter guide RNAs had loss-of-function. Full-length guide RNAs complemented with mismatches also showed loss-of-function. When the shortened guide RNA and target DNA heteroduplex (gRNA:DNA heteroduplex) was blocked by mismatch, the CRISPR/Cas9 would be interfered with. These results suggested the length of the gRNA:DNA heteroduplex was a key factor for maintaining high efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system rather than weak bonding between shortened guide RNA and Cas9 in porcine cells.",Accuracy and precision of measurements performed on three-dimensional printed pelvises when compared to computed tomography measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161740,Journal of veterinary science,2019 06 10,"The preoperative contouring of plates decreases the duration of surgery and improves the quality of the reduction of pelvic fractures. Patient-tailored three-dimensionally printed pelvises might be an interesting tool for achieving that purpose. Currently, no study has evaluated the accuracy of measurements performed on three-dimensional printed models in comparison with computed tomography data for complex bones, such as the pelvis. This study examined whether the measurements obtained on pelvises printed using dual-material fused deposition modeling technology are not significantly different from those obtained on computed tomography images. The computed tomography images of the pelvic region from 10 dogs were used to produce three-dimensionally printed models with a dual-material fused deposition-modeling process. Four segments were measured on both three-dimensionally printed models and computed tomography images. The measurements were performed by three observers and repeated twice. Concordance correlation coefficients were used to assess the precision and accuracy of the measurements as well as evaluate the agreement between the methods. The accuracy of measurements between the methods was > 0.99 for all measurements. The precision was almost perfect for AE (0.996), substantial for BD and BC (0.963 and 0.958, respectively), and moderate for CD (0.912). These results indicate that, despite some minor variations, the measurements performed on printed models reproduced the computed tomography data reliably.",Tidal volume in mechanically ventilated dogs: can human strategies be extrapolated to veterinary patients?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161739,Journal of veterinary science,2019 06 10,"This paper compares and describes the tidal volume (Vt) used in mechanically ventilated dogs under a range of clinical conditions. Twenty-eight dogs requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were classified into 3 groups: healthy dogs mechanically ventilated during surgery (group I, n = 10), dogs requiring MV due to extra-pulmonary reasons (group II, n = 7), and dogs that required MV due to pulmonary pathologies (group III, n = 11). The median Vt used in each group was 16 mL/kg (interquartile range [IQR], 15.14-21) for group I, 12.59 mL/kg (IQR, 9-14.25) for group II, and 12.59 mL/kg (IQR, 10.15-14.96) for group III. The Vt used was significantly lower in group III than in group I (p = 0.016). The thoraco-pulmonary compliance was significantly higher in group I than in groups II and III (p = 0.011 and p = 0.006, respectively). The median driving pressure was similar among the groups with a median of 9, 11, and 10 cmH₂O in groups I, II, and III, respectively (p = 0.260). Critically-ill dogs requiring MV due to the primary pulmonary pathology received a significantly lower Vt than healthy dogs but with a range of values that were markedly higher than those recommended by human guidelines.",Evaluation of fecal microbiomes associated with obesity in captive cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161737,Journal of veterinary science,2019 06 10,"Microorganisms play important roles in obesity; however, the role of the gut microbiomes in obesity is controversial because of the inconsistent findings. This study investigated the gut microbiome communities in obese and lean groups of captive healthy cynomolgus monkeys reared under strict identical environmental conditions, including their diet. No significant differences in the relative abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Prevotella were observed between the obese and lean groups, but a significant difference in Spirochetes (p < 0.05) was noted. Microbial diversity and richness were similar, but highly variable results in microbial composition, diversity, and richness were observed in individuals, irrespective of their state of obesity. Distinct clustering between the groups was not observed by principal coordinate analysis using an unweighted pair group method. Higher sharedness values (95.81% ± 2.28% at the genus level, and 79.54% ± 5.88% at the species level) were identified among individual monkeys. This paper reports the association between the gut microbiome and obesity in captive non-human primate models reared under controlled environments. The relative proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as the microbial diversity known to affect obesity were similar in the obese and lean groups of monkeys reared under identical conditions. Therefore, obesity-associated microbial changes reported previously appear to be associated directly with environmental factors, particularly diet, rather than obesity."

Evolutionary conservation of islet excitability in lower organisms is largely unexplored. Here we show that adult zebrafish islet calcium levels rise in response to elevated extracellular [glucose], with similar concentration-response relationship to mammalian β-cells. However, zebrafish islet calcium transients are nor well coupled, with a shallower glucose-dependence of cytoplasmic calcium concentration. We have also generated transgenic zebrafish that conditionally express gain-of-function mutations in ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP -GOF) in β-cells. Following induction, these fish become profoundly diabetic, paralleling features of mammalian diabetes resulting from equivalent mutations. KATP -GOF fish become severely hyperglycemic, with slowed growth, and their islets lose glucose-induced calcium responses. These results indicate that, although lacking tight cell-cell coupling of intracellular Ca2+ , adult zebrafish islets recapitulate similar excitability-driven β-cell glucose responsiveness to those in mammals, and exhibit profound susceptibility to diabetes as a result of inexcitability. While illustrating evolutionary conservation of islet excitability in lower vertebrates, these results also provide important validation of zebrafish as a suitable animal model in which to identify modulators of islet excitability and diabetes.","Selective Synthesis of Discrete Mono-, Interlocked-, and Borromean Ring Ensembles based on a π-electron deficient ligand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161719,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 06 04,"Herein, we present a new synthetic approach to achieve selective supramolecular transformations and construct different interlocked metallacycles featuring a π-electron deficient thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-derived ligand. In this contribution, we demonstrate that the formation of mono-rings, interlocked rings ([2]catenanes) and Borromean rings can be controlled by adjusting the length of the binuclear half-sandwich RhIII and IrIII building blocks. Furthermore, concentration effect or D-A stacking interaction between pyrene guest and the thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based ligand promotes a unique and reversible conversion between catenane structures and metalla-rectangles.

Soybean WRINKLED1 (WRI1) a and b, with their alternative splicing (AS) products a' and b', are highly expressed in developing seeds and nodules, but their functions in soybean nodulation are not known. GmWRI1a and b differently promoted triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in both Arabidopsis wild-type and wri1 mutant seeds and when they ectopically expressed in the soybean hairy roots. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 15 genes containing AW boxes in their promoters were targeted by GmWRI1s, including genes involved in glycolysis, fatty acid (FA) and TAG biosynthesis. GmWRI1a, GmWRI1b, and b' differentially trans-activated most targeted genes. Overexpression of GmWRI1s affected phospholipid and galactolipid synthesis, soluble sugar and starch contents, and led to increased nodule numbers, whereas GmWRI1 knockdown hairy roots interfered root glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis and resulted in fewer nodules. These phenomena in GmWRI1 mutants were coincided with the altered expression of nodulation genes. Thus, GmWRI1-regulated starch degradation, glycolysis, and lipid biosynthesis were critical for nodulation. GmWRI1 mutants also altered auxin and other hormone-related biosynthesis and -related genes, by which GmWRI1s may affect nodule development. The study expands the views for pleiotropic effects of WRI1s in regulating soybean seed filling and root nodulation. This article is protected by copyright.

In an analysis of the pancreas of patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes, viral antigens and viral receptors were expressed in beta cells, as well as macrophages and T lymphocytes surrounding the beta cells. These findings suggest that the beta cells of patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes are destroyed during an immune response against viral infection of the pancreas. Recently, fulminant type 1 diabetes was induced by treatment with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies, suggesting that immune regulatory mechanisms are also involved in the onset of this disease. We generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes for the first time. We also successfully differentiated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into insulin-producing cells in vitro, and produced a disease model. The proportion of cytokine induced apoptotic cells among INSULIN-positive cells was higher in the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes than in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from healthy control. We performed RNA sequencing in insulin-producing cells differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and are now attempting to identify new biomarkers for the disease.

Silica monolith particles of ca 2.6 μm (volume-based average) have been prepared as the support particles by sol-gel reaction followed by differential sedimentation. The particles were reacted with 3-chloropropyl trimethoxysilane followed by sodium diethyldithiocarbamate to introduce an initiator moiety. Then, the copolymer layer was immobilized via reversible addition-fragmentation transfer polymerization. The resultant phase was packed in glass lined stainless steel micro-columns (1.0 mm x 150 mm) and evaluated for the separation of a mixture composed of five peptides (Trp-Gly, Thr-Tyr-Ser, angiotensin I, isotocin and bradykinin). The effect of monomer mixing ratio (styrene vs N-phenyl acrylamide) on the chromatographic separation efficiency of the stationary phase was examined. The number of theoretical plates (N) as high as 33,600 plates/ column (224,000 plates/ m, 4.46 μm plate height) was achieved using the column packed with the optimized stationary phase. The column-to-column reproducibility based on three columns packed with three different batches of stationary phase was found satisfactory in separation efficiency, retention factor, and asymmetry factor.

Herein, Fumonisin B1 Resistant41 (FBR41), a dominant mutant allele was identified by map-based cloning of Arabidopsis FB1-resistant mutant fbr41, then ectopically expressed in AAL-toxin sensitive tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivar. FBR41-overexpressing tomato plants exhibited less severe cell death phenotype upon AAL-toxin treatment. Analysis of free sphingoid bases showed that both fbr41 and FBR41-overexpressing tomato plants accumulated less sphinganine and phyto-sphingosine upon FB1 and AAL-toxin treatment, respectively. Alternaria stem canker is a disease caused by AAL and responsible for severe economic losses in tomato production, and FBR41-overexpressing tomato plants exhibited enhanced resistance to AAL with decreased fungal biomass and less cell death, which was accompanied by attenuated accumulation of free sphingoid bases and jasmonate (JA). Taken together, our results indicate that FBR41 is potential in inhibiting SAMT-induced PCD and controlling Alternaria stem canker in tomato. This article is protected by copyright.

Malate dehydrogenases (MDHs) catalyze the reversible interconversion of malate and oxaloacetate using NAD(H)/NADP(H) as a cofactor and regulate plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. Vitamin B6 function as essential cofactors in enzymatic reactions involved in numerous cellular processes. However, the role of plastidial MDH in rice (Oryza sativa) in salt stress response by altering vitamin B6 content remains unknown. In this study, we identified a new loss-of-function osmdh1 mutant displaying salt stress-tolerant phenotype. The OsMDH1 was expressed in different tissues of rice plants including leaf, leaf sheath, panicle, glume, bud, root, and stem and was induced in the presence of NaCl. Transient expression of OsMDH1-GFP in rice protoplasts showed that OsMDH1 localizes to chloroplast. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMDH1 (OsMDH1OX) displayed a salt stress-sensitive phenotype. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolic profiling revealed that the amount of pyridoxine was significantly reduced in OsMDH1OX lines compared with the NIP plants. Moreover, the pyridoxine content was higher in the osmdh1 mutant and lower in OsMDH1OX plants than in the NIP plants under the salt stress, indicating that OsMDH1 negatively regulates salt stress-induced pyridoxine accumulation. Furthermore, genome-wide RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated that ectopic expression of OsMDH1 altered the expression level of genes encoding key enzymes of the vitamin B6 biosynthesis pathway, possibly reducing the level of pyridoxine. Together, our results establish a novel, negative regulatory role of OsMDH1 in salt stress tolerance by affecting vitamin B6 content of rice tissues. This article is protected by copyright.

Part A,2019 06 04,"Tissue engineering is one of the most promising areas for treatment of various ophthalmic diseases particularly for patients who suffer from limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) and this is due to the lack of existence of appropriate matrix for stem cell regeneration. The aim of this research project is to design and fabricate triple layered electrospun nanofibers as a suitable corneal tissue engineering scaffold and the objective is to investigate and perform various in-vitro tests to find the most optimum and suitable scaffold for this purpose. Electrospun scaffolds were prepared in three layers. Poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide; PLGA, 50:50) nanofibers were electrospun as outer and inner layers of the scaffold and aligned type I collagen nanofibers were electrospun in the middle layer. Furthermore, the scaffolds were crosslinked by 1-ethyl-3-(3 dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and Glutaraldehyde. Structural, physical, and mechanical properties of scaffolds were investigated by using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle measurement, tensile test, degradation, shrinkage analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Also, capability to support cell attachment and viability were characterized by SEM, MTT assay and DAPI staining. According to the result of BET analysis, specific surface area of electrospun scaffold was about 23.7 m2 g-1. Tensile tests on crosslinked scaffolds represented more suitable hydrophilicity and tensile behavior. In addition, degradation rate analysis indicated that non-crosslinked scaffolds degraded faster than crosslinked one and crosslinking led to controlled shrinkage in the scaffold. The SEM analysis depicted nano-sized fibers in good shape. Also, the in-vitro study represented an improved cell attachment and proliferation in the presence of human endometrial stem cells (hEnSCs) for both crosslinked and non-crosslinked samples. The current study suggests the possibility of producing an appropriate substrate for successful cornea tissue engineering with a novel design. This article is protected by copyright.

This fungus produces astin C, a cyclic pentapeptide with anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties. The production of this secondary metabolite was compared in immobilized and planktonic conditions. For immobilized cultures, a stainless steel packing immersed in the culture broth was used as a support. In these conditions, the fungus exclusively grew on the packing, which provides a considerable advantage for astin C recovery and purification. C. asteris metabolism was different according to the culture conditions in terms of substrate consumption rate, cell-growth, and astin C production. Immobilized-cell cultures yielded a 30% increase of astin C production associate to a 39% increase in biomass. The inoculum type as spores rather than hyphae, and a pre-inoculation washing procedure with sodium hydroxide, turned out to be beneficial both for astin C production and fungus development onto the support. Finally, influence of culture parameters such as pH and medium composition, on astin C production was evaluated. With optimized culture conditions, astin C yield was further improved reaching a five times higher final specific yield compared to the value reported with astin C extraction from Aster tataricus (0.89 and 0.16 mg/g respectively).

The spatial scale of an offset scheme may influence which of these two outcomes is favoured and is an important aspect of the scheme's design. However, how spatial scale influences the trade-off between the preservation of existing habitat and restoration of degraded areas is poorly understood. Here, we used the largest forest offset scheme in the world, which is part if the Brazilian Forest Code, to explore how implementation at different spatial scales may affect the outcome in terms of the area of avoided deforestation and/or regrowth. Allowing offsets over large spatial scales led to a greater area of avoided deforestation and only a small area allocated to regrowth, whilst restricting offsets to small spatial scales led to the opposite pattern. The greatest total area (avoided deforestation and regrowth combined) was directed to conservation when implementing the scheme at small scales, especially in locations that are already highly deforested. To maximize conservation gains from avoided deforestation and regrowth, the design of the Brazilian forest offset scheme should have a ""think local"" focus by restricting the spatial scale in which offsets occur. A ""think local"" strategy could help to ensure that conservation benefits stay localized and promote the recovery of degraded areas in the most threatened forest landscapes.

Prior research suggests that essential aspects of coagulation may be reproduced by simpler models. This evidence motivates a systematic approach to model reduction. We herein introduce an automated framework to generate reduced-order models of blood coagulation. The framework consists of nested optimizations, where an outer optimization selects the optimal species for the reduced-order model and an inner optimization selects the optimal reaction rates for the new coagulation network. The framework was tested on an established 34-species coagulation model to rigorously consider what level of model fidelity is necessary to capture essential coagulation dynamics. The results indicate that a nine-species reduced-order model is sufficient to reproduce the thrombin dynamics of the benchmark 34-species model for a range of tissue factor concentrations, including those not included in the optimization process. Further model reduction begins to compromise the ability to capture the thrombin generation process. The framework proposed herein enables automated development of reduced-order models of coagulation that maintain essential dynamics used to model thrombosis."

In this study, a sesquiterpene lactone, 13-O-acetylsolstitialin A (13ASA), isolated from Centaurea cyanus, showed cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines using standard 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. To find the mechanism of action of cytotoxicity, annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed for evaluation of apoptosis. This process was further confirmed by immunoblotting of anti- and proapoptotic, Bcl-2 and Bax, proteins. Cell cycle arrest was evaluated by measurement of fluorescence intensity of PI dye and further confirmed by immunoblotting of Cdk-4 and cyclin D1. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using the JC-1 and DCFDA fluorescence probes, respectively. These experiments showed that 13ASA is a potent cytotoxic agent, which activates apoptosis-mediated cell death. In response to this compound, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was noticeably increased in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, 13ASA induced cell cycle arrest at subG1 and G1 phases by decreasing protein levels of cyclin D1 and Cdk-4. It was done possibly through the decrease of ΔΨm and increase of ROS levels which induce apoptosis. In conclusion, this study mentioned that 13ASA inhibit the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines through the induction of cell cycle arrest, which triggers apoptotic pathways. 13ASA can be considered as a susceptible compound for further investigation in breast cancer study.",Bip inducer X: an ER stress inhibitor for enhancing recombinant antibody production in CHO cell culture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161665,Biotechnology journal,2019 06 04,"Prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress reduces protein synthesis and induces apoptosis in mammalian cells. When dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a specific monoclonal antibody productivity (q mAb )-enhancing reagent, was added to recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (rCHO) cell cultures (GSR cell line), it induced ER stress and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. To determine an effective ER stress inhibitor, three ER stress inhibitors (BiP inducer X (BIX), tauroursodeoxycholic acid, and carbazole) were examined, and BIX showed the best production performance. Co-addition of BIX (50 μM) with DMSO extended the culture longevity and enhanced qmAb . As a result, the maximum mAb concentration was significantly increased with improved galactosylation. Co-addition of BIX significantly increased the expression level of BiP followed by increased expression of chaperones (calnexin and GRP94) and galactosyltransferase. Furthermore, the expression levels of CHOP, a well-known ER stress marker, and cleaved caspase-3 were significantly reduced, suggesting that BIX addition reduced ER stress-induced cell death by relieving ER stress. The beneficial effect of BIX on mAb production was also demonstrated with another qmAb -enhancing reagent (sodium butyrate) and a different rCHO cell line (CS13-1.00). Taken together, BIX is an effective ER stress inhibitor that can be used to increase mAb production in rCHO cells. This article is protected by copyright.

These resuscitated cells can reconstitute infections; hence, it is imperative to discover compounds which eradicate persister cells. By screening 10,000 compounds directly for persister cell killing, we identified 5-nitro-3-phenyl-1H-indol-2-yl-methylamine hydrochloride (NPIMA) kills Escherichia coli persister cells more effectively than the best indigoid found to date, 5-iodoindole, and better than the DNA-crosslinker cisplatin. In addition, NPIMA eradicated Pseudomonas aeruginosa persister cells in a manner comparable to cisplatin. NPIMA also eradicated Staphylococcus aureus persister cells but was less effective than cisplatin. Critically, NPIMA kills Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by damaging membranes and causing lysis as demonstrated by microscopy and release of extracellular DNA and protein. Furthermore, NPIMA was effective in reducing P. aeruginosa and S. aureus cell numbers in a wound model, and no resistance was found after one week. Hence, we identified a potent indigoid that kills persister cells by damaging their membranes. This article is protected by copyright.

The expression of miR-21-5p was remarkably upregulated in chronic constrictive injury (CCI) rat model. A significant alleviated neuropathic pain development and reduced the expression of cytokines was observed in CCI rat after exogenous injection of miR-21-5p mimic. The dual-luciferase analysis revealed that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3) and chemokines C-C motif ligand 1 (CCL1) was direct downstream target of miR-21-5p. Moreover, silencing of TIMP3 and CCL1 could rescue mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia and cytokine release in CCI rat, suggesting that TIMP3 and CCL1 exert their function by mediating neuroinflammation in neuropathic pain development. Therefore, we have identified a novel miR-21-5p-CCL1/TIMP3-cytokine axis in regulation of neuropathic pain development in CCI rat model, which is valuable for enhancing our understanding of neuropathic pain and developing miRNAs as potential therapeutic options in the future.",Evaluation of Effectiveness of Treatment Paradigm for Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Patients in China-A nationwide prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31161658,Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 06 04,Data of nationwide glycemic control and hypoglycemic treatment patterns in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in China is vacant.

Stimuli-responsive properties of the semi-IPN hydrogels showed remarkable sensitivity to both temperature and pH without limitation in NEMA content. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) as a model drug was efficiently loaded into the hydrogels and the release profiles of drug from them were investigated. The results of in vitro studies showed a quick DOX release in the conditions simulating tumor environment (PBS, pH 6.5, 37 °C) or endosomes/lysosomes (PBS, pH 5.5, 37 °C) compared to simulated human physiological conditions (PBS, pH 7.4, 37 °C). In conclusion, the novel poly(NIPAA-co-NEMA) semi-IPN hydrogels could be a promising candidate for targeted and controlled release of anticancer drugs in drug delivery system (DDS).
