RWPE-1 cells are immortalized, non-tumorigenic, human prostate epithelia that become malignantly transformed into the CAsE-PE line after continuous in vitro exposure to 5μM arsenite over a period of months. For insight into in vitro arsenite transformation, we performed RNA-seq for differential gene expression and targeted sequencing of KRAS. We report >7,000 differentially expressed transcripts in CAsE-PE cells compared to RWPE-1 cells at >2-fold change, q<0.05 by RNA-seq. Notably, KRAS expression was highly elevated in CAsE-PE cells, with pathway analysis supporting increased cell proliferation, cell motility, survival and cancer pathways. Targeted DNA sequencing of KRAS revealed a mutant specific allelic imbalance, 'MASI', frequently found in primary clinical tumors. We found high expression of a mutated KRAS transcript carrying oncogenic mutations at codons 12 and 59 and many silent mutations, accompanied by lower expression of a wild-type allele. Parallel cultures of RWPE-1 cells retained a wild-type KRAS genotype. Copy number analysis and sequencing showed amplification of the mutant KRAS allele. KRAS is expressed as two splice variants, KRAS4a and KRAS4b, where variant 4b is more prevalent in normal cells compared to greater levels of variant 4a seen in tumor cells. 454 Roche sequencing measured KRAS variants in each cell type. We found KRAS4a as the predominant transcript variant in CAsE-PE cells compared to KRAS4b, the variant expressed primarily in RWPE-1 cells and in normal prostate, early passage, primary epithelial cells. Overall, gene expression data were consistent with KRAS-driven proliferation pathways found in spontaneous tumors and malignantly transformed cell lines. Arsenite is recognized as an important environmental carcinogen, but it is not a direct mutagen. Further investigations into this in vitro transformation model will focus on genomic events that cause arsenite-mediated mutation and overexpression of KRAS in CAsE-PE cells.",Mutation of key lysine residues in the Insert B region of the yeast dynamin Vps1 disrupts lipid binding and causes defects in endocytosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009484,PloS one,2019 05 08,"The yeast dynamin-like protein Vps1 has roles at multiple stages of membrane trafficking including Golgi to vacuole transport, endosomal recycling, endocytosis and in peroxisomal fission. While the majority of the Vps1 amino acid sequence shows a high level of identity with the classical mammalian dynamins, it does not contain a pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain). The Dyn1 PH domain has been shown to bind to lipids with a preference for PI(4,5)P2 and it is considered central to the function of Dyn1 in endocytosis. The lack of a PH domain in Vps1 has raised questions as to whether the protein can function directly in membrane fusion or fission events. Here we demonstrate that the region Insert B, located in a position equivalent to the dynamin PH domain, is able to bind directly to lipids and that mutation of three lysine residues reduces its capacity to interact with lipids, and in particular with PI(4,5)P2. The Vps1 KKK-AAA mutant shows more diffuse staining but does still show some localization to compartments adjacent to vacuoles and to endocytic sites suggesting that other factors are also involved in its recruitment. This mutant selectively blocks endocytosis, but is functional in other processes tested. While mutant Vps1 can localise to endocytic sites, the mutation results in a significant increase in the lifetime of the endocytic reporter Sla2 and a high proportion of defective scission events. Together our data indicate that the lipid binding capacity of the Insert B region of Vps1 contributes to the ability of the protein to associate with membranes and that its capacity to interact with PI(4,5)P2 is important in facilitating endocytic scission.",A priority based energy harvesting scheme for charging embedded sensor nodes in wireless body area networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009483,PloS one,2019 05 08,"This research work proposes a novel priority aware schedule based charging algorithm that uses wireless power transfer (WPT) technique in order to charge embedded sensor nodes (SNs) in a wireless body area network (WBAN). Implanted sensor nodes in WBANs require energy for both information extraction and data transmission to the remote controller unit. Thus, energy shortage of these SNs deteriorates due to the data transmission process of the patient health monitoring system. However, continuous operation by means of electromagnetic induction for energy harvesting, obtained from ambient sources, reduces the overall efficiency of the primary unit. With this paradigm in sight, an algorithm demonstrating the modeling of a priority-based mechanism is proposed in order to ensure proper sensor voltage level and to reduce the transmission losses. Medium access control (MAC) protocols are used for inductive powering from the primary unit to the secondary unit in a collision-free centralized scheduling scheme. Therefore, the proposed wireless charging algorithm for implanted SNs in WBAN is designed as per carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) technique. Because of this, the overall power consumption of SNs for certain operation periods, successful charging probabilities for multiple SNs, and instantaneous power requirements are considered as key performance measures of analysis. It is assumed that proper energy storage in both transmitters and receivers can handle channel interference and traffic contention. Simulation results verify that a significant reduction in power consumption for the proposed priority aware algorithm will maintain almost similar output. For this reason, saturating class-C as well as class-E driver circuits have been used to justify the performance in two different circuit topologies. Effects of priority with respect to the full charge period have also been observed for the multi-node system. Furthermore, from performance analysis, it has been demonstrated that the scheduling scheme causes both single MOSFET composed saturating class-C and Lchoke modeled class-E associated driver circuits to be considerably more loss efficient than corresponding existing ones.",Systematic sampling of adults as a sensitive means of detecting persistence of lymphatic filariasis following mass drug administration in Sri Lanka.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009482,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 19,"Sri Lanka's Anti-Filariasis Campaign conducted 5 annual rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) plus albendazole to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) in all endemic districts between 2002 and 2006. Post-MDA surveillance has consistently documented Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaremia (Mf) rates below 1% in all sentinel and spot check sites since that time, and all implementation units easily satisfied WHO's target for school-based transmission assessment surveys (school-TAS) in 2013. However, more detailed studies have identified foci of persistent infection in the large coastal evaluation unit (EU) (population about 0.6 million) in Galle district. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the sensitivity and feasibility of community-based TAS in adults (adult-TAS) and to compare results obtained by adult-TAS with prior school-TAS and molecular xenomonitoring (MX, molecular detection of filarial DNA in systematically sampled mosquitoes) results in this known problem area.",The spatial epidemiology of leprosy in Kenya: A retrospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009481,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 19,"Leprosy elimination defined as a registered prevalence rate of less than 1 case per 10,000 persons was achieved in Kenya at the national level in 1989.

Perceptions of influenza in rural Southern Malawi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009480,PloS one,2019 05 08,"Influenza virus infections cause between 291 243 and 645 832 deaths annually, with the highest burden in low-income settings. Research in high-income countries has examined public understanding of influenza, but there is little information on views and behaviours about influenza in low-income countries. We explored communities' ideas about the severity, causes, prevention and treatment of influenza in Chikwawa district, Malawi. We conducted 64 in-depth interviews with parents of children aged <5 years, and 7 focus groups with community health workers, parents, and traditional healers. Data were analysed thematically and using a framework matrix to compare views between groups. Respondents held varied ideas about influenza, and many were uncertain about its causes and treatment. Some parents, traditional healers and health workers thought influenza was not severe because they felt it did not cause death or limit activities, but others disagreed. Many saw influenza as a symptom of other conditions, especially malaria and pneumonia, rather than as a disease of its own. Most mentioned dust as the main cause of influenza and believed influenza could be prevented by cleaning the home thoroughly. Treatment seeking for influenza followed different stages, usually starting with home remedies followed by purchasing drugs from groceries and then visiting a health centre. Seeking a clinician tended to be triggered by severe symptoms like high fever or difficulty breathing, and suspicions of malaria or pneumonia. Community health workers provide health education for communities, but some lacked understanding of influenza. Our findings suggest uncertainty about the causes and control of influenza among parents and varied levels of understanding among health providers. Strengthening the capacity of community health workers to provide relevant information about influenza prevention and treatment could address parents' interest in further information and support informed health seeking and engagement with future influenza interventions.","A cross-sectional survey on the seroprevalence of dengue fever in febrile patients attending health facilities in Cross River State, Nigeria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009479,PloS one,2019 05 08,"In Nigeria, recent reports suggest that dengue viruses could be a major cause of acute fevers.

Combined treatment with the probiotic strains Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus helveticus in rats has been shown to attenuate caspase-3 activation and depressive-like behaviour together with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present study was designed to determine the respective contribution of these two strains on caspase-3 activity in the limbic system and on depressive-like behaviour. Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four groups: Vehicle, L. helveticus R0052, B. longum R0175 and L. salivarius HA-118, administered orally for 14 days (109CFU daily) before inducing MI by occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 40 min followed by 14 days of reperfusion. Animals were then tested for socialisation, passive avoidance and forced swim test to assess depressive-like behaviour. At day 18 the animals were sacrificed; infarct size was estimated, plasma C-reactive protein concentration and brain caspase-3 activity were measured. Results indicated that infarct size did not vary across the different treatments. Rats treated with B. longum spent more time socializing, learned more rapidly the passive avoidance test and spent less time immobile in the forced swim test compared to the vehicle groups. Caspase-3 activity and plasma C-reactive protein concentrations were reduced in the lateral and medial amygdala as well as in the dentate gyrus of B. longum-supplemented animals. The only significant effect in the two groups receiving Lactobacilli compared to vehicle was that rats receiving L. salivarius learned more rapidly in the step-down passive avoidance test. In conclusion, most of the beneficial effects that we previously reported with the combination of two probiotic strains in our experimentation regarding post-myocardial infarction depression are related to Bifidobacterium longum.","Prevalence, intensity and associated risk factors of soil transmitted helminth infections: A comparison between Negritos (indigenous) in inland jungle and those in resettlement at town peripheries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009476,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 19,"Formerly known as the Malaysian hunter gatherers, the Negrito Orang Asli (OA) were heavily dependent on the forest for sustenance and early studies indicated high prevalence of intestinal parasitism.

Gradually, the OA were relocated to new resettlement areas at the peripheries. The aim of this study was to compare STH infections between Negritos who are still living in the inland jungle with those living in resettlements."

Data were retrieved from 612 studies, published 1973-2013. Results showed that females outperformed (Cohen's d > 0) males in verbal (42 out of 45 countries) and other (28 out of 45 countries) episodic memory tasks. Although all three social progress indicators were, separately, positively associated with the female advantage in verbal episodic memory performance, only population education and employment remained significant when considering the social indicators together. Results suggest that women's verbal episodic memory performance benefits more than men's from education and employment.",In-season internal and external training load quantification of an elite European soccer team.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009464,PloS one,2019 05 08,"Elite soccer teams that participate in European competitions need to have players in the best physical and psychological status possible to play matches. As a consequence of congestive schedule, controlling the training load (TL) and thus the level of effort and fatigue of players to reach higher performances during the matches is therefore critical. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to provide the first report of seasonal internal and external training load that included Hooper Index (HI) scores in elite soccer players during an in-season period. Nineteen elite soccer players were sampled, using global position system to collect total distance, high-speed distance (HSD) and average speed (AvS). It was also collected session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and HI scores during the daily training sessions throughout the 2015-2016 in-season period. Data were analysed across ten mesocycles (M: 1 to 10) and collected according to the number of days prior to a one-match week. Total daily distance covered was higher at the start (M1 and M3) compared to the final mesocycle (M10) of the season. M1 (5589m) reached a greater distance than M5 (4473m) (ES = 9.33 [12.70, 5.95]) and M10 (4545m) (ES = 9.84 [13.39, 6.29]). M3 (5691m) reached a greater distance than M5 (ES = 9.07 [12.36, 5.78]), M7 (ES = 6.13 [8.48, 3.79]) and M10 (ES = 9.37 [12.76, 5.98]). High-speed running distance was greater in M1 (227m), than M5 (92m) (ES = 27.95 [37.68, 18.22]) and M10 (138m) (ES = 8.46 [11.55, 5.37]). Interestingly, the s-RPE response was higher in M1 (331au) in comparison to the last mesocycle (M10, 239au). HI showed minor variations across mesocycles and in days prior to the match. Every day prior to a match, all internal and external TL variables expressed significant lower values to other days prior to a match (p<0.01). In general, there were no differences between player positions. Conclusions: Our results reveal that despite the existence of some significant differences between mesocycles, there were minor changes across the in-season period for the internal and external TL variables used. Furthermore, it was observed that MD-1 presented a reduction of external TL (regardless of mesocycle) while internal TL variables did not have the same record during in-season match-day-minus.",Assessment on reticuloendotheliosis virus infection in specific-pathogen-free chickens based on detection of yolk antibody.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009463,PloS one,2019 05 08,"Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is the most frequent exogenous virus that contaminates attenuated vaccines. Therefore, it is extremely important to select REV-free specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. Generally, REV infection is assessed by detecting REV antibodies in SPF chickens. This present study seeks to evaluate REV infection by replacing serum antibody detection with yolk antibody detection. A cohort of 40 nineteen-week-old SPF chickens were artificially inoculated with REV, with 32 SPF chickens raised in another isolation environment served as a blank control. Eggs and serum from 23-week-old chickens were sampled, and yolks were diluted separately to ratios of 1:150, 1:200, 1:300 and 1:400, which were detected together with serum. We found that the yolk antibody detection findings at a dilution of 1:300 had the highest coincidence rate compared with that based on serum antibody measurements. At a dilution ratio of 1:300 for yolk antibody, 72 chickens were continuously observed for 10 weeks from 25- to 34-weeks-old. Our findings were based on serum antibody or yolk antibody detection, and the evaluation results were completely consistent. Therefore, all serum antibody-positive chickens were yolk antibody-positive, and vice versa. Accordingly, vaccine producers can estimate REV cleanliness in a poultry farm by sampling yolk antibody titers.",Destabilization of chromosome structure by histone H3 lysine 27 methylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009462,PLoS genetics,2019 06 10,"Chromosome and genome stability are important for normal cell function as instability often correlates with disease and dysfunction of DNA repair mechanisms. Many organisms maintain supernumerary or accessory chromosomes that deviate from standard chromosomes. The pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici has as many as eight accessory chromosomes, which are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis, transcriptionally repressed, show enrichment of repetitive elements, and enrichment with heterochromatic histone methylation marks, e.g., trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 or lysine 27 (H3K9me3, H3K27me3). To elucidate the role of heterochromatin on genome stability in Z. tritici, we deleted the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, kmt1 and kmt6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. We combined experimental evolution and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability, both in vitro and in planta. We used whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure, and differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. Analyses of genome and ChIP-seq data in H3K9me3-deficient strains revealed dramatic chromatin reorganization, where H3K27me3 is mostly relocalized into regions that are enriched with H3K9me3 in wild type. Many genome rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in the absence of H3K9me3, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In stark contrast, loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions in vitro, even without large scale changes in gene activity. We conclude that H3K9me3 is important for the maintenance of genome stability because it disallows H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. In this system, H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, generating a ""metastable"" state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome.",Osmolyte accumulation regulates the SUMOylation and inclusion dynamics of the prionogenic Cyc8-Tup1 transcription corepressor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009461,PLoS genetics,2019 06 10,"Environmental stressors can severely perturb cellular homeostasis and compromise viability. To cope with environmental stressors, eukaryotes have developed distinct signaling programs that allow for adaptation during different stress conditions. These programs often require a host of post-translational modifications that alter proteins to elicit appropriate cellular responses. One crucial protein modifier during stress is the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO. In many cases, however, the functions of stress dependent protein SUMOylation remain unclear. Previously, we showed that the conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cyc8-Tup1 transcriptional corepressor complex undergoes transient hyperosmotic stress-induced SUMOylation and inclusion formation, which are important for appropriate regulation of hyperosmotic-stress genes. Here, we show the osmostress-responsive MAP kinase Hog1 regulates Cyc8 SUMOylation and inclusion formation via its role in the transcriptional activation of glycerol biosynthesis genes. Mutations that ablate Cyc8 SUMOylation can partially rescue the osmosensitivity of hog1Δ cells, and this is facilitated by inappropriate derepression of glycerol-biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, cells specifically unable to synthesize the osmolyte glycerol cause transient Cyc8 SUMOylation and inclusions to persist, indicating a regulatory role for glycerol to reestablish the basal state of Cyc8 following adaptation to hyperosmotic stress. These observations unveil a novel intersection between phosphorylation and SUMOylation networks, which are critical for shifting gene expression and metabolic programs during stress adaptation.",Spatio-temporal dynamics of dengue in Brazil: Seasonal travelling waves and determinants of regional synchrony.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009460,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 19,"Dengue continues to be the most important vector-borne viral disease globally and in Brazil, where more than 1.4 million cases and over 500 deaths were reported in 2016. Mosquito control programmes and other interventions have not stopped the alarming trend of increasingly large epidemics in the past few years. Here, we analyzed monthly dengue cases reported in Brazil between 2001 and 2016 to better characterise the key drivers of dengue epidemics. Spatio-temporal analysis revealed recurring travelling waves of disease occurrence. Using wavelet methods, we characterised the average seasonal pattern of dengue in Brazil, which starts in the western states of Acre and Rondônia, then travels eastward to the coast before reaching the northeast of the country. Only two states in the north of Brazil (Roraima and Amapá) did not follow the countrywide pattern and had inconsistent timing of dengue epidemics throughout the study period. We also explored epidemic synchrony and timing of annual dengue cycles in Brazilian regions. Using gravity style models combined with climate factors, we showed that both human mobility and vector ecology contribute to spatial patterns of dengue occurrence. This study offers a characterization of the spatial dynamics of dengue in Brazil and its drivers, which could inform intervention strategies against dengue and other arboviruses.",Temporal pattern separation in hippocampal neurons through multiplexed neural codes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009459,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 28,"Pattern separation is a central concept in current theories of episodic memory: this computation is thought to support our ability to avoid confusion between similar memories by transforming similar cortical input patterns of neural activity into dissimilar output patterns before their long-term storage in the hippocampus. Because there are many ways one can define patterns of neuronal activity and the similarity between them, pattern separation could in theory be achieved through multiple coding strategies. Using our recently developed assay that evaluates pattern separation in isolated tissue by controlling and recording the input and output spike trains of single hippocampal neurons, we explored neural codes through which pattern separation is performed by systematic testing of different similarity metrics and various time resolutions. We discovered that granule cells, the projection neurons of the dentate gyrus, can exhibit both pattern separation and its opposite computation, pattern convergence, depending on the neural code considered and the statistical structure of the input patterns. Pattern separation is favored when inputs are highly similar, and is achieved through spike time reorganization at short time scales (< 100 ms) as well as through variations in firing rate and burstiness at longer time scales. These multiplexed forms of pattern separation are network phenomena, notably controlled by GABAergic inhibition, that involve many celltypes with input-output transformations that participate in pattern separation to different extents and with complementary neural codes: a rate code for dentate fast-spiking interneurons, a burstiness code for hilar mossy cells and a synchrony code at long time scales for CA3 pyramidal cells. Therefore, the isolated hippocampal circuit itself is capable of performing temporal pattern separation using multiplexed coding strategies that might be essential to optimally disambiguate multimodal mnemonic representations.",A benchmark-driven approach to reconstruct metabolic networks for studying cancer metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009458,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 19,"Genome-scale metabolic modeling has emerged as a promising way to study the metabolic alterations underlying cancer by identifying novel drug targets and biomarkers. To date, several computational methods have been developed to integrate high-throughput data with existing human metabolic reconstructions to generate context-specific cancer metabolic models. Despite a number of studies focusing on benchmarking the context-specific algorithms, no quantitative assessment has been made to compare the predictive performance of these methods. Here, we integrated various and different datasets used in previous works to design a quantitative platform to examine functional and consistency performance of several existing genome-scale cancer modeling approaches. Next, we used the results obtained here to develop a method for the reconstruction of context-specific metabolic models. We then compared the predictive power and consistency of networks generated by our method to other computational approaches investigated here. Our results showed a satisfactory performance of the developed method in most of the benchmarks. This benchmarking platform is of particular use in algorithm selection and assessing the performance of newly developed algorithms. More importantly, it can serve as guidelines for designing and developing new methods focusing on weaknesses and strengths of existing algorithms.",Neural crest streaming as an emergent property of tissue interactions during morphogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009457,PLoS computational biology,2019 05 19,"A fundamental question in embryo morphogenesis is how a complex pattern is established in seemingly uniform tissues. During vertebrate development, neural crest cells differentiate as a continuous mass of tissue along the neural tube and subsequently split into spatially distinct migratory streams to invade the rest of the embryo. How these streams are established is not well understood. Inhibitory signals surrounding the migratory streams led to the idea that position and size of streams are determined by a pre-pattern of such signals. While clear evidence for a pre-pattern in the cranial region is still lacking, all computational models of neural crest migration published so far have assumed a pre-pattern of negative signals that channel the neural crest into streams. Here we test the hypothesis that instead of following a pre-existing pattern, the cranial neural crest creates their own migratory pathway by interacting with the surrounding tissue. By combining theoretical modeling with experimentation, we show that streams emerge from the interaction of the hindbrain neural crest and the neighboring epibranchial placodal tissues, without the need for a pre-existing guidance cue. Our model suggests that the initial collective neural crest invasion is based on short-range repulsion and asymmetric attraction between neighboring tissues. The model provides a coherent explanation for the formation of cranial neural crest streams in concert with previously reported findings and our new in vivo observations. Our results point to a general mechanism of inducing collective invasion patterns.",The complex genetic architecture of shoot growth natural variation in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009456,PLoS genetics,2019 05 08,"One of the main outcomes of quantitative genetics approaches to natural variation is to reveal the genetic architecture underlying the phenotypic space. Complex genetic architectures are described as including numerous loci (or alleles) with small-effect and/or low-frequency in the populations, interactions with the genetic background, environment or age. Linkage or association mapping strategies will be more or less sensitive to this complexity, so that we still have an unclear picture of its extent. By combining high-throughput phenotyping under two environmental conditions with classical QTL mapping approaches in multiple Arabidopsis thaliana segregating populations as well as advanced near isogenic lines construction and survey, we have attempted to improve our understanding of quantitative phenotypic variation. Integrative traits such as those related to vegetative growth used in this work (highlighting either cumulative growth, growth rate or morphology) all showed complex and dynamic genetic architecture with respect to the segregating population and condition. The more resolutive our mapping approach, the more complexity we uncover, with several instances of QTLs visible in near isogenic lines but not detected with the initial QTL mapping, indicating that our phenotyping accuracy was less limiting than the mapping resolution with respect to the underlying genetic architecture. In an ultimate approach to resolve this complexity, we intensified our phenotyping effort to target specifically a 3Mb-region known to segregate for a major quantitative trait gene, using a series of selected lines recombined every 100kb. We discovered that at least 3 other independent QTLs had remained hidden in this region, some with trait- or condition-specific effects, or opposite allelic effects. If we were to extrapolate the figures obtained on this specific region in this particular cross to the genome- and species-scale, we would predict hundreds of causative loci of detectable phenotypic effect controlling these growth-related phenotypes."

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 843 elderly residents from east China were enrolled in this study, which included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes and 417 controls. Four SNPs were analyzed by qPCR. Genotype frequencies of the 4 SNPs in FOXO3 of the patients and controls were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. The association between each SNP and clinical indicators was analyzed by linear regression analysis. RESULTS None of the 4 FOXO3 variants, rs13217795, rs2764264, rs2802292, and rs13220810, were associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes compared to controls. However, rs13217795, rs2764264, and rs2802292 were associated with lower blood glucose levels. Notably, further subgroup analysis indicated that the longevity-associated alleles of FOXO3 SNP (rs13217795, rs2764264, and rs2802292) were associated with lower blood glucose levels in women (TC versus TT, -0.724 mmol/L, P=0.005; CC versus TT, -1.093 mmol/L, P=0.03; TC versus TT, -0.801 mmol/L, P=0.002; CC versus TT, -1.212 mmol/L, P=0.001; TG versus TT, -0.754 mmol/L, P=0.004; and GG versus TT, -1.150 mmol/L, P=0.001) but not in men.

This study aimed to explore the genotype and phenotype spectrum of SCN1A gene related epilepsy. Epileptic patients who were treated in the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from January 2015 to July 2018 and identified as having SCN1A mutations by targeted next-generation sequencing were included. Clinical manifestations of all patients were analyzed retrospectively. A total of 24 patients with SCN1A mutations were identified. The age of epilepsy onset ranged from 2 months to 2 years and 9 months. Multiple seizure types were observed. A total of 13 (54.2%) patients had three or more types of seizures. Overall, 16 (66.7%) patients had status epilepticus, 11 (45.8%) patients had fever sensitivity, and nine (37.5%) patients had seizures after vaccination. Moreover, 15 (62.5%) patients showed varying degrees of cognitive and motor development retardation. In addition, two patients had mutations inherited from one of their parents and 22 (91.7%) patients had de novo mutations. The following SCN1A mutation types were identified: missense (16 patients, 66.7%), nonsense (four patients, 16.7%), splice site (one patient), frameshift (one patient), and large deletions (two patients). Overall, 23 of the patients received antiepileptic therapy, of which eight (33.3%) patients had no decrease in seizures and 11 (45.8%) patients had more than 50% decrease in seizure frequency. Three patients had poor response to antiepileptic drug therapy before attempting ketogenic diet, after which seizure frequency decreased by 50%. A total of 10 (41.7%) patients had used sodium channel blockers before accurate diagnosis, all of whom showed ineffective or even aggravated seizure response. SCN1A mutations are associated with a spectrum of seizure-related disorders, ranging from a relatively mild form of febrile seizures to a more severe epileptic encephalopathy known as Dravet syndrome. Early diagnosis of SCN1A mutation-associated epilepsy can aid in appropriate choice of antiepileptic drugs for treatment and reducing adverse sequelae.",Predicting Loading Intensity Measuring Velocity in Barbell Hip Thrust Exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009439,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 04 22,"de Hoyo, M, Núñez, FJ, Sañudo, B, Gonzalo-Skok, O, Muñoz-López, A, Romero-Boza, S, Otero-Esquina, C, Sánchez, H, and Nimphius, S. Predicting loading intensity measuring velocity in barbell hip thrust exercise. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The barbell hip thrust is an increasingly used exercise to target the hip extensors. Direct and indirect measurement of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) to determine the relative load of each exercise is time-consuming; therefore, practitioners may be more in favor of monitoring velocity and determining relative load through velocity-based prediction models for an exercise. This study aimed to assess the relationship between mean velocity (MV) and mean propulsive velocity (MPV) at different relative training loads (%1RM) in the barbell hip thrust exercise. One hundred two male sport science students performed an incremental 1RM testing protocol for the barbell hip thrust exercise, and a linear position transducer measured MV and MPV of the barbell. The 1RM was reached at 0.25 ± 0.03 m·s, and the regression model generated to estimate a relative load showed an acceptable standard error of estimate (7.01 ± 1.05% 1RM and 7.36 ± 1.05% 1RM for MV and MPV, respectively) with a very large explained variance (R = 0.94). These results may have important practical applications for the prescription and monitoring of the accessory exercise of the hip thrust for monitoring training load and predicting 1RM without undertaking a RM test.",Does the Expectancy on the Static Stretching Effect Interfere With Strength-Endurance Performance?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009438,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 04 22,"Bertolaccini, AL, da Silva, AA, Teixeira, EL, Schoenfeld, BJ, and de Salles Painelli, V. Does the expectancy on the static stretching effect interfere with strength-endurance performance? J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Static stretching (SS) may interfere with strength performance. Such interference, however, may be partially attributed to the subjects' or researcher's expectancy about the SS effects. We aimed to examine whether the manipulation of subjects' expectancy of SS on force production could influence strength-endurance during unilateral knee extension exercise. Eighteen strength-trained men were randomly divided into positively biased (PB; N = 09) or negatively biased (N = 09) groups on the possible effects of SS on performance. Subjects' total number of repetitions and total volume of exercise were assessed during strength-endurance tests (4 sets performed to failure at 70% of 1 repetition maximum) performed under 2 different conditions on separate days: Control-no stretching (CON); or SS. Static stretching consisted of 3 sets of 3 stretching exercises, lasting 30 seconds each. Data were analyzed using mixed models. Neither the total number of repetitions nor the total volume was significantly different between the CON and SS conditions, nor for type of bias (all p > 0.05). However, the number of repetitions in the last set of exercise was greater during SS compared with CON for the PB group (p = 0.01). Although previous negative or positive information about SS did not interfere with the total number of repetitions and total volume of exercise, previous positive information about SS improved performance in the last set of exercise. Expectancy therefore may have played a partial role influencing strength-endurance in previous studies.",Dietary Strategies of Modern Bodybuilders During Different Phases of the Competitive Cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009437,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 04 22,"Lenzi, JL, Teixeira, EL, de Jesus, G, Schoenfeld, BJ, and de Salles Painelli, V. Dietary strategies of modern bodybuilders during different phases of the competitive cycle. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Bodybuilders have used a wide array of nutritional strategies over the years. However, most information on the topic is anecdotal, with limited research about the nutritional habits of modern bodybuilders, especially those from new categories. Accordingly, we sought to compare the dietary routines of bodybuilders from the Men's Physique category during ""bulking"" and ""cutting"" phases, while attempting to identify the rationale underpinning these practices. Sixteen experienced male bodybuilding competitors were interviewed during bulking (10-12 weeks before competition) and cutting (1 week before competition) phases, wherein we quantified energy and nutrient intake and determined their rationale and sources of education. Dietary analysis revealed a low carbohydrate intake during bulking, with a further decrease (at p < 0.05) during cutting. A similar decrease (at p < 0.05) from bulking to cutting was shown in the intake of most macronutrients and micronutrients, although intake of protein and almost all the micronutrients was well above the recommendation throughout the competitive cycle. Most of the consumed supplements can be deemed unnecessary or without scientific support. Most athletes reported self-managing their diet and supplement program, without the assistance of nutrition professionals. As such, some of their professed nutritional habits obtained during interviewers were not consistent with the food diary information. Although some dietary strategies used by bodybuilders in the Men's Physique category are consistent with evidence-based practice, most can be considered extreme and lack scientific support. The source of education may help to explain their decision-making.",Measures of Strength and Jump Performance Can Predict 30-m Sprint Time in Rugby Union Players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009436,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 04 22,"Furlong, L-AM, Harrison, AJ, and Jensen, RL. Measures of strength and jump performance can predict 30-m sprint time in Rugby Union players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Performance and fitness monitoring in Rugby Union often include jumping, sprinting, and strength tests, but repeatability of and relationships between these measures are unclear. The level of interindividual variability in these relationships and their sprint time predictive capabilities are also unknown. This study examined the reliability of, and relationship between, countermovement (CMJJH), squat (SJJH), and rebound (RBJJH) jump heights, rebound jump contact time (RBJCT), estimated 1 repetition maximum back squat relative to body mass (SQBM), and reactive strength index (RSI) to 30-m sprint time of subelite, semiprofessional Rugby Union players. Measurement reliability was very good, with high average intraclass correlation coefficients (≥0.9) and low coefficient of variation (<10.1%). All variables were significantly (p < 0.01) correlated to each other (r > 0.575), except for SQBM (only related to CMJJH, r = 0.621) and RBJCT (only related to RSI, r = -0.727). SJJH and SQBM were the strongest and most consistent predictors of time to 30 m (R = 0.754 ± 0.081; SEE = 0.166 ± 0.025), but variability in SEE magnitude was observed across the group during bootstrapping. Cross-validation showed a mean difference between actual and predicted 30 m times equivalent to 0.22% of the group average time to 30 m. These results support the importance of multiple aspects of fitness training in Rugby Union players for improving performance in short-duration sprinting activities, but highlight the individual nature of their relative importance. Measures of strength and power can be used to predict short sprint performance by the strength and conditioning professional.","Acute Effect of Drop-Set, Traditional, and Pyramidal Systems in Resistance Training on Neuromuscular Performance in Trained Adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009435,Journal of strength and conditioning research,2019 04 22,"Costa, BDV, Ferreira, MEC, Gantois, P, Kassiano, W, Paes, ST, de Lima-Júnior, D, Cyrino, ES, and Fortes, LS.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The aim of this study was to analyze the acute effects of resistance training (RT) systems on lower- and upper-limb performance in trained adults. Eighteen male young adults with experience in RT aged from 18 to 26 years underwent the 3 experimental conditions (drop-set [DS], decrescent pyramid [DP], and traditional [TR]). The participants performed 2 exercises (bench press and leg press 45°). In the DS condition, they underwent 2 sets of 10 repetitions at 12RM, followed by 5 additional repetitions with an intensity of 15RM with 6-minute interval rest between sets. In the DP, it was performed 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 10RM, 12RM, and 15RM, respectively, and the rest interval was 3 minutes between sets. In the TR, the participants performed 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 12RM with 3 minutes of rest between sets. Countermovement jump, peak power (Wpeak), and force (Fpeak) in the bench press were evaluated in the baseline, before, and 30 minutes after the experimental sessions. Countermovement jump performance decreased significantly only after the DS and DP conditions (-6.7 and -1.9%, respectively). The groups were significantly different in the post-intervention; the DS condition presented lower values when compared with the DP (p = 0.01) and TR (p = 0.001). According to Fpeak and Wpeak, only DS condition significantly decreased the performance (-3.8 and -4.1%, respectively). The results indicate the DS and DP conditions impair the neuromuscular performance of the lower limbs, whereas for upper limbs, only DS condition negatively affect upper-limb performance."

Exercise-intensity adherence during aerobic training and cardiovascular response during resistance training in cancer survivors. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-Combined aerobic-resistance training has shown the best benefits has proved beneficial for cancer survivors (CS). To understand the adherence to the aerobic training program (in terms of the intensity and duration of the sessions) and the cardiovascular response to the resistance training program, heart rate (HR) of 48 CS was monitored in each training session with an HR monitor for a 2-year period. During aerobic training, CS had to maintain the intensity in zone 2 (Z2) (between the ventilatory threshold and respiratory compensation point). The time spent below Z2 (Z1), in Z2, and above Z2 (Z3) was assessed in both aerobic and resistance training. The exercise-intensity distribution (aerobic vs. resistance training) was as follows: Z1 6.6 ± 12.8% vs. 34.3 ± 29.9% (p < 0.001); Z2 66.6 ± 29.3% vs. 54.5 ± 27.6% (p < 0.05); and Z3 26.9 ± 29.9% vs. 11.2 ± 20.6% (p < 0.001). The most deconditioned CS (<4.5 metabolic equivalents [METs]) presented the poorest adherence in Z2 and spent the most time in Z3. A significant positive moderate-high correlation was found for the percentage of time in Z3 between resistance and aerobic exercise (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the individualization of exercise intensity resulted in good adherence to the prescribed intensity. Less fit CS needed more supervision in their training sessions. Resistance training allowed the CS to train in moderate-vigorous intensities of cardiovascular response. Resistance training should have more scope in exercise prescriptions, particularly in deconditioned CS and in the first steps of exercise programs.",Dermal Calcium Loss is Not the Primary Determinant of PTH Secretion during Exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009423,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019 06 10,"Exercise can cause a decrease in serum ionized calcium (iCa) concentration, which stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and activates bone resorption.

The objectives of this study were to identify trajectories of SA/DP before and after strong and weak opioid initiation for noncancer pain and the factors associated with these trajectories. A longitudinal population-based study of 201,641 people (24-59 years) without cancer who initiated opioid analgesics in 2009 in Sweden was conducted. Trajectories of net annual SA/DP days in the 5 years before/after opioid initiation were estimated with group-based trajectory modelling. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors associated with trajectory groups. Among the 6.9% of people initiating strong opioids, 12.5% had persistent high SA/DP (estimated 320 days/year) before and after opioid initiation and 72.9% had persistent low/minimum SA/DP (estimated 30 days/year). Approximately 8.6% of people had increasing SA/DP, and 6.1% had decreasing SA/DP after opioid initiation, although this seemed to reflect continuation of preinitiation patterns. Trajectories were similar at lower SA/DP days/year among those initiating weak opioids. Persistent high SA/DP among strong opioid initiators were associated with ≥5 comorbidities (OR = 8.72, 95% CI 5.61-13.56), ≤9 years of education (OR = 5.83, 95% CI 4.84-7.03), and previous use of antidepressants (OR = 4.57, 95% CI 3.89-5.37) and antipsychotics (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.93-6.88). Three-quarters of people initiating opioids for noncancer pain had persistent low/minimum levels of SA/DP 5 years before and after initiation. Increasing and decreasing SA/DP after opioid initiation seemed to reflect a continuation of preinitiation patterns.

Identifying brain regions involved in persistent neuronal changes will provide new insights for developing efficient chronic pain treatment. Here, we showed that anterior nucleus of paraventricular thalamus (PVA) plays an essential role in the development of mechanical hyperalgesia in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models in mice. Increase in c-Fos, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and hyperexcitability of PVA neurons were detected in hyperalgesic mice. Direct activation of PVA neurons using optogenetics and pharmacological approaches were sufficient to induce persistent mechanical hyperalgesia in naive animals. Conversely, inhibition of PVA neuronal activity using DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) or inactivation of PVA extracellular signal-regulated kinase at the critical time window blunted mechanical hyperalgesia in chronic pain models. At the circuitry level, PVA received innervation from central nucleus of amygdala, a known pain-associated locus. As a result, activation of right central nucleus of amygdala with blue light was enough to induce persistent mechanical hyperalgesia. These findings support the idea that targeting PVA can be a potential therapeutic strategy for pain relief.","Effectiveness and safety of 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster on localized neuropathic pain after knee surgery: a randomized, double-blind controlled trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009419,Pain,2019 04 22,"Localized neuropathic pain symptoms are reported after knee surgery in 30% to 50% of patients. 5% lidocaine plaster (LP5) is recommended for localized neuropathic pain, but evidence in postsurgery neuropathic pain is missing.

A randomized double-blind, 2 parallel groups, controlled trial (NCT02763592) took place in 36 patients (age, 69.4 ± 7.3 years) at the Clinical Pharmacology Center, University Hospital Clermont-Ferrand, France. Patients randomly received LP5 or placebo plaster during 3 months. Neuropathic pain intensity and several parameters (dynamic mechanical allodynia, mechanical [von Frey], heat and cold detection and pain thresholds [Pathway Medoc], and size of the allodynic area were recorded at each visit [inclusion, day 7, 15, month 1, 2, and 3]). From day 7 onwards, dynamic mechanical allodynia diminished progressively of ≥ 30% over 3 months (P = 0.003) in 96% of patients (23/24) and of ≥ 50% in 83% of patients (20/24). Cold pain and maximal mechanical pain thresholds improved over 3 months (P = 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively). This study shows for the first time the effectiveness of LP5 on dynamic mechanical allodynia, pain, pressure, and cold thresholds over 3 months in knee localized neuropathic pain. Beyond the inhibition of sodium channels by LP5, these findings suggest the involvement of cold and mechanical receptors that participate to pain chronicisation and also of the non-negligible placebo effect of the patch, items that need to be explored further and challenged in other etiologies of localized neuropathic pain.",Chronic pain is associated with a brain aging biomarker in community-dwelling older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009418,Pain,2019 04 22,"Chronic pain is associated with brain atrophy with limited evidence on its impact in the older adult's brain.

We estimated a brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) that has been previously reported to predict overall mortality risk (brain-PAD, calculated as brain-predicted age minus chronological age), using an established machine-learning model. Analyses of covariances and Pearson/Spearman correlations were used to determine associations of brain-PAD with pain, somatosensory function, and psychological function. Individuals with chronic pain (n = 33) had ""older"" brains for their age compared with those without (n = 14; F[1,41] = 4.9; P = 0.033).

NF1 patients present with, among other disease complications, café au lait patches, skin fold freckling, Lisch nodules, orthopedic complications, cutaneous neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, cognitive impairment, and chronic pain. Although NF1 patients inevitably express pain as a debilitating symptom of the disease, not much is known about its manifestation in the NF1 disease, with most current information coming from sporadic case reports. Although these reports indicate the existence of pain, the molecular signaling underlying this symptom remains underexplored, and thus, we include a synopsis of the literature surrounding NF1 pain studies in 3 animal models: mouse, rat, and miniswine. We also highlight unexplored areas of NF1 pain research. As therapy for NF1 pain remains in various clinical and preclinical stages, we present current treatments available for patients and highlight the importance of future therapeutic development. Equally important, NF1 pain is accompanied by psychological complications in comorbidities with sleep, gastrointestinal complications, and overall quality of life, lending to the importance of investigation into this understudied phenomenon of NF1. In this review, we dissect the presence of pain in NF1 in terms of psychological implication, anatomical presence, and discuss mechanisms underlying the onset and potentiation of NF1 pain to evaluate current therapies and propose implications for treatment of this severely understudied, but prevalent symptom of this rare disease.","Alexithymia in individuals with chronic pain and its relation to pain intensity, physical interference, depression, and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009416,Pain,2019 04 30,"Numerous studies have examined how alexithymia (difficulty identifying and describing one's emotions and a preference for externally oriented thinking) relates to chronic pain and associated disability.

Primary analyses indicated that chronic pain samples had significantly higher mean alexithymia scores compared with nonclinical (d = 0.81) and clinical nonpain (d = 0.55) controls. In chronic pain samples, alexithymia was significantly positively associated with pain intensity (d = 0.20), physical interference (d = 0.17), depression (d = 0.46), and anxiety (d = 0.43). Secondary meta-analyses of 14 studies that conducted partial correlations that controlled for negative affect-related measures revealed that alexithymia was no longer significantly related to pain intensity or interference. Meta-analysis findings demonstrated that alexithymia is elevated in individuals with chronic pain and related to greater pain intensity and physical interference, although the latter relationships may be accounted for by negative affect. Critical future work is needed that examines alexithymia assessed using non-self-report measures, develops a person-centered perspective on this construct, and identifies how alexithymia is relevant to the assessment and treatment of individuals with chronic pain.",Uncommon Histopathological Variants of Malignant Melanoma.

We review the general patterns, pathways, and thoracic imaging features of renal, adrenal, urothelial, prostatic, and testicular metastatic neoplasms, as well as provide a discussion of treatment-related complications that might manifest in the chest. Detailed reporting of these patterns will allow the imager to assist the referring clinicians and surgeons in accurate determination of the stage, prognosis, and treatment options available for the patient.

Machine learning and deep neural networks promise to transform the practice of medicine, and, in particular, the practice of diagnostic radiology. These technologies are evolving at a rapid pace due to innovations in computational hardware and novel neural network architectures. Several cutting-edge postprocessing analysis applications are actively being developed in the fields of thoracic and cardiovascular imaging, including applications for lesion detection and characterization, lung parenchymal characterization, coronary artery assessment, cardiac volumetry and function, and anatomic localization. Cardiothoracic and cardiovascular imaging lies at the technological forefront of radiology due to a confluence of technical advances. Enhanced equipment has enabled computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanners that can safely capture images that freeze the motion of the heart to exquisitely delineate fine anatomic structures. Computing hardware developments have enabled an explosion in computational capabilities and in data storage. Progress in software and fluid mechanical models is enabling complex 3D and 4D reconstructions to not only visualize and assess the dynamic motion of the heart, but also quantify its blood flow and hemodynamics. And now, innovations in machine learning, particularly in the form of deep neural networks, are enabling us to leverage the increasingly massive data repositories that are prevalent in the field. Here, we discuss developments in machine learning techniques and deep neural networks to highlight their likely role in future radiologic practice, both in and outside of image interpretation and analysis.

However, PD-L1 expression and tumor-associated lymphocytes have not been well-investigated in uterine smooth muscle tumors. Forty-nine uterine smooth muscle tumors (23 leiomyosarcomas, 8 smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential [STUMP], 7 atypical leiomyomas, and 11 benign leiomyomas) were evaluated for tumoral and tumor-associated immune PD-L1 expression and tumor-associated T-cell infiltration. ALK immunohistochemistry was performed to exclude inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors. Tumor PD-L1 expression was seen in 70% of leiomyosarcomas and 14% of atypical leiomyomas; no cases of STUMP or benign leiomyoma demonstrated tumoral PD-L1. PD-L1 positivity was seen in tumor-associated immune cells in 78% of leiomyosarcomas, 25% of STUMP, no cases of atypical leiomyomas, and 9% of benign leiomyomas. Of the 23 leiomyosarcomas, 15 (65%) had a combined positive score ≥1, while of the 26 other uterine smooth muscle tumors, only 2 (8%) had a combined positive score ≥1. Tumor-associated CD8+ cells were highest among leiomyosarcomas (mean: 87/high-power fields vs. 17/high-power fields for nonleiomyosarcomas), and were significantly associated with PD-L1 expression. One PD-L1, CD8-enriched leiomyosarcoma showed an ALK overexpression suggesting possible classification as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, but otherwise lacked morphologic features of this entity. Leiomyosarcomas demonstrate significantly higher PD-L1 expression and cytotoxic T-cell infiltration when compared with other uterine smooth muscle tumors. These data suggest the possibility that treatment with targeted immunotherapy may be appropriate in a selected population of patients with leiomyosarcoma and, potentially, in related tumors bearing ALK rearrangements."

We investigated the clinical and imaging factors associated with good outcome and mortality at 90 days in acute stroke patients with a large baseline ischemic core treated with MT. Methods- Data from the multicentric prospective ETIS (Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke) registry of consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients treated with MT from January 1, 2012, to August 31, 2016, were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline large ischemic core was defined as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score of ≤5. The degree of disability was assessed by the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Outcomes included good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of ≤2), and mortality (modified Rankin Scale score of 6). Results- Among 216 patients with DWI-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score of ≤5 (median DWI volume 77 mL, interquartile range 52-120 mL) treated with MT, good outcome was achieved in 55 (25.4%) patients and 75 (34.7%) died at 90 days. Hemorrhagic transformation was detected in 40 (18.5%) patients within 24 hours post-MT. Older age (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for every 10 years, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.80; P<0.001) and increased DWI lesional volume (adjusted OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; P<0.001) were associated with a lower chance of achieving a good outcome, while successful recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction [mTICI] grades of ≤2b) predicted good outcome (adjusted OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.79-11.62; P=0.001). Successful recanalization (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.97; P=0.042), increased DWI lesional volume (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P<0.001), age (OR for every 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.31-2.26; P<0.001), and diabetes mellitus (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.34-7.8; P=0.009) were independent predictors of 90-day mortality.

Methods- From June 2012 to January 2013, 19 604 patients with acute ischemic stroke were admitted to 219 urban hospitals in the China National Stroke Registry II. Based on heart rhythm assessed during admission, we classified patients as AFDAS, KAF, or SR. We explored the relationship between heart rhythm groups and 1-year ischemic stroke recurrence or death by using Cox regression adjusted for multiple covariates. Considering that death is a competing risk for stroke recurrence, we used the competing risks analysis of Fine and Gray and subdistribution Cox proportional hazards to test the association between heart rhythm and 1-year outcomes. Results- Among 19 604 ischemic stroke patients, 17 727 had SR, 495 AFDAS, and 1382 KAF. At 1 year, 54 (10.9%) patients with AFDAS, 182 (13.2%) with KAF, and 1008 (5.7%) with SR had recurrent ischemic strokes ( P<0.0001). Mortality was 22.0% in patients with AFDAS, 22.1% in patients with KAF, and 7.0% in patients with SR ( P<0.0001). AFDAS-related ischemic stroke recurrence adjusted risk was higher than that of SR (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.29-2.01) but not different from that of KAF (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.87-1.45]). The adjusted risk of 1-year death for AFDAS was also higher than that of SR (hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.37-2.12) and not different from that of KAF (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86-1.41). Conclusions- This study showed that AFDAS had similar risk of 1-year ischemic stroke recurrence and mortality when compared with KAF and higher risk when compared with SR. The potential risk of AFDAS should be given more emphasis, and appropriate treatment is needed to achieve reduction in the incidence of stroke recurrence and mortality.",Incidence of Stroke After Pneumonectomy and Lobectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009351,Stroke,2019 04 22,"Background and Purpose- After pneumonectomy or lobectomy, at least 1 blind pulmonary vein is left with potential risk of postoperative thromboembolic incidents. We investigated the risk of stroke within this population compared with background and pulmonary wedge resections controls. Methods- We identified 12 965 patients with pneumonectomy or lobectomy and 6400 patients with wedge resection using data from Danish nationwide registries from 1996 to 2016. In multivariate Poisson regression analysis, we estimated incidence rate ratios of stroke for patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy versus background population controls and patients who underwent wedge resection. We stratified our analysis by days: 0 to 30, 31 to 90, 91 to 180, and 180 to 365 after surgery and performed a subgroup analysis in patients with lung cancer. Results- The incidence rate of stroke was 10.6 per 1000 person-years for time exposed for pneumonectomy or lobectomy and 2.3 per 1000 person-years for patients not exposed for pneumonectomy or lobectomy. In the 0- to 30-day multivariate Poisson regression analysis, compared with the background population, pneumonectomy or lobectomy was associated with an increased risk of stroke both patients with and without atrial fibrillation (incidence rate ratios [IRR]) of 4.66 (95% CI, 2.04-7.12) and 5.43 (95% CI, 3.99-7.41), respectively. Similarly, in patients with lung cancer, the first 30 days after pneumonectomy or lobectomy remained a risk factor for stroke for patients with (IRR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.39-6.25) and for patients without atrial fibrillation (IRR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.86-3.59).When compared with wedge resection, 0 to 30 days after lobectomy or pneumonectomy was also associated with increased risk of stroke (IRR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.19-5.81); however, this association was insignificant in patients with lung cancer (IRR, 2.98; 95% CI, 0.72-12.29). Conclusions- Patients undergoing pneumonectomy or lobectomy had an increased 30 days risk of stroke. Whether the pulmonary vein stump is a risk factor for stroke and whether preventive strategies are relevant require further investigation.",Lesion Localization of Poststroke Lateropulsion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009350,Stroke,2019 04 26,"Background and Purpose- Hemispheric stroke studies associating lateropulsion (pusher syndrome) with the location of brain lesions have had mixed results from small, unmatched samples. This study was designed to determine whether lateropulsion localizes to specific brain regions across patients with stroke using a case-control design. Methods- Fifty patients with lateropulsion after stroke were matched with 50 stroke patients without lateropulsion using age, time since onset of stroke, admission motor Functional Independence Measure score, lesion side, and gender. The primary analysis included multivariate lesion symptom mapping using sparse canonical correlations to identify regions most associated with lateropulsion as assessed with the Burke Lateropulsion Scale. Secondary analyses included evaluating paired comparisons for lesion volume, degree of motor impairment, motor and cognitive Functional Independence Measure scores. Results- The lesion symptom mapping analysis of all lesions mapped onto a common hemisphere produced an overall significant model ( P<5×10-5) with a regional peak at the inferior parietal lobe at the junction of the post-central gyrus (Brodmann Area 2) and Brodmann Area 40 as the lesion location most associated with lateropulsion. Lesion volume was larger for patients with lateropulsion. Despite adequate matching, motor performance and total Functional Independence Measure scores differed at a group level between patients with and without lateropulsion. Conclusions- This analysis implicated lesion involvement of the inferior parietal lobe as a key neuroanatomical determinant of developing lateropulsion. A better understanding of the anatomic underpinnings of lateropulsion may improve rehabilitation efforts, including the potential for informing noninvasive neuromodulation approaches.",S100B Serum Elevation Predicts In-Hospital Mortality After Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Rupture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009346,Stroke,2019 04 22,"Background and Purpose- S100B protein serum elevation has been associated with poor prognosis in neurologically ill patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether elevation of S100B is associated with increased in-hospital mortality after brain arteriovenous malformation rupture. Methods- This is a retrospective study of patients admitted for brain arteriovenous malformation rupture. The study population was divided into derivation and validation cohorts. Univariate followed by multivariate logistic regression was used to determine whether elevation of S100B serum levels above 0.5 µg/L during the first 48 hours after admission (S100Bmax48) was associated with in-hospital mortality. Results- Two hundred and three ruptures met inclusion criteria. Twenty-three led to in-hospital mortality (11%). Mean S100Bmax48 was 0.49±0.62 µg/L. In the derivation cohort (n=101 ruptures), multivariate analysis found Glasgow coma scale score ≤8 (odds ratio, 21; 95% CI, 2-216; 0.001) and an S100Bmax48>0.5 µg/L (odds ratio, 19; 95% CI, 2-188; P=0.001) to be associated with in-hospital mortality. When applied to the validation cohort (n=102 ruptures), the same model found only S100Bmax48>0.5 µg/L (odds ratio, 8; 95% CI, 1.5-44; P=0.01) to be associated with in-hospital mortality. Conclusions- Elevated S100B protein serum level is strongly associated with in-hospital mortality after brain arteriovenous malformation rupture.",Combining Neurovascular and Neurodegenerative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Measures in Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009345,Stroke,2019 04 22,"Background and Purpose- Individual markers of cerebral small vessel disease and cerebral atrophy explain a small proportion of variance in vascular risk factors and cognitive function. Combining these markers into a single measure of neurovascular and neurodegenerative disease may be more powerful. We assessed this using data contained in the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive - Prevention sub-archive. Methods- We extracted white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes from 317 people with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack who had baseline magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed progression of volumes in 208 people who had 2-year follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. WMH and CSF volumes were segmented from fluid attenuated inversion recovery and T1 images. The combined neurovascular and neurodegenerative measure was the sum of WMH and CSF volume normalized by intracranial volume. We assessed (1) the relationship between baseline vascular risk factors and imaging markers; and (2) the relationship between baseline imaging markers and Mini-Mental State Examination score at follow-up using multiple linear regression. We also assessed implications for sample size calculations using n=208 participants with follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. Results- Vascular risk factors accounted for 7%, 11%, and 12% of the variance in WMH, CSF, and combined volume, respectively (all P<0.001). The association between baseline combined volume and 6-month follow-up Mini-Mental State Examination (β=-0.442; SE, 0.07; P<0.0001) was 32% greater than WMH (β=-0.302; SE, 0.06; P<0.0001) and 12% greater than CSF (β=-0.391; SE, 0.07; P<0.0001) alone. The combined volume required between 207 and 3305 (20%) fewer patients per arm than WMH alone to detect reductions of 10% to 40% in volume progression over 2 years. Conclusions- A combined neurovascular and neurodegenerative magnetic resonance imaging measure including WMH and CSF volume was more closely related to vascular risk factors and cognitive function than either WMH or CSF volume alone. The combined volume may be a more sensitive measurement for clinical trials.","Arteriopathy Influences Pediatric Ischemic Stroke Presentation, but Sickle Cell Disease Influences Stroke Management.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009343,Stroke,2019 04 26,"Background and Purpose- Sickle cell disease (SCD) and arteriopathy are pediatric stroke risk factors that are not mutually exclusive. The relative contributions of sickled red blood cells and arteriopathy to stroke risk are unknown, resulting in unclear guidelines for primary and secondary stroke prevention when both risk factors are present. We hypothesized that despite similarities in clinical presentation and radiographic appearance of arteriopathies, stroke evaluation and management differ in children with SCD compared with those without SCD. Methods- We compared presentation and management of children with and without SCD enrolled in the IPSS (International Pediatric Stroke Study) with acute arterial ischemic stroke, according to SCD and arteriopathy status. Regression modeling determined relative contribution of SCD and arteriopathy in variables with significant frequency differences. Results- Among 930 childhood arterial ischemic strokes, there were 98 children with SCD, 67 of whom had arteriopathy, and 466 without SCD, 392 of whom had arteriopathy. Arteriopathy, regardless of SCD status, increased likelihood of hemiparesis (odds ratio [OR], 1.94; 95% CI, 1.46-2.56) and speech abnormalities (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.29-2.19). Arteriopathy also increased likelihood of headache but only among those without SCD (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.40-2.55). Echocardiograms were less frequently obtained in children with SCD (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.93), but the frequency of identified cardiac abnormalities was similar in both groups ( P=0.57). Children with SCD were less likely to receive antithrombotic therapy, even in the presence of arteriopathy (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.22). Arteriopathy was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of antithrombotic therapy in children without SCD (OR, 5.36; 95% CI, 3.55-8.09). Conclusions- Arteriopathy, and not SCD status, was most influential of stroke presentation. However, SCD status influenced stroke management because children with SCD were less likely to have echocardiograms or receive antithrombotic therapy. Further work is needed to determine whether management differences are warranted.",Per-Pass Analysis of Thrombus Composition in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Undergoing Mechanical Thrombectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009342,Stroke,2019 04 22,"Background and Purpose- Mechanical thrombectomy may involve multiple attempts to retrieve the occluding thrombus. This study examined the composition of thrombus fragments retrieved with each pass of a device during the thrombectomy procedure. Second, the per-pass composition was compared with procedural and clinical data including angiographic outcome and stroke etiology. Methods- Thrombi were retrieved from 60 patients with acute ischemic stroke, where thrombus fragments retrieved in each pass were segregated as individual samples and maintained throughout the histological analysis as independent samples. All samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Martius Scarlet Blue. The relative composition of red blood cells, fibrin, and white blood cells in thrombus fragments from each pass was quantified. Results- Over the 60 cases, thrombus material was retrieved in 106 of 138 passes. The number of passes required to complete the cases ranged from 1 to 6 passes. The analysis of thrombus fragments retrieved in each pass provided a greater insight into the thrombectomy procedure progression than the overall thrombus composition; the red blood cell content of thrombus fragments retrieved in passes 1 and 2 was significantly higher than that retrieved in passes 3 to 6. The removal of thrombus material in a total of 1, 2, or 3 passes was associated with the highest percentage of final modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2c-3. There was no association between modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score and per-pass thrombus composition. Conclusions- The differentiation achieved through the per-pass analysis of acute ischemic stroke thrombi provides a greater insight into the thrombectomy procedure progression than the combined per-case thrombus analysis. Insights gained may be a useful consideration in determining the treatment strategy as a case evolves and may be useful for the development of new devices to increase rates of 1-pass recanalization.",Blood-Brain Barrier Leakage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009340,Stroke,2019 04 22,"Background and Purpose- The diagnosis of transient ischemic attack is challenging. Evidence of acute ischemia on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging is highly variable and confirmed in only about one-third of patients. This study investigated the significance of blood-brain barrier dysfunction (BBBD) mapping in patients with transient neurological deficits, as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker required for risk stratification and stroke prevention. Methods- We used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantitatively map BBBD in a prospective cohort study of 57 patients diagnosed with transient ischemic attack/minor stroke and 50 healthy controls. Results- Brain volume with BBBD was significantly higher in patients compared with controls ( P=0.002). BBBD localization corresponded with the clinical presentation in 41 patients (72%) and was more extensive in patients with acute infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging ( P=0.05). Patients who developed new stroke during follow-up had a significantly greater BBBD at the initial presentation ( P=0.03) with a risk ratio of 5.35 for recurrent stroke. Conclusions- This is the first description of the extent and localization of BBBD in patients with transient ischemic attack/minor stroke. We propose BBBD mapping as a valuable tool for detection of subtle brain ischemia and a promising predictive biomarker required for risk stratification and stroke prevention.",Safety and Outcomes of Tenecteplase in Moderate and Severe Ischemic Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009339,Stroke,2019 04 22,"Background and Purpose- Tenecteplase represents a promising alternative to alteplase as thrombolytic treatment in acute ischemic stroke. There are limited data on tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg in patients with increased stroke severity. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg in patients with moderate and severe ischemic stroke. Methods- NOR-TEST (Norwegian Tenecteplase Stroke Trial) was a phase III trial designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg versus alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in ischemic stroke. In this post hoc analysis, moderate stroke was defined as admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; 6 to 14 and severe stroke as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; ≥15. Rates of favorable outcome at 90 days, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality after 7 and 90 days were assessed. Results- In patients with moderate stroke (n=261), there were no differences in rates of favorable outcome, sICH, or mortality between tenecteplase and alteplase. In patients with severe stroke (n=87), there were no differences in outcome, frequency of sICH, or mortality at 7 days, but all-cause mortality at 90 days was increased in patients treated with tenecteplase (10 [26.3%] versus 4 [9.1%]; P=0.045). One patient died of sICH in the tenecteplase group, and 2 patients died of sICH in the alteplase group. Conclusions- Rates of favorable outcome and sICH were similar between treatment groups in patients with moderate and severe stroke. Mortality after 90 days was increased in patients with severe stroke receiving tenecteplase. Future studies assessing tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg should monitor safety parameters closely in patients with severe stroke. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Background:
 Sepsis is an uncommon occurrence after appendectomy, but the morbidity and mortality of patients who develop sepsis after appendectomy remains exceedingly high. The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors and adverse post-operative outcomes associated with sepsis after appendectomy in adults. 
Patients and Methods:
 The American College of Surgery National Surgical Quality Improvement Program participant user database was queried from 2012 to 2015. Patients who underwent appendectomy were identified and demographic data, intra-operative variables, and post-operative outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was post-operative sepsis after appendectomy, which was defined as the development of sepsis or septic shock post-operatively. Patients with a diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, or septic shock within 48 hours prior to surgery or present at the time of surgery were excluded. Multivariable analyses (logistic and linear regression) were performed to assess for risk factors and adverse outcomes associated with sepsis. 
Results:
 Of the 72,538 patients who had appendectomies, 311 patients (0.43%) were identified as having post-operative sepsis. Of these, 17 patients (5.47%) died within 30 days. Age 60 years or more (odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.129-2.02), African American race (OR 1.951, 95% CI 1.399-2.722), morbid obesity (OR 1.784, 95% CI 1.264-2.516), acute renal failure or dialysis (OR 4.642, 95% CI 2.17-9.929), disseminated malignancy (OR 4.089, 95% CI 1.719-9.726), and open appendectomy (OR 2.607, 95% CI 2.003-3.393) were found to be associated with increased risk of post-operative sepsis; patients were also less likely to be female (OR 0.650, 95% CI 0.517-0.817). Patients who developed sepsis after appendectomy were more likely to return to the operating room (24.76 vs. 0.77%, p < 0.001), be re-admitted for any cause (53.38% vs. 2.70%, p < 0.0001), and die within 30 days of surgery (5.47% vs. 0.05%, p < 0.001). 
Conclusion:
 Patients who become septic after appendectomy are at risk for adverse post-operative morbidity and mortality. Age 60 years or more, African American race, morbid obesity, acute renal failure or dialysis, disseminated malignancy, and open appendectomy increase the risk for sepsis after appendectomy and sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. Given the remarkably large number of appendectomies that are performed each year, the findings of this study can assist in identifying at-risk patients, facilitate physician-patient discussion and shared decision-making, and guide appropriate care to further reduce the incidence of sepsis after appendectomy.",Antimicrobial Agent Susceptibility and Typing of Staphylococcal Isolates from Subclinical Mastitis in Ewes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009324,"Microbial drug resistance (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2019 04 22,"Objective was to study susceptibility to antimicrobial agents of 142 staphylococcal isolates from subclinical mastitis in ewes. In total, 41.5% of these were resistant and 5.6% multidrug resistant. More coagulase-negative staphylococci (47.0%) were resistant than Staphylococcus aureus (18.5%) isolates. Resistance was greater to penicillin (22.5%), tetracycline, or ampicillin (18.3%). More biofilm-forming (20.6%) isolates were resistant to tetracycline than nonbiofilm-forming (0.0%) ones. Presence of tetK was associated with presence of icaA in the same strains. Further, 76.6% of resistant isolates versus 57.7% of susceptible ones were recovered immediately postpartum and 23.4% of resistant isolates versus 9.9% of susceptible ones were recovered in farms that practiced routine administration of antimicrobial agents at the end of a lactation period. Most S. aureus (59.3%) were classified in ST133 and most Staphylococcus epidermidis were classified in ST100, ST142, or ST152 (19.0% each). There was no association of sequence types with resistance. Whole genome sequencing showed that, in a Staphylococcus lentus strain, the ermB gene was part of transposon Tn917 integrated into the chromosome; also, a small plasmid was observed in an ermC-carrying Staphylococcus hominis strain and, finally, in an S. aureus and an S. epidermidis strains, small tetK-carrying plasmids (pSau-2716Lar, pSau-3893Lar) of 4.439 kb were found.",Characterization of Plasmid-Mediated Quinolone Resistance in Gram-Negative Bacterial Strains from Animals and Humans in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009323,"Microbial drug resistance (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2019 04 22,"The aim of this study was to determine the molecular epidemiology of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants in Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica (Salmonella spp.), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Four hundred seventy-two nonrepetitive isolates were collected from different sources in China and screened for the presence of PMQR genes (PMQRs). Then, 49 PMQR producers were selected to study the coexistence of PMQRs and other resistance genes using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). High rates of resistance to tetracycline (93.4%), nalidixic acid (81.5%), and norfloxacin (65.8%) were observed. The predominant PMQRs were aac(6')-Ib-cr (28.6%) and oqxAB (21.4%). The prevalence of PMQR determinants was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in E. coli from stockmen (55.9%, 19/34), pigs (51.1%, 70/137), and laying hens (43.1%, 28/65) than that from wild animals (21.7%, 5/23) and dairy cattle (20.1%, 5/24). WGS results showed that 89.8% of the PMQR-positive isolates co-harbored β-lactamase genes, with blaCTX-M being the dominant β-lactamase gene. In K. pneumoniae, the coexistence rate of oqxAB and qnrB with fosA, blaDHA-1, and blaSHV was significantly higher than that in P. mirabilis and E. coli. In contrast, the coexistence of qnrD and blaOXA-1 was more prominent (p < 0.001) in P. mirabilis than in the other two species. Particularly, oqxAB and mcr-1 had an obvious preference for E. coli than K. pneumonia and P. mirabilis (p < 0.001), which had not been reported in previous studies on the prevalence of PMQRs.",In Vitro and In Vivo Activity of a Novel Antisense Peptide Nucleic Acid Compound Against Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009322,"Microbial drug resistance (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2019 04 22,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a difficult pathogen due to its propensity to develop resistance to antibiotics. Antisense nucleic acid analogs have been proposed as a potential alternative anti-infective approach. We developed a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) compound that targets the essential Acinetobacter gene carA. The PNA oligomer was conjugated to the cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)4XB. In vitro testing of the PNA conjugate against four clinical strains of MDR-A. baumannii in minimal medium demonstrated that all four strains were inhibited at a concentration of 1.25 μM. In vivo testing of the PNA conjugate was done using a Galleria mellonella model of sepsis caused by one of the clinical strains. Preliminary testing of a variety of inocula demonstrated that an inoculum of 1 × 106 cfu was lethal to the majority of caterpillars by day 3, but not within 24 hours. The PNA compound was administered 30 minutes after an inoculum of 1 × 106 cfu at doses estimated to produce concentrations of ∼5 and 20 μM. The PNA compound had no effect at the lower dose. However, the higher dose reduced mortality from 5/28 (18%) to 0/28 (0%) at day 1 (p = 0.051) and from 19/28 (68%) to 9/28 (32%) at day 6 (p = 0.015). Antisense therapy is a novel approach to dealing with difficult MDR pathogens that could circumvent the problem of progressive resistance to available antibiotics. Further studies need to be done with additional strains and more complex in vivo model systems.",A new high-throughput screening method to determine multiple dyes in herbs and spices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009321,"Food additives & contaminants. Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 06 13,"The unauthorised addition of colours to herbs and spices is a recurrent issue affecting food business operators. Such a practice aims at improving food visual attractiveness, masking poor product quality, and/or compensating for natural colour variation with the ultimate goal to increase profits. To detect this fraud, a new LC-MS/MS method was developed for screening 58 dyes in both herbs and spices. This extended list of targets was established based on requirements from international spices organisations, past issues identified by web scouting and by notifications from the European Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). The method is intended to quickly detect fraudulent addition of dyes with Screening Target Concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 mg/kg. Validation was performed according to the European Community Reference Laboratories Residues Guidelines 20/1/2010. False positive and false negative rates were below 5% for all analytes and applicability of the method was further demonstrated by analysing 117 samples collected worldwide. None of the surveyed dyes was found in herbs (n = 28, 16 varieties) whereas 6% of spice samples (n = 89, 21 varieties) was found contaminated with one or two dyes at levels ranging from 0.12 to 255 mg/kg. Four out of the nine detected compounds have never been reported in the RASFF, thus demonstrating the usefulness of this analytical approach.","Exposure assessment and risk characterization of aflatoxins intake through consumption of maize products in the adult populations of Serbia, Croatia and Greece.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009320,"Food additives & contaminants. Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 06 13,"The main objective of this research was to perform an exposure assessment of aflatoxins intake through consumption of maize products in Serbia, Croatia, and Greece. Food consumption survey of maize-based products has been performed during 2017 in the three countries with at least 1,000 interviewees per country covering their dietary habits and body weight. Values for the concentration of aflatoxins were extracted from available research published in the last ten years. Finally, a Monte Carlo analysis of 100,000 iterations was performed to estimate the intake of aflatoxins from consumption of maize-based products. Results revealed that the estimated average exposure of adults to aflatoxins, from maize consumption, in each of the three countries was between 0.44 ng kg-1 bw day-1 and 5.59 ng kg-1 bw day-1. Margin of exposure values for the mean exposure levels, in all three countries, were between 30 and 389. Estimations for hepatocellular carcinoma cases/year/105 individuals, depending on the HBsAg+ prevalence, were 0.075-0.098, 0.006-0.008 and 0.020-0.026 for Serbia, Croatia and Greece, respectively.",Can official control laboratories quantify reliably fipronil in eggs?

The content of the target analytes (sum of fipronil plus its metabolite fipronil sulfone, expressed as fipronil in the PT test material) was set around the regulated Maximum Residue Level (MRL) set by EU legislation. The PT was organised by the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General (DG) Joint Research Centre (JRC) - in agreement with the EC DG for Health and Food Safety (SANTE) - following a request by the Belgian Authorities. Eighty-six NRLs and OCLs from 22 EU Member States, Norway, Serbia and Albania participated. The test items used were two materials made of frozen liquid eggs, processed and characterised at the JRC facilities in Geel (Belgium). The majority of the participants (94%) were shown to have a satisfactory performance, expressed as z scores, thus demonstrating the analytical capability of most of the participating NRLs and OCLs to enforce the relevant EU Regulations ((EC) 396/2005 and 1127/2014).

Part A, Chemistry, analysis, control, exposure & risk assessment",2019 06 13,"Arsenic intake in the world is linked with drinking water and food; the main sources of inorganic As (i-As) exposure in food are rice and rice-based products. The consumption of rice in Ecuador is 53.2 kg year-1 and it is the most commonly used cereal for the preparation of many popular dishes especially for subjects with celiac disease. Objectives of this research were: (i) to determine the content of i-As in foods widely consumed by Ecuadorians with celiac disease, (ii) to calculate the i-As dietary intake, and (iii) to model and predict the health risks of the population under study as a result of their exposure to i-As from rice-based food. The estimated daily intakes of Ecuadorian children (below 3 years of age) and adults were established at 0.52 and 0.55 μg kg-1 body weight d-1, respectively. These values were above the lower BMDL01 value established for i-As established by the EFSA; consequently, it can be concluded that health risk cannot be excluded for the Ecuadorian population with celiac disease.",Targeting Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-Gamma Decreases Host Mortality After Influenza Infection in Obese Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009317,Viral immunology,2019 06 10,"Obesity is an independent risk factor for severe influenza infection. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In this study, we have utilized a murine influenza infection model in genetic-induced obese (db/db) mice to explore the mechanisms by which obesity increases host susceptibility to influenza infection. We find that db/db mice have enhanced viral replication, exaggerated inflammatory responses, and dysregulated lung repair process after influenza infection, and consequently increased host mortality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ), an important inflammation regulator, was downregulated in the lung macrophages of db/db mice after influenza infection. Strikingly, the treatment of 15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a PPAR-γ agonist, largely rescued the survival of db/db mice after influenza infection. Interestingly, macrophage PPAR-γ-deficient mice exhibited enhanced mortality after influenza infection and 15d-PGJ2 fails to rescue host mortality in macrophage PPAR-γ-deficient mice, suggesting that PPAR-γ expression in macrophages is critical for the action of 15d-PGJ2. These data indicate that obesity attenuates lung antiviral immunity and hampers host recovery through the modulation of macrophage PPAR-γ expression. Furthermore, modalities targeting macrophage PPAR-γ expression and/or function may serve as promising therapeutics to treat severe influenza infection in obese patients.",Evaluating the Impact of Variable Phosphorothioate Content in Tricyclo-DNA Antisense Oligonucleotides in a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009315,Nucleic acid therapeutics,2019 05 31,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) hold promise for therapeutic splice switching correction for genetic diseases, in particular for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), for which ASO-exon skipping represents one of the most advanced therapeutic strategies. We have previously reported the therapeutic potential of tricyclo-DNA (tcDNA) in mouse models of DMD, highlighting the unique pharmaceutical properties and unprecedented uptake in many tissues after systemic delivery, including the heart and central nervous system. TcDNA-ASOs demonstrate an encouraging safety profile and no particular class-related toxicity, however, when administered in high doses for several months, mild renal toxicity is observed secondary to predictable phosphorothioate (PS)-ASO accumulation in kidneys. In this study, we investigate the influence of the relative content of PS linkages in tcDNA-ASOs on exon skipping efficacy. Mdx mice were injected intravenously once weekly for 4 weeks with tcDNA carrying various amounts of PS linkages (0%, 25%, 33%, 50%, 67%, 83%, and 100%). The results indicate that levels of exon-23 skipping and dystrophin rescue increase with the number of PS linkages in most skeletal muscles except in the heart. As expected, plasma coagulation times are shortened with decreasing PS content, and tcDNA-protein binding in serum directly correlates with the number of PS linkages on the tcDNA backbone. Altogether, these data contribute in establishing the appropriate sulfur content within the tcDNA backbone for maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity of the oligonucleotide."

Sixty bats belonging to four species of two families were captured from rural areas of Xianning City, Hubei Province, China. We extracted DNA from the kidneys of bats, and Leptospira spp. were determined by PCR amplification of the rrs2, flaB, lipL32, and secY genes. We found that 57% (34/60) of bats were positive for Leptospira with at least one of the four genes, and the positive rate of Leptospira in bats was 45% (27/60) with rrs2, 50% (30/60) with flaB, 15% (9/60) with lipL32, and 27% (16/60) with secY.

While this study considers a multifaceted approach to veterinary student stress and ultimate depressive symptoms, the focus is on the financial stress. A common strategy for reducing debt is to increase financial literacy. While this has the potential to help, it is not the sole solution given that students opt into the program for non-financial reasons. A path analysis was used to explore the predictors of financial satisfaction (the inverse of financial stress). The results were then used to predict depression among pre-vet and veterinary students in combination with relationship stress and demographic characteristics. Results indicate that current and expected student loan debt negatively influence financial satisfaction of pre-veterinary and veterinary students. Lower financial and relational satisfaction predict depressive symptoms among students. Among pre-veterinary students, feeling less intelligent than peers and being a sophomore versus a freshman is associated with depressive symptoms.

The new curriculum included design features to encourage deeper learning such as a spiral curriculum with cross-course integration, increased open time, and more active learning. Student well-being was seen as a simultaneous need. To gather overall perceptions of workload and well-being, student volunteers from each cohort were surveyed weekly starting in 2013. Survey questions asked about out-of-class work time, level of integration, extracurricular activities, student well-being habits, paid employment, and other factors. Survey questions were combined with course data to get a full picture of week quality, total course work time, extracurricular activities, and the effects of integration. Many of our hypotheses about curricular and extracurricular impacts on week quality were disproven. Week quality was most positively affected by student factors of sleep and exercise, whereas the curricular factors of out-of-class work time, total course work time, and examination hours had the strongest negative effects. A surprising finding was that open time, in-class hours, and paid employment hours had a minimal effect on week quality. Students identified excessively heavy semesters and uneven semester workloads that resulted in early revisions to the new curriculum. Student feedback provided a view of the curriculum that was not otherwise available and resulted in early and significant impacts on the new curriculum, and they provided insight into whether planned changes had occurred and how effective various factors were in reaching the curricular goals.","Economic burden and associated factors of measles patients in Zhejiang Province, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009298,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 04 22,"This study aimed to figure out the economic burden of measles patients and explore the associated factors for total cost in measles cases that occurred in the year 2015 from Jiaxing, Jinhua, and Taizhou cities in Zhejiang Province, China. Direct interviews were conducted to collect information on patient expenses during treatment, including outpatient expenses, hospitalization expenses, self-treatment fees, productivity loss, and transportation fees. Descriptive epidemiological methods and chi-square tests were used to assess the direct and indirect cost of measles patients. Ordinal logistic regression was applied to explore the possible factors contributing to cost. A total of 136 measles cases were investigated and the average direct cost, indirect cost, and total cost were #747.14, #520.12, and #1,267.26, respectively. Direct cost accounted for 58.96% of the total cost, which was significantly higher than the indirect cost (P < 0.001). In 2015, 1,386 confirmed cases were reported in the Zhejiang Province, and the overall direct, indirect, and total economic burden reached #1.04 million, #0.72 million, and #1.76 million, respectively.

Exhibiting overlapping properties with type I and II interferons (IFNs), IL-27 impacts cancer cell viability and immune cell activity. Known to modulate toll-like receptor (TLR) expression, we investigated whether IL-27 affected TLR-mediated death in cancer cells. Using DU145 and PC3 cell lines as models of prostate cancer, we investigated whether IL-27 and IFN-γ affect TLR3-mediated cell death. Our results demonstrate that when IL-27 or IFN-γ is added with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], type I IFN (IFN-I) expression increases concurrently with cell death. IL-27 and IFN-γ enhanced TLR3 expression, suggesting a mechanism for sensitization to cell death. Further, PC3 cells were more sensitive to IL-27/poly(I:C)-induced cell death compared with DU145 cells. This correlated with higher production of IFN-β and inducible protein-10 versus IL-6 in response to treatment of PC3 cells compared with DU145. Taken together, this study demonstrates a potential role for IL-27 in the treatment of prostate cancer.","Association Between miR-155, Its Polymorphism and Ischemia-Modified Albumin in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009294,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,2019 04 22,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease.

Virtual-reality endoscopy trainers (VRET) are used for this purpose in human medicine with the clear benefits of avoiding live animal use, decreasing trainee stress, and allowing repeated, independent training sessions. However, there are currently no commercially available veterinary endoscopy simulators. The purpose of the study was to determine whether a human VRET can be a reasonable alternative to a LDL for teaching early veterinary endoscopy skills. Twelve veterinarians with limited or no endoscopy experience underwent training with a VRET (n = 6) or a LDL (n = 6), performed two recorded esophagogastroduodenoscopies (EGD) on anesthetized dogs for evaluation purposes (outcomes laboratory), and then underwent training with the alternative method. Participants completed questionnaires before any training and following each training session. No significant differences were found between training methods based on: measured parameters from the outcomes laboratory, including duration of time to perform EGD; evaluators' assessment of skills; and, assessment of skills through blinded review of the esophageal portion of EGD recordings. The VRET was less stressful for participants than the LDL (p = .02). All participants found that the VRET was a useful and acceptable alternative to the LDL for training of early endoscopy skills. Based on this limited study, VRET can serve as a reasonable alternative to LDL for teaching endoscopy skills to veterinarians.","Comparison of the Moral Sensitivity, Judgment, and Actions of Australian and Turkish Veterinary Students in Relation to Animal Ethics Issues.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009292,Journal of veterinary medical education,2019 04 22,"Veterinarians regularly face animal ethics conflicts, and research has identified the moral reasoning methods that they utilize to solve these. It is unclear whether students' sensitivity to animal ethics conflicts influences their reasoning methods, and the recent development of appropriate tests allows this to be assessed. We compared the moral reasoning methods, intended action and sensitivity of 112 first-year veterinary students in two contrasting veterinary schools, in Australia and Turkey. Students were presented with two animal ethics issues: breeding blind hens to address welfare concerns in intensive housing, for moral reasoning evaluation; and a video of a lame dairy cow walking, for sensitivity assessment. The sensitivity score was not related to the principal moral reasoning methods, which are Personal Interest (PI), Maintaining Norms (MN), and Universal Principles (UP). However, less sensitive students were more concerned about professional criticism of emotional reactions when addressing the hen scenario. Turkish students, mostly males, used more MN reasoning when deciding the hen dilemma. Australian, mostly female, students did not. Overall, female students were more likely to consider the universal moral principles in moral reasoning than male students and were more likely to recommend against breeding blind hens. This suggests that females are more likely to consider the ethical implications of their actions than males. This study demonstrates relationships between ethical sensitivity (ES) and moral reasoning, and cultural and gender effects on moral action choices. Students placing greater importance on professional criticism about having an emotional reaction are more likely to be those who have less ES.",Financial Margins for Prostate Cancer Surgery: Quantifying the Impact of Modifiable Cost Inputs in an Episode Based Reimbursement Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009291,The Journal of urology,2019 06 10,The United States health care system is rapidly moving away from fee for service reimbursement in an effort to improve quality and contain costs. Episode based reimbursement is an increasingly relevant value based payment model of surgical care. We sought to quantify the impact of modifiable cost inputs on institutional financial margins in an episode based payment model for prostate cancer surgery.

Even though this is an area in which veterinarians can intervene to support the human-animal bond, prior research has documented that they frequently do not bring the topic up during appointments. This study explored veterinarians' training in animal behavior and behavioral medicine, along with their level of comfort in treating common behavioral problems. An online survey of practicing veterinarians (N = 1,085) found that only 42.8% felt they'd received a significant amount of training in this field during veterinary school, but the majority reported participating in continuing education sessions about behavior. Almost all respondents reported seeing patients with behavioral issues (99.6%), even when the initial appointment was made for other reasons. Participants felt most comfortable discussing inappropriate elimination and begging for food but were least comfortable treating issues involving aggression. Most veterinarians treat their own behavior cases, using a combination of behavior modification techniques and medication. Only 22.1% refer cases needing behavioral therapy to a specialist. Given the prevalence of behavioral problems in companion animals and the potential for early veterinary intervention to play a significant role in animal health, it is important for veterinary schools to include this topic in their curricula. At present, 73% of schools require a course in animal behavior. The release of the new Competency-Based Veterinary Education framework is anticipated to support a greater teaching emphasis in this area.",Guidelines for Implementing a Low-Cost Volunteer Desexing Skills Training Program for Veterinary and Veterinary Technology Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009278,Journal of veterinary medical education,2019 04 22,"Although desexing surgeries are considered a core clinical skill for small animal veterinary practice, it can be challenging for veterinary schools to provide students with adequate training opportunities in the traditional curriculum. At the Massey University School of Veterinary Science, we recently established an innovative extracurricular volunteer program designed to have students teaching other students how to perform different elements of desexing procedures as they progress through their degree. This program includes administrative and assistant roles for first-year students (responsible for client communication, patient restraint, and medical record keeping), physical exam and recovery roles for second-year students (responsible for assessing patient fitness for surgery, drawing up anesthetic drugs, and monitoring patients in recovery), anesthesia and neuter surgeon roles for third-year students (responsible for inducing, preparing, and monitoring spay patients and performing cat neuter surgeries), and spay surgeon roles for fourth- and fifth-year students (responsible for performing cat spay surgeries, discharging patients, and following up with clients to monitor recovery). This program has been successful in improving student confidence and competence while also providing a valuable low-cost desexing service to the community. In this article, we discuss the practical considerations and processes involved in implementing this program, including mapping the existing surgical curriculum, recruiting patients, setting up the surgical facilities, purchasing equipment and supplies, establishing standard operating procedures, developing training materials, maintaining clinic records, and monitoring program outcomes. These resources can serve as guidelines for other veterinary schools looking to expand desexing surgery training opportunities for students.",Development and Validation of a Canine Castration Model and Rubric.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009276,Journal of veterinary medical education,2019 04 22,"Veterinary educators use models to allow repetitive practice of surgical skills leading to clinical competence. Canine castration is a commonly performed procedure that is considered a Day One competency for a veterinarian. In this study, we sought to create and evaluate a canine pre-scrotal closed castration model and grading rubric using a validation framework of content evidence, internal structure evidence, and relationship with other variables. Veterinarians (n = 8) and students (n = 32) were recorded while they performed a castration on the model and provided survey feedback. A subset of the students (n = 7) then performed a live canine castration, and their scores were compared with their model scores. One hundred percent of the veterinarians and 91% of the students reported that the model was helpful in training for canine castration. They highlighted several areas for continued improvement. Veterinarians' model performance scores were significantly higher than students', indicating that the model had adequate features to differentiate expert from novice performance. Students' performance on the model strongly correlated with their performance of live castration (r = .82). Surgical time was also strongly correlated (r = .70). The internal consistency of model and live rubric scores were good at .85 and .94, respectively. The framework supported validation of the model and rubric. The canine castration model facilitated cost-efficient practice in a safe environment in which students received instructor feedback and learned through experience without the risk of negatively affecting a patient's well-being. The strong correlation between model and live animal performance scores suggests that the model could be useful for mastery learning.",Faculty's Perception of a Research Project Embedded in the Undergraduate Veterinary Curriculum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009275,Journal of veterinary medical education,2019 04 22,"In this article, we describe faculty's perception of a research project embedded in the final year of the undergraduate veterinary curriculum and look at factors associated with overall perceptions of the project. We hypothesized that faculty would have a dichotomous attitude toward the research project, with faculty viewing it either positively or negatively, and that this opinion of the project would be largely influenced by the background of the faculty member-in particular, her or his role at the Royal Veterinary College. We explored this hypothesis via a questionnaire consisting of 26 questions in categorical format, Likert-scale format, and ranking format. The questions addressed faculty demographics, faculty's perceptions of the project, and generic skills. Faculty had an overall positive view of the project and found it to be a useful part of the undergraduate curriculum (83.3% found it to be useful or very useful). Faculty's perception of the project was influenced by their role at the college (p = .017), the species with which they primarily work (p = .05), and their opinion on the time spent supervising the final-year project (p = .003). We concluded that faculty view research as an important and useful part of the undergraduate veterinary curriculum.","Implementation, evaluation, and outcome of TeamSTEPPS in interprofessional education: a scoping review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009273,Journal of interprofessional care,2019 04 22,"The ability to effectively work in interprofessional teams is listed as one of the five core competencies in health professions education. Though the importance of interprofessional education (IPE) has been established, results of studies have been difficult to compare due to the high variability of programs. We undertook a scoping review to examine the use of a prescribed curriculum, TeamSTEPPS, in IPE. Articles describing TeamSTEPPS implementations were extracted from Pubmed, Embase, and Scopus. Studies with two or more health professions students reporting on a clear evaluation and published in English were eligible for inclusion. Two researchers independently applied inclusion criteria to studies and reconciled conflicts for a final selection. The reference lists of selected papers were also searched for relevant studies. Data were extracted from each of the articles independently using a standard form. Twenty-four papers describing 23 unique programs were included. Programs used a variety of teaching modalities and included students from two to ten health professions, most commonly medical and nursing students. Programs used a range (n = 11) of validated IPE evaluation surveys, few of which were part of the TeamSTEPPS program. Methods included multimodal evaluations, self-assessment confidence and attitude surveys, pre/post-test models, and external evaluation of simulation performance. There was great variation in the implementation of TeamSTEPPS implying that while a consistent curriculum it can be adapted to meet the needs of different educational contexts. The variation in evaluation methods makes comparing and synthesis of results problematic. Future IPE research can expand on the use of this prescribed curriculum, especially with focus on uniform evaluation methods.",Screening for Opioid Misuse in the Nonhospitalized Seriously Ill Patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009271,Journal of palliative medicine,2019 04 22,"
Background:
 Responding to an epidemic of opioid-related deaths, guidelines and laws have been implemented to promote safe opioid prescribing practices. 
Objective:
 This study evaluates differences in screening practices and knowledge of laws between oncologists and cardiologists who prescribe opiates. 
Design:
 Surveys regarding screening practices and knowledge of opioid prescribing laws were distributed in March 2017 to oncology and congestive heart failure (CHF) clinicians at the University of Virginia. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used. 
Results:
 Forty-six of 129 (35.6%) oncology providers and 7 of 14 (50%) CHF providers reported prescribing opiates in their clinic with usable survey results. The majority of oncology (65.22%) and cardiology (85.71%) providers report screening for substance abuse ""when indicated"" (p = 0.053). Only 19.6% of oncologists reported always using the prescription monitoring program (PMP), while 71.43% of cardiologists reported using it always (p = 0.014). Of the oncology providers, 66.67% report never using the urine drug screen (UDS), while 86.7% of cardiologists reported using it ""when indicated"" (p = 0.0086). Up to 34.78% of the oncologists and 57.14% of the cardiologists reported of never screening the family members for misuse (p = 0.317). Knowledge of laws was similar between groups, with 14.29% of cardiology and 17.39% of oncology providers reporting no knowledge of opioid prescribing laws (p = 0.2869). 
Conclusions:
 Routine screening for substance misuse risk was uncommon for both groups, but cardiology providers were more likely to use the PMP or UDS. Knowledge gaps regarding Virginia laws were noted in both groups. Improved education regarding best practices and laws, as well as programs to promote screening, is needed for all providers.",Advancing Cancer Research in Africa Through Early-Career Awards: The BIG Cat Initiative.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009270,Journal of global oncology,2019 06 10,"The burden of cancer in Africa is growing rapidly, and increased cancer research on the continent is a critical component of an effective response.

Here, decorin expression was examined in human vulva carcinoma tissue samples and in primary and commercial cell lines representing this malignant disease. Furthermore, the effect of adenovirus-mediated decorin cDNA (Ad-DCN) transduction on the viability, proliferation, and the expression and activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB/HER) family members of the cell lines were investigated. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for decorin, it was demonstrated that malignant cells in human vulva carcinoma tissues lack decorin expression. This result was true independently on tumor stage, grade or human papillomavirus status. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the human vulva carcinoma cell lines used in this study were also negative for decorin expression. Transduction of the cell lines with Ad-DCN caused a marked reduction in cell viability, while the proliferation of the cells was not affected. Experiments examining potential mechanisms behind the oncosuppressive effect of Ad-DCN transduction revealed that ErbB2/HER2 expression and activity in carcinoma cells were markedly downregulated. In conclusion, the results of this study showed that human vulva carcinoma cells lack decorin expression, and that Ad-DCN transduction of these cells induces oncosuppressive activity in part via downregulation of ErbB2/HER2.",An altered composition of the microbiome in microscopic colitis is driven towards the composition in healthy controls by treatment with budesonide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009268,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,2019 05 29,"Background and aim: Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory disease of the bowel, hypothetically induced by an immunologic response to a luminal microbial agent. We aimed to characterize the microbiome composition in MC and subtypes collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) and to identify a possible microbial effect of treatment. Method: Stool samples were collected from MC patients prior to treatment, at 8 weeks (during treatment) and at 16 weeks (after treatment), and from healthy controls, not receiving treatment, at matched time-points. Microbiome composition was analyzed by sequencing of the 16S and 18S genes. Differences between patients and controls were analyzed by Shannon's diversity index (mean, standard deviation (SD)) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) complemented with a permanova test of UniFrac distances. Results: Ten LC patients, 10 CC patients and 10 controls were included. By PCoA, the bacterial composition in MC patients differed from controls at baseline (p = .02), but not during and after treatment (p = .09 and p = .33, respectively). At baseline, bacterial diversity was lower in MC patients compared to controls (2.5, SD: 0.5 vs 3.5, SD: 0.3, p < .05). Diversity in MC patients increased during (3.0, SD: 0.6) and after treatment and (2.9, SD: 0.5) compared with baseline (p < .01). Eukaryotes were detected in fewer samples from MC patients compared with controls (11/20 (55%) vs. 9/10 (90%), p = .06) with no effect of treatment. Conclusion: Microbiome composition is altered in MC patients. During and after treatment with budesonide the microbiome composition in MC patients was driven towards the composition in healthy controls.",Pattern and Outcome of Uveitis in a Tertiary Military Hospital in Thailand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009267,Ocular immunology and inflammation,2019 04 22,"Causes of uveitis vary upon the epidemiologic, racial, and geographical variations."

Careful and proper selection of adjuvants helps in promoting appropriate immune responses against target pathogens at both innate and adaptive levels such that protective immunity can be elicited. Areas covered: Herein, we describe the recent progress in our understanding of the mode of action of adjuvants that are licensed for use in human vaccines or in clinical or pre-clinical stages at both innate and adaptive levels. Different pathogens have distinct characteristics, which require the host to mount an appropriate immune response against them. Adjuvants can be selected to elicit a tailor-made immune response to specific pathogens based on their unique properties. Identification of biomarkers of adjuvanticity for several candidate vaccines using omics-based technologies can unravel the mechanism of action of modern and experimental adjuvants. Expert opinion: Adjuvant technology has been revolutionized over the last two decades. In-depth understanding of the role of adjuvants in activating the innate immune system, combined with systems vaccinology approaches, have led to the development of next-generation, novel adjuvants that can be used in vaccines against challenging pathogens and in specific target populations.",Storage Conditions of Insulin in Domestic Refrigerators and When Carried by Patients: Often Outside Recommended Temperature Range.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009254,Diabetes technology & therapeutics,2019 05 07,"
Objective:
 Not much is known about how people with diabetes store their insulin. Objective of our evaluation was to analyze at which temperature insulin is stored in domestic refrigerators and when opened/carried as a spare, and if these temperatures meet the manufacturers' recommendations. 
Methods:
 People with diabetes (n = 338; 46% US, 41% EU) put Bluetooth-enabled temperature sensors (MedAngel ONE, Netherlands) next to the insulin into their refrigerator or diabetes bag. Measurement results were transferred to an app and stored in a protected online database. 
Results:
 Temperature logs from 400 sensors were analyzed (230 for refrigerated, 170 for carried insulin). Deviations outside the recommended range were found in 315 (78.8%) logs (230 [100%] refrigerated, 85 [50%] carried). For refrigerated insulin, temperature recorded was out of range 11.3% of the time, on average 2 h 43 min/day with an average deviation of 3.7 K. For carried insulin, temperatures were out of range 0.5% of the time (8 min/day) with an average deviation of 1.1 K. Seventeen percent of sensors measured temperatures <0°C (57 of sensors for refrigerated, 9 for carried insulin). 
Conclusions:
 Storage conditions of insulin are known to have an impact on its blood glucose-lowering effect. This is the first study investigating temperature conditions of insulin storage in industrialized countries. In a clinically relevant percentage of storage time, insulin was exposed to temperatures outside the recommended range, especially when refrigerated. Thus, domestic refrigerators may pose an underestimated risk for insulin quality.",Effect of Knockout Serum Replacement During Postwarming Recovery Culture on the Development and Quality of Vitrified Parthenogenetic Porcine Blastocysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009253,Biopreservation and biobanking,2019 04 22,"The postwarming recovery culture, as one of the steps in cryopreservation process, is directly correlated with the survival and quality of embryos. Generally, recovery medium includes undefined serum or serum components that may cause the instability of results and other problems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of knockout serum replacement (KSR) as a substitute for serum during recovery culture on the development and quality of vitrified parthenogenetic porcine blastocysts. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used as a positive control. The expanded blastocysts on day 5 were vitrified by the Cryotop method, and recovered with 10% (v/v) KSR or 10% (v/v) FBS for 48 hours after warming. Survival and hatching rates of vitrified blastocysts were significantly increased by KSR or FBS supplementation. The vitrified blastocysts recovered in KSR or FBS exhibited significantly decreased percentages of membrane damage and apoptosis, and increased total cells. Addition of KSR or FBS during recovery culture significantly reduced reactive oxygen species levels, and improved mitochondrial activity and adenosine triphosphates content in the vitrified blastocysts. Vitrification did not affect the gene expression of PCNA, CDX2, and CPT1, but significantly increased mRNA levels of POU5F1 and uPA. KSR added to the recovery medium significantly upregulated mRNA levels of PCNA and CPT1, and downregulated POU5F1 mRNA levels. The expression levels of PCNA, CDX2, CPT1, and uPA in vitrified blastocysts were significantly upregulated by addition of FBS to recovery medium. Moreover, the BAX: BCL2L1 ratio was similar between fresh and vitrified blastocysts, and KSR or FBS supplementation had no effect on the value. In conclusion, our data showed that KSR supplementation during recovery culture can improve the development and quality of vitrified parthenogenetic porcine blastocysts. These findings provide a useful reference that KSR could be used to replace FBS as a defined serum supplement for recovery culture of vitrified blastocysts.","Development of a Biobank from a Legacy Collection in Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia: Proposed Approach for Centralized Biobank Development in Low-Resource Institutions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009252,Biopreservation and biobanking,2019 04 22,"
Introduction:
 The establishment of a biobank requires specific expertise along with relatively expensive infrastructure and appropriate technology. This causes certain challenges in biobank implementation for research in low-middle-income countries. Biobank development with established specimens and data collection (legacy collection) was an approach used in the Faculty of Medicine, Public Health and Nursing, Universitas Gadjah Mada. This approach aimed to identify the resources available at present, while providing nontechnical information for further development of a centralized biobank. 
Materials and Methods:
 Retrospective modeling was done in 2015 by recruiting existing specimen collections and their associated data. The steps were as follows: (1) informing research stakeholders through discussion with experts and stakeholders; (2) identifying specimen collections to be used; (3) determining the system, infrastructure, and consumables needed; (4) determining inclusion criteria; (5) building an in-house database system; (6) organizing data and physical specimen collections; and (7) validating data and physical sample arrangement. All technical procedures were built into standard operating procedures. Results: The model included specimens from one -80°C freezer. The associated data included demographic, clinical diagnosis, and physical sample information. Samples came from six studies, collected between 2001 and 2014. A web-based database was built based on the MySQL programming system. Information on biospecimens from a total of 4196 subjects collected in 11,358 vials was entered into the database, following physical rearrangement of vials in the -80°C freezer with one-dimensional barcodes taped to vials, boxes, and racks. A validation test was done for data concordance between the database and physical arrangement in the -80°C freezer, showing no discrepancies. 
Conclusion:
 This report demonstrated current technical and nontechnical insights to further develop a centralized biobank for health research at an academic institution in Indonesia.",Antibacterial Effects of Phytic Acid against Foodborne Pathogens and Investigation of Its Mode of Action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009250,Journal of food protection,2019 05 01,"This study investigated the antimicrobial mechanism of phytic acid (PA) and its antibacterial effects in combination with ethanol. The MIC of PA on Escherichia coli ATCC 11229, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, and Salmonella Typhimurium CICC 27483 were 0.24, 0.20, 0.26, and 0.28% (w/w), respectively. E. coli ATCC 11229 and S. aureus ATCC 6538P were selected to investigate the mechanism of PA by analyzing its effects at 1/2MIC and at MIC on the cell morphology, intracellular ATP, and cell membrane integrity. Environmental scanning electron microscope images revealed that PA was able to change the cell morphology and disrupt the intercellular adhesion. PA retarded bacterial growth and caused cell membrane dysfunction, which was accompanied by decreased intracellular ATP concentrations. Flow cytometry analysis further revealed that almost all the bacterial cells were damaged after treatment with PA at its MIC for 2 h. Moreover, PA has a synergistic antimicrobial ability when used in combination with ethanol. These results suggested that PA is effective in inhibiting growth of foodborne pathogens mainly by the mechanism of cell membrane damage and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of natural antimicrobial agents in the food industry.","Prevalence, Levels, and Viability of Salmonella in and on Raw Chicken Livers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009249,Journal of food protection,2019 05 01,"We surveyed chicken livers from various sources for the presence and levels of Salmonella. The pathogen was recovered from 148 (59.4%) of 249 chicken livers purchased at retail stores in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania over about a 9-month period. Positive samples harbored Salmonella at levels of 6.4 most probable number (MPN)/g to 2.4 log CFU/g. The percentage of Salmonella-positive livers purchased at retail outlets in New Jersey (72%, 59 of 82 livers) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the percentage for livers purchased in Delaware (48%, 36 of 75 livers); however, this percentage was not significantly different (P > 0.05) from that for livers purchased in Pennsylvania (57.6%, 53 of 92 livers). The pathogen was also recovered more often (P = 0.019) from livers that were packaged by retailers (81 of 121 livers, 66.9%) than from livers packaged directly by processors (67 of 128 livers, 52.3%). In related studies, 12 (5.8%) of 207 chicken livers harvested from birds on a research farm tested positive for Salmonella at levels of 0.4 to 2.2 MPN/g. The recovery rate of Salmonella was 4.4% (6 of 135 livers) from livers with the gall bladder attached and 8.3% (6 of 72 livers) from livers when the gall bladder was removed at harvest on the research farm. We also quantified the levels of a nine-strain cocktail (ca. 6.5 log CFU/g) of Salmonella strains inoculated externally onto or internally into livers both before and after extended cold storage. Storage for at least 2 days at 4°C or 15 days at -20°C resulted in a decrease of about 1.0 log CFU/g in pathogen levels. Given the relatively high recovery rate (ca. 6.0 to 60.0%) and high (possibly illness causing) levels (0.4 MPN/g to 2.4 CFU/g) of Salmonella associated with chicken livers in the present study, further interventions for processors are needed to lower the prevalence and levels of this pathogen on poultry liver.",Impact of Hanging Motionless in Harness on Respiratory and Blood Pressure Reflex Modulation in Mountain Climbers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009248,High altitude medicine & biology,2019 05 31,"Harness hang syncope (HHS) is a risk that specifically affects safety of harness' users in mountain climbing. 
Aims:
 To evaluate individual patterns of breathing resulting from deranged cardiovascular reflexes triggering a syncopal event when a mismatch between cerebral O2 demand and supply is present. 
Results:
 Forty healthy participants [aged 39.1 (8.2) years] were enrolled in a motionless suspension test while hanging in harness. Respiratory gas exchange values were analyzed to assess the pattern of breathing (EpInWel, respiratory elastic power) and cardiovascular parameters were monitored (BP, blood pressure). Four participants experienced HHS after 30.0 (7.6) minutes, with an early manifestation of loss of control of both a sustainable EpInWel and BP, starting after 10-12 minutes. Among the other participants, two different reactions were observed during suspension: (1) group G1 tolerated 32.7 (11.4) minutes of suspension by a favorable adaptation of the EpInWel and BP parameters and (2) group G2 showed significantly shorter time of suspension 24.0 (10.4) minutes with unfavorable increase in EpInWel and BP. 
Conclusions:
 Greater resistance to HHS occurs in people developing less marked fluctuations of both respiratory and cardiovascular reflex responses. Conversely, wider fluctuations both in control of EpInWel and BP were observed in the event of decreased suspension tolerance or in syncopal events.",Chemical constituents and HRESI-MS analysis of an Algerian endemic plant - Verbascum atlanticum batt. - extracts and their antioxidant activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009247,Natural product research,2019 04 22,"This is the first report on the phytochemistry and antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate and n- butanol extracts from an Algerian endemic plant Verbascum atlanticum Batt.

Pharmacotherapy, in combination with behavioral interventions, has the potential to increase the likelihood of successful treatment for youth struggling with SUD; however, the literature in this area is limited. To date, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for adolescent SUD, other than buprenorphine, which has been approved down to 16 years of age for opioid use disorder. Despite alcohol and cannabis being the most commonly used substances during adolescence, only three medications have been tested among this demographic, and only two have warranted further study (i.e., naltrexone for alcohol and N-acetylcysteine for cannabis use disorder). Although less common in adolescents and young adults, the most promising pharmacological findings for this age group are for opioid (buprenorphine) and tobacco (bupropion and varenicline) use disorders. In addition, despite the recent marked increases in electronic nicotine delivery systems (i.e., vaping) among youth, treatment strategies are still in their infancy and no recommendation exists for how to promote cessation for youth vaping. Current findings are limited by: small, demographically homogeneous samples; few trials, including a substantial number of youth younger than 18; low retention; medication adherence rates; and minimal information on effective dosing levels and long-term outcomes. Overall, pharmacotherapy may be a potentially effective strategy to increase treatment effects; however, more rigorous research trials are warranted before FDA approval would be granted for any of the potential adjunctive medications in this age group.",Quality Management System in the BBMRI.pl Consortium: Status Before the Formation of the Polish Biobanking Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009233,Biopreservation and biobanking,2019 04 22,"Many types of biomedical research projects depend on high-quality biological material with a data set attached.

This report introduces artificial multiple quantum wells (MQWs) built from CsPbBr3 perovskite materials using commonly available thermal evaporator systems. These perovskite-based MQWs are spatially aligned on a large-area substrate with multiple stacking and systematic control over well/barrier thicknesses, resulting in tunable optical properties and a carrier confinement effect. The fabricated CsPbBr3 artificial MQWs can be designed to display a variety of photoluminescence (PL) characteristics, such as a PL peak shift commensurate with the well/barrier thickness, multiwavelength emissions from asymmetric quantum wells, the quantum tunneling effect, and long-lived hot-carrier states.

Using tabulated molar volumes for ammonia and ammonium, we have the result V̅(e-aq) - V̅(H) = 11.3 cm3/mol at 25 °C, confirming that V̅(e-aq) is positive and even larger than the hydrophobic H atom. Assuming on the basis of recent molecular dynamics simulations that the molar volume of the H atom is somewhat less than that of H2, we estimate V̅(e-aq) = 26 ± 6 cm3/mol.

It has become a serious public health problem whose solution requires medical research in order to explore novel effective antimicrobial molecules. On the one hand, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are regarded as good alternatives because of their generally broad-spectrum activities, but sometimes they can be easily degraded by the organism or be toxic to animal cells. On the other hand, cationic carbosilane dendrons, whose focal point can be functionalized in many different ways, have also shown good antimicrobial activity. In this work, we synthetized first- and second-generation cationic carbosilane dendrons with a maleimide molecule on their focal point, enabling their functionalization with three different AMPs. After different microbiology studies, we found an additive effect between first-generation dendron and AMP3 whose study reveals three interesting effects: (i) bacteria aggregation due to AMP3, which could facilitate bacteria detection or even contribute to antibacterial activity by preventing host cell attack, (ii) bacteria disaggregation capability of second-generation cationic dendrons, and (iii) a higher AMP3 aggregation ability when dendrons were added previously to peptide treatment.

Here, Pb-RBA in 14 Pb-contaminated soils were assessed using an in vivo mouse bioassay and compared to Pb bioaccessibility by the gastrointestinal phase of the UBM (Unified Bioaccessibility research group of Europe (BARGE) Method) in vitro assay with and without 0.45 μm filtration of GI fluid. Results showed good IVIVC between Pb-RBA and Pb bioaccessibility without filtration ( r 2 = 0.62), while Pb bioaccessibility with filtration provided a poor correlation with Pb-RBA ( r 2 = 0.16). This suggested that besides dissolved Pb ions, Pb-complexes formed in the UBM gastrointestinal fluid might also contribute to bioavailable Pb. To ascertain this, DGT (diffusive gradients in thin-films) devices which can measure both Pb2+ ions and labile inorganic and organic Pb-complexes were introduced to the UBM fluids to measure Pb DGT-bioaccessibility, which showed strong correlation to Pb-RBA ( r 2 = 0.71). With increasing diffusive gel thickness which could enhance release of Pb ions from Pb-complexes, Pb DGT-bioaccessibility increased by 3.4-5.7 times, while inclusion of dialysis membrane within DGT devices significantly decreased Pb DGT-bioaccessibility by inhibiting diffusion of Pb complexes to binding gel. These results confirmed the contribution of Pb-complexes to Pb bioavailability, providing new insights to Pb bioavailability.","Synthesis, Spectroscopy, and Theoretical Details of Uranyl Schiff-Base Coordination Complexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009208,Inorganic chemistry,2019 06 12,"Two uranyl Schiff-base coordination complexes, UO2L(MeOH) and UO2Cl2(H2L) {L = N, N'-bis[(4,4'-diethylamino)salicylidene]-1,2-phenylenediamine}, have been synthesized that feature a rigid phenyl backbone.

Thermodynamic modeling and several experimental Cu-Fe-O system investigations did not focus specifically on the possible nonstoichiometry of this compound, which is, nevertheless, a very important optimization factor for its physicochemical properties. In this work, through a complete set of analytical and thermostructural techniques from 50 to 1100 °C, a fine reinvestigation of some specific regions of the Cu-Fe-O phase diagram under air was carried out to clarify discrepancies concerning the delafossite CuFeO2 stability region as well as the eutectic composition and temperature for the reaction L = CuFeO2 + Cu2O. Differential thermal analysis and Tammann's triangle method were used to measure the liquidus temperature at 1050 ± 2 °C with a eutectic composition at Fe/(Cu + Fe) = 0.105 mol %. The quantification of all of the present phases during heating and cooling using Rietveld refinement of the high-temperature X-ray diffraction patterns coupled with thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses revealed the mechanism of formation of delafossite CuFeO2 from stable CuO and spinel phases at 1022 ± 2 °C and its incongruent decomposition into liquid and spinel phases at 1070 ± 2 °C. For the first time, a cationic off-stoichiometry of cuprous ferrite CuFe1- yO2-δ was unambiguous, as evidenced by two independent sets of experiments: (1) Electron probe microanalysis evidenced homogeneous micronic CuFe1- yO2-δ areas with a maximum y value of 0.12 [i.e., Fe/(Cu + Fe) = 0.47] on Cu/Fe gradient generated by diffusion from a perfect spark plasma sintering pristine interface. Micro-Raman provided structural proof of the existence of the delafossite structure in these areas. (2) Standard Cu additions from the stoichiometric compound CuFeO2 coupled with high-temperature X-ray diffraction corroborated the possibility of obtaining a pure Cu-excess delafossite phase with y = 0.12. No evidence of an Fe-rich delafossite was found, and complementary analysis under a neutral atmosphere shows narrow lattice parameter variation with an increase of Cu in the delafossite structure. The consistent new data set is summarized in an updated experimental Cu-Fe-O phase diagram. These results provide an improved understanding of the stability region and possible nonstoichiometry value of the CuFe1- yO2-δ delafossite in the Cu-Fe-O phase diagram, enabling its optimization for specific applications.",Structural and Functional Studies of the Membrane-Binding Domain of NADPH-Cytochrome P450 Oxidoreductase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009206,Biochemistry,2019 05 15,"NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CYPOR), the essential flavoprotein of the microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system, is anchored in the phospholipid bilayer by its amino-terminal membrane-binding domain (MBD), which is necessary for efficient electron transfer to cytochrome P450. Although crystallographic and kinetic studies have established the structure of the soluble catalytic domain and the role of conformational motions in the control of electron transfer, the role of the MBD is largely unknown. We examined the role of the MBD in P450 catalysis through studies of amino-terminal deletion mutants and site-directed spin labeling. We show that the MBD spans the membrane and present a model for the orientation of CYPOR on the membrane capable of forming a complex with cytochrome P450. EPR power saturation measurements of CYPOR mutants in liposomes containing a lipid/Ni(II) chelate identified a region of the soluble domain interacting with the membrane. The deletion of more than 29 residues from the N-terminus of CYPOR decreases cytochrome P450 activity concomitant with alterations in electrophoretic mobility and an increased resistance to protease digestion. The altered kinetic properties of these mutants are consistent with electron transfer through random collisions rather than via formation of a stable CYPOR-P450 complex. Purified MBD binds weakly to cytochrome P450, suggesting that other interactions are also required for CYPOR-P450 complex formation. We propose that the MBD and flexible tether region of CYPOR, residues 51-63, play an important role in facilitating the movement of the soluble domain relative to the membrane and in promoting multiple orientations that permit specific interactions of CYPOR with its varied partners.",Two-Dimensional Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-L-Derived Iron-Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticle-Composed Nanosheet Array for Water Oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009205,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 08,"Rational design of various functional nanomaterials using MOFs as a template provides an effective strategy to synthesize electrocatalysts for water splitting.

Specifically, the zeolitic imidazolate framework-L-Co nanosheet array (ZIF-L-Co NS/CC) was synthesized through a facile ambient liquid-phase deposition reaction, and then reacted with [Fe(CN)6]3- ions as precursors during the anion-exchange reaction at room temperature.

Adverse outcomes caused by pollutants to ecosystems are determined not only by toxic properties but also ecological contexts of ecosystems, including indigenous biodiversity and community composition. It is therefore important to identify key factors, such as diversity of species and traits that determine the vulnerability of structures and functions of ecosystems in response to toxic substances. Detection and quantification of biodiversity and its activities using environmental DNA (eDNA) is arguably one of the most important technical advances in ecology in recent years. A huge opportunity has appeared to allow more relevant approaches for assessments of risks posed to ecosystems by toxic substances. eDNA approaches provide effective and efficient tools to evaluate the effects of chemical pollutants on (1) the occurrences and population of wildlife, (2) communities, and (3) the function of ecosystem in the field. Here a conceptual framework of adverse outcome pathways to relate molecular initiating events to apical ecosystem-level responses is proposed to connecting laboratory-based prediction to observations under field conditions. Particularly, future research opportunities on effects on biodiversity, community structure, and ecosystem function by toxic substances will be discussed.",New Strategy for Ultrasensitive Aptasensor Fabrication: D-A-D Constitution as a Charge Transfer Platform and Recognition Element.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009203,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 17,"Over the past decade, various sensing systems based on aptamers have attracted a great deal of studies directed at designing highly selective biosensors. In this paper, we described a new-style electrochemical aptamer sensor (aptasensor) via a donor-acceptor link substrate, which was characterized by electrochemical methods and other helpful characterization instruments. Molecules with D-A-D configuration always undergo an intrinsic signal amplification due to the elongation of the π-electron conjugation. Triphenylamine, a peripheral electron donor, has excellent hole-transport property and is able to assemble on the surface of glassy carbon electrode by π-π stacking interaction. To further improve the performance of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensor, we chose diphenylfumaronitrile-containing electron-withdrawing group as the central core to promote charge transfer, which can also efficiently combine with aptamers by multihydrogen bond function. Surprisingly, the sensing platform showed a wide liner range from 0.1 pM to 100 nM, with a detection limit of 0.018 pM. We examined the ATP in human serum sample, indicating that the novel aptasensor based on D-A-D conjugated polymer holds great possibility for practical detection of ATP.

Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are considered as promising adsorbents to remove the PPCPs. To overcome the limitation of PAFs in their powder forms for large-scale applications, herein, we proposed a strategy to covalently anchor PAFs onto electrospun polymer fiber membranes. Polyaniline (PANI) played the role of aromatic seed layer, which was coated on the electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber membrane first. Then, PAF-45 modification was in situ synthesized in the presence of the PANI-coated electrospun PAN fiber membrane. This study could make the PAF-based materials be handled more easily and improve the surface area of electrospun fiber membrane. The obtained composite adsorbent (PAF-45-PP FM) was applied for the adsorption of three PPCPs: ibuprofen (IBPF), chloroxylenol (CLXN), and N, N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), which exhibited high adsorption capacity and good recycling ability. According to the Langmuir model, the maximum adsorption capacities of PAF-45-PP FM toward IBPF, CLXN and DEET were 613.50, 429.18, and 384.61 mg/g, respectively. In addition, after ten adsorption-desorption cycles, the adsorption capacities toward the three PPCPs decreased slightly. Through an adsorption comparison test, the adsorption capacity of PAF-45-PP FM almost attributed to the loading PAF-45. The adsorption mechanism analysis illustrated that there were pore capture, hydrophobic interaction and π-π interaction between PPCPs and PAF-45-PP FM. Therefore, the PAF-45-PP FM can be potential adsorbents to purify water contaminated with PPCPs.",Cross-Correlative Single-Cell Analysis Reveals Biological Mechanisms of Nanoparticle Radiosensitization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009200,ACS nano,2019 06 10,"Nanoparticle radiosensitization has been demonstrated well to enhance the effects of radiotherapy, motivate the improvement of therapeutic ratios, and decrease morbidity in cancer treatment. A significant challenge exists in optimizing formulations and translation due to insufficient knowledge of the associated mechanisms, which have historically been limited to physical concepts. Here, we investigated a concept for the role of biological mechanisms. The mere presence of gold nanoparticles led to a down-regulation of thymidylate synthase, important for DNA damage repair in the radioresistant S-phase cells. By developing a cross-correlative methodology to reveal probabilistic gold nanoparticle uptake by cell sub-populations and the associated sensitization as a function of the uptake, a number of revealing observations have been achieved. Surprisingly, for low numbers of nanoparticles, a desensitization action was observed. Sensitization was discovered to preferentially impact S-phase cells, in which impairment of the DNA damage response by the homologous recombination pathway dominates. This small but radioresistant cell population correlates with much greater proliferative ability. Thus, a paradigm is presented whereby enhanced DNA damage is not necessarily due to an increase in the number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created but can be from a nanoparticle-induced impairment of the damage response by down-regulating repair proteins such as thymidylate synthase.",Flexible Organometal-Halide Perovskite Lasers for Speckle Reduction in Imaging Projection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009199,ACS nano,2019 05 29,"Disorder is emerging as a strategy for fabricating random laser sources with very promising materials, such as perovskites, for which standard laser cavities are not effective or too expensive. We need, however, different fabrication protocols and technologies for reducing the laser threshold and controlling its emission. Here, we demonstrate an effectively solvent-engineered method for high-quality perovskite thin films on a flexible polyimide substrate. The fractal perovskite thin films exhibit excellent optical properties at room temperature and easily achieve lasing action without any laser cavity above room temperature with a low pumping threshold. The lasing action is also observed in curved perovskite thin films on flexible substrates. The lasing threshold can be further reduced by increasing the local curvature, which modifies the scattering strengths of the bent thin film. We also show that the curved perovskite lasers are extremely robust with respect to repeated deformations. Because of the low spatial coherence, these curved random laser devices are efficient and durable speckle-free light sources for applications in spectroscopy, bioimaging, and illumination."

The injury induced by surgical implantation of bone replacement graft materials initiates a cascade of host responses, starting with blood-biomaterial contact, protein adsorption on the material surface, blood coagulation, and leukocyte responses. During the initial acute inflammatory response, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and monocytes, abundant circulating leukocytes of the myeloid lineage, are recruited to the site of inflammation. In addition to responding to pathogenic challenges, these cells respond to particulate substances within the body including crystals of monosodium urate (MSU). Host responses toward grafts impact short- and long-term success in tissue engineering and regenerative applications. Although multinucleated osteoclasts, formed by monocyte/macrophage fusion, are generally thought to be responsible for resorption of implant biomaterials, the ability of different biomaterials to trigger PMNs, which are invariably present at the early stages after implant surgery, and are abundant in the oral cavity, has never been tested. In this article, we present analysis of the response of human blood-derived PMNs and monocytes toward brushite, monetite, and calcium polyphosphate (CPP) biomaterial substrates and compare this to the response to MSU crystals, the latter serving as a positive control. Employing multicolor flow cytometry to look at PMN and monocyte cell surface markers of activation to gauge the response to different biomaterials, we found that both types of myeloid cells are highly activated after exposure to brushite, monetite, and MSU but not CPP. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Part B, Applied biomaterials",2019 04 22,"In this work, bone formation/remodeling/maturation was correlated with the presence of multinucleated giant cells (MGCs)/osteoclasts (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAP]-positive cells) on the surface of beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP), sintered deproteinized bovine bone (sDBB), and carbonated deproteinized bovine bone (cDBB) using a maxillary sinus augmentation (MSA) in a New Zealand rabbit model. Microtomographic, histomorphometric, and immunolabeling for TRAP-cells analyses were made at 15, 30, and 60 days after surgery. In all treatments, a faster bone formation/remodeling/maturation and TRAP-positive cells activity occurred in the osteotomy region of the MSA than in the middle and submucosa regions. In the β-TCP, the granules were rapidly reabsorbed by TRAP-positive cells and replaced by bone tissue. β-TCP enabled quick bone regeneration/remodeling and full bone and marrow restoration until 60 days, but with a significant reduction in MSA volume. In cDBB and sDBB, the quantity of TRAP-positive cells was smaller than in β-TCP, and these cells were associated with granule surface preparation for osteoblast-mediated bone formation. After 30 days, more than 80% of granule surfaces were surrounded and integrated by bone tissue without signs of degradation, preserving the MSA volume. Overall, the materials tested in a standardized preclinical model led to different bone formation/remodeling/maturation within the same repair process influenced by different microenvironments and MGCs/osteoclasts. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this sense, one approach is to search for inhibitors of important enzymes in its metabolism. According to this, the shikimate pathway is an important metabolic route in bacteria and its enzymes are considered as great targets for the development of new antibiotic drugs. One of these enzymes is the shikimate dehydrogenase, that catalyze the reversal reduction from 3-dehydroshikimate to shikimate using NADPH as cofactor. In this work, four new compounds were found capable of inhibiting the SDH from S. aureus (SaSDH) activity. A detailed kinetic characterization showed that the most potent inhibitor presented a Ki of 8 and 10 μM with respect to shikimate and NADP+ , respectively, and a mixed partial inhibition mechanism for both substrates. Molecular dynamics studies revealed that the four inhibitors perturb the structure of SaSDH affecting important domains. Toxicological and physicochemical parameters indicated that these compounds can be considered as potential drugs. Therefore, these compounds are good hits that will help in the process to obtain a new drug against MRSA. This article is protected by copyright.

The special stains like periodic acid schiff (PAS) highlights the fungus and the Masson Fontana confirm the melanin pigment and dematiaceous nature of the fungi.

The fine-needle aspiration cytological (FNAC) diagnosis and sub-typing of this tumor is challenging, which is of critical importance from its treatment point of view. All cases with a clinicoradiological impression of ""HB"" during the study period of 1 year were subjected to ultrasound-guided (USG) FNAC and cell blocks were prepared in all cases. Detailed cytopathological examination was carried out based on the cytomorphological pattern and the cell blocks were used to correlate the findings and the final diagnoses were confirmed with the histopathological findings. Four cases were included during this study period. All were children, whose age ranged from 3 months to 10 years. All of them presented with mass per abdomen and increased serum alfa-feto protein (AFP) levels. On a detailed cytological examination, the clinical impression of HB was confirmed in all four cases with a subsequent histological correlation. Based on their distinct cytomorphological pattern, three of them were accurately sub-typed as""fetal type,"" wile the fourth was an ""embryonal type of HB."" All four cases had the evidence of extramedullary hematopoeisis. We conclude that a precise preoperative FNAC diagnosis with accurate sub-typing of HB is possible purely on cytomorphologic basis which has prognostic and therapeutic implications. Cell blocks are of great use for ancillary studies.

One important drawback of this system is the presence of lipopolysaccharides. The generally recognized as safe Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) would constitute a safer alternative for plasmid production. A key requirement for the establishment of a cost-effective L. lactis-based plasmid manufacturing is the availability of high-copy number plasmids. Unfortunately, the highest copy number reported in Gram-positive bacteria for the pAMβ1 replicon is around 100 copies. The purpose of this work is to engineer the repDE ribosome-binding site (RBS) of the pTRKH3 plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis in order to increase the plasmid copy number in L. lactis LMG19460 cells. The pTRKH3-b mutant is the most promising candidate, achieving 215 copies of plasmid per chromosome, a 3.5-fold increase when compared to the nonmodified pTRKH3, probably due to a stronger RBS sequence, a messenger RNA secondary structure that promotes the RepDE expression, an ideal intermediate amount of transcriptional repressors and the presence of a duplicated region that added an additional RBS sequence and one new in-frame start codon. pTRKH3-b is a promising high-copy number shuttle plasmid that will contribute to turn lactic acid bacteria into a safer and economically viable alternative as DNA vaccines producers.","One Modification, Two Functions: Single Ni-modified Light-Driven ZnO Microrockets with Both Efficient Propulsion and Steerable Motion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009170,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 05 24,"Efficient propulsion and effective direction control are essential for self-propelled micro/nanomotors.

This successful demonstration of ZnO-Ni microrockets is significant for the development of highly efficient synthetic micro/nanomotors, which have strong delivery ability and efficient direction control for future applications across the micro/nanoscale field.",Variability in content and dissolution profiles of MDMA tablets collected in the UK between 2001 and 2018 - A potential risk to users?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009168,Drug testing and analysis,2019 05 15,"3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) tablets are widely used recreationally, and not only vary in appearance, but also in MDMA content. Recently, the prevalence of high-content tablets is of concern to public health authorities. To compare UK data with other countries, we evaluated MDMA content of 412 tablets collected from the UK, 2001-2018, and investigated within-batch content variability for a sub-set of these samples. In addition, we investigated dissolution profiles of tablets using pharmaceutical industry-standard dissolution experiments on 247 tablets. All analyses were carried out using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our data supported other studies, in that recent samples (2016-2018) tend to have higher MDMA content compared to earlier years. In 2018, the median MDMA content exceeded 100 mg free-base for the first time. Dramatic within-batch content variability (up to 136 mg difference) was also demonstrated. Statistical evaluation of dissolution profiles at 15-minutes allowed tablets to be categorized as fast-, intermediate-, or slow-releasing, but no tablet characteristics correlated with dissolution classification. Hence, there would be no way of users knowing a priori whether a tablet is more likely to be fast or slow-releasing. Further, within-batch variation in dissolution rate was observed. Rapid assessment of MDMA content alone provides important data for harm reduction, but does not account for variability in (a) the remainder of tablets in a batch, or (b) MDMA dissolution profiles. Clinical manifestations of MDMA toxicity, especially for high-content, slow-releasing tablets, may be delayed or prolonged, and there is a significant risk of users re-dosing if absorption is delayed.",A foldable manipulator with tunable stiffness based on braided structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009167,"Journal of biomedical materials research. Part B, Applied biomaterials",2019 04 22,"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has recently seen a surge in clinical applications due to its potential benefits over open surgery. In MIS, a long manipulator is placed through a tortuous human orifice to create a channel for surgical tools and provide support when they are operated. Currently the relative large profile and low stiffness of the manipulators limit the effectiveness and accuracy of MIS. Here we propose a new foldable manipulator with tunable stiffness. The manipulator takes a braided skeleton to enable radial folding, whereas membrane is used to seal the skeleton so as to adjust stiffness through creating negative pressure. We demonstrated experimentally, numerically, and analytically that, a flexible and a rigid state were obtained, and the ratio of bending stiffness in the rigid state to that in the flexible state reached 6.85. In addition, the manipulator achieved a radial folding ratio of 1.95. The proposed manipulator shows great potential in the design of surgical robots for MIS. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Previously a duplication variant within A2ML1 was identified as a significant risk factor for otitis media in an indigenous Filipino population and in US children. In this report exome and Sanger sequencing was performed using DNA samples from the indigenous Filipino population, Filipino cochlear implantees, US probands, and Finnish and Pakistani families with otitis media. Sixteen novel, damaging A2ML1 variants identified in otitis media patients were rare or low-frequency in population-matched controls. In the indigenous population, both gingivitis and A2ML1 variants including the known duplication variant and the novel splice variant c.4061+1G>C were independently associated with otitis media. Sequencing of salivary RNA samples from indigenous Filipinos demonstrated lower A2ML1 expression according to carriage of A2ML1 variants. Sequencing of additional salivary RNA samples from US patients with otitis media revealed differentially expressed genes that are highly correlated with A2ML1 expression levels. In particular RND3 is upregulated in both A2ML1 variant carriers and high-A2ML1-expressors. These findings support a role for A2ML1 in keratinocyte differentiation within the middle ear as part of otitis media pathology and the potential application of ROCK inhibition in otitis media.

In this longitudinal study, we examined whether drinking water contaminants interact with negative family environments (parental psychological control) to predict changes in depressive symptoms in 110 adolescents-a developmental period when symptoms often first emerge. We found that for adolescents in psychologically controlling families, levels of drinking water contaminants prospectively predicted depressive symptoms 2 years later; this effect was not present in adolescents in non-controlling families. Importantly, these associations were not accounted for by family- or community-level socioeconomic resources, demographic features, or by the adolescents' stress exposure. These findings highlight the interplay of physical and psychological environments in influencing depressive symptoms in adolescents.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most prevalent cause of secondary hypertension (3% to 32% of hypertensive patients). The recent endocrine society clinical practice guideline (ESCPG), ""The Management of Primary Aldosteronism: Case Detection, Diagnosis, and Treatment"", differs from the previous version in the explicit recognition of PA as a major public health issue. Despite this, PA is underdiagnosed. The guidelines call on physicians to substantially ramp up the screening of hypertensive patients at risk of PA. Further, it recommends the plasma aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR), as the test of choice for screening for PA. However, the ARR is a highly variable test with reported diagnostic sensitivities and specificities ranging from 66% to 100% and 61% to 100% respectively. Variability of the ARR can be attributed to the high degree of within-subject variation, differences in sampling protocols, laboratory assays, reporting units, the effect of medications and the population characteristics used to establish the decision thresholds. These factors render the possibility of false positive and false negative results - which have the potential to adversely impact patients. The limitations and caveats to the use of the ARR necessitate an effective clinic-laboratory interface, with specialist physician and clinical scientist collaboration for ARR result interpretation. Improvement in the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the ARR is predicated on harmonisation of pre-testing patient preparation criteria, knowledge of the analytical methods used to derive the ratio and the method-specific threshold for PA.

As a newly identified miRNA, the function and potential mechanism of miR-188-5p in GC has not been thoroughly elucidated. Here, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction detection showed abnormally higher expression of miR-188-5p in GC cells and tissues. Gain-of-function analysis in vitro showed that miR-188-5p promoted GC cell proliferation and migration, while loss-of-function studies showed the reverse. Targetscan has predicted that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was a potential target gene of miR-188-5p. miR-188-5p suppressed PTEN messenger RNA and protein expression and activated downstream AKT/mTOR signaling in GC cells, but luciferase reporter analysis showed that PTEN was not regulated by miR-188-5p via the 3' untranslated region. Furthermore, we observed that miR-188-5p overexpression promoted Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) protein expression, cellular nuclear translocation, and transcription. Knockdown of SALL4 eliminated the effect of miR-188-5p in GC cells as well as suppression of PTEN. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-188-5p promotes GC cell proliferation and migration while suppressing tumor suppressor gene PTEN expression via transcriptional upregulation of oncogene SALL4.

In this study, the effect of sapylin on lung cancer cell A549 was investigated. A549 cell lines were treated with sapylin (0.1, 0.5, and 1 KE/mL) for different time intervals. A549 cell proliferation and apoptosis was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide/Ki67 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was used to determine the expressions of proteins involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT), Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathway. Level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was insured by using the ROS kit. Sapylin inhibited A549 cell viability and the expressions of proliferation-related proteins (cyclin E1 and D1) in dose- and time-dependent manners. Sapylin promoted apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manners. Sapylin also promoted the expressions of apoptotic proteins (cleaved caspase-3 and 8) in dose- and time-dependent manners. Furthermore, sapylin increased the intracellular concentration of ROS in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, the high expression of ROS level might induce inhibition of cell viability and increase cell apoptosis. The mechanistic study revealed that sapylin inactivated the PI3K/AKT and Wnt3a/β-catenin signaling pathways.

Here, we assemble functional mapping and allometry theory through Lokta-Volterra ordinary differential equations (LVODE) into an R-based computing platform, np2 QTL, aimed to map and visualize phenotypic plasticity QTLs. Based on LVODE parameters, np2 QTL constructs a bidirectional, signed and weighted network of QTL-QTL epistasis, whose emergent properties reflect the ecological mechanisms for genotype-environment interactions over any range of environmental change. The utility of np2 QTL was validated by comprehending the genetic architecture of phenotypic plasticity via the reanalysis of published plant height data involving 3502 recombinant inbred lines of maize planted in multiple discrete environments. np2 QTL also provides a tool for constructing a predictive model of phenotypic responses in extreme environments relative to the median environment."

Volatiles play an important role in the interaction of a plant with its environment. Through transcript profiling of jasmonate-elicited Medicago truncatula cells, we identified emission of methyl anthranilate (EMA) 1, a MYB transcription factor that is involved in the emission of the volatile compound methyl anthranilate when expressed in M. truncatula hairy roots, giving them a fruity scent. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of the fragrant roots revealed the upregulation of a methyltransferase that was subsequently characterized to catalyze the O-methylation of anthranilic acid and was hence named M. truncatula anthranilic acid methyl transferase (MtAAMT) 1. Given that direct activation of the MtAAMT1 promoter by EMA1 could not be unambiguously demonstrated, we further probed the RNA-Seq data and identified the repressor protein M. truncatula plant AT-rich sequence and zinc-binding (MtPLATZ) 1. Emission of methyl anthranilate 1 binds a tandem repeat of the ACCTAAC motif in the MtPLATZ1 promoter to transactivate gene expression. Overexpression of MtPLATZ1 in transgenic M. truncatula hairy roots led to transcriptional silencing of EMA1, indicating that MtPLATZ1 may be part of a negative feedback loop to control the expression of EMA1.

The aim of this study was to investigate the apparent effectiveness of these channel blockers using a model of trigeminal activation in vivo. Rats were anaesthetized before electrically stimulating the dura mater adjacent the middle meningeal artery. Neurons responding to stimulation were recorded extracellularly using electrophysiological methods. l-Glutamate or NMDA, and Mg2+ , memantine, or sodium controls were applied locally using microiontophoresis. Microiontophoretic application of Mg2+ or memantine into the trigeminocervical complex inhibited mechanically and electrically stimulated craniovascular afferents,  and l-glutamate or NMDA-evoked neuronal activity at the second-order trigeminal synapse of craniovascular afferents. By contrast, intravenous administration of MgSO4 (100 mg/kg) or memantine (10 mg/kg) did not significantly affect electrically stimulated afferent-evoked activity within the trigeminocervical complex. The Mg2+ and memantine concentrations achieved after systemic administration may not effectively inhibit activation of the trigeminocervical complex, perhaps providing an explanation for the relatively poor efficacy of these NMDA receptor open-channel blockers for headache treatment in clinical studies. Nevertheless, the present results suggest blocking of NMDA-receptor open channels inhibits nociceptive activation of the trigeminocervical complex. Further exploration of such channel blockers as a therapeutic strategy for primary head pain is warranted.",Rapid and accurate detection of Helicobacter pylori from biopsy specimens using loop-mediated isothermal amplification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009119,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",2019 06 11,"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a promising nucleic acid-based assay for quick, accurate and cost-effective diagnosis of many infectious agents.

In total, 155 patients were recruited and were categorized according to the presence of endocarditis or thromboembolic events with gender-age adjusted controls. Patients who deceased within 90 days or patients not chosen as controls were excluded. SAB management was supervised by an infectious disease specialist. Patients with endocarditis (N = 21), compared to controls (N = 21), presented lower antithrombin III at day 4 (p < 0.05), elevated antithrombin III at day 90 (p < 0.01), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time at days 4 and 10 (p < 0.05), and enhanced thrombin-antithrombin complex at day 4 (p < 0.01). Thromboembolic events (N = 8), compared to controls (N = 34), significantly increased thrombin-antithrombin complex at day 4 (p < 0.05). In receiver operating characteristic analysis, the changes in these hemostasis parameters at day 4 predicted endocarditis and thromboembolic events (p < 0.05). No differences in hemoglobin, thrombocyte, prothrombin fragment, thrombin time, factor VIII, D-dimer or fibrinogen levels were observed between cases and controls. The results suggest that nonfatal MS-SAB patients present marginal hemostasis parameter changes that, however, may have predictability for endocarditis or thromboembolic events.

This includes both the processing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs ready for translation and RNA-based silencing processes, such as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs is one important step in their processing and is carried out by three functionally specialized canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerases in Arabidopsis thaliana. Null mutations in one of these, termed PAPS1, result in a male gametophytic defect. Using a fluorescence-labelling strategy, we have characterized this defect in more detail using RNA and small-RNA sequencing. In addition to global defects in the expression of pollen-differentiation genes, paps1 null-mutant pollen shows a strong overaccumulation of transposable element (TE) transcripts, yet a depletion of 21- and particularly 24-nucleotide-long short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the corresponding TEs. Double-mutant analyses support a specific functional interaction between PAPS1 and components of the RdDM pathway, as evident from strong synergistic phenotypes in mutant combinations involving paps1, but not paps2 paps4, mutations. In particular, the double-mutant of paps1 and rna-dependent rna polymerase 6 (rdr6) shows a synergistic developmental phenotype disrupting the formation of the transmitting tract in the female gynoecium. Thus, our findings in A. thaliana uncover a potentially general link between canonical poly(A) polymerases as components of mRNA processing and RdDM, reflecting an analogous interaction in fission yeast.",The assembly of (+)-vincadifformine- and (-)-tabersonine-derived monoterpenoid indole alkaloids in Catharanthus roseus involves separate branch pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009114,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2019 05 21,"The biological activity of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) has led to their use in cancer treatment and other medical applications. Their biosynthesis has involved the formation of reactive intermediates by responsible enzymes to elaborate several different chemical scaffolds. Modification of scaffolds through different substitution reactions has produced chemically diverse MIAs and related biological activities. The present study characterizes the three-step pathway involved in the formation of (+)-echitovenine, the major O-acetylated MIA of Catharanthus roseus roots, and differentiates it from a parallel pathway involved in the formation of hörhammericine. Separate hydrolases convert a common reactive MIA intermediate to aspidosperma skeletons of opposite specific rotations, that is (+)-vincadifformine and (-)-tabersonine, respectively. The formation of (+) minovincinine from (+) vincadifformine 19-hydroxylase (V19H) is catalyzed by a root-specific cytochrome P450 with high amino acid sequence similarity to the leaf-specific tabersonine-3-hydroxylase involved in vindoline biosynthesis. Similarly, O-acetylation of (+)-minovincinine to form (+) echitovenine involves minovincinine-O-acetytransferase. The substrate specificity of V19H and MAT for their respective (+)-enantiomers defines the separate enantiomer-specific pathway involved in (+)-echitovenine biosynthesis and differentiates it from a parallel (-)-enantiomer-specific pathway involved in the formation of hörhammericine from (-)-tabersonine.","Sexual cues influence cocaine-induced locomotion, anxiety and the immunoreactivity of oestrogen receptor alpha and tyrosine hydroxylase in both sexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009113,Journal of neuroendocrinology,2019 05 08,"Dyadic physical social interaction influences cocaine-seeking behaviour, although whether limited sexual cues (LSC) from an opposite-sex partner influence the behavioural responses to cocaine is unclear. We investigated this issue using a cylindrical wire cage containing a stimulus mouse; the subject mouse (of the opposite sex) had access to this stimulus mouse during a ""binge"" injection pattern (injected with cocaine or saline vehicle twice a day at 6-hour intervals). Following the second injection, locomotion and anxiety-like behaviours were examined using the open-field and elevated plus maze test, at the same time as oestrogen receptor (ER)α and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivities were also examined. The data indicate that LSC enhanced cocaine-stimulated locomotion in both sexes and inhibited the levels of anxiety caused by cocaine in males only. Accompanying these changes, the interaction between LSC and cocaine altered ERα immunoreactivity in the ventral medial nuclei of the hypothalamus (VMH) and medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA) of males, whereas such interaction effects occurred in the VMH, MeA, arcuate nucleus (AR), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and lateral septum (LS) of females. LSC increased cocaine-induced ERα immunoreactivity in the VMH in males and reduced cocaine-induced ERα immunoreactivity in the AR and LS in females. LSC up-regulated cocaine-induced increases in ventral tegmental area (VTA) TH immunoreactivity in females only. Our present data suggest that interactions between LSC and cocaine led to changes in ERα and TH immunoreactivity in a brain region-specific manner, which showed subtle differences in both sexes. The effects of LSC-mediated cocaine-induced locomotion and anxiety may be associated with alterations in ERα and dopamine activation.",Organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides and bladder cancer: A case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009110,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 04 22,Exposure to pesticides is associated with an increase in the incidence of cancer.

Several quantities and procedures have been proposed to assess the utility of a surrogate marker. However, few methods have been proposed to address how one might use the surrogate marker information to test for a treatment effect at an earlier time point, especially in settings where the primary outcome and the surrogate marker are subject to censoring. In this paper, we propose a novel test statistic to test for a treatment effect using surrogate marker information measured prior to the end of the study in a time-to-event outcome setting. We propose a robust nonparametric estimation procedure and propose inference procedures. In addition, we evaluate the power for the design of a future study based on surrogate marker information. We illustrate the proposed procedure and relative power of the proposed test compared to a test performed at the end of the study using simulation studies and an application to data from the Diabetes Prevention Program.

In order to investigate the multivariate spatial dependence properties of air pollution extremes, we introduce a new class of multivariate max-stable processes. Our proposed model admits a hierarchical tree-based formulation, in which the data are conditionally independent given some latent nested positive stable random factors. The hierarchical structure facilitates Bayesian inference and offers a convenient and interpretable characterization. We fit this nested multivariate max-stable model to the maxima of air pollution concentrations and temperatures recorded at a number of sites in the Los Angeles area, showing that the proposed model succeeds in capturing their complex tail dependence structure.

Preimplantation embryo-derived EVs have been shown to carry molecules potentially able to modulate the local endometrial immune system. The non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G, the immunomodulatory molecule progesterone-induced blocking factor and some regulatory miRNAs species are contained in embryo-derived EV cargo. The implanted syncytiotrophoblasts are also well known to secrete EVs, with microvesicles exerting a mainly proinflammatory effect while exosomes in general mediate local immunotolerance.

This framework is motivated by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment where we are interested in estimating the mediation effects between a randomized stimulus time series and brain activity time series from two brain regions. The independent observation assumption is thus unrealistic for this type of time-series data. To address this challenge, our framework integrates two types of models: causal mediation analysis across the mediation variables, and vector autoregressive (VAR) models across the temporal observations. We use ""Granger"" to refer to VAR correlations modeled in this paper. We further extend this framework to handle multilevel data, in order to model individual variability and correlated errors between the mediator and the outcome variables. Using Rubin's potential outcome framework, we show that the causal mediation effects are identifiable under our time-series model. We further develop computationally efficient algorithms to maximize our likelihood-based estimation criteria. Simulation studies show that our method reduces the estimation bias and improves statistical power, compared with existing approaches.

Traditionally, transcriptomic data have been analyzed from bulk samples, masking the heterogeneity now seen across individual cells. Even within the same cellular population, genes can be highly expressed in some cells but not expressed (or lowly expressed) in others. Therefore, the computational approaches used to analyze bulk RNA sequencing data are not appropriate for the analysis of scRNA-seq data. Here, we present a novel statistical model for high dimensional and zero-inflated scRNA-seq count data to identify differentially expressed genes across cell types. Correlated random effects are employed based on an initial clustering of cells to capture the cell-to-cell variability within treatment groups. Moreover, this model is flexible and can be easily adapted to an independent random effect structure if needed. We apply our proposed methodology to both simulated and real data and compare results to other popular methods designed for detecting differentially expressed genes. Due to the hurdle model's ability to detect differences in the proportion of cells expressed and the average expression level (among the expressed cells), our methods naturally identify some genes as differentially expressed that other methods do not, and we demonstrate with real data that these uniquely detected genes are associated with similar biological processes and functions.

The baseline variables could include, for example, age, sex, disease severity, and biomarkers. According to two surveys of clinical trial reports, there is confusion about the statistical properties of covariate adjustment. We focus on the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) estimator, which involves fitting a linear model for the outcome given the treatment arm and baseline variables, and trials that use simple randomization with equal probability of assignment to treatment and control. We prove the following new (to the best of our knowledge) robustness property of ANCOVA to arbitrary model misspecification: Not only is the ANCOVA point estimate consistent (as proved by Yang and Tsiatis, 2001) but so is its standard error. This implies that confidence intervals and hypothesis tests conducted as if the linear model were correct are still asymptotically valid even when the linear model is arbitrarily misspecified, for example, when the baseline variables are nonlinearly related to the outcome or there is treatment effect heterogeneity. We also give a simple, robust formula for the variance reduction (equivalently, sample size reduction) from using ANCOVA. By reanalyzing completed randomized trials for mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, and depression, we demonstrate how ANCOVA can achieve variance reductions of 4 to 32%.",Integrative analysis of genetical genomics data incorporating network structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009063,Biometrics,2019 04 30,"In a living organism, tens of thousands of genes are expressed and interact with each other to achieve necessary cellular functions. Gene regulatory networks contain information on regulatory mechanisms and the functions of gene expressions. Thus, incorporating network structures, discerned either through biological experiments or statistical estimations, could potentially increase the selection and estimation accuracy of genes associated with a phenotype of interest. Here, we considered a gene selection problem using gene expression data and the graphical structures found in gene networks. Because gene expression measurements are intermediate phenotypes between a trait and its associated genes, we adopted an instrumental variable regression approach. We treated genetic variants as instrumental variables to address the endogeneity issue. We proposed a two-step estimation procedure. In the first step, we applied the LASSO algorithm to estimate the effects of genetic variants on gene expression measurements. In the second step, the projected expression measurements obtained from the first step were treated as input variables. A graph-constrained regularization method was adopted to improve the efficiency of gene selection and estimation. We theoretically showed the selection consistency of the estimation method and derived the

Count normalization with ad hoc zero adjustment tends to result in poor estimates of abundances for taxa with zero or small counts. To account for heterogeneity and overdispersion in such data, we suggest using the logistic normal multinomial (LNM) model with an arbitrary correlation structure to simultaneously estimate the taxa compositions by borrowing information across subjects. We overcome the computational difficulties in high dimensions by developing a stochastic approximation EM algorithm with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling for scalable parameter estimation in the LNM model. The ill-conditioning problem due to unstructured covariance is further mitigated by a covariance-regularized estimator with a condition number constraint. The advantages of the proposed methods are illustrated through simulations and an application to human gut microbiome data."

Recently, biallelic mutations in the MYORG gene have been reported to cause PFBC with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. We screened MYORG in 29 unrelated probands negatively screened for the autosomal dominant PFBC genes and identified 11 families with a biallelic rare or novel predicted damaging variant. We studied the clinical and radiological features of 16 patients of these 11 families and compared them to that of 102 autosomal dominant PFBC patients carrying a mutation in one of the four known autosomal dominant PFBC genes. We found that MYORG patients exhibited a high clinical penetrance with a median age of onset of 52 years (range: 21-62) with motor impairment at the forefront. In particular, dysarthria was the presenting sign in 11/16 patients. In contrast to patients with autosomal dominant PFBC, 12/15 (80%) symptomatic patients eventually presented at least four of the following five symptoms: dysarthria, cerebellar syndrome, gait disorder of any origin, akinetic-hypertonic syndrome and pyramidal signs. In addition to the most severe clinical pattern, MYORG patients exhibited the most severe pattern of calcifications as compared to the patients from the four autosomal dominant PFBC gene categories. Strikingly, 12/15 presented with brainstem calcifications in addition to extensive calcifications in other brain areas (lenticular nuclei, thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, ±cortex). Among them, eight patients exhibited pontine calcifications, which were observed in none of the autosomal dominant PFBC patients and hence appeared to be highly specific. Finally, all patients exhibited cerebellar atrophy with diverse degrees of severity on CT scans. We confirmed the existence of cerebellar atrophy by performing MRI voxel-based morphometry analyses of MYORG patients with autosomal dominant PFBC mutation carriers as a comparison group. Of note, in three families, the father carried small pallido-dentate calcifications while carrying the mutation at the heterozygous state, suggesting a putative phenotypic expression in some heterozygous carriers. In conclusion, we confirm that MYORG is a novel major PFBC causative gene and that the phenotype associated with such mutations may be recognized based on pedigree, clinical and radiological features.","A multicentre longitudinal study of flortaucipir (18F) in normal ageing, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009046,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 06 12,"The advent of tau-targeted PET tracers such as flortaucipir (18F) (flortaucipir, also known as 18F-AV-1451 or 18F-T807) have made it possible to investigate the sequence of development of tau in relationship to age, amyloid-β, and to the development of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Here we report a multicentre longitudinal evaluation of the relationships between baseline tau, tau change and cognitive change, using flortaucipir PET imaging. A total of 202 participants 50 years old or older, including 57 cognitively normal subjects, 97 clinically defined mild cognitive impairment and 48 possible or probable Alzheimer's disease dementia patients, received flortaucipir PET scans of 20 min in duration beginning 80 min after intravenous administration of 370 MBq flortaucipir (18F). On separate days, subjects also received florbetapir amyloid PET imaging, and underwent a neuropsychological test battery. Follow-up flortaucipir scans and neuropsychological battery assessments were also performed at 9 and 18 months. Fifty-five amyloid-β+ and 90 amyloid-β- subjects completed the baseline and 18-month study visits and had valid quantifiable flortaucipir scans at both time points. There was a statistically significant increase in the global estimate of cortical tau burden as measured by standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) from baseline to 18 months in amyloid-β+ but not amyloid-β- subjects (least squared mean change in flortaucipir SUVr : 0.0524 ± 0.0085, P < 0.0001 and 0.0007 ± 0.0024 P = 0.7850, respectively), and a significant association between magnitude of SUVr increase and baseline tau burden. Voxel-wise evaluations further suggested that the regional pattern of change in flortaucipir PET SUVr over the 18-month study period (i.e. which regions exhibited the greatest change) also varied as a function of baseline global estimate of tau burden. In subjects with lower global SUVr, temporal lobe regions showed the greatest flortaucipir retention, whereas in subjects with higher baseline SUVr, parietal and frontal regions were increasingly affected. Finally, baseline flortaucipir and change in flortaucipir SUVr were both significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with changes in cognitive performance. Taken together, these results provide a preliminary characterization of the longitudinal spread of tau in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that the amount and location of tau may have implications both for the spread of tau and the cognitive deterioration that may occur over an 18-month period.",Homozygous stop mutation in AHR causes autosomal recessive foveal hypoplasia and infantile nystagmus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009037,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 05 28,"Herein we present a consanguineous family with three children affected by foveal hypoplasia with infantile nystagmus, following an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The patients showed normal electroretinography responses, no signs of albinism, and no anterior segment or brain abnormalities. Upon whole exome sequencing, we identified a homozygous mutation (c.1861C>T;p.Q621*) in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) gene that perfectly co-segregated with the disease in the larger family. AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that has been intensively studied in xenobiotic-induced toxicity. Further, it has been shown to play a physiological role under normal cellular conditions, such as in immunity, inflammatory response and neurogenesis. Notably, knockout of the Ahr gene in mouse impairs optic nerve myelin sheath formation and results in oculomotor deficits sharing many features with our patients: the eye movement disorder in Ahr-/- mice appears early in development and presents as conjugate horizontal pendular nystagmus. We therefore propose AHR to be a novel disease gene for a new, recessively inherited disorder in humans, characterized by infantile nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia.",Nicotine Effects on White Matter Microstructure in Young Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009035,Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists,2019 05 08,"Nicotine use is widely prevalent among youth, and is associated with white matter microstructural changes as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

Many of the classical analysis techniques require expensive equipment and/or expertise. Notably, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have become an emerging method for the analysis of foods and natural products. This method is based on antibody-mediated detection of the target components. However, as many of the bioactive components in natural products are small (<1,000 Da) and do not induce an immune response, creating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against them is often difficult. In this protocol, we provide a detailed explanation of the steps required to generate mAbs against target molecules as well as those needed to create the associated indirect competitive (ic)ELISA for the rapid analysis of the compound in multiple samples. The procedure describes the synthesis of the artificial antigen (i.e., the hapten-carrier conjugate), immunization, cell fusion, monoclonal hybridoma preparation, characterization of the mAb, and the ELISA-based application of the mAb. The hapten-carrier conjugate was synthesized by the sodium periodate method and evaluated by MALDI-TOF-MS. After immunization, splenocytes were isolated from the immunized mouse with the highest antibody titer and fused with the hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT)-sensitive mouse myeloma cell line Sp2/0 -Ag14 using a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based method. The hybridomas secreting mAbs reactive to the target antigen were screened by icELISA for specificity and cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the limiting dilution method was applied to prepare monoclonal hybridomas. The final mAbs were further characterized by icELISA and then utilized in an ELISA-based application for the rapid and convenient detection of the example hapten (naringin (NAR)) in natural products.",Human Serum Anti-aquaporin-4 Immunoglobulin G Detection by Cell-based Assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009006,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 22,"Anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the core diagnostic biomarker for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). The cell-based assay (CBA) is a widely used method to detect anti-AQP4 IgG in human serum with high sensitivity and specificity. Briefly, serum anti-AQP4 IgG is captured by AQP4-transfected cell that is fixed on the biochip then detected by a fluorescein-labelled secondary antibody. Fluorescence microscopy is utilized to visualize the fluorescence, and the intensity of fluorescence is evaluated by at least two experienced clinicians. A final diagnosis of NMOSD can be made based on the combination of anti-AQP4 IgG detection results, clinical manifestations, and neuroradiological findings. According to previous studies, CBA is more sensitive and specific than other anti-AQP4 IgG detection methods, and it can be applied to both clinical diagnosis and studies of NMOSD. The method has limitations; for example, an international scale to evaluate serum anti-AQP4 IgG titers is still lacking. Here, a detailed protocol for human serum anti-AQP4 IgG detection using CBA is described.",Multi-Modal Signals for Analyzing Pain Responses to Thermal and Electrical Stimuli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009005,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 22,"The assessment of pain relies mostly on methods that require a person to communicate. However, for people with cognitive and verbal impairments, existing methods are not sufficient as they lack reliability and validity. To approach this problem, recent research focuses on an objective pain assessment facilitated by parameters of responses derived from physiology, and video and audio signals. To develop reliable automated pain recognition systems, efforts have been made in creating multimodal databases in order to analyze pain and detect valid pain patterns. While the results are promising, they only focus on discriminating pain or pain intensities versus no pain. In order to advance this, research should also consider the quality and duration of pain as they provide additional valuable information for more advanced pain management. To complement existing databases and the analysis of pain regarding quality and length, this paper proposes a psychophysiological experiment to elicit, measure, and collect valid pain reactions. Participants are subjected to painful stimuli that differ in intensity (low, medium, and high), duration (5 s / 1 min), and modality (heat / electric pain) while audio, video (e.g., facial expressions, body gestures, facial skin temperature), and physiological signals (e.g., electrocardiogram [ECG], skin conductance level [SCL], facial electromyography [EMG], and EMG of M. trapezius) are being recorded. The study consists of a calibration phase to determine a subject's individual pain range (from low to intolerable pain) and a stimulation phase in which pain stimuli, depending on the calibrated range, are applied. The obtained data may allow refining, improving, and evaluating automated recognition systems in terms of an objective pain assessment. For further development of such systems and to investigate pain reactions in more detail, additional pain modalities such as pressure, chemical, or cold pain should be included in future studies. Recorded data of this study will be released as the ""X-ITE Pain Database"".","Generation, Amplification, and Titration of Recombinant Respiratory Syncytial Viruses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009004,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 22,"The use of recombinant viruses has become crucial in basic or applied virology. Reverse genetics has been proven to be an extremely powerful technology, both to decipher viral replication mechanisms and to study antivirals or provide development platform for vaccines. The construction and manipulation of a reverse genetic system for a negative-strand RNA virus such as a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), however, remains delicate and requires special know-how. The RSV genome is a single-strand, negative-sense RNA of about 15 kb that serves as a template for both viral RNA replication and transcription. Our reverse genetics system uses a cDNA copy of the human RSV long strain genome (HRSV). This cDNA, as well as cDNAs encoding viral proteins of the polymerase complex (L, P, N, and M2-1), are placed in individual expression vectors under T7 polymerase control sequences. The transfection of these elements in BSR-T7/5 cells, which stably express T7 polymerase, allows the cytoplasmic replication and transcription of the recombinant RSV, giving rise to genetically modified virions. A new RSV, which is present at the cell surface and in the culture supernatant of BSRT7/5, is gathered to infect human HEp-2 cells for viral amplification. Two or three rounds of amplification are needed to obtain viral stocks containing 1 x 106 to 1 x 107 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL. Methods for the optimal harvesting, freezing, and titration of viral stocks are described here in detail. We illustrate the protocol presented here by creating two recombinant viruses respectively expressing free green fluorescent protein (GFP) (RSV-GFP) or viral M2-1 fused to GFP (RSV-M2-1-GFP). We show how to use RSV-GFP to quantify RSV replication and the RSV-M2-1-GFP to visualize viral structures, as well as viral protein dynamics in live cells, by using video microscopy techniques.",Long-term Video Tracking of Cohoused Aquatic Animals: A Case Study of the Daily Locomotor Activity of the Norway Lobster (Nephrops norvegicus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009003,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 22,"We present a protocol related to a video-tracking technique based on the background subtraction and image thresholding that makes it possible to individually track cohoused animals. We tested the tracking routine with four cohoused Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) under light-darkness conditions for 5 days. The lobsters had been individually tagged. The experimental setup and the tracking techniques used are entirely based on the open source software. The comparison of the tracking output with a manual detection indicates that the lobsters were correctly detected 69% of the times. Among the correctly detected lobsters, their individual tags were correctly identified 89.5% of the times. Considering the frame rate used in the protocol and the movement rate of lobsters, the performance of the video tracking has a good quality, and the representative results support the validity of the protocol in producing valuable data for research needs (individual space occupancy or locomotor activity patterns). The protocol presented here can be easily customized and is, hence, transferable to other species where the individual tracking of specimens in a group can be valuable for answering research questions.","Real-time Live-cell Flow Cytometry to Investigate Calcium Influx, Pore Formation, and Phagocytosis by P2X7 Receptors in Adult Neural Progenitor Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009002,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 22,"Live-cell flow cytometry is increasingly used among cell biologists to quantify biological processes in a living cell culture. This protocol describes a method whereby live-cell flow cytometry is extended upon to analyze the multiple functions of P2X7 receptor activation in real-time. Using a time module installed on a flow cytometer, live-cell functionality can be assessed and plotted over a given time period to explore the kinetics of calcium influx, transmembrane pore formation, and phagocytosis. This simple method is advantageous as all three canonical functions of the P2X7 receptor can be assessed using one machine, and the gathered data plotted over time provides information on the entire live-cell population rather than single-cell recordings often obtained using technically challenging patch-clamp methods. Calcium influx experiments use a calcium indicator dye, while P2X7 pore formation assays rely on ethidium bromide being allowed to pass through the transmembrane pore formed upon high agonist concentrations. Yellow-green (YG) latex beads are utilized to measure phagocytosis. Specific agonists and antagonists are applied to investigate the effects of P2X7 receptor activity. Individually, these methods can be modified to provide quantitative data on any number of calcium channels and purinergic and scavenger receptors. Taken together, they highlight how the use of real-time live-cell flow cytometry is a rapid, cost-effective, reproducible, and quantifiable method to investigate P2X7 receptor function.",Mimicking a Space Mission to Mars Using Hindlimb Unloading and Partial Weight Bearing in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009001,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 22,"Rodent ground-based models are widely used to understand the physiological consequences of space flight on the physiological system and have been routinely employed since 1979 and the development of hind limb unloading (HLU). However, the next steps in space exploration now include to travel to Mars where the gravity is 38% of Earth's gravity. Since no human being has experienced this level of partial gravity, a sustainable ground-based model is necessary to investigate how the body, already impaired by the time spent in microgravity, would react to this partial load. Here, we used our innovative partial weight-bearing (PWB) model to mimic a short mission and stay on Mars to assess the physiological impairments in the hind limb muscles induced by two different levels of reduced gravity applied in sequential fashion. This could provide a safe, ground-based model to study the musculoskeletal adaptations to gravitational change and to establish effective countermeasures to preserve astronauts' health and function.",Studying Brain Function in Children Using Magnetoencephalography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009000,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 22,"Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique which directly measures magnetic fields produced by the electrical activity of the human brain. MEG is quiet and less likely to induce claustrophobia compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is therefore a promising tool for investigating brain function in young children. However, analysis of MEG data from pediatric populations is often complicated by head movement artefacts which arise as a consequence of the requirement for a spatially-fixed sensor array that is not affixed to the child's head. Minimizing head movements during MEG sessions can be particularly challenging as young children are often unable to remain still during experimental tasks. The protocol presented here aims to reduce head movement artefacts during pediatric MEG scanning. Prior to visiting the MEG laboratory, families are provided with resources that explain the MEG system and the experimental procedures in simple, accessible language. An MEG familiarization session is conducted during which children are acquainted with both the researchers and the MEG procedures. They are then trained to keep their head still whilst lying inside an MEG simulator. To help children feel at ease in the novel MEG environment, all of the procedures are explained through the narrative of a space mission. To minimize head movement due to restlessness, children are trained and assessed using fun and engaging experimental paradigms. In addition, children's residual head movement artefacts are compensated for during the data acquisition session using a real-time head movement tracking system. Implementing these child-friendly procedures is important for improving data quality, minimizing participant attrition rates in longitudinal studies, and ensuring that families have a positive research experience.",An Instrumented Pull Test to Characterize Postural Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008999,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 05 15,"Impairment of postural reflexes, termed postural instability, is a common and disabling deficit in Parkinson's disease. To assess postural reflexes, clinicians typically employ the pull test to grade corrective responses to a backward perturbation at the shoulders. However, the pull test is prone to issues with reliability and scaling (score/4). Here, we present an instrumented version of the pull test to more precisely quantify postural responses. Akin to the clinical test, pulls are manually administered except pull force is also recorded. Displacements of the trunk and feet are captured by a semi-portable motion tracking system. Raw data represent distance traveled (in millimeter units), making subsequent interpretation and analysis intuitive. The instrumented pull test also detects variabilities influencing pull test administration, such as pull force, thereby identifying and quantifying potential confounds that can be accounted for by statistical techniques. The instrumented pull test could have application in studies seeking to capture early abnormalities in postural responses, track postural instability over time, and detect responses to therapy.",Evaluation of medication adherence and pharmacokinetics of dasatinib for earlier molecular response in Japanese patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008998,Therapeutic drug monitoring,2019 04 22,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) markedly improve the survival for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

The questionnaire included 5 sections, general demographics; knowledge; attitudes; practices and barriers; and expectation. Scores were calculated for each category of knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests between the parents with and without a history of voice disorders. The internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach alpha coefficient. The correlations between vocal hygiene knowledge, attitude, and practice were analyzed using Spearman correlation test.The questionnaire was completed by 1075 parents. There were certain misconceptions in vocal hygiene knowledge among parents, and the parents had higher level knowledge of positive factors than negative factors about vocal hygiene. Attitudes towards vocal hygiene were positive. Practices of vocal hygiene were poor. The most common barriers to implementation of vocal hygiene practices were related to lack of awareness and knowledge for this topic.The level of parental vocal hygiene knowledge, practice, and barriers suggest that carry out vocal hygiene programs extremely urgent for school-aged children and their parents.",Treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the mobile tongue with anterolateral thigh flap reconstruction: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008961,Medicine,2019 06 10,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is an infrequent malignant neoplasm of the salivary glands.

We assessed the relationship between HR on admission and in-hospital mortality among general inpatients.We used data from Japan Adverse Drug Events (JADE) study, a prospective cohort study. One tertiary care hospital in Japan with 13 medical and 12 surgical wards, and an intensive care unit (ICU). Patients (n = 2360) were ≥12 years old and admitted to this hospital within 3 months; and pregnant women were excluded. We assessed the relationship between HR and mortality in five (<60, 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, ≥120 beats per minutes [bpm]) groups. We also compared the five HR groups according to the age (<70 years; ≥70 years) and wards (medical; surgical; ICU).We enrolled 2360 patients (median age, 71 [interquartile range (IQR) 58-81] years) including 1147, 1068, and 145 patients in the medical and surgical wards, and the ICU, respectively. The median (IQR) HR on admission was 78 (68-91) bpm. Ninety-five patients died during hospitalization. Mortalities in the <60, 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, and ≥120 bpm groups were 2.9% (5/175), 2.7% (28/1047), 3.4% (26/762), 8.2% (24/291), and 14.3% (12/84), respectively (P < .001). The adjusted odds ratios of in-hospital mortality was 3.64 (95% CI 1.88-7.05, P < .001) when HR was ≥100 bpm in the medical ward; and 5.69 (95% CI 1.72-18.82, P = .004) when HR ≥120 bpm in the surgical ward. There was no statistically significant relationship with the ICU.In conclusion, higher HR should be associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with general diseases. Even with less severe condition or outside ICU, HR should be directed attention to and patients with high HR on admission should be taken additional therapy to reduce the further risk of deterioration.","Mediating effect of social support on the associations between health literacy, productive aging, and self-rated health among elderly Chinese adults in a newly urbanized community.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008936,Medicine,2019 06 10,"With the growing urbanization of China, which has changed older adults' living conditions, lifestyle, and the source of support, coupled with rapid population aging, the health status of the elderly should be paid attention to. In addition to objective indicators such as the decline of function, specific factors, such as social support, health literacy, and productive aging, also have an impact on the health outcomes of the elderly. However, the interrelationships among these factors and their potential mechanisms in the context of urbanization remain unclear. Thus, this study was the first to explore the interrelationships among social support, health literacy, productive aging, and self-rated health in older adults living in a newly urbanized community in China.We aimed to investigate the mediating effect of social support on the associations between health literacy, productive aging, and self-rated health among elderly Chinese adults in a newly urbanized community to provide reference data for future health interventions for the elderly.This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and August 2013. Questionnaires on social support, health literacy, productive aging, and self-rated health were administered to 992 elderly residents. Structural equation models were used to examine the relationships among these 4 variables. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 and Mplus 7.0.The mean scores for social support, health literacy, productive aging, and self-rated health were 34.5 ± 5.8, 13.6 ± 4.4, 11.3 ± 3.0, and 3.4 ± 0.7, respectively. Social support was directly related to self-rated health (β=0.119, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.041-0.198), while productive aging and health literacy had indirect associations with self-rated health via social support (β=0.071, 95% CI: 0.054-0.216; β=0.049, 95% CI: 0.066-0.183).

However, personality science has evolved from an understanding of personality as fixed traits to one that acknowledges that personality is dynamic. Dynamic approaches to conceptualizing and measuring personality and individual differences can enrich personality-health research. In this Presidential Address (American Psychosomatic Society, 2018), I consider how different formulations of personality-stable traits, stable signals in a noisy or variable measure, within-person changes, and intraindividual variability-can be implemented to better understand how personality is related to health and particularly to immune function. These approaches recognize and, in some cases, capitalize on the fact that personality factors can display variability as well as stability over time. They also require repeated measurement and therefore greater methodological sophistication that considers reliability and generalizability, Simpson's paradox, and the difference between variability and flexibility. Dynamic qualities of personality and individual differences potentially influence health, and designs and methodology that incorporate them can illuminate the important processes that occur inside the error bars."

Periprosthetic joint infection of the shoulder is a devastating complication occurring in approximately 1% of cases. The most common organisms responsible for the infection are Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) (∼39%) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (∼29%). Evaluation of patients includes history and physical examination, serologic testing, imaging, possible joint aspiration, and tissue culture. Diagnosing infections caused by lower virulence organisms (eg, C acnes) poses a challenge to the surgeon because traditional diagnostic tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and joint aspiration) have a low sensitivity due to the lack of an inflammatory response. Periprosthetic joint infections of the shoulder due to Staphylococcus aureus and other highly virulent organisms are often easy to diagnose and are usually treated with two-stage revisions. However, for infections with C acnes and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, single- and two-stage revision surgeries have shown similar ability to clear the infection.

This way, QST aids in diagnostics of individual patients and may help guide their care in the future. Deficits in ""dynamic"" QST have been proposed as predictors of chronic pain (impaired descending inhibition and delayed recovery from central sensitization).

Roles of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), including Aβ fibers, in mechanical allodynia have previously been proposed, but the necessity and sufficiency of LTMRs in allodynia have not been fully determined. Recent technological advances have made it possible to achieve subpopulation-specific ablation, silencing or stimulation, and to dissect and elucidate complex neuronal circuitry. Recent studies using an optogenetic approach have shown that activation of LTMRs, including Aβ fibers that genetically express channelrhodopsin-2, by illuminating blue light to the skin elicit morphine-resistant withdrawal behaviors after nerve damage. Whole-cell recording has revealed that optical Aβ stimulation after nerve injury causes excitation of lamina I dorsal horn neurons, which are normally silent by this stimulation. Moreover, Aβ stimulation after nerve injury results in activation of central amygdaloid neurons and produces aversive behaviors. In summary, these findings indicate that optogenetics is a powerful approach for investigating LTMR-derived pain (resembling mechanical allodynia) with sensory and emotional features after nerve injury and for discovering novel and effective drugs to treat neuropathic pain.",Pointer-kindreds and pain: big lessons from small families.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008849,Pain,2019 04 22,"Small families carrying rare mutations, which I call ""pointer-kindreds,"" can teach us important lessons.

The most common complication of DM is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which leads to neuropathic pain in as many as 50% of patients. Despite its prevalence, there is neither good prevention of nor treatments for DPN, representing a major gap in care for the many who are afflicted. It has long been known from patient studies that both small and large primary afferent fibers undergo structural changes in DPN; however, the exact functional contributions of these changes to DPN symptomology are unknown, necessitating animal studies. This review first presents the commonly used mouse models of DPN resulting from both type 1 and type 2 DM. It then discusses structural changes in Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers throughout the progression of DPN and their respective contributions to painful DPN in both human patients and DM mouse models.

Because of the difficulty to extrapolate mechanisms from animals to humans, an inverse translational approach (""top-down"") has been advocated and contributed to the development of therapy. In particular, a number of treatments such as neurostimulation techniques have been initially assessed in patients and then translated to animal models for further investigation of their mechanisms. Therapeutic approaches based on an in-depth assessment of sensory phenotypes, suggestive of mechanisms, have also been implemented. The biggest trend in recent translational research is to investigate mechanisms or predict therapeutic response in patients by integrating multimodal approaches. The present narrative review emphasizes these various aspects of translational research in neuropathic pain.",Axon degeneration: mechanistic insights lead to therapeutic opportunities for the prevention and treatment of peripheral neuropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008845,Pain,2019 05 07,"Peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting hundreds of millions of patients worldwide and is an important cause of chronic pain. Typical peripheral neuropathies are characterized by dysesthesias including numbness, crawling skin, a sensation of ""pins and needles,"" and burning and stabbing pain. In addition, peripheral neuropathy can affect the motor and autonomic systems leading to symptoms such as weakness, constipation, and dysregulation of blood pressure. Peripheral neuropathies can be either hereditary or acquired and are a common consequence of diabetes and treatment with chemotherapy agents. Many neuropathies are due to degeneration of long axons; however, the mechanisms driving axon loss were unknown, and so no therapies are available to preserve vulnerable axons and prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy. With the recent identification of SARM1 as an injury-activated NADase enzyme that triggers axon degeneration, there is now a coherent picture emerging for the mechanism of axonal self-destruction. Here, we will present evidence that inhibiting the SARM1 pathway can prevent the development of peripheral neuropathy, describe the emerging mechanistic understanding of the axon degeneration program, and discuss how these mechanistic insights may be translated to the clinic for the prevention and treatment of peripheral neuropathy and other neurodegenerative disorders.",Neuropathic itch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008844,Pain,2019 04 22,"Neuropathic itch is clinically important but has received much less attention as compared to neuropathic pain. In the past decade, itch-specific pathways have been characterized on a cellular and molecular level, but their exact role in the pathophysiology of neuropathic itch is still unclear. Traditionally, mutually exclusive theories for itch such as labeled line, temporal/spatial pattern, or intensity theory have been proposed, and experimental studies in mice mainly favor the specificity theory of itch. By contrast, results in humans also suggest a role for spatial and temporal patterns in neuropathic itch. Rarefication of skin innervation in neuropathy could provide a ""spatial contrast"" discharge pattern, and axotomy could induce de novo expression of the itch-specific spinal neuropeptide, gastrin-releasing peptide, in primary afferent nociceptors, thereby modulating itch processing in the dorsal horn. Thus, clinical neuropathy may generate itch by changes in the spatial and temporal discharge patterns of nociceptors, hijacking the labeled line processing of itch and abandoning the canonical scheme of mutual exclusive itch theories. Moreover, the overlap between itch and pain symptoms in neuropathy patients complicates direct translation from animal experiments and, on a clinical level, necessitates collaboration between medical specialities, such as dermatologists, anesthesiologists, and neurologists.",Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: where are we now?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008843,Pain,2019 06 10,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a major challenge, with increasing impact as oncological treatments, using potentially neurotoxic chemotherapy, improve cancer cure and survival. Acute CIPN occurs during chemotherapy, sometimes requiring dose reduction or cessation, impacting on survival. Around 30% of patients will still have CIPN a year, or more, after finishing chemotherapy. Accurate assessment is essential to improve knowledge around prevalence and incidence of CIPN. Consensus is needed to standardize assessment and diagnosis, with use of well-validated tools, such as the EORTC-CIPN 20. Detailed phenotyping of the clinical syndrome moves toward a precision medicine approach, to individualize treatment. Understanding significant risk factors and pre-existing vulnerability may be used to improve strategies for CIPN prevention, or to use targeted treatment for established CIPN. No preventive therapies have shown significant clinical efficacy, although there are promising novel agents such as histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitors, currently in early phase clinical trials for cancer treatment. Drug repurposing, eg, metformin, may offer an alternative therapeutic avenue. Established treatment for painful CIPN is limited. Following recommendations for general neuropathic pain is logical, but evidence for agents such as gabapentinoids and amitriptyline is weak. The only agent currently recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology is duloxetine. Mechanisms are complex with changes in ion channels (sodium, potassium, and calcium), transient receptor potential channels, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune cell interactions. Improved understanding is essential to advance CIPN management. On a positive note, there are many potential sites for modulation, with novel analgesic approaches."

Therefore, we evaluated the severity of WMHs and polysomnography parameters as well as cognitive tests to explore the underlying connections. There was no significant difference in sex, age, or educational attainment (years) between the two groups. The data showed significant decreases in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and percentage of time spent in stage nonrapid eye movement sleep 3 in the CID group, but this group also showed prolonged sleep latency and increased percentages of time spent in stages nonrapid eye movement sleep 1 and nonrapid eye movement sleep 2 and wake after sleep onset. Moreover, chronic insomniacs showed poor performance on the attention, intelligence, and memory tests, as well as visual recognition and visual regeneration. Importantly, WMHs were observed to be associated with sleep latency, percentage of time spent in stage nonrapid eye movement sleep 1, and percentage of time spent in stage nonrapid eye movement sleep 3. In conclusion, our findings suggest that there are certain underlying correlations between WMHs and sleep architecture. Abnormal sleep architecture and WMHs could be involved in the impairment of cognitive function in CID.

Here, electric foot-shock stressors with noise were used to establish the stress-induced hypertensive (SIH) rat model. The expression of Kv10.2 in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, the nucleus tractus solitarius, and the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was examined by immunohistochemical staining and western blots. The following results were obtained: (a) the expression level of Kv10.2 was increased obviously in the paraventricular nucleus of SIH rats, whereas no significant difference was found in the rostral ventrolateral medulla and the nucleus tractus solitarius. (b) Kv10.2 was located in neurons. (c) Vesicular glutamate transporter 1 as a protein mark of glutamate neurons was increased in the paraventricular nucleus of the SIH group. (d) The expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 protein in neurons was significantly decreased when the Kcnh5 gene was knocked down by small interfering RNA in vitro.

Consultation from our international neurodevelopmental team was requested for severe anxiety and avoidance of social interactions. He reported 4 or more spontaneous anxiety episodes per day. Anxiety triggers included returning to his group home from his vocational rehabilitation program each evening or returning to the group home after weekends at his parents' house. Each Sunday evening, in anticipation of returning to the group home, Peter engaged in tantrums, including screaming and throwing objects and suicidal threats without intent, but not direct aggression toward family members. He phoned his mother several times per day on weekdays.Peter's early history was significant for hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression, and socially intrusive behavior; he repeated kindergarten and by first grade was characterized as motorically clumsy and ""too much in [peers'] personal space."" He played alone in kindergarten and had poor social boundaries; when older, he evidenced reduced social perception, and his family reported he did not notice when peers made fun of him. His language developed normally, but he had a ""sophisticated style of speaking"" and as an adult continued to have trouble understanding gestures, jokes, and social themes in movies.Between ages 7 and 11 years, Peter had been bullied and ostracized by male peers but did well academically, always got along well with adults, and preferred to play with girls. Exclusion by peers persisted through high school, at which time his independent functioning declined and he required his mother's assistance with organizing his materials. At age 15 years, Peter repeated a grade so that he could change classmates, and by the equivalent of his junior year, his grades deteriorated. He had several psychiatric admissions for depression and destructive outbursts (to avoid going to school) and was diagnosed with Asperger disorder. At age 18 years, Peter refused to return to school. He lived at home with his parents, only leaving the house to accompany them on errands, until placed in a group home for people with mental health disorders at age 20 years. At age 26 years, he is sharing a supported-living apartment with 2 young adults with chronic psychiatric disorders. He works in 3 highly structured sheltered workshops for a few hours each and becomes easily overwhelmed in unstructured situations and/or in situations in which he anticipates being reprimanded or letting someone down.

Although this is usually an incidental finding during regular work-up, HIV-infected patients with transaminase elevations require additional visits for laboratory studies and clinical assessments, and often undergo interruptions and changes in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Alanine aminotransferase is present primarily in the liver, thus being a surrogate marker of hepatocellular injury. Aspartate aminotransferase is present in the liver and other organs, namely cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidney and brain. Serum levels of both liver transaminases predict liver-related mortality. Moreover, serum fibrosis biomarkers based on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase predict all-cause mortality. In a busy clinical setting, a diagnostic approach to elevated liver transaminases could be complicated given the frequency and nonspecificity of this finding. Indeed, HIV-infected individuals present multiple risk factors for liver damage and chronic elevation of transaminases, including coinfection with hepatitis B and C viruses, alcohol abuse, hepatotoxicity due to ART, HIV itself and frequent metabolic comorbidities leading to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This review provides an update on epidemiology of elevated liver transaminases, summarizes the main etiologic contributors and discusses the prognostic significance and a pragmatic approach to this frequent finding in the clinical practice of HIV medicine. With the aging of the HIV-infected population following the successful implementation of ART in Western countries, liver-related conditions are now a major comorbidity in this setting. As such, clinicians should be aware of the frequency, clinical significance and diagnostic approach to elevated liver transaminases.",Simplifying switch to second-line ART: Predicted effect of defining failure of first-line efavirenz-based regimens in sub-Saharan Africa by a single viral load more than 1000 copies/ml.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008798,"AIDS (London, England)",2019 06 06,"Many individuals failing first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa never initiate second-line ART or do so after significant delay.

However, most patients will experience recurrence afterwards, and receive subsequent lines of therapy. It has been proposed that extending the treatment-free interval of platinum can improve the response to a subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy, and reduce associated toxicities in women with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. The aim was to determine the impact, in clinical practice, of trabectedin with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (trabectedin/PLD) on the subsequent platinum-based therapy in these patients, and to explore the prognosis for breast cancer gene status and the expression of diverse genes. This was a multicenter, retrospective, postauthorization study that involved 79 patients. Germline or somatic mutations of breast cancer gene 1/2 were present in 21.5%. The median time between trabectedin/PLD and the onset of the subsequent treatment was 6.7 months. The overall response rate during the trabectedin/PLD period was 36.7%. In the subsequent first-line platinum-based therapy, the overall response rate was 51.4%. Progression-free survival and overall survival were 11.8 and 25.4 months, respectively, from the onset of trabectedin/PLD treatment.

Although there has been a wide expansion of mental health apps with promise as well as hype, the current means of researching, evaluating, and deploying effective tools have been problematic. As a means of gaining a perspective that moves beyond usability testing, surveys, and app ratings, the primary objective of this patient perspective is to question the killer app and condition-specific mentality of current mental health app development. We do this by reviewing the current mobile mental health app literature, identifying ways in which psychiatric patients use apps in their lives, and then exploring how these issues are experienced by a software engineer who has struggled with her bipolar disorder for many years. Her lived experience combined with a technology perspective offers potential avenues for using technology productively in psychiatric treatment.

Materials and methods: We constructed calibration curves for each assay at doses ranging from 0 to 5 Gy of X-rays at dose rate of 0.275 Gy/min. To simulate partial-body exposures, blood samples from two donors were irradiated with 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 Gy and the ratios of irradiated to unirradiated blood were 25, 50, and 100%. Different tests were used to confirm if all samples were overdispersed or zero-inflated and for partial-body dose assessment we used the Qdr, Dolphin and Bayesian model. Results: In our samples for D + R calibration curve, practically all doses agreed with Poisson assumption, but MN exhibited overdispersed and zero-inflated cellular distributions. The exact Poisson tests and zero-inflated tests demonstrate that virtually all samples of D + R from PBI simulation fit the Poisson distribution and were not zero-inflated, but the MN samples were also overdispersed and zero-inflated. In the partial-body estimation, when Qdr and Dolphin methods were used the D + R results were better than MN, but the doses estimation defined by the Bayesian methodology were more accurate than the classical methods. Conclusions: Dicentric chromosomes continue to prove to be the best biological marker for dose assessment. However exposure scenarios of partial-body estimation, overdispersion and zero-inflation may not occur, it being a critical point not only for dose assessment, but also to confirm partial-body exposure. MN could be used as alternative assay for partial-body dose estimation, but in case of an accident without any information, the MN assay could not define whether the accident was a whole-body irradiation (WBI) or a PBI.",PPAR-δ Activation Ameliorates Diabetes-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction by Modulating Integrin-linked Kinase and AMPA Receptor Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008686,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,2019 04 22,"An estimated 9% of the American population experiences type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to diet or genetic predisposition. Recent reports indicate that patients with T2DM are at increased risk for cognitive dysfunctions, as observed in conditions like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, AD is the leading cause of dementia, highlighting the urgency of developing novel therapeutic targets for T2DM-induced cognitive deficits. The peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-δ (PPAR-δ) is highly expressed in the brain and has been shown to play an important role in spatial memory and hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the effect of PPAR-δ agonists on T2DM-induced cognitive impairment has not been explored. In this study, the effects of GW0742 (a selective PPAR-δ agonist) on hippocampal synaptic transmission, plasticity, and spatial memory were investigated in the db/db mouse model of T2DM. Oral administration of GW0742 for 2 weeks significantly improved hippocampal long-term potentiation. In addition, GW0742 effectively prevented deficits in hippocampal dependent spatial memory in db/db mice. PPAR-δ-mediated improvements in synaptic plasticity and behavior were accompanied by a significant recovery in hippocampal α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Our findings suggest that activation of PPAR-δ might ameliorate T2DM-induced impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory.",Comparative observation of immediate and late placement of dental implants with immediate loading: A 14-year follow up case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008685,The Journal of oral implantology,2019 04 22,"A 63-year-old healthy female presented in 2002 for implant replacement of her maxillary right premolars following failure of a three-unit bridge replacing the second premolar.

Forty abutments and crowns were divided into four groups as follows: TB group, luting with zinc oxide-eugenol cement; TBV group, luting with zinc oxide-eugenol cement after application of a separating agent over the transmucosal area of the abutment; PI group, luting with methacrylate cement; and PIV group, luting with methacrylate cement after application of a separating agent. After cementation, all the quadrants of the specimens were photographed, and the amount and location of the cement remnants were statistically analyzed (p ≤ 0.05). The amount of cement remnants was significantly smaller in the groups with a separating agent. The type of luting material did not significantly affect the results. Cement remnants were more abundant on the mesial and distal sides than on the buccal and lingual sides of the restoration.","Trends in varicella and herpes zoster epidemiology before and after the implementation of universal one-dose varicella vaccination over one decade in South Korea, 2003-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008679,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2019 05 07,"In South Korea, the one-dose varicella vaccine was included in the National Immunization Program for children aged 12-15 months in 2005, and the vaccine coverage reached >95%.

Participants studied word pairs (A-B, C-D) and were later tested with intact (A-B), reversed (D-C), recombined (A-D), and recombined and reversed (B-C) pairs. When participants were instructed to respond ""Old"" to both intact and reversed pairs, and ""New"" to recombined, and recombined and reversed pairs, older adults showed worse recognition for recombined and reversed pairs relative to younger adults (Experiment 1). This finding also emerged when flexible retrieval demands were increased by asking participants to respond ""Old"" only to intact pairs (Experiment 2). These results suggest that as conditions for flexible retrieval become more demanding, older adults may show worse recognition in associative memory tasks relative to younger adults."

In spectroscopy, they present as random unidirectional sharp spikes that distort spectra and may have an affect on post-processing, possibly affecting the results of multivariate statistical classification. A number of methods have previously been proposed to remove cosmic ray artifacts from spectra but the goal of removing the artifacts while making no other change to the underlying spectrum is challenging. One of the most successful and commonly applied methods for the removal of comic ray artifacts involves the capture of two sequential spectra that are compared in order to identify spikes. The disadvantage of this approach is that at least two recordings are necessary, which may be problematic for dynamically changing spectra, and which can reduce the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio when compared with a single recording of equivalent duration due to the inclusion of two instances of read noise. In this paper, a cosmic ray artefact removal algorithm is proposed that works in a similar way to the double acquisition method but requires only a single capture, so long as a data set of similar spectra is available. The method employs normalized covariance in order to identify a similar spectrum in the data set, from which a direct comparison reveals the presence of cosmic ray artifacts, which are then replaced with the corresponding values from the matching spectrum. The advantage of the proposed method over the double acquisition method is investigated in the context of the S/N ratio and is applied to various data sets of Raman spectra recorded from biological cells.",Conformal Prediction Based on Raman Spectra for the Classification of Chinese Liquors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008664,Applied spectroscopy,2019 04 22,"This work extends the conventional back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to the classification of Chinese liquors of different flavors according to their Raman spectra. Conformal prediction is applied to assign reliable confidence measures for each classification and support an effective framework to make the machine learning on classification trustable. The BPNN can be used to predict the flavors of Chinese liquors according to their Raman spectra, and a classification rate of 88.96% can be achieved. In order to evaluate each classification, a non-conformity score is defined to generate a P-value for each classification. Moreover, the validity of conformal prediction in online mode is discussed. The number of cumulative errors in the conformal prediction is much less than that without conformal prediction. The relationship between the cumulative error and confidence levels shows that a high confidence level leads to low cumulative errors, but many cumulative errors will occur under a very high confidence level. The result implies that conformal prediction is a useful framework, which can employ classification satisfying a certain level of confidence. Meanwhile, the conformal prediction can improve our classification using a BPNN, when the number of data points is limited.",Drug discovery strategies for acute radiation syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008662,Expert opinion on drug discovery,2019 06 06,"Introduction: There are at the minimum two major, quite different approaches to advance drug discovery. The first being the target-based drug discovery (TBDD) approach that is commonly referred to as the molecular approach. The second approach is the phenotype-based drug discovery (PBDD), also known as physiology-based drug discovery or empirical approach. Area covered: The authors discuss, herein, the need for developing radiation countermeasure agents for various sub-syndromes of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) following TBDD and PBDD approaches. With time and continuous advances in radiation countermeasure drug development research, the expectation is to have multiple radiation countermeasure agents for each sub-syndrome made available to radiation exposed victims. Expert opinion: The majority of the countermeasures currently being developed for ARS employ the PBDD approach, while the TBDD approach is clearly under-utilized. In the future, an improved drug development strategy might be a 'hybrid' strategy that is more reliant on TBDD for the initial drug discovery via large-scale screening of potential candidate agents, while utilizing PBDD for secondary screening of those candidates, followed by tertiary analytics phase in order to pinpoint efficacious candidates that target the specific sub-syndromes of ARS.",Patient costs and outcomes before and after the institution of a pre-eclampsia quality improvement initiative in a southwestern tertiary facility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008661,Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology : the journal of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,2019 04 22,"The study objective was to evaluate the effect of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) initiative, as implemented in a southwestern U.S. tertiary hospital, on associated patient costs and outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental study design, we collected existing data (cost and patient outcomes) comparing two six-month period at the baseline and one-year follow-up. Following descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests and t-tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. One hundred and eighty-nine women met the inclusion criteria for the study (93 and 96 women in the baseline and follow-up period, respectively). There was no significant difference in maternal health outcomes between both periods. However, there was a significant difference for newborns with almost 90% (95%CI = 0.06-0.92; p = .027) reduction in stillbirths in the follow-up period. There was also a significant reduction in the days between discharge and follow-up appointments (p < .01). Importantly, the initiative bears no additional financial burden on patients, as hospitalisation cost was unchanged. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? In 2013, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) set up a task force to develop guidelines for managing patients with preeclampsia based on global best practices. A previous study showed that despite system-level implementation challenges, the initiative led to significant increase in blood pressure treatments within one-hour and reduced severe maternal morbidity. What do the results of this study add? This study follows patients from admission, beyond the one-hour post-treatment and into the post-partum phase, to understand if outcomes of the initiative extend beyond the admission. While the study findings do not show any statistically significant difference in readmission before and after the initiative, nor any marked difference in maternal outcomes, it shows a significant difference in the prevalence of stillbirths at no additional cost to the patient. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Based on these findings, there is a case for scaling-up the initiative as in addition to its evidenced improvements in maternal outcomes; it is effective in improving newborn health outcomes at no additional cost. Further research, using larger sample size and exploring different care levels would be useful to verify these findings.",Assessment of the psychometric properties of the AQoL-4D questionnaire in Kannada language for use with adults with hearing loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008659,International journal of audiology,2019 05 08,This study aimed to validate the translated (Kannada language) version of the Assessment of Quality of Life-4 Dimensions (AQoL-4D) questionnaire for use in Kannada speaking adults with hearing loss.,The introduction of a Neurosurgical Postoperative Checklist improved quality of care and patient safety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008658,British journal of neurosurgery,2019 04 22,"Neurosurgical patients are often complex and require high quality, attentive care in the immediate postoperative period.

All participants received either BMI content (n = 63) or ECALC (n = 58). ECALC was delivered as a web-based program with clinician assistance. Measures of alcohol use and harms were completed at baseline and 4 weeks postintervention. ECALC produced significant reductions on all 4 positive expectancy subscales of the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Scale (CEOA). Both programs were associated with significant reductions on all alcohol use variables and harms, and expectancies significantly mediated the intervention to outcome relationship in the ECALC condition. There were no significant gender differences. Two one-sided equivalence test indicated superior effects for ECALC compared to BMI on four alcohol use variables (mean blood alcohol concentration, peak blood alcohol concentration, peak drinks per sitting, and drinking days per month), and noninferior to BMI in reducing others (mean drinks per sitting, mean drinks per week, & binge drinking). Superior effects of ECALC versus BMI are based on a short-term follow-up, and longevity of ECALC effects have yet to be established. ECALC has previously been found to be effective as a group-delivered program for male fraternity members, and these findings provide preliminary support for effectiveness for both males and females when delivered individually using a web-based clinician-assisted format.

For example, repeated mu-opioid agonist administration results in increased expression of mu agonist-induced facilitation of ICSS. Acute kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist administration depresses ICSS; however, effects of repeated KOR agonist administration on ICSS are unknown. This study determined effects of daily KOR agonist U-50488 administration and subsequent termination on ICSS in male and female rats. Female (n = 5) and male (n = 6) Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to respond for electrical brain stimulation under a frequency-rate ICSS procedure. Sequential U-50488 dose-effect functions (1-5.6 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) were determined every 7 days over a 21-day experimental period during which saline and increasing U-50488 doses (3.2-5.6 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) were administered on intervening days. Sequential U-50488 dose-effect functions were also determined 7 and 28 days after termination of repeated U-50488 administration. U-50488 dose-dependently depressed ICSS in both female and male rats. There were no sex differences on either initial or repeated U-50488 treatment effects. Repeated 5.6 mg/kg U-50488 administration produced selective tolerance to the rate-decreasing, but not threshold-altering, effects of 5.6 mg/kg U-50488 during sequential dose-effect test sessions. Neither repeated U-50488 administration nor termination of U-50488 significantly altered baseline ICSS. Overall, these results suggest neither tolerance nor sensitization develops to the depressive-like effects of repeated KOR agonist activation. Selective tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of repeated KOR agonist administration may have implications for elucidating the neurobiological processes involved in long-term abused drug self-administration.

This cultural difference may be driven by culturally divergent beliefs about negative affect as a source of threat to self-image versus as natural and integral to life. Here, we examined whether culture may moderate the relationship between negative affect and biological stress responses, with a focus on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. By using culturally matched surveys of Americans (N = 761) and Japanese (N = 328), we found that negative affect was associated with a flattening of the diurnal cortisol slope among Americans after controlling for demographic variables, personality traits, sleep patterns, and health behaviors. In contrast, the association between negative affect and the HPA axis activity was negligible among Japanese. Moreover, we assessed biological health risk with biomarkers of both inflammation (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels) and cardiovascular function (higher systolic blood pressure and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio) and found that the relationship between negative affect and increased biological health risk, which was observed only among Americans, was mediated by the flattening of the diurnal cortisol rhythm. These findings suggest that cultural differences in how emotions are construed may make the experience of negative affect more or less stressful and differentially consequential for health.

This behavior is referred to as third-party punishment. Much of the research on this topic has been done in the context of group cooperation and unjust economic interactions. However, little is known about punishment in response to other types of more personal transgressions. In the present study, we sought to determine whether adults would punish an individual after viewing them undeservingly reject a stranger. We experimentally demonstrate that after observing an individual socially reject an unknown victim, individuals will engage in third-party punishment. Individuals who reported feeling upset with the rejecter were most likely to punish, while feeling sorry for the victim was not predictive of punishment behavior. These findings highlight the motivational role of empathic anger in punishing social norm transgressors. Notably, individuals who reported having been bullied in their own pasts were the most likely to punish the rejecter. These results demonstrate how a history of being bullied may make one more attuned to the social rejection of others and in turn may make one more likely to take retributive action on behalf of another.

This paradigmatic shift comes with new challenges, such as questions revolving around how to measure within-person affect variation or more fundamental questions about the reliability and validity of constructs at the within-person level. We provide a review of substantive research published in Emotion since 2005, which revealed that to date no consensus has been established on measurement instruments for assessing within-person affective experiences. Our review also showed that researchers who are interested in within-person affect variation sometimes rely on measurement instruments that were established at the between-person level, which we think should be reconsidered. Finally, reliability estimates of state variation have been developed but are not comprehensively reported in studies on within-person affect variation. The purpose of this article is therefore to alert the reader to these issues and to highlight relevant criteria for selecting items and measurement instruments when studying within-person affect variation in intensive longitudinal studies. We recommend establishing common standards for measuring within-person affect variation and drawing from a common pool of instruments, which would allow direct comparison of results across studies.

The present method offers a facile and efficient approach to broad range of α-aminophosphine oxide derivatives in moderate to good yields with excellent functional group tolerance.,Development of a Storable Triazinone-Based Reagent for O- p-Methoxybenzylation under Mild Heating Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008611,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"A new triazinone-based reagent for O- p-methoxybenzylation has been developed. In spite of its stability in solid form, this reagent converts a free alcohol into the corresponding p-methoxybenzyl ether with mild heating (50-60 °C) in a solution.

The presented transformations allow divergent construction of valuable dihydro- or tetrahydrophenanthridin-6(5 H)-ones through the generation of S- or P-centered radicals, subsequent radical addition, cyclization, and a hydrogen atom transfer/electron transfer sequence. This strategy demonstrates the potential generality of quinolinone-tethered substrates to directly participate in the photoexcitation for the development of useful synthetic methods."

However, little is known about the potential involvement of cytosine DNA methylation in apple trees as well as in response to alternate bearing. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfate sequencing to investigate genomic CG, CHG, and CHH methylation patterns, together with their global mRNA accumulation and small RNA expression in ""Fuji"" apple trees. Results showed that ""Fuji"" apple trees have a higher CHH methylation than Arabidopsis. Moreover, genomic methylation analysis revealed that CG and CHG methylation were robustly maintained at the early stage of flower induction. Additionally, differentially methylated regions (DMRs), including hypermethylated and hypomethylated DMRs, were also characterized in alternate bearing (AB) apple trees. Intriguingly, the DMRs were enriched in hormones, redox state, and starch and sucrose metabolism, which affected flowering. Further global gene expression evaluation based on methylome analysis revealed a negative correlation between gene body methylation and gene expression. Subsequent small RNA analyses showed that 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs were activated and maintained in non-CG methylated apple trees. Our whole-genome DNA methylation analysis and RNA and small RNA expression profile construction provide valuable information for future studies.","Infrared Spectroscopy of Disilicon-Carbide, Si2C: The ν3 Fundamental Band.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008598,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 05 16,"The ν3 antisymmetric stretching mode of disilicon-carbide, Si2C, was studied using a narrow line width infrared quantum cascade laser spectrometer operating at 8.3 μm. The Si2C molecules were produced in an Nd:YAG laser ablation source from a pure silicon sample with the addition of a few percent methane diluted in a helium buffer gas. Subsequent adiabatic expansion was used to cool the gas down to rotational temperatures of a few tens of kelvin. A total of 183 infrared transitions recorded in the spectral range between 1200 and 1220 cm-1 were assigned to the fundamental ν3 mode of Si2C. In addition, pure rotational transitions of Ka = 1 and 2 between 278 and 375 GHz were recorded using a supersonic jet spectrometer for submillimeter wavelengths. Molecular parameters for the ( v1 v2 v3) = (001) vibrationally excited state were derived and improved molecular parameters for the vibrational ground-state (000) were obtained from a global fit data analysis, which includes our new laboratory data and millimeter wavelength data from the literature. We found the rotational levels Ka = 0 and Ka = 2 in the vibrationally excited (001) state being perturbed by a Coriolis-type interaction with energetically close lying levels of the symmetric stretching and triple-excited bending mode (130). The data analysis was supported by quantum chemical calculations performed at the coupled-cluster level of theory. All experimental results were found to be in excellent agreement with the theory.",Polyglutamine Solution-State Structural Propensity Is Repeat Length Dependent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008597,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 05 16,"Expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in proteins, which are known to induce their aggregation, are associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Longer polyQ tracts correlate with faster protein aggregation kinetics and a decreased age of onset for polyQ disease symptoms. Here, we use UV resonance Raman spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and metadynamics simulations to investigate the solution-state structures of the D2Q15K2 (Q15) and D2Q20K2 (Q20) peptides. Using metadynamics, we explore the conformational energy landscapes of Q15 and Q20 and investigate the relative energies and activation barriers between these low-energy structures. We compare the solution-state structures of D2Q10K2 (Q10), Q15, and Q20 to determine the dependence of polyQ structure on the Q tract length. We show that these peptides can adopt two distinct monomeric conformations: an aggregation-resistant PPII-like conformation and an aggregation-prone β-strand-like conformation. We find that longer polyQ peptides have an increased preference for the aggregation-prone β-strand-like conformation. This preference may play an important role in the increased aggregation rate of longer polyQ peptides that is thought to lead to decreased neurodegenerative disease age of onset for polyQ disease patients.",Modeling the Sensitivity of Aquatic Macroinvertebrates to Chemicals Using Traits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008596,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 10,"In this study, a trait-based macroinvertebrate sensitivity modeling tool is presented that provides two main outcomes: (1) it constructs a macroinvertebrate sensitivity ranking and, subsequently, a predictive trait model for each one of a diverse set of predefined Modes of Action (MOAs) and (2) it reveals data gaps and restrictions, helping with the direction of future research. Besides revealing taxonomic patterns of species sensitivity, we find that there was not one genus, family, or class which was most sensitive to all MOAs and that common test taxa were often not the most sensitive at all. Traits like life cycle duration and feeding mode were identified as important in explaining species sensitivity. For 71% of the species, no or incomplete trait data were available, making the lack of trait data the main obstacle in model construction. Research focus should therefore be on completing trait databases and enhancing them with finer morphological traits, focusing on the toxicodynamics of the chemical (e.g., target site distribution). Further improved sensitivity models can help with the creation of ecological scenarios by predicting the sensitivity of untested species. Through this development, our approach can help reduce animal testing and contribute toward a new predictive ecotoxicology framework.",Competing Allosteric Mechanisms for Coordination-Directed Conformational Changes of Chiral Stacking Structures with Aromatic Rings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008595,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 08,"This work revealed that significant asymmetric nonlinear effects can be found in a coordination-directed conformational alteration through competing allosteric mechanisms. Toward this aim, we have prepared new chiral bridging ligands [( S, S)- and ( R, R)-Im2An] containing an anthracene ring as a spacer with two ethynyl-linked chiral imidazole groups at the 9,10-positions. The ( S, S)- and ( R, R)-Im2An ligands (L) spontaneously form the assemblies with Zn2+ ions (M) in solution phase, giving L4M2-type assemblies with a general formula [( S, S)- or ( R, R)-Im2An]4(Zn2+)2. NMR studies revealed that the [( S, S)-Im2An]4(Zn2+)2 assembly has an anthracene dimer structure with a parallel-displaced geometry, leading to relatively small circular dichroism (CD) signals, as expected for nonchiral objects. Conversely, subsequent addition of chiral coligands [( R)- or ( S)-Ph-box] to [( S, S)-Im2An]4(Zn2+)2 afforded an alternative Zn2+ assembly with general formula [( R)- or ( S)-Ph-box]2[( S, S)-Im2An]2(Zn2+)2, where the chiral coligands expel two of the ( S, S)-Im2An ligands that were singly bound to the Zn2+ ions in the original [( S, S)-Im2An]4(Zn2+)2 assembly. This ligand-exchange reaction causes conformational alteration from a parallel-displaced structure to a twisted stacking between the anthracene rings inside the Zn2+ assembly, which results in a significant enhancement of CD signals due to excitonic interactions of the chiral anthracene dimer. Dissymmetry factor ( gCD) for CD due to chiral stacking structures shows a significant inverse sigmoidal response to the enantiomeric excess of the chiral coligands. The observed nonlinear phenomena are results of the two conflicting mechanisms, homochiral cooperative association (homochiral self-sorting) to form CD-active assemblies [( S)- or ( R)-Ph-box]2[( S, S)-Im2An]2(Zn2+)2 versus heterochiral cooperative dissociation of [( S, S)-Im2An]4(Zn2+)2 by sequestering of Zn2+ inside the assembly through formation of a heterochiral 2:1 Zn2+ complex ([( R)-Ph-box][( S)-Ph-box]Zn2+). The presented mechanisms provide a new strategy for generating switch-like OFF/ON states in chiral systems.","Fluoride Interferes with the Sperm Fertilizing Ability via Downregulated SPAM1, ACR, and PRSS21 Expression in Rat Epididymis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008594,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 08,"Fluoride is a widespread environmental pollutant that can induce low sperm quality and fertilizing ability; however, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. Hence, we aimed to investigate the influence of fluoride on the sperm fertilizing ability via some key proteins in the epididymis. For this, 40 adult rats were assigned randomly into four groups. The control group was given distilled water, while the other three groups were given 25, 50, and 100 mg of NaF/L via drinking water for 56 days, respectively. After 1 day, epididymides were processed for sperm-egg binding, RNA extraction, western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis. Fluoride exposure reduced the ability of sperm to break down the egg cumulus cell layer. A further study revealed that fluoride altered the expression levels of genes and proteins related to acrosome reaction in vivo, including SPAM1, ACR, and PRSS21. However, fluoride only affected the expression of the ACR protein only in the epididymis but not in the testis. Fluoride also affected the expression levels of the membrane proteins CD9 and CD81 of epididymosomes in the epididymis. From the results, it can be concluded that fluoride exposure reduced the ability of sperm to break down the egg cumulus cell layer, which could be one of the reasons for decreased fertility ability in males treated with fluoride. These results provide some theoretical guidance and new ideas for treatments of low fertility, infertility, and other reproductive diseases.","Tryptophan Supplementation Increases Reproduction Performance, Milk Yield, and Milk Composition in Lactating Sows and Growth Performance of Their Piglets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008593,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 08,"Tryptophan (Trp) can produce bioactive compounds for appetite regulation, calcium mobilization, and mammary gland homeostasis via a serotonin pathway. This study evaluated the effects of Trp supplementation on the reproduction performance, milk yield, and composition of lactating sows, growth performance of their piglets, and the secretion function of porcine mammary epithelial cells (PMECs). The infrared emulsion analyzer and ELISA analyses revealed that feeding sows with a 0.12% Trp addition increased ( P < 0.05) sow average daily feed intake, milk yield, milk calcium concentration, average daily gain of piglets, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and lactose synthase (LS), β-casein secretion, intracellular Ca2+ level, the expression of calcium binding protein CaM, and the activity of CaMKII. In a cellular experiment of PMECs treated with Trp, ELISA and flow cytometry analyses revealed that the pretreatment of a Trp hydroxylase inhibitor reduced ( P < 0.05) FAS and LS synthesis, the intracellular Ca2+ level, and the activity of CaMKII. In conclusion, Trp supplementation at 0.12% increased sows' reproductive performance, milk yield, and calcium concentration and piglets' growth performance. Milk yield increased by Trp was linked to 5-hydroxytryptamine-mediated synthesis of FAS, LS, and β-casein in PMECs, while the increase in calcium concentration was attributed to increasing CaM expression and CAMKII activity.",Stabilizing Reactive Fe(III) Clusters by Freeze-Dry/Solvent-Exchange To Benchmark Iron Hydrolysis Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008592,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 08,"Isolating Fe(III) clusters from water without stabilizing ligands is significantly challenged by the high acidity of Fe3+-bound water, leading to uncontrolled precipitation of iron oxyhydroxides. Here we demonstrate a freeze-drying solvent-exchange method that enabled the isolation of a metastable Fe(III) sulfate decameric cluster formulated [Fe10O2(SO4)12(OCH3)2]·14CH3OH (Fe10). Without stabilization by solvent-exchange, the aqueous species undergoes rapid conversion to the iron sulfate mineral schwertmannite. Monitoring the hydrolysis process from cluster intermediates to schertmannite by small-angle X-ray scattering, we observe the progression from Fe10 to 37 Å soluble nanoparticles prior to the precipitation process. This condensation behavior of Fe10 is further exploited to develop a simple laboratory synthesis of schwetmannite. In addition, we demonstrate the versatility of the freeze-drying solvent-exchange method by isolating Al(III), Zn(II), and Cd(II) substituted Fe(III) sulfate clusters. The freeze-drying solvent-exchange method provides a unique opportunity to isolate cluster intermediates and models to aid in our understanding of metal-ion hydrolysis processes in environmental, material science, and geological studies.",Cell-Penetrating Peptide-Mediated Transformation of Large Plasmid DNA into Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008591,ACS synthetic biology,2019 05 17,"The highly efficient genetic transformation of cells is essential for synthetic biology procedures, especially for the transformation of large gene clusters. In this technical note, we present a novel cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-mediated large-sized plasmid DNA transformation system for Escherichia coli. A large plasmid (pMSR227, 205 kb) was complexed with cationic peptides containing a CPP motif and was successfully transformed into E. coli cells. The transformants containing the plasmid DNA exhibited expression of a reporter gene encoding a red fluorescent protein. The transformation efficiency was significantly higher than that obtained using the heat-shock method and was similar to that of electroporation. This technique can be used as a platform for the simple and highly efficient transformation of large DNA molecules under mild conditions without causing significant damage to DNA, accelerating synthetic biology investigations for the design of genetically engineered microorganisms for industrial purposes.",Fe2O3-CeO2@Al2O3 Nanoarrays on Al-Mesh as SO2-Tolerant Monolith Catalysts for NO x Reduction by NH3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008590,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 23,"Currently, selective catalytic reduction of NO x with NH3 in the presence of SO2 is still challenging at low temperatures (<300 °C). In this study, enhanced NO x reduction was achieved over a SO2-tolerant Fe-based monolith catalyst, which was originally developed through in situ construction of Al2O3 nanoarrays (na-Al2O3) on the monolithic Al-mesh by a steam oxidation method followed by anchoring Fe2O3 and CeO2 onto the na-Al2O3@Al-mesh composite by an impregnation method. The optimum catalyst delivered more than 90% NO conversion and N2 selectivity above 98% within 250-430 °C as well as excellent SO2 tolerance at 270 °C. The strong interaction between Fe2O3 and CeO2 enabled favorable electron transfers from Fe2O3 to CeO2 while generating more oxygen vacancies and active oxygen species, consequently accelerating the redox cycle. The improved reactivity of NH4+ with nitrates following the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism and active NH2 species that directly reacted with gaseous NO following the Eley-Rideal mechanism enhanced the NO x reduction efficiency at low temperatures. The preferential sulfation of CeO2 alleviated the sulfation of Fe2O3 while maintaining the high reactivities of NH4+ and NH2 species. Especially, the SCR reaction following the Eley-Rideal mechanism largely improved the SO2 tolerance because NO does not need to compete with sulfates to adsorb on the catalyst surface as nitrates or nitrites. This work paves a way for the development of high-performance SO2-tolerant SCR monolith catalysts."

The strong electron-withdrawing capability of the 5,8-DCQx and 6,7-DCQx acceptors enabled from yellow to red emission in the TADF emitters. Comparing 5,8-DCQx and 6,7-DCQx, a red-shifted emission by about 40 nm was observed in the 5,8-DCQx acceptor-based emitters, but the external quantum efficiency of the TADF devices was over 20% irrespective of the acceptor, proving the usefulness of the two acceptor moieties as the building blocks of the TADF emitters. Therefore, the quinoxalinedicarbonitrile acceptors are promising as the acceptor moiety for designing yellow or red TADF emitters.",Self-Assembled Injectable Nanocomposite Hydrogels Coordinated by in Situ Generated CaP Nanoparticles for Bone Regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008576,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 16,"Due to the great similarity to the natural extracellular matrix and minimally invasive surgeries, injectable hydrogels are appealing biomaterials in cartilage and bone tissue engineering. Nevertheless, undesirable mechanical properties and bioactivity greatly hamper their availability in clinic applications. Here, we developed an injectable nanocomposite hydrogel by in situ growth of CaP nanoparticles (ICPNs) during the free-radical polymerization of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) matrix (PDH) for bone regeneration. The ICPNs are self-assembled by incorporation of poly-l-glutamic acid (PGA) with abundant carboxyl functional groups during the formation of carboxyl-Ca2+ coordination and further CaP precipitation. Furthermore, the carboxyl groups of PGA could interact with the tertiary amines of DMAEMA fragments and thus improve the mechanical strength of hydrogels. Upon mixing solutions of DMAEMA and HEMA bearing PGA, Ca2+, and PO43-, this effective and dynamic coordination led to the rapid self-assembly of CaP NPs and PDH nanocomposite hydrogels (PDH/mICPN). The obtained optimal nanocomposite hydrogels exhibited suitable injectable time, an enhanced tensile strength of 321.1 kPa, and a fracture energy of 29.0 kJ/m2 and dramatically facilitated cell adhesion and upregulated osteodifferentiation compared to hydrogels prepared by blending ex situ prefabricated CaP NPs. In vivo experiments confirmed the promoted osteogenesis, which shows a striking contrast to pure PDH hydrogels. Additionally, the methacrylate groups on the monomers could easily be functionalized with aptamers and thereby facilitate recognition and capturing of bone marrow stromal cells both in vitro and in vivo and strengthen the bone regeneration. We believe that our conducted research about in situ self-assembled CaP nanoparticle-coordinated hydrogels will open a new avenue for bone regeneration in the future endeavors.",Transport Evidence for Sulfur Vacancies as the Origin of Unintentional n-Type Doping in Pyrite FeS2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008575,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 06,"Pyrite FeS2 has long been considered a potential earth-abundant low-cost photovoltaic material for thin-film solar cells but has been plagued by low power conversion efficiencies and open-circuit voltages. Recent efforts have identified a lack of understanding and control of doping, as well as uncontrolled surface conduction, as key roadblocks to the development of pyrite photovoltaics. In particular, while n-type bulk behavior in unintentionally doped single crystals and thin films is speculated to arise from sulfur vacancies (VS), proof remains elusive. Here, we provide strong evidence, from extensive electronic transport measurements on high-quality crystals, that VS are deep donors in bulk pyrite. Otherwise identical crystals grown via chemical vapor transport under varied S vapor pressures are thoroughly characterized structurally and chemically, and shown to exhibit systematically different electronic transport. Decreased S vapor pressure during growth leads to reduced bulk resistivity, increased bulk Hall electron density, reduced transport activation energy, onset of positive temperature coefficient of resistivity, and approach to an insulator-metal transition, all as would be expected from increased VS donor density. Impurity analyses show that these trends are uncorrelated with metal impurity concentration and that extracted donor densities significantly exceed total impurity concentrations, directly evidencing a native defect. Well-controlled, wide-range n-doping of pyrite is thus achieved via the control of VS concentration, with substantial implications for photovoltaic and other applications. The location of the VS state within the gap, the influence of specific impurities, unusual aspects to the insulator-metal transition, and the influence of doping on surface conduction are also discussed.",Mobility of Yield Stress Fluids on Lubricant-Impregnated Surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008574,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 06,"A common problem which we encounter on a daily basis is dispensing of yield stress fluids such as condiments, lotions, toothpaste, etc. from containers. Beyond consumer products, assuring the flow of yield stress fluids such as crude oil, mud, blood, paint, pharmaceutical products, and others, is essential for the respective industries. Elimination of wall-induced friction can lead to significant savings in the energy required for flow of yield stress fluids, as well as associated product loss and cleaning costs. Lubricant-impregnated surfaces (LIS) have been shown to change the dynamic behavior of yield stress fluids and enable them to flow without shearing. Despite the wide applicability of this technology and its general appeal, the fundamental physics governing the flow of yield stress fluids on LIS have not yet been fully explained. In this work, we study the mobility of yield stress fluids on LIS, and explain the relationship between their macroscale flow behavior and the microscale properties of LIS. We show that for yield stress fluids the thermodynamic state of an LIS can be the difference between mobility and immobility. We demonstrate that LIS can induce mobility in yield stress fluids even below their yield stress allowing them to move as a plug without shearing with an infinite slip length. We identify different mobility mechanisms and establish a regime map for drag reduction in terms of the shear stress to yield stress ratio and the microscopic properties of the LIS. We demonstrate these regimes in a practical application of pipe flow thereby providing key insights for the design of LIS to induce mobility of yield stress fluids in a broad range of practical applications.",A novel Botrytis cinerea-specific gene BcHBF1 enhances virulence of the grey mould fungus via promoting host penetration and invasive hyphal development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008573,Molecular plant pathology,2019 04 22,"Botrytis cinerea is the causative agent of grey mould on over 1000 plant species and annually causes enormous economic losses worldwide. However, the fungal factors that mediate pathogenesis of the pathogen remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a novel B. cinerea-specific pathogenicity-associated factor BcHBF1 (hyphal branching-related factor 1), identified from virulence-attenuated mutant M8008 from a B. cinerea T-DNA insertion mutant library, plays an important role in hyphal branching, infection structure formation, sclerotial formation and full virulence of the pathogen. Deletion of BcHBF1 in B. cinerea did not impair radial growth of mycelia, conidiation, conidial germination, osmotic- and oxidative-stress adaptation, as well as cell wall integrity of the ∆Bchbf1 mutant strains. However, loss of BcHBF1 impaired the capability of hyphal branching, appressorium and infection cushion formation, appressorium host penetration and virulence of the pathogen. Moreover, disruption of BcHBF1 altered conidial morphology and dramatically impaired sclerotial formation of the mutant strains. Complementation of BcHBF1 completely rescued all the phenotypic defects of the ∆Bchbf1 mutants. During young hyphal branching, host penetration and early invasive growth of the pathogen, BcHBF1 expression was up-regulated, suggesting that BcHBF1 is required for these processes. Our findings provide novel insights into the fungal factor mediating pathogenesis of the grey mould fungus via regulation of its infection structure formation, host penetration and invasive hyphal branching and growth.",A homologue of the fungal tetraspanin Pls1 is required for Epichloë festucae expressorium formation and establishment of a mutualistic interaction with Lolium perenne.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008572,Molecular plant pathology,2019 04 22,"Epichloë festucae is an endophytic fungus that forms a mutualistic symbiotic association with the grass host Lolium perenne. Endophytic hyphae exit the host by an appressorium-like structure known as an expressorium. In plant-pathogenic fungi, the tetraspanin Pls1 and the NADPH oxidase component Nox2 are required for appressorium development. Previously we showed that the homologue of Nox2, NoxB, is required for E. festucae expressorium development and establishment of a mutualistic symbiotic interaction with the grass host. Here we used a reverse genetics approach to functionally characterize the role of the E. festucae homologue of Pls1, PlsA. The morphology and growth of ΔplsA in axenic culture was comparable to wild-type. The tiller length of plants infected with ΔplsA was significantly reduced. Hyphae of ΔplsA had a proliferative pattern of growth within the leaves of L. perenne with increased colonization of the intercellular spaces and the vascular bundles. The ΔplsA mutant was also defective in expressorium development although the phenotype was not as severe as for ΔnoxB, highlighting potentially distinct roles for PlsA and NoxB in signalling through the NoxB complex. Hyphae of ΔplsA proliferate below the cuticle surface but still occasionally form an expressorium-like structure that enables the mutant hyphae to exit the leaf to grow on the surface. These expressoria still form a septin ring-like structure at the point of cuticle exit as found in the wild-type strain. These results establish that E. festucae PlsA has an important, but distinct, role to NoxB in expressorium development and plant symbiosis.",Visualization of the intrarenal distribution of capillary blood flow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008571,Physiological reports,2019 04 26,"This study describes a modified technique to fill the renal vasculature with a silicon rubber (Microfil) compound and obtain morphologic information about the intrarenal distribution of capillary blood flow under a variety of conditions. Kidneys and cremaster muscles of rats were perfused in vivo with Microfil using a perfusion pressure equal to the animal's mean arterial pressure at body temperature. Microfil did not alter arteriolar diameter or the pattern of flow in the microcirculation of the cremaster muscle. The modified protocol reproducibly filled the renal vasculature, including; glomerular, peritubular, and vasa recta capillaries. We compared the filling of the renal circulation in control rats with that seen in animals subjected to maneuvers reported to alter the intrarenal distribution of blood flow. Infusion of angiotensin II, hypotension, volume expansion, and mannitol- or furosemide-induced diuresis redistributed flow between renal cortical and medullary capillaries. The advantage of the current technique is that it provides anatomical information regarding the number, diameter, and branching patterns of capillaries in the postglomerular circulation critical in determining the intrarenal distribution of cortical and medullary blood flow.",Machine Learning with Optical Phase Signatures for Phenotypic Profiling of Cell Lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008570,Cytometry.

The goals of this study were to determine robust and reproducible optical phase signatures of cell lines for classification with machine learning and to correlate optical phase parameters to motile behavior. Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) reconstructed phase maps of cells from two pairs of cancer and non-cancer cell lines. Seventeen image parameters were extracted from each cell's phase map, used for linear support vector machine learning, and correlated to scratch wound closure and Boyden chamber chemotaxis. The classification accuracy was between 90% and 100% for the six pairwise cell line comparisons. Several phase parameters correlated with wound closure rate and chemotaxis across the four cell lines. The level of cell confluence in culture affected phase parameters in all cell lines tested.

Part A,2019 06 14,"Formation of peritoneal adhesions is common complication after abdominal and pelvic surgery. They bear a significant health problem with an influence to quality of life and health care expenses. Promising approach for their prevention is using of biodegradable barrier films for physical separation of peritoneal surfaces. In the present study, highly porous pectin-based three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds were obtained by freeze-drying technique. Physico-chemical properties of the formed materials, including their morphology, porosity, density, and stability, have been studied. The evaluation of their biocompatibility, biodegradation, and potential antiadhesion effect was studied by in vivo experiment. To reinforce the scaffolds structure and improve their stability in physiological solutions, pectin chains were cross-linked with divalent cations. We determined optimal cross-linking conditions, which allow obtaining scaffolds with desired biodegradation rate. These cross-linked scaffolds fully dissolved within 8 days in the peritoneal cavity with low presence of complications and some antiadhesive effect. It has also been determined that mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue could effectively adhere to the scaffolds with preservation of their viability. Our results show that obtained materials can be suggested as mechanical scaffold for delivery of the stem cells culture to peritoneal surfaces as a part of complex antiadhesive barrier system.",Clinical and Molecular Phenotyping in Scleromyxedema Pre- and Post-Treatment with Intravenous Immunoglobulin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008568,Arthritis care & research,2019 04 26,"Scleromyxedema (SMX) is a rare systemic sclerosis mimic that often responds to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG), yet the resulting clinical and biochemical changes have not been well characterized."

Four hundred and eighty 75-week-old laying hens (Lohmann Brown) were randomly assigned to five treatments with eight replicates per treatment and 12 hens in each replicate. The hens were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0 (control), 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, or 1.2 g MMT/kg for 70 days. Compared with the control, supplemented with 0.9 g MMT/kg increased egg mass significantly (p < 0.05) during weeks 1-5 of the experiment. Supplemented with 0.6 and 0.9 g MMT/kg also increased the endotoxin concentration in the ileal digesta (p < 0.05), but decreased the MDA concentration in the ileum significantly (p < 0.05). The T-AOC in the jejunum of the group fed 0.3 g MMT/kg was significantly increased (p < 0.05). Compared with the control, the villus height:crypt depth of ileum from the groups fed 0.6, 0.9, and 1.2 g MMT/kg increased significantly (p < 0.05). The sIgA concentration of jejunum in the groups fed 0.6 and 0.9 g MMT/kg was higher (p < 0.05) than the control. The MMT supplementation linearly increased (p < 0.05) the mRNA expression of claudin-1 and claudin-5 in the jejunum. Dietary MMT supplementation down-regulated the mRNA expression of NF-κB P65 and TNF-α in the jejunum in a linear and quadratic manner (p < 0.05). The IL-1β mRNA expression of jejunum in the group fed 0.6 g MMT/kg was lower (p < 0.05) than the control. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with MMT may improve the gut barrier functions and suggests that 0.9 g/kg of MMT in diets may be the optimal supplemental level for laying hens in late production.",Prevalence and factors associated with unmet needs in post-treatment cancer survivors: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008544,European journal of cancer care,2019 05 21,"Cancer survivors may experience unmet needs beyond the end of their treatment. This paper aimed to explore the prevalence and most frequently found unmet needs and to identify factors associated with higher levels of total unmet needs and with each domain separately. Five databases were searched using the keywords neoplasms, survivors, needs assessment, health services' needs and demands. The results were presented based on the strength of the evidence (strong, moderate and weak association) and the categorisation of the pooled prevalence of at least one unmet need (high, moderate, low). Twenty-six studies were included in the review. A higher prevalence of at least one reported unmet need was observed in survivors with less time since treatment and in women with breast cancer. The most frequently reported unmet needs were fear of cancer recurrence and requesting up to date information. Strong evidence was found for an association between a higher number of unmet needs and younger age, higher anxiety and poorer quality of life. Future studies on unmet needs should report how unmet needs are associated with each domain separately.

A subset of these tumors defy conventional classification. However, with the advent of next-generation sequencing, the identification of disease-defining molecular alterations is gradually improving their subclassification. Following identification of two index cases of a distinctive fibroblastic neoplasm with a fusion gene involving PRRX1 and NCOA1, we performed a retrospective review to further characterize this entity. We identified two additional cases, including one with a fusion between PRRX1 and NCOA2. The average patient age was 38 years, and three patients were female. Two tumors occurred on the neck, and the others involved the groin and thigh. Tumors were centered in the subcutis and ranged from 2.3 to 14.0 cm (average 5.8 cm). Morphologically, they were predominantly hypocellular, with focal hypercellularity. They were composed of monomorphic spindle-stellate cells with a vague fascicular pattern. The nuclei were bland with only rare mitotic activity, and occasional multinucleation. The intervening stroma was typically abundant and ranged from myxoid to collagenous, with frequent rope-like collagen bundles. Three of the cases had a prominent vasculature ranging from numerous small curvilinear vessels to ectatic and branching staghorn-like vessels. Immunohistochemistry was negative for desmin, smooth muscle actin, S100, CD34, keratin, and epithelial membrane antigen. Each of the patients was treated by simple excision and none of the tumors were associated with local recurrence or metastasis. Based on their unique morphological and molecular attributes, we believe this represents a novel fibroblastic tumor for which we have tentatively proposed the name ""PRRX-NCOAx-rearranged fibroblastic tumor.""",Proteolysis mediated by the membrane-integrated ATP-dependent protease FtsH has a unique nonlinear dependence on ATP hydrolysis rates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008538,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,2019 06 14,"ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) proteases utilize ATP hydrolysis to actively unfold native or misfolded proteins and translocate them into a protease chamber for degradation. This basic mechanism yields diverse cellular consequences, including the removal of misfolded proteins, control of regulatory circuits, and remodeling of protein conformation. Among various bacterial AAA+ proteases, FtsH is only membrane-integrated and plays a key role in membrane protein quality control. Previously, we have shown that FtsH has substantial unfoldase activity for degrading membrane proteins overcoming a dual energetic burden of substrate unfolding and membrane dislocation. Here, we asked how efficiently FtsH utilizes ATP hydrolysis to degrade membrane proteins. To answer this question, we measured degradation rates of the model membrane substrate GlpG at various ATP hydrolysis rates in the lipid bilayers. We find that the dependence of degradation rates on ATP hydrolysis rates is highly nonlinear: (i) FtsH cannot degrade GlpG until it reaches a threshold ATP hydrolysis rate; (ii) after exceeding the threshold, the degradation rates steeply increase and saturate at the ATP hydrolysis rates far below the maxima. During the steep increase, FtsH efficiently utilizes ATP hydrolysis for degradation, consuming only 40-60% of the total ATP cost measured at the maximal ATP hydrolysis rates. This behavior does not fundamentally change against water-soluble substrates as well as upon addition of the macromolecular crowding agent Ficoll 70. The Hill analysis shows that the nonlinearity stems from coupling of three to five ATP hydrolysis events to degradation, which represents unique cooperativity compared to other AAA+ proteases including ClpXP, HslUV, Lon, and proteasomes.",Anatomic characterization of the femoral nutrient artery: Application to fracture and surgery of the femur.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008535,"Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 30,"The localization of nutrient foramina and direction of nutrient canals have been studied. However, information about the origin and extraosseous course of nutrient arteries is lacking in some types of long tubular and irregular bones. Thus, we aimed to reexamine the origin and course of the femoral nutrient artery (FNA) through cadaveric dissection to clarify its anatomic characteristics. Sixty thighs were collected from 57 cadavers. To fix the cadavers and visualize the small arterial branches, 10% formalin was injected from the femoral artery, followed by an injection of acrylic ink. The arterial tree in the posterior part of the thigh was recorded by line drawings. The femur received single or double FNAs via the femoral nutrient foramina, which were on and along the linea aspera. In cases with single FNA (41 of the 60 thighs), it typically arose from the four parts of the profunda femoris system: profunda femoris artery between the origins of the third and fourth perforating arteries; second perforating artery; third perforating artery; and terminal branch. In cases with double FNAs (remaining 19 thighs), the superior FNA typically arose from the second perforating artery, and the inferior FNA arose from the terminal branch of the profunda femoris artery and popliteal system. FNAs are described as branches of the perforating arteries in Terminologia Anatomica and anatomy textbooks. However, we found that FNAs also frequently arose from the profunda femoris artery and popliteal system, in addition to the perforating arteries. Clin.

Here, we assess gender differences in a newly identified set of methylation biomarkers. UCa-associated hypermethylated sites were identified in urine of a male screening cohort (n = 24) applying Infinium-450K-methylation arrays and verified in two separate mixed-gender study groups (n = 617 in total) using mass spectrometry as an independent technique. Additionally, tissue samples (n = 56) of mixed-gender UCa and urological controls (UCt) were analyzed. The hypermethylation signature of UCa in urine was specific and sensitive across all stages and grades of UCa and independent on hematuria. Individual CpG sensitivities reached up to 81.3% at 95% specificity. Albeit similar methylation differences in tissue of both genders, differences were less pronounced in urine from women, most likely due to the frequent presence of squamous epithelial cells and leukocytes. Increased repression of methylation levels was observed at leukocyte counts ≥500/μl urine which was apparent in 30% of female and 7% of male UCa cases, further confirming the significance of the relative amounts of cancerous and noncancerous cells in urine. Our study shows that gender difference is a most relevant issue when evaluating the performance of urinary biomarkers in cancer diagnostics. In case of UCa, the clinical benefits of methylation signatures to male patients may outweigh those in females due to the general composition of women's urine. Accordingly, these markers offer a diagnostic option specifically in males to decrease the number of invasive cystoscopies."

With regard to TPA we question the validity of the data generated and urge authors caution before they publish results from the test protocol. If results are published then the x-axis should be viewed as deformation or strain, and not time. Hardness should be represented by the breaking stress. Adhesiveness should be measured at a medium strain taking into account the surface properties of the plunger. The ratio of the energy estimated by the area under the curve obtained from the second and the first bites (A2 /A1 ) should be called recoverability and not cohesiveness.","Trends in substance use and in the attributable burden of disease and mortality in the WHO European Region, 2010-16.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008515,European journal of public health,2019 04 22,"This paper examines changes in substance use, and compares the resulting attributable burden of disease in the WHO European Region between 2010 and 2016.","Localized Control of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Miami, FL, via Inundative Releases of Wolbachia-Infected Male Mosquitoes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008514,Journal of medical entomology,2019 04 22,"As part of the response to autochthonous Zika transmission in the United States, the City of South Miami implemented a 6-mo period in which Wolbachia-infected WB1 Aedes aegypti (L.) males were released into an ~170-acre area.

These results suggest that RXR activation can effectively protect the lung tissue against I/R injury, and the mechanism may involve the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway, the enhancement of antioxidant level and the reduction of oxidative stress response.",[Nutritional status alters the mRNA expressions of galanin and its receptors in taste buds of rats].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008489,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],2019 04 22,"The nutritional and metabolic status alters the peripheral taste perception and food intake by participating in the modulation of taste information integration. The taste receptors and neuropeptides in the taste buds are the important targets of this modulation process. To explore the effects of nutritional status on the expressions of galanin and its receptors in the taste buds, we compared the mRNA levels of galanin and its specific receptor GalR2 in the taste buds among the high-fat diet induced obese rats (HF), chronically restricted diet rats (CR) and control rats. The high-fat diet, half of chow diet, and normal chow diet were given to HF, CR and control groups for 6 weeks, respectively. The body weight and some metabolic indexes, including blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol levels were detected. The mRNA expressions of galanin and its receptors in taste buds were determined using real-time PCR. Results showed that compared with control rats, the body weights, levels of blood glucose and triglyceride were significantly elevated in HF rats; while the mRNA expressions of galanin and GalR2 were dramatically decreased. However, galanin mRNA expression in CR rats was increased to 2.3 times of that in control group. Considering the results obtained from our previous studies, we conclude that the behavioral changes in tasting choice of HF rats may be related to the expressions of galanin and GalR2 in the taste buds. The changes of galanin and GalR2 in taste buds are involved in the peripheral mechanism of nutritional status regulating taste perception and feeding behavior in rats.",[Slit/Robo pathway participates in luteal cells apoptosis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008488,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],2019 04 22,"This study was aimed to examine the expression and function of Slit/Robo family members in mouse ovary. Real-time PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression levels of Slit/Robo family members, and immunohistochemistry was used to examine the location of Slit2 and Robo1 in the ovary. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Slit2 and Robo1 in early-, middle- and late-phase corpus luteum (CL) were examined by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Blocking agent ROBO1/Fc chimera was used in the luteal cells in vitro to examine the function of Slit/Robo signaling pathway in mouse CL. The results showed that, among the Slit/Robo family members, the expression levels of ligand Slit2 and receptor Robo1 were the highest in mouse ovarian tissue. Moreover, both of them were specifically expressed in mouse luteal cells. Compared with proestrus ovaries, the expression levels of Slit2 and Robo1 mRNA in the ovaries during diestrus were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01, P < 0.001). The mRNA expression levels of Slit2 and Robo1 in late-phase CL were significantly increased when compared with pregnant CL. Furthermore, blocking Slit/Robo signaling pathway with ROBO1/Fc chimera in the luteal cells in vitro significantly decreased the apoptotic rate of late luteal cells. These results suggest that Slit/Robo family members are mainly expressed in the late-phase CL of ovary and participate in luteal cells apoptosis.",[S100 calcium binding protein A16 promotes fat synthesis through endoplasmic reticulum stress in HepG2 cells].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008487,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],2019 04 22,"The aim of this study was to investigate the role of S100 calcium binding protein A16 (S100A16) in lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and its possible biological mechanism. HepG2 cells (human hepatoma cell line) were cultured with fatty acid to establish fatty acid culture model. The control model was cultured without fatty acid. Each model was divided into three groups and transfected with S100a16 over-expression, shRNA and vector plasmids, respectively. The concentration of triglyceride (TG) in the cells was measured by kit, and the lipid droplets was observed by oil red O staining. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to find the interesting proteins interacting with S100A16, and the interaction was verified by immunoprecipitation. The further mechanism was studied by Western blot and qRT-PCR. The results showed that the intracellular lipid droplet and TG concentrations in the fatty acid culture model were significantly higher than those in the control model. The accumulation of intracellular fat in the S100a16 over-expression group was significantly higher than that in the vector plasmid transfection group. There was an interaction between heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5) and S100A16. Over-expression of S100A16 up-regulated protein expression levels of HSPA5, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) and pIREα1, which belong to endoplasmic reticulum stress HSPA5/IRE1α-XBP1 pathway. Meanwhile, over-expression of S100A16 up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of adipose synthesis-related gene Srebp1c, Acc and Fas. In the S100a16 shRNA plasmid transfection group, the above-mentioned protein and mRNA levels were lower than those of vector plasmid transfection group. These results suggest that S100A16 may promote lipid synthesis in HepG2 cells through endoplasmic reticulum stress HSPA5/IRE1α-XBP1 pathway."

It also discusses the identification of Internet addiction based on diagnostic criteria suggested by the scientific community. The focus of the article is on executive functioning in this type of addiction. Until recently researchers have put it in the context of a personal, social or emotional area, yet it would seem that cognitive functions play a significant role in explaining the development of addiction, with cognitive control and executive functions being particularly important.

However, these models are not described in a consistent manner in the scientific literature, which is one of the barriers to their broader use and acceptance, especially for regulatory purposes. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) are in silico models based on the assumption that the activity of a substance is related to its chemical structure. These models can be used to provide information on (eco)toxicological effects in hazard assessment. In an environmental risk assessment, environmental exposure models can be used to estimate the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). In addition, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models can be used in various ways to support a human health risk assessment. In this paper, we first propose model reporting templates for systematically and transparently describing models that could potentially be used to support regulatory risk assessments of MNs, for example under the REACH regulation. The model reporting templates include (a) the adaptation of the QSAR Model Reporting Format (QMRF) to report models for MNs, and (b) the development of a model reporting template for PBK and environmental exposure models applicable to MNs. Second, we show the usefulness of these templates to report different models, resulting in an overview of the landscape of available computational models for MNs.",Physiologically based mathematical models of nanomaterials for regulatory toxicology: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008415,"Computational toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 04 24,"The development of physiologically based (PB) models to support safety assessments in the field of nanotechnology has grown steadily during the last decade. This review reports on the availability of PB models for toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicodynamic (TD) processes, including in vitro and in vivo dosimetry models applied to manufactured nanomaterials (MNs). In addition to reporting on the state-of-the-art in the scientific literature concerning the availability of physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models, we evaluate their relevance for regulatory applications, mainly considering the EU REACH regulation. First, we performed a literature search to identify all available PBK models. Then, we systematically reported the content of the identified papers in a tailored template to build a consistent inventory, thereby supporting model comparison. We also described model availability for physiologically based dynamic (PBD) and in vitro and in vivo dosimetry models according to the same template. For completeness, a number of classical toxicokinetic (CTK) models were also included in the inventory. The review describes the PBK model landscape applied to MNs on the basis of the type of MNs covered by the models, their stated applicability domain, the type of (nano-specific) inputs required, and the type of outputs generated. We identify the main assumptions made during model development that may influence the uncertainty in the final assessment, and we assess the REACH relevance of the available models within each model category. Finally, we compare the state of PB model acceptance for chemicals and for MNs. In general, PB model acceptance is limited by the absence of standardised reporting formats, psychological factors such as the complexity of the models, and technical considerations such as lack of blood:tissue partitioning data for model calibration/validation.",Next generation physiologically based kinetic (NG-PBK) models in support of regulatory decision making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008414,"Computational toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 04 24,"The fields of toxicology and chemical risk assessment seek to reduce, and eventually replace, the use of animals for the prediction of toxicity in humans. In this context, physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modelling based on in vitro and in silico kinetic data has the potential to a play significant role in reducing animal testing, by providing a methodology capable of incorporating in vitro human data to facilitate the development of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation of hazard information. In the present article, we discuss the challenges in: 1) applying PBK modelling to support regulatory decision making under the toxicology and risk-assessment paradigm shift towards animal replacement; 2) constructing PBK models without in vivo animal kinetic data, while relying solely on in vitro or in silico methods for model parameterization; and 3) assessing the validity and credibility of PBK models built largely using non-animal data. The strengths, uncertainties, and limitations of PBK models developed using in vitro or in silico data are discussed in an effort to establish a higher degree of confidence in the application of such models in a regulatory context.

Evaluation of different analytic techniques frequently employed to understand the DTI-derived change in WM organization in a multisite, well-characterized, early stage PD cohort should aid the identification of the most robust analytic techniques to be used to investigate WM pathology in this disease, an important unmet need in the field. Thus, region of interest (ROI)-based analysis, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis with varying spatial smoothing, and the two most widely used skeletonwise approaches (tract-based spatial statistics, TBSS, and tensor-based registration, DTI-TK) were evaluated in a DTI dataset of early PD and Healthy Controls (HC) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort. Statistical tests on the DTI-derived metrics were conducted using a nonparametric approach from this cohort of early PD, after rigorously controlling for motion and signal artifacts during DTI scan which are frequent confounds in this disease population. Both TBSS and DTI-TK revealed a significantly negative correlation of fractional anisotropy (FA) with disease duration. However, only DTI-TK revealed radial diffusivity (RD) to be driving this FA correlation with disease duration. HC had a significantly positive correlation of MD with cumulative DaT score in the right middle-frontal cortex after a minimum smoothing level (at least 13mm) was attained. The present study found that scalar DTI-derived measures such as FA, MD, and RD should be used as imaging biomarkers with caution in early PD as the conclusions derived from them are heavily dependent on the choice of the analysis used. This study further demonstrated DTI-TK may be used to understand changes in DTI-derived measures with disease progression as it was found to be more accurate than TBSS. In addition, no singular region was identified that could explain both disease duration and severity in early PD. The results of this study should help standardize the utilization of DTI-derived measures in PD in an effort to improve comparability across studies and time, and to minimize variability in reported results due to variation in techniques.",Performance and emission characteristics of compression-ignition engine handling biodiesel blends with electronic fumigation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008406,Heliyon,2019 04 22,"Many research works are being carried out to enhance the performances of internal combustion engines to meet out the current energy demand and to reduce the emission with the alternate fuels. In this experimental investigation, the performances and emission characteristics of compression ignition engine were studied by using electronic fuel fumigation method. The lemongrass biodiesel blended with 20% of biodiesel and 80% of diesel (B20) was used as primary fuel and 1-propanol is used as secondary fuel for fumigation. The Kirlosker, single cylinder four stroke, direct injection, and water cooled engine was taken for conduction of tests. The speed of the engine is maintained constant and the engine load was varied in the range of 0%-100% and fumigation injection timing is varied in the range of 1 ms, 3 ms and 5 ms to study the engine parameters. It is studied that the brake thermal efficiency of fumigation fuel at 5 ms is 6.7% higher than diesel and at 3 ms is 3.1% higher than the diesel fuel at 100% load. The specific fuel consumption at 5 ms is 16 % higher than the reference diesel fuel. The 5 ms 1-propanol fumigation produces the maximum HC and CO with minimum smoke and NO because of lower combustion temperature and incomplete combustion. The SFC of fumigation fuel at 5 ms is 18.6% higher than diesel at 100% load and 23 % higher than diesel at 80% load. The net heat release of fumigation fuel (1-propanol) at 1 ms produces 2% higher than the reference diesel at crank angle of 360°. The fumigation fuel (1-propanol) injection timing at 5 ms produces more percentage of CO at different load conditions. It is also studied that the minimum level of CO is 0.38 % at 40% load condition. The fumigation fuel at 5 ms injection timing produces minimum percentage of CO2 at different load conditions. The minimum level of CO2 is 9.3% at 80% load condition. The other emissions are also analyzed and recorded the levels based on the load condition."

Its applications include studies to control vehicular traffic lights, urban planning, market studies, and detection of abnormal behaviors. However, these tasks require the use of intelligent algorithms of high computational demand that need to be trained in the environment being studied. This article presents a novel method to estimate pedestrian flow in uncontrolled environments by using the fractal dimension measured through the box-counting algorithm, which does not require the use of image pre-processing and intelligent algorithms. Four scenarios were used to validate the method presented in this article, of which the last scene was a low-light surveillance video, showing experimental results with a mean relative error of 4.92% when counting pedestrians. After comparing the results with other techniques that depend on intelligent algorithms, we can confirm that this method achieves improved performance in the estimation of pedestrian traffic.",One year outcome of high-risk newborn infants discharged from the neonatal care unit of the National Maternal and Child Health Center in Cambodia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008390,Heliyon,2019 04 24,"In the National Maternal and Child Health Center in Cambodia, about 7,500 newborn infants are born every year.

Although it is a source of livelihood for several people, it causes environmental degradation. Reclamation is needed to restore mined areas to an acceptable condition. This study uses ANN to monitor reclamation activities in small scale mining area. Landsat satellite images of study area (2007, 2011 and 2016), ground truth data and ESRI shapefile of the study area were used for the analyses. Two ANN classification methods, Unsupervised Self - Organized Mapping (SOM) and Supervised Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were used for the classification of the satellite images. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) change maps were generated in order to help confirm where actual change had occurred and to what extent it had occurred. The results show disturbance and revegetation in the study area between 2007 and 2016. The Barelands/mined areas class increased by 60.4% and a decrease in the vegetation class by 18.7% from 2007 to 2011.

In poultry production, feed is the single major input constituting 70-75% of total production cost. Feed mainly consists of cereal grains, those provide energy to the birds. However, these grains contain different levels of anti-nutritional factors such as non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). These NSP are indigestible by poultry birds due to the lack of vital endogenous enzymes (carbohydrases) thus increase intestinal viscosity which slower the migration and absorption of nutrients. Consequently, these NSP may also increase the chances for infection by inducing competition within gut microbiota for digestible nutrients. This affects bird's health and increases the production cost. Therefore, there is a need to find efficient and effective solutions for these problems. Carbohydrases supplementation have an important role in poultry diets with high NSP contents. Feed enzymes are being used from years to enhance growth performance and digestibility but have limited activity for selective ingredients. New generation carbohydrases with a board range of activity and stability help to degrade the complex substrates and improve growth performance of poultry. Present review summarizes the updated literature on the use of carbohydrases to improve bird's performance and intestinal health.","First-principles study on the structural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of LiNbO3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008386,Heliyon,2019 05 04,"The structural, electronic, elastic, mechanical and optical properties of technologically important lithium niobate (LiNbO3) have been investigated by using the first-principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) implemented in the CASTEP code.

However, with normal renal function, oral and enteral ingestion of substances contaminated with Al, such as antacids and infant formulae, do not cause problems. The intestine, skin, and respiratory tract are barriers to Al entry into the blood. However, contamination of fluids given parenterally, such as parenteral nutrition solutions, or hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or even oral Al-containing substances to patients with impaired renal function could result in accumulation in bone, parathyroids, liver, spleen, and kidney. The toxic effects of Al to the skeleton include fractures accompanying a painful osteomalacia, hypoparathyroidism, microcytic anemia, cholestatic hepatotoxicity, and suppression of the renal enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha hydroxylase.

Conventional therapeutic strategies for inducing angiogenesis aim to deliver one or more proangiogenic cytokines or to over-express known pro-angiogenic genes, but seldom address potential compensatory or cooperative effects between signals and the overarching signaling pathways that determine successful outcomes. An emerging grand challenge is harnessing the expanding knowledge base of angiogenic signaling pathways toward development of successful new therapies. We previously performed drug optimization studies by various substitutions of a 2-(2,6-dioxo-3-piperidyl)isoindole-1,3-dione scaffold to discover novel bioactive small molecules capable of inducing growth of microvascular networks, the most potent of which we termed phthalimide neovascularization factor 1 (PNF1, formerly known as SC-3-149). We then showed that PNF-1 regulates the transcription of signaling molecules that are associated with vascular initiation and maturation in a time-dependent manner through a novel pathway compendium analysis in which transcriptional regulatory networks of PNF-1-stimulated microvascular endothelial cells are overlaid with literature-derived angiogenic pathways. In this study, we generated three analogues (SC-3-143, SC-3-263, SC-3-13) through systematic transformations to PNF1 to evaluate the effects of electronic, steric, chiral, and hydrogen bonding changes on angiogenic signaling. We then expanded our compendium analysis toward these new compounds. Variables obtained from the compendium analysis were then used to construct a PLSR model to predict endothelial cell proliferation. Our combined approach suggests mechanisms of action involving suppression of VEGF pathways through TGF-β andNR3C1 network activation.",Serum BNP levels are associated with malignant pericardial effusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008182,International journal of cardiology.

We investigate specific ecoregions within these two U.S. regions and find that in the majority of ecoregions, annual lightning- and human-ignited wildfire burn area have similar relationships with key meteorological parameters. We investigate the fuel moisture values where wildfires occur segregated by ignition type and show that within a given ecoregion, the differences in median fuel moisture between ignition types are generally smaller than the differences between ecoregions. Our results suggest that annual wildfire burn area for human- and lightning-ignited wildfires within a given ecoregion are modulated by environmental conditions, and climate change may similarly impact wildfires of both ignition types.

NPs have not been widely investigated in relation to left atrium (LA) function after sinus rhythm (SR) restoration and duration of AF. The aim of the study was to determine the changes of NPs levels and to define their relation with LA phasic function after electrical cardioversion (ECV). Methods. The study included 48 persistent AF patients with restored SR after ECV. NT-proANP and NT-proBNP were measured for all patients before the ECV. LA phasic function (reservoir, conduit, and pump phases) was assessed using echocardiographic volumetric analysis within the first 24 hours after ECV. Patients were repeatedly tested after 1 month in case of SR maintenance. Results. After 1 month, SR was maintained in 26 (54%) patients. For those patients, NT-proBNP decreased significantly (p=0.0001), whereas NT-proANP tended to decrease (p=0.13). Following 1 month after SR restoration, LA indexed volume decreased (p=0.0001) and all phases of LA function improved (p=<0.01). Patients with AF duration < 3 months had lower NT-proANP compared to patients with AF duration from 6 to 12 months (p = 0.005). Higher NT-proANP concentration before ECV was associated with lower LA reservoir function during the first day after SR restoration (R=-0.456, p=0.005), whereas higher NT-proBNP concentration after 1 month in SR was significantly related to lower LA reservoir function (R=-0.429, p=0.047). Conclusions. LA indexed volume, all phases of LA function, and NT-proBNP levels improved significantly following 1 month of SR restoration. Preliminary results suggest that higher baseline NT-proANP levels and higher NT-proBNP for patients with maintained SR for 1 month are related to lower LA reservoir function. The longer duration of persistent AF is associated with higher NT-proANP concentration.",Effectiveness of Platelet-Rich Fibrin as an Adjunctive Material to Bone Graft in Maxillary Sinus Augmentation: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trails.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008111,BioMed research international,2019 04 24,"To date, it remains unknown whether the addition of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) to bone grafts actually improves the effectiveness of maxillary sinus augmentation.

MSI plays a central role in the development of multiple human cancers. In colon cancer, despite being associated with resistance to 5-fluorouracil treatment, MSI is a favourable prognostic marker. In gastric and endometrial cancers, its prognostic value is not so well established. Nevertheless, recognising the MSI tumours may be important for predicting the therapeutic effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Several gene expression signatures were trained on microarray data sets to understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer. A wealth of expression data already exists in the form of microarray data sets. However, the RNA-seq has become a routine for transcriptome analysis. A new MSI gene expression signature presented here is the first to be valid across two different platforms, microarrays and RNA-seq. In the case of colon cancer, its estimated performance was (i) AUC = 0.94, 95% CI = (0.90 - 0.97) on RNA-seq and (ii) AUC = 0.95, 95% CI = (0.92 - 0.97) on microarray. The 25-gene expression signature was also validated in two independent microarray colon cancer data sets. Despite being derived from colorectal cancer, the signature maintained good performance on RNA-seq and microarray gastric cancer data sets (AUC = 0.90, 95% CI = (0.85 - 0.94) and AUC = 0.83, 95% CI = (0.69 - 0.97), respectively). Furthermore, this classifier retained high concordance even when classifying RNA-seq endometrial cancers (AUC = 0.71, 95% CI = (0.62 - 0.81). These results indicate that the new signature was able to remove the platform-specific differences while preserving the underlying biological differences between MSI/MSS phenotypes in colon cancer samples."

In this study, we evaluated the effect of ginsenoside Ro (G-Ro) on the binding of fibronectin and fibrinogen to αIIb/β3 and clot retraction. We found that G-Ro inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation dose-dependently and attenuated the fibronectin-, and fibrinogen-binding to αIIb/β3 through the dephosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 and Akt, which influence clot retraction, reflecting the intensification of thrombus. We observed that G-Ro is involved in αIIb/β3 in human platelets. These results suggest that G-Ro is beneficial, inhibiting fibronectin adhesion, fibrinogen binding, and clot retraction. Therefore, G-Ro in Panax ginseng may prevent platelet aggregation-mediated thrombotic disease.","Antidiarrheal, Analgesic, and Anthelmintic Activities of Honeys in the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest, Bangladesh.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008096,Preventive nutrition and food science,2019 04 24,"This study evaluated the antidiarrheal, analgesic, and anthelmintic activities of honey samples from the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh.

These findings postulate that supplementation with 100% flesh watermelon juice improves endurance in swimming performance.",Long-Term Feeding of Soy Protein Attenuates Choline Deficient-Induced Adverse Effects in Wild Type Mice and Prohibitin 1 Deficient Mice Response More Sensitively.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008094,Preventive nutrition and food science,2019 04 24,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, however the exact cause of NAFLD remains unknown. Methionine, an essential amino acid, is the first limiting amino acid of soy protein, and its deficiency is suggested to cause hepatocyte damage and NAFLD. The objective of this study is to examine the changes in NAFLD susceptibility with soy protein consumption and deterioration due to prohibitin 1 (PHB1) deficiency, an important protein in hepatic mitochondrial function. In this study, liver-specific phb1 +/- mice and wild-type mice were fed a normal diet, choline-deficient diet (CDD), or soy protein diet without choline (SPD) for 16 weeks. Using hematoxylin and eosin staining, we showed that SPD attenuates symptoms of hepatocyte damage and lipid accumulation induced by CDD in mouse liver. The liver damage in mice fed the SPD was alleviated by decreasing lipogenic markers and by increasing anti-inflammatory markers. Furthermore, mRNA expression of genes involved in hepatic methionine metabolism was significantly lower in liver-specific phb1 +/- mice fed with a SPD compared with wild-type mice fed with a SPD. These data suggest a CDD can cause non-alcohol related liver damage, which can be attenuated by a SPD in wild-type mice. These phenomena were not observed in liver-specific phb1 +/- mice. It may therefore be concluded that SPD attenuates CDD-induced liver damage in wild-type mice, and that PHB1 deficiency blocks the beneficial effects of SPD against CDD-induced liver damage.",Association between Green Tea Consumption and Risk of Stroke in Middle-Aged and Older Korean Men: The Health Examinees (HEXA) Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008093,Preventive nutrition and food science,2019 04 24,"Green tea consumption is known to have varying effects on health and disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between green tea consumption and risk of stroke in Korean adult men. Data were obtained from the Health Examinees (HEXA) Study, which included 50,439 subjects aged 40 years and older. Information regarding dietary intake was collected from semi-quantified food frequency questionnaires consisting of 106 items. Green tea consumption was categorized as none, <1 cup/d, 1 to <3 cups/d, and ≥3 cups/d. Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to examine a possible association between green tea consumption and risk of stroke by controlling for potential confounders. Subgroup analyses by age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, and alcohol consumption were also performed. Compared with green tea non-drinkers, individuals that consumed 1 to <3 cups/d or ≥3 cups/d of green tea had multivariable adjusted OR (CI) of stroke of 0.75 (0.59~0.97) and 0.62 (0.39~0.98), respectively, after adjusting for age and various confounders. In the subgroup analyses, an inverse association between green tea consumption and risk of stroke was identified among younger, non-hypertensive, and non-diabetic men. Higher consumption of green tea was inversely associated with stroke risk in middle-aged and older Korean men.","Meta-Analysis: Effects of Zinc Supplementation Alone or with Multi-Nutrients, on Glucose Control and Lipid Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008092,Preventive nutrition and food science,2019 04 24,"The present study aims to assess the effects of zinc supplementation on metabolic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. A literature search was conducted in PubMedTM, Google ScholarTM, and ScopusTM up to March 2018. Twenty randomized controlled trials met the predefined inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for net changes in glycemic indices including fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and in lipid markers including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). Subgroup analyses were performed based on intervention and study quality. Compared to controls, zinc supplementation significantly reduced the concentrations of both FBG and HbA1c (FBG WMD: -19.66 mg/dL, 95% CI: -33.71, -5.62; HbA1c WMD: -0.43 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.80, -0.07). The pooled estimate showed a significant decrease in serum TC and LDL-c, and increase in serum HDL-c levels in treatment group compared with the control group (TC WMD: -18.51 mg/dL, 95% CI: -21.36, -15.66; LDL-c WMD: -4.80 mg/dL, 95% CI: -6.07, -3.53; HDL-c WMD: 1.45 mg/dL, 95% CI: 1.40, 1.51). Subgroup analysis of ""no co-supplement"" intervention demonstrated significant differences for mean changes in HDL-c and FBG levels, whereas subgroup analysis of high quality studies showed significant differences for mean changes of LDL-c, HDL-c, and FBG levels. Results suggested that zinc supplementation reduces FBG, HbA1c and LDL-c levels and increases HDL-C levels; however, these changes were related to intervention and quality of studies.",Occurrence and traceability of Salmonella spp. in five Sardinian fermented sausage facilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008088,Italian journal of food safety,2019 04 24,"The aims of the present study were to evaluate the presence of Salmonella in five fermented sausage processing plants and their products during the production process, and to trace the possible sources of contamination. A total of 270 samples were collected: mixture of ground pork meat and fat, products at the end of acidification, sausages at the end of ripening and, during production stages, surfaces in contact with meat and surfaces not in contact with meat. For samples of ground meat, product at the end of acidification and sausages at the end of ripening, the pH and water activity (aw), were determined. All the samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella. Thirtytwo Salmonella isolates were obtained, subjected to serotyping and PFGE. The sausages at the end of ripening pH and aw mean values were 5.39±0.24 and 0.91±0.03, respectively. Salmonella was detected in three processing plants with an overall prevalence of 16.7% in food samples and 5.8% in environmental samples. Salmonella prevalence was 24% in ground meat and products at the end of acidification and was also detected in a sample of sausage at the end of ripening (2%). In environmental samples, Salmonella was detected in 6.6% of surfaces in contact with meat and 5% of surfaces not in contact with meat. Five serotypes were identified among 32 isolates: S. Derby (37.5%), S. Typhimurium and S. Rissen (both 25%), S. Give and monophasic S. Typhimurium (both 6.25%). Six different pulsotypes were obtained with PFGE. The serotypes and the PFGE pattern of the strains were specific for each facility with no overlapping between different processing plants. The same observation can be pointed out considering different sampling days for the same processing plants, thus presumably indicating the raw material (ground pork meat and fat) as the source of contamination. The detection of Salmonella in a sample of sausage at the end of ripening highlights the ability of the pathogen to survive during manufacturing process.",Detection of antibiotic residues among raw beef in Erbil City (Iraq) and impact of temperature on antibiotic remains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008087,Italian journal of food safety,2019 04 24,"The presence of antibiotic residues in beef is considered a serious threat to public health.

The dataset under investigation included a total of 144 wild and farmed specimens coming from 17 different European areas located in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Samples were subjected to SIR analysis (carbon and nitrogen) and REEs analysis (lanthanum, europium, holmium, erbium, lutetium, and terbium). Then, Analytical data were handled by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then by Orthogonal Partial Last Square Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), to obtain functional classification models to qualitatively discriminate sea bass according to the conditions under study. OPLSDA models provided good correct classification rate both for production method and geographical origin. It was confirmed that chemometric elaboration of data obtained from SIR and REEs analyses can be a suitable tool for an accurate authentication of European sea bass.",Introduction of the nudging method in penitentiary facilities in Italy in view of food waste reduction: Preliminary data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008085,Italian journal of food safety,2019 04 24,"The aim of this study was to analyze different aspects of food waste in the specific context of prisons by introducing the nudging method, thanks to the collaboration of District House and Prison of Larino (Italy) involving staff and guests of the penitentiary structure, providing them with the knowledge of the topic and encouraging them to propose creative and effective solutions to prevent and reduce food waste. The study involved n. 50 participants out of total of about 200 prisoners. Data were collected using n.3 questionnaires related to the knowledge of food waste food, the second related to the origin of consumed and food waste and the third collected the participants' proposals how to reduce food waste. The results show that effects of nudging has awakened the prisoners' conscience about the social, ethical and economic importance of reducing food waste and a proactive attitude in providing proposals for the reduction of food waste. The most wasted food is bread (35%), pasta (27%) and fresh fruit (20%), provided by the administration because they are considered of inferior quality or prepared and cooked badly. The overwhelming majority (96%) of the participants showed sensitivity about the ethical and economic reasons behind the fight against food waste, making themselves available to contribute to its reduction and suggesting some initiatives. The data collected from the questionnaires related to the causes of waste indicate the need to implement actions aimed at the correct conservation of food and the promotion of good hygiene practices."

Therefore, the esterification is conducted under solvent-free conditions. The thermodynamic water activity (aw) was identified as a key parameter affecting the esterification performance in the (-)-menthol:LA DES. A response surface methodology was applied to optimize the esterification conditions in terms aw, amount of C. rugosa lipase (mCRL) and reaction temperature. Under the optimized reaction conditions (aw = 0.55; mCRL =60 mg; T =45 °C), a conversion of 95 ± 1% LA was achieved (one day), the final (-)-menthyl lauric acid ester concentration reached 1.36 ± 0.04 M (2.25 days).

The effects of StSTBc-3 concentration (0.2-5 μM), pH value (6-10) and temperature (35-50 °C) on fibrinogenolytic activity were studied through response surface methodology (RSM). We obtained a model that predicts the response accurately. The relationship between enzyme concentration and fibrinogenolytic activity was linear, while the main effect from pH and temperature on the response was quadratic. From the RSM generated model the optimum pH was 8 and the optimum temperature was 43 °C, while higher concentrations of enzyme produce higher activities. Under optimum conditions there were no statistically significant differences between the experimental responses and the ones predicted from the model. This model also predicts the activity under physiological conditions. These results confirm that StSTBc-3 is a good candidate to be considered for therapeutic uses.

Kernels allow data to be mapped into high-dimensional feature spaces and can thus extend simple linear additive methods to nonlinear methods with higher order interactions. However, until recently, there has been a strong reliance on a limited class of stationary kernels such as the Matérn or squared exponential, limiting the expressiveness of these modelling approaches. Recent machine learning research has focused on spectral representations to model arbitrary stationary kernels and introduced more general representations that include classes of nonstationary kernels. In this paper, we exploit the connections between Fourier feature representations, Gaussian processes and neural networks to generalise previous approaches and develop a simple and efficient framework to learn arbitrarily complex nonstationary kernel functions directly from the data, while taking care to avoid overfitting using state-of-the-art methods from deep learning. We highlight the very broad array of kernel classes that could be created within this framework. We apply this to a time series dataset and a remote sensing problem involving land surface temperature in Eastern Africa. We show that without increasing the computational or storage complexity, nonstationary kernels can be used to improve generalisation performance and provide more interpretable results.",Stepwise Protocols for Scoring of Mitral Valve using Three-Dimensional Transthoracic Echocardiography in Mitral Stenosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008031,Journal of cardiovascular echography,2019 04 24,This study aims to propose protocols that enable scoring of mitral valve (MV) in mitral stenosis using the three-dimensional (3D) scoring system.,Youth consumption of alcohol mixed with energy drinks in Canada: Assessing the role of energy drinks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008029,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"Consuming alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmED) is a risk behaviour among youth, and previous research has reported a positive association between binge drinking and AmED consumption. However, limited research has examined how regular consumption of energy drinks is associated with AmED consumption among youth. The purpose of this report is to examine the role of energy drink use on AmED consumption in a Canadian youth population. Using data from the 2015-2016 COMPASS survey including 35,300 grade 9 to 12 students, two logistic regression models investigated if the inclusion of energy drink consumption in the past week altered the results of a model examining AmED consumption. In this sample, 13.2% of students reported AmED consumption in the last 12 months. Those who reported drinking energy drinks in the past week were 3.38 times more likely to consume AmED than those who did not drink energy drinks. The inclusion of past week energy drink use decreased the effect size of other associated substance use behaviours. This report demonstrates that past week energy drink use is associated with increased likelihood of AmED consumption and suggests that previous research may have missed this important contributor. These findings along with existing energy drink research highlight the importance of addressing the lack of energy drink regulations in Canada.","Associations between parenting and substance use, meal pattern and food choices: A cross-sectional survey of 13,269 Norwegian adolescents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008028,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"Identifying factors that affect adolescent lifestyle behaviors is essential in order to develop effective generic prevention approaches.

The sample included adults aged 21 years or older with diabetes (n = 8415). The outcome for this study was either receiving five selected preventive care measures (HbA1c tests, cholesterol tests, foot examinations, dilated eye examinations, and influenza vaccines) collectively or not. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among all adults with diabetes, those with multimorbidity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) or eye complications. Adults with diabetes were poorly adherent to receiving the five preventive care measures collectively (15.6%). Among all adults with diabetes, factors associated with receiving all the selected preventive practices included age, education, health insurance, prescription drug coverage, duration of diabetes, number of chronic conditions and smoking status. Similar results were observed among adults with multimorbidity. Among adults with CKD, those with private insurance and drug prescription coverage were more likely to receive the recommended practices. The findings suggest low adherence to receiving all five recommended practices. It is crucial to increase the awareness about the need for all the recommended practices among adults with diabetes.",Urban young women's preferences for intervention strategies to promote physical and mental health preconception: A Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008026,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"This study aimed to qualitatively investigate young women's preferences for preconception intervention strategies to promote physical and mental health in a rapidly transitioning, urban setting. Four semi-structured focus group discussions were conducted with young women (n = 29, 18-24 years old) from Soweto, South Africa. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. Two main themes were identified: 1) challenges and needs of intervention beneficiaries; and 2) preferences for intervention strategies (content and delivery). The challenges participants mentioned could be classified as those relating to social pressure, identity, and socioeconomic circumstances. Mental health support appeared to be a greater need than physical health, and this featured in their preferences for intervention content, although a number of physical health topics were also mentioned (healthy eating and contraception). Participants had mixed preferences for intervention materials, ranging from printed to electronic and mobile resources. Their preferences for intervention activities ranged from educational sessions, to fun and interactive practical activities, and activities they could take home. Community health workers (CHWs) were the preferred agent of delivery for interventions, though participants emphasised the importance of CHWs having appropriate interpersonal skills and own life experience. Some women preferred one-on-one sessions with a CHW, while others preferred group sessions. While recognising the value of family sessions, young women were less enthusiastic about this approach. These findings provide valuable formative data for developing effective interventions to optimise young women's preconception health in urban Africa. These contextual realities should be acknowledged when addressing key physical and mental health issues facing young women.",Perceived risk of colorectal and breast cancers among women who are overweight or with obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008025,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"Many overweight women or women with obesity do not acknowledge their high weight status and may be unaware of their elevated cancer risk. We explored the relationship between weight status and women's perceived risk of colorectal (CRC) and breast cancers, overall and by race/ethnicity, in a nationally representative sample. Data was combined from NHIS 2005, 2010, and 2015 sample adult questionnaires and cancer control supplements. The analytic sample included females aged 18 years and over without reported history of cancer diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was performed and adjusted estimates for perceived risk of CRC and breast cancers were examined, stratified by body mass index and race/ethnicity. Data were reported using predicted marginal risk ratio (PMR). Colorectal cancer risk perception remained lowest among Non-Hispanic (NH) Black women regardless of weight status (PMR = 0.53 obesity, 0.65 overweight, 0.55 normal) compared to NH White women after adjustment for all covariates. Hispanic women who were overweight or had obesity also saw themselves at lower risk of CRC compared to NH White women, however these findings were statistically insignificant. Breast cancer risk perception also remained low for NH Blacks and Hispanics at any weight compared with NH Whites. Greater effort is needed to develop, disseminate, and widely adopt or institutionalize multilevel weight management interventions and programs. These programs increase awareness of excess weight as a risk factor for cancer and empower women in diverse communities to achieve and maintain a healthy weight by adopting healthy behaviors related to nutrition and physical activity.",Near-Infrared Organic Fluorescent Nanoparticles for Long-term Monitoring and Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008024,Nanotheranostics,2019 04 24,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which utilizes reactive oxygen species to ablate tumor, has attracted much attention in recent years. Photosensitizers with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence as well as efficient ROS generation ability have been used for precise diagnosis and simultaneous treatment of cancer. However, photosensitizers frequently suffer from low ROS generation ability and NIR fluorescence quenching in aqueous media due to the aggregation. Methods: We prepare an effective AIE active NIR emissive photosensitizer containing rhodanine as electron acceptor and triphenylvinylthiophene as electron donor is prepared, and encapsulate the corresponding photosensitizer into Pluronic F127 to fabricate NIR organic fluorescent nanoparticles. We then evaluate the NIR fluorescence bioimaging and photodynamic therapy ability of TPVTR dots in vitro and in vivo. Results: The yielded organic fluorescent nanoparticles exhibit effective ROS generation ability, bright NIR emission, high photostability, and good biocompatibility. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments confirm that NIR organic fluorescent nanoparticles demonstrate good performances in long-term tracing and photodynamic ablation of tumor. Conclusion: In summary, the synthesized organic fluorescent nanoparticles, TPVTR dots, showed great potentials in long-term cell tracing and photodynamic therapy of tumor. Our study highlights the efficient strategy for developing promising near-infrared organic fluorescent nanoparticles in advancing the field of bioimaging and further image-guide clinical applications.",Enhanced Photothermal Treatment Efficacy and Normal Tissue Protection via Vascular Targeted Gold Nanocages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008023,Nanotheranostics,2019 04 26,"A major challenge in photothermal treatment is generating sufficient heat to eradicate diseased tissue while sparing normal tissue. Au nanomaterials have shown promise as a means to achieve highly localized photothermal treatment. Toward that end, the synthetic peptide anginex was conjugated to Au nanocages. Anginex binds to galectin-1, which is highly expressed in dividing endothelial cells found primarily in the tumor vasculature. The skin surface temperature during a 10 min laser exposure of subcutaneous murine breast tumors did not exceed 43°C and no normal tissue damage was observed, yet a significant anti-tumor effect was observed when laser was applied 24 h post-injection of targeted nanocages. Untargeted particles showed little effect in immunocompetent, tumor-bearing mice under these conditions. Photoacoustic, photothermal, and ICP-MS mapping of harvested tissue showed distribution of particles near the vasculature throughout the tumor. This uptake pattern within the tumor combined with a minimal overall temperature rise were nonetheless sufficient to induce marked photothermal efficacy and evidence of tumor control. Importantly, this evidence suggests that bulk tumor temperature during treatment does not correlate with treatment outcome, which implies that targeted nanomedicine can be highly effective when closely bound/distributed in and around the tumor endothelium and extensive amounts of direct tumor cell binding may not be a prerequisite of effective photothermal approaches.",Perfluorocarbon nanodroplets can reoxygenate hypoxic tumors in vivo without carbogen breathing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008022,Nanotheranostics,2019 04 24,"Nanoscale perfluorocarbon (PFC) droplets have enormous potential as clinical theranostic agents. They are biocompatible and are currently used in vivo as contrast agents for a variety of medical imaging modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, photoacoustic and 19F-magnetic resonance imaging. PFC nanodroplets can also carry molecular and nanoparticulate drugs and be activated in situ by ultrasound or light for targeted therapy. Recently, there has been renewed interest in using PFC nanodroplets for hypoxic tumor reoxygenation towards radiosensitization based on the high oxygen solubility of PFCs. Previous studies showed that tumor oxygenation using PFC agents only occurs in combination with enhanced oxygen breathing. However, recent studies suggest that PFC agents that accumulate in solid tumors can contribute to radiosensitization, presumably due to tumor reoxygenation without enhanced oxygen breathing. In this study, we quantify the impact of oxygenation due to PFC nanodroplet accumulation in tumors alone in comparison with other reoxygenation methodologies, in particular, carbogen breathing. Methods: Lipid-stabilized, PFC (i.e., perfluorooctyl bromide, CF3(CF2)7Br, PFOB) nanoscale droplets were synthesized and evaluated in xenograft prostate (DU145) tumors in male mice. Biodistribution assessment of the nanodroplets was achieved using a fluorescent lipophilic indocarbocyanine dye label (i.e., DiI dye) on the lipid shell in combination with fluorescence imaging in mice (n≥3 per group). Hypoxia reduction in tumors was measured using PET imaging and a known hypoxia radiotracer, [18F]FAZA (n≥ 3 per group). Results: Lipid-stabilized nanoscale PFOB emulsions (mean diameter of ~250 nm), accumulated in the xenograft prostate tumors in mice 24 hours post-injection. In vivo PET imaging with [18F]FAZA showed that the accumulation of the PFOB nanodroplets in the tumor tissues alone significantly reduced tumor hypoxia, without enhanced oxygen (i.e., carbogen) breathing. This reoxygenation effect was found to be comparable with carbogen breathing alone. Conclusion: Accumulation of nanoscale PFOB agents in solid tumors alone successfully reoxygenated hypoxic tumors to levels comparable with carbogen breathing alone, an established tumor oxygenation method. This study confirms that PFC agents can be used to reoxygenate hypoxic tumors in addition to their current applications as multifunctional theranostic agents."

Space physics,2019 04 24,"Ring current electrons (1-100 keV) have received significant attention in recent decades, but many questions regarding their major transport and loss mechanisms remain open. In this study, we use the four-dimensional Versatile Electron Radiation Belt code to model the enhancement of phase space density that occurred during the 17 March 2013 storm. Our model includes global convection, radial diffusion, and scattering into the Earth's atmosphere driven by whistler-mode hiss and chorus waves. We study the sensitivity of the model to the boundary conditions, global electric field, the electric field associated with subauroral polarization streams, electron loss rates, and radial diffusion coefficients. The results of the code are almost insensitive to the model parameters above 4.5 R E R E, which indicates that the general dynamics of the electrons between 4.5 R E and the geostationary orbit can be explained by global convection. We found that the major discrepancies between the model and data can stem from the inaccurate electric field model and uncertainties in lifetimes. We show that additional mechanisms that are responsible for radial transport are required to explain the dynamics of ≥40-keV electrons, and the inclusion of the radial diffusion rates that are typically assumed in radiation belt studies leads to a better agreement with the data. The overall effect of subauroral polarization streams on the electron phase space density profiles seems to be smaller than the uncertainties in other input parameters. This study is an initial step toward understanding the dynamics of these particles inside the geostationary orbit.","Ionospheric GNSS Imagery of Seismic Source: Possibilities, Difficulties, and Challenges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008005,Journal of geophysical research. Space physics,2019 04 24,"Up to now, the possibility to obtain images of seismic source from ionospheric Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) measurements (seismo-ionospheric imagery) has only been demonstrated for giant earthquakes with moment magnitude Mw ≥ 9.0. In this work, we discuss difficulties and restrictions of this method, and we apply for the first time the seismo-ionospheric imagery for smaller earthquakes. The latter is done on the example of the Mw7.4 Sanriku-oki earthquake of 9 March 2011. Analysis of 1-Hz data of total electron content (TEC) shows that the first coseismic ionospheric disturbances (CID) occur ~470-480 s after the earthquake as TEC enhancement on the east-northeast from the epicenter. The location of these first CID arrivals corresponds to the location of the coseismic uplift that is known as the source of tsunamis. Our results confirm that despite several difficulties and limitations, high-rate ionospheric GNSS data can be used for determining the seismic source parameters for both giant and smaller/moderate earthquakes. In addition to these seismo-ionospheric applications, we raise several fundamental questions on CID nature and evolution, namely, one of the most challenging queries-can moderate earthquake generate shock-acoustic waves?",Evaluating Single Spacecraft Observations of Planetary Magnetotails With Simple Monte Carlo Simulations: 2. Magnetic Flux Rope Signature Selection Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008004,Journal of geophysical research. Space physics,2019 04 24,"A Monte Carlo method of investigating the effects of placing selection criteria on the magnetic signature of in situ encounters with flux ropes is presented. The technique is applied to two recent flux rope surveys of MESSENGER data within the Hermean magnetotail. It is found that the different criteria placed upon the signatures will preferentially identify slightly different subsets of the underlying population. Quantifying the selection biases first allows the distributions of flux rope parameters to be corrected, allowing a more accurate estimation of the intrinsic distributions. This is shown with regard to the distribution of flux rope radii observed. When accounting for the selection criteria, the mean radius of Hermean magnetotail quasi-force-free flux ropes is found to be

The downtail location of the neutral line is not self-consistent or in agreement with previous (independent) studies unless dissipation terms are included planetward of the reconnection site; potential physical explanations are discussed. In the future the model could be adapted to other environments, for example, the dayside magnetopause or other planetary magnetotails.",Correlations Between the Thermosphere's Semiannual Density Variations and Infrared Emissions Measured With the SABER Instrument.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008002,Journal of geophysical research. Space physics,2019 04 24,"This paper presents measurements of the amplitudes and timings of the combined, annual, and semiannual variations of thermospheric neutral density, and a comparison of these density variations with measurements of the infrared emissions from carbon dioxide and nitric oxide in the thermosphere. The density values were obtained from measurements of the atmospheric drag experienced by the Challenging Minisatellite Payload, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment A, Gravity field and Ocean Circulation Explorer, and three Swarm satellites, while the optical emissions were measured with the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite. These data span a time period of 16 years. A database containing global average densities that were derived from the orbits of about 5,000 objects (Emmert, 2009, https://doi.org/10.1029/2009JA014102, 2015b, https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JA021047) was employed for calibrating these density data. A comparison with the NRLMSISE-00 model was used to derive measurements of how much the density changes over time due to these seasonal variations. It is found that the seasonal density oscillations have significant variations in amplitude and timing. In order to test the practicality of using optical emissions as a monitoring tool, the SABER data were fit to the measured variations. Even the most simple fit that used only filtered carbon dioxide emissions had good correlations with the measured oscillations. However, the density oscillations were also well predicted by a simple Fourier series, contrary to original expectations. Nevertheless, measurements of the optical emissions from the thermosphere are expected to have a role in future understanding and prediction of the semiannual variations.",Extrinsic Elastic Anisotropy in a Compositionally Heterogeneous Earth's Mantle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008001,Journal of geophysical research. Solid earth,2019 04 24,"Several theoretical studies indicate that a substantial fraction of the measured seismic anisotropy could be interpreted as extrinsic anisotropy associated with compositional layering in rocks, reducing the significance of strain-induced intrinsic anisotropy. Here we quantify the potential contribution of grain-scale and rock-scale compositional anisotropy to the observations by (i) combining effective medium theories with realistic estimates of mineral isotropic elastic properties and (ii) measuring velocities of synthetic seismic waves propagating through modeled strain-induced microstructures. It is shown that for typical mantle and oceanic crust subsolidus compositions, rock-scale compositional layering does not generate any substantial extrinsic anisotropy (<1%) because of the limited contrast in isotropic elastic moduli among different rocks. Quasi-laminated structures observed in subducting slabs using P and S wave scattering are often invoked as a source of extrinsic anisotropy, but our calculations show that they only generate minor seismic anisotropy (<0.1-0.2% of Vp and Vs radial anisotropy). More generally, rock-scale compositional layering, when present, cannot be detected with seismic anisotropy studies but mainly with wave scattering. In contrast, when grain-scale layering is present, significant extrinsic anisotropy could exist in vertically limited levels of the mantle such as in a mid-ocean ridge basalt-rich lower transition zone or in the uppermost lower mantle where foliated basalts and pyrolites display up to 2-3% Vp and 3-6% Vs radial anisotropy. Thus, seismic anisotropy observed around the 660-km discontinuity could be possibly related to grain-scale shape-preferred orientation. Extrinsic anisotropy can form also in a compositionally homogeneous mantle, where velocity variations associated with major phase transitions can generate up to 1% of positive radial anisotropy.",Effects of Induced Stress on Seismic Waves: Validation Based on Ab Initio Calculations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31008000,Journal of geophysical research. Solid earth,2019 04 24,"When a continuum is subjected to an induced stress, the equations that govern seismic wave propagation are modified in two ways. First, the equation of conservation of linear momentum gains terms related to the induced deviatoric stress, and, second, the elastic constitutive relationship acquires terms linear in the induced stress. This continuum mechanics theory makes testable predictions with regard to stress-induced changes in the elastic tensor. Specifically, it predicts that induced compression linearly affects the prestressed moduli with a slope determined by their local adiabatic pressure derivatives and that induced deviatoric stress produces anisotropic compressional and shear wave speeds. In this article we successfully compare such predictions against ab initio mineral physics calculations for NaCl and MgO.",Earthquake Nucleation Size: Evidence of Loading Rate Dependence in Laboratory Faults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007999,Journal of geophysical research. Solid earth,2019 04 24,"Recent Global Positioning System observations of major earthquakes such as the 2014 Chile megathrust show a slow preslip phase releasing a significant portion of the total moment (Ruiz et al., 2014, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1256074). Despite advances from theoretical stability analysis (Rubin & Ampuero, 2005, https://doi.org/10.1029/2005JB003686; Ruina, 1983, https://doi.org/10.1029/jb088ib12p10359) and modeling (Kaneko et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1002/2016GL071569), it is not fully understood what controls the prevalence and the amount of slip in the nucleation process. Here we present laboratory observations of slow slip preceding dynamic rupture, where we observe a dependence of nucleation size and position on the loading rate (laboratory equivalent of tectonic loading rate). The setup is composed of two polycarbonate plates under direct shear with a 30-cm long slip interface. The results of our laboratory experiments are in agreement with the preslip model outlined by Ellsworth and Beroza (1995, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.268.5212.851) and observed in laboratory experiments (Latour et al., 2013, https://doi.org/10.1002/grl.50974; Nielsen et al., 2010, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246x.2009.04444.x; Ohnaka & Kuwahara, 1990, https://doi.org/10.1016/0040-1951(90)90138-X), which show a slow slip followed by an acceleration up to dynamic rupture velocity. However, further complexity arises from the effect of (1) rate of shear loading and (2) inhomogeneities on the fault surface. In particular, we show that when the loading rate is increased from 10-2 to 6 MPa/s, the nucleation length can shrink by a factor of 3, and the rupture nucleates consistently on higher shear stress areas. The nucleation lengths measured fall within the range of the theoretical limits L b and

We analyzed new multibeam bathymetry, backscatter, gravity, and magnetic data with 100% multibeam bathymetric data over the active transform valley and adjacent spreading segments as part of the Passive Imaging of the Lithosphere Asthenosphere Boundary (PI-LAB) Experiment. Analyses of these data sets allow us to determine the history and mode of crustal formation and the tectonic evolution of the transform system and adjacent ridges over the past 20 Myr. We model the total field magnetic anomaly to determine the age of the crust along the northern ridge segment to better establish the timing of the variations in the seafloor fabric and the tectonic-magmatic history of the region. Within the active transform fault zone, we observe four distinct positive flower structures with several en échelon fault scarps visible in the backscatter data. We find up to -10 mGal residual Mantle Bouguer Anomaly in the region of the largest positive flower structure within the transform zone suggesting crustal thickening relative to the crustal thinning typically observed in fracture zones in the Atlantic. The extensional/compressional features observed in the Chain Transform are less pronounced than those observed further north in the Vema, St. Paul, and Romanche and may be due to local ridge segment adjustments.","Southern Ocean Biogeochemical Float Deployment Strategy, With Example From the Greenwich Meridian Line (GO-SHIP A12).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007997,Journal of geophysical research.

The goal is 200 floats by 2020, to provide the first full set of annual cycles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, and optical properties across multiple oceanographic regimes. Building from no prior coverage to a sparse array, deployments are based on prior knowledge of water mass properties, mean frontal locations, mean circulation and eddy variability, winds, air-sea heat/freshwater/carbon exchange, prior Argo trajectories, and float simulations in the Southern Ocean State Estimate and Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Twelve floats deployed from the 2014-2015 Polarstern cruise from South Africa to Antarctica are used as a test case to evaluate the deployment strategy adopted for SOCCOM's 20 deployment cruises and 126 floats to date. After several years, these floats continue to represent the deployment zones targeted in advance: (1) Weddell Gyre sea ice zone, observing the Antarctic Slope Front, and a decadally-rare polynya over Maud Rise; (2) Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) including the topographically steered Southern Zone chimney where upwelling carbon/nutrient-rich deep waters produce surprisingly large carbon dioxide outgassing; (3) Subantarctic and Subtropical zones between the ACC and Africa; and (4) Cape Basin.

These entities are poorly studied and understood because of their rarity and are often either managed conservatively with observation if the lesion is complex, or treated surgically or interventionally in the presence of an accessible and distinct fistulous connection. Most surgeons avoid intervening on more intricate lesions until they become symptomatic with progressive neurological decline. We describe the case of a 38-year-old man who presented with severe sharp back pain after an appendectomy procedure. A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) revealed an arteriovenous malformation of the conus medullaris, with a compact glomus-type nidus and arterial feeders originating from an enlarged artery of Adamkiewicz.

The ocular manifestations included panuveitis (four eyes, 30.8%), anterior uveitis (two eyes, 15.4%), posterior uveitis (seven eyes, 53.8%) and optic neuritis (two eyes, 15.4%). Seven (53.8%) eyes presented with visual acuity of worse than 6/60, five (38.5%) eyes had visual acuity between 6/15 to 6/60, and one (7.7%) eye had visual acuity of 6/12 or better. Nine patients received an intravenous benzylpenicillin regime and one patient received an intramuscular penicillin injection. Out of 13 eyes affected, 11 (84.6%) eyes had improved visual acuity of at least one Snellen line after treatment. Visual acuity of 6/12 or better increased to four (30.8%) eyes. Conclusions Posterior uveitis was the commonest presentation of ocular syphilis in HIV-negative patients. Early detection and treatment of ocular syphilis can result in resolution of inflammation and improvement of vision.",Finding the 'QR' to Patient Safety: Applying Gamification to Incorporate Patient Safety Priorities Through a Simulated 'Escape Room' Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007972,Cureus,2019 04 24,"Medical errors are the eighth leading cause of mortality in the United States and contribute to over one million preventable injuries. In an effort to prevent medical errors, reporting systems serve as invaluable tools to detect patient safety events and quality problems longitudinally. Historically, trainees (i.e., students and residents) rarely submit incident reports for encountered patient safety threats. The authors propose an immersive learning experience utilizing gamification theory and leveraging the increasingly popular 'escape room' to help resident trainees identify reportable patient safety priorities. All 130 incoming intern physicians at the Thomas Jefferson University (Jefferson) were enrolled in the Patient Safety Escape Room study as part of their residency orientation (June 2018). The residents were randomly divided into 16 teams. Each team was immersed in a simulated escape room, tasked with identifying a predetermined set of serious patient safety hazards, and successfully manually entering them into the Jefferson Event Reporting System within the time allotted to successfully 'win the game' by 'escaping the room'. Quick response (QR) codes were planted throughout the activity to provide in-game instructions; clues to solve the puzzle; and key information about patient safety priorities at Jefferson. All participants underwent a formal debriefing using the feedback capture grid method and completed a voluntary post-study survey, adapted from Brookfield's Critical Incident Questionnaire (CIQ). The study was IRB exempt. Thematic analysis of the post-activity CIQ survey (n = 102) revealed that interns were engaged during the immersive learning experience (n = 42) and were specifically engaged by having to independently identify patient safety threats (n = 30). Participants identified team role assignment (n = 52) and effective communication (n = 26) as the two most helpful actions needed to successfully complete the activity. Participants were overall surprised by the success of the education innovation (n = 45) and reported that it changed how they viewed patient safety threats. Areas for improvement include clearer game instructions and using a more streamlined event reporting process. The escape room patient-safety activity allowed interns to actively engage in an innovative orientation activity that highlighted the importance of patient safety hazards, as well as providing them with the opportunity to document event reports in real-time. Next steps will include longitudinally tracking the quantity of error reports entered by this cohort to determine the effectiveness of this educational intervention.",Predicting Monomers for Use in Aqueous Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization-Induced Self-Assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007970,ACS macro letters,2019 04 24,"Aqueous polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) is a well-established methodology enabling in situ synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles of controllable morphology. Notably, PISA via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMPISA) is an emerging technology for block copolymer self-assembly, mainly due to its high versatility and robustness. However, a limited number of monomers suitable for core-forming blocks in aqueous ROMPISA have been reported to date. In this work, we identified seven monomers for use as either corona- or core-forming blocks during aqueous ROMPISA by in silico calculation of relative hydrophobicity for corresponding oligomeric models. The predicted monomers were validated experimentally by conducting ROMPISA using our previously reported two-step approach. In addition to predictive data, our computational model was exploited to identify trends between polymer hydrophobicity and the morphology of the self-assembled nano-objects they formed. We expect that this methodology will greatly expand the scope of aqueous ROMPISA, as monomers can be easily identified based on the structure-property relationships observed herein.",Development of an Improved System for the Carboxylation of Aryl Halides through Mechanistic Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007967,ACS catalysis,2019 04 26,"The nickel-catalyzed carboxylation of organic halides or pseudohalides using carbon dioxide is an emerging method to prepare synthetically valuable carboxylic acids. Here, we report a detailed mechanistic investigation of these reactions using the carboxylation of aryl halides with (PPh3)2NiIICl2 as a model reaction. Our studies allow us to understand several general features of nickel-catalyzed carboxylation reactions. For example, we demonstrate that both a Lewis acid and halide source are beneficial for catalysis. To this end, we establish that heterogeneous Mn(0) and Zn(0) reductants are multifaceted reagents that generate noninnocent Mn(II) or Zn(II) Lewis acids upon oxidation. In a key result, a rare example of a well-defined nickel(I) aryl complex is isolated, and it is demonstrated that its reaction with carbon dioxide results in the formation of a carboxylic acid in high yield (after workup). The carbon dioxide insertion product undergoes rapid decomposition, which ca These three oxidation states correspond to the onbe circumvented by a ligand metathesis reaction with a halide source. Our studies have led to both a revised mechanism and the development of a broadly applicable strategy to improve reductive carboxylation reactions. A critical component of this strategy is that we have replaced the heterogeneous Mn(0) reductant typically used in catalysis with a well-defined homogeneous organic reductant. Through its use, we have increased the range of ancillary ligands, additives, and substrates that are compatible with the reaction. This has enabled us to perform reductive carboxylations at low catalyst loadings. Additionally, we demonstrate that reductive carboxylations of organic (pseudo)halides can be achieved in high yields in more practically useful, non-amide solvents. Our results describe a mechanistically guided strategy to improve reductive carboxylations through the use of a homogeneous organic reductant, which may be broadly translatable to a wide range of cross-electrophile coupling reactions.",Phosphothreonine (pThr)-Based Multifunctional Peptide Catalysis for Asymmetric Baeyer-Villiger Oxidations of Cyclobutanones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007966,ACS catalysis,2019 04 24,"Biologically inspired phosphothreonine (pThr)-embedded peptides that function as chiral Brønsted acid catalysts for enantioselective Baeyer-Villiger oxidations (BV) of cyclobutanones with aqueous H2O2 are reported herein. Complementary to traditional BINOL-derived chiral phosphoric acids (CPAs), the functional diversity of the peptidic scaffold provides the opportunity for multiple points of contact with substrates via hydrogen bonding, and the ease of peptide synthesis facilitates rapid diversification of the catalyst structure, such that numerous unique peptide-based CPA catalysts have been prepared. Utilizing a hypothesis-driven design, we identified a pThr-based catalyst that contains an N-acylated diaminopropionic acid (Dap) residue, which achieves high enantioselectivity with catalyst loadings as low as 0.5 mol%. The power of peptide-based multi-site binding is further exemplified through reversal in the absolute stereochemical outcome upon repositioning of the substrate-directing group (ortho- to meta). Modifications to the i+3 residue (LDap to LPhe) lead to an observed enantiodivergence without inversion of any stereogenic center on the peptide catalyst, due to noncovalent interactions. Structure-selectivity and 1H-1H-ROESY studies revealed that the proposed hydrogen bonding interactions are essential for high levels of enantioinduction. The ability for the phosphopeptides to operate as multifunctional oxidation catalysts expands the scope of pThr catalysts and provides a framework for the future selective diversification of more complex substrates, including natural products.","Manganese-Catalyzed α-Alkylation of Ketones, Esters, and Amides Using Alcohols.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007965,ACS catalysis,2019 04 24,"Herein we report the manganese-catalyzed C-C bond-forming reactions via α-alkylation of ketones, amides, and esters, using primary alcohols. β-Alkylation of secondary alcohols by primary alcohols to obtain α-alkylated ketones is also reported.

However, C. elegans is but one species among millions and the significance of this important model organism will only be fully revealed if it is placed in a rich evolutionary context. Global sampling efforts have led to the discovery of over 50 putative species from the genus Caenorhabditis, many of which await formal species description. Here, we present species descriptions for 10 new Caenorhabditis species. We also present draft genome sequences for nine of these new species, along with a transcriptome assembly for one. We exploit these whole-genome data to reconstruct the Caenorhabditis phylogeny and use this phylogenetic tree to dissect the evolution of morphology in the genus. We reveal extensive variation in genome size and investigate the molecular processes that underlie this variation. We show unexpected complexity in the evolutionary history of key developmental pathway genes. These new species and the associated genomic resources will be essential in our attempts to understand the evolutionary origins of the C. elegans model.",Experimentally reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling in adulthood extends lifespan of parents and improves Darwinian fitness of their offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007945,Evolution letters,2019 04 24,"Classical theory maintains that ageing evolves via energy trade-offs between reproduction and survival leading to accumulation of unrepaired cellular damage with age. In contrast, the emerging new theory postulates that ageing evolves because of deleterious late-life hyper-function of reproduction-promoting genes leading to excessive biosynthesis in late-life. The hyper-function theory uniquely predicts that optimizing nutrient-sensing molecular signaling in adulthood can simultaneously postpone ageing and increase Darwinian fitness. Here, we show that reducing evolutionarily conserved insulin/IGF-1 nutrient-sensing signaling via daf-2 RNA interference (RNAi) fulfils this prediction in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Long-lived daf-2 RNAi parents showed normal fecundity as self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and improved late-life reproduction when mated to males. Remarkably, the offspring of daf-2 RNAi parents had higher Darwinian fitness across three different genotypes. Thus, reduced nutrient-sensing signaling in adulthood improves both parental longevity and offspring fitness supporting the emerging view that suboptimal gene expression in late-life lies at the heart of ageing.",Conflict within species determines the value of a mutualism between species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007944,Evolution letters,2019 04 24,"Mutually beneficial interactions between species play a key role in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function. Nevertheless, such mutualisms can erode into antagonistic interactions. One explanation is that the fitness costs and benefits of interacting with a partner species vary among individuals. However, it is unclear why such variation exists. Here, we demonstrate that social behavior within species plays an important, though hitherto overlooked, role in determining the relative fitness to be gained from interacting with a second species. By combining laboratory experiments with field observations, we report that conflict within burying beetles Nicrophorus vespilloides influences the fitness that can be gained from interacting with the mite Poecilochirus carabi. Beetles transport these mites to carrion, upon which both species breed. We show that mites help beetles win intraspecific contests for this scarce resource: mites raise beetle body temperature, which enhances beetle competitive prowess. However, mites confer this benefit only upon smaller beetles, which are otherwise condemned by their size to lose contests for carrion. Larger beetles need no assistance to win a carcass and then lose reproductive success when breeding alongside mites. Thus, the extent of mutualism is dependent on an individual's inability to compete successfully and singlehandedly with conspecifics. Mutualisms degrade into antagonism when interactions with a partner species start to yield a net fitness loss, rather than a net fitness gain. This study suggests that interactions with conspecifics determine where this tipping point lies.",Host defense triggers rapid adaptive radiation in experimentally evolving parasites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007943,Evolution letters,2019 04 24,"Adaptive radiation occurs when the members of a single lineage evolve different adaptive forms in response to selection imposed by competitors or predators. Iconic examples include Darwin's finches, Caribbean anoles, and Hawaiian silverswords, all of which live on islands. Although adaptive radiation is thought to be an important generator of biodiversity, most studies concern groups that have already diversified. Here, we take the opposite approach. We experimentally triggered diversification in the descendants of a single population of host-specific parasites confined to different host ""islands."" We show rapid adaptive divergence of experimentally evolving feather lice in response to preening, which is a bird's main defense against ectoparasites. We demonstrate that host defense exerts strong phenotypic selection for crypsis in lice transferred to different colored rock pigeons (Columba livia). During four years of experimental evolution (∼60 generations), the lice evolved heritable differences in color. Strikingly, the observed color differences spanned the range of phenotypes found among congeneric lice adapted to other species of birds. To our knowledge, this is the first real-time demonstration that microevolution is fast enough to simulate millions of years of macroevolutionary change. Our results further indicate that host-mediated selection triggers rapid divergence in the adaptive radiation of parasites, which are among the most diverse organisms on Earth.",Anatomy of the Ediacaran rangeomorph Charnia masoni.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007942,Papers in palaeontology,2019 04 24,"The Ediacaran macrofossil Charnia masoni Ford is perhaps the most iconic member of the Rangeomorpha: a group of seemingly sessile, frondose organisms that dominates late Ediacaran benthic, deep-marine fossil assemblages.

We present an analysis of C. masoni that evaluates specimens from the UK, Canada and Russia, representing the largest morphological study of this taxon to date. We describe substantial morphological variation within C. masoni and present a new morphological model for this species that has significant implications both for interpretation of rangeomorph architecture, and potentially for existing taxonomic schemes. Previous reconstructions of Charnia include assumptions regarding the presence of structures seen in other rangeomorphs (e.g. an internal stalk) and of homogeneity in higher order branch morphology; observations that are not borne out by our investigations. We describe variation in the morphology of third and fourth order branches, as well as variation in gross structure near the base of the frond. The diagnosis of Charnia masoni is emended to take account of these new features.

In this study, we evaluated its functionality in the assessment of flow dynamics of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) through ICG videoangiography under clinical settings. ICG videoangiography was performed in the exposed AVM in eight patients undergoing surgery. FLOW800 analysis was applied directly, and gray-scale and color-coded maps of the surgical field were obtained. After surgery, a region of interest was placed on the individual vessels to obtain time-intensity curves. Parameters of flow dynamics, including the maximum intensity, transit time, and cerebral blood flow index, were calculated using the curves. The color-coded maps provided high-resolution images; however, reconstruction of colored images was restricted by the depth, approach angle, and brain swelling. Semi-quantitative parameters were similar among the feeders, niduses, and drainers.

In this review, we provide an extensive overview of the results obtained from a variety of neuroimaging studies on the neural correlates of amodal completion. We discuss whether low-level and high-level cortical areas are implicated in amodal completion; provide an overview of how amodal completion unfolds over time while dissociating feedforward, recurrent, and feedback processes; and discuss how amodal completion is represented at the neuronal level. The involvement of low-level visual areas such as V1 and V2 is not yet clear, while several high-level structures such as the lateral occipital complex and fusiform face area seem invariant to occlusion of objects and faces, respectively, and several motor areas seem to code for object permanence. The variety of results on the timing of amodal completion hints to a mixture of feedforward, recurrent, and feedback processes. We discuss whether the invisible parts of the occluded object are represented as if they were visible, contrary to a high-level representation. While plenty of questions on amodal completion remain, this review presents an overview of the neuroimaging findings reported to date, summarizes several insights from computational models, and connects research of other perceptual completion processes such as modal completion. In all, it is suggested that amodal completion is the solution to deal with various types of incomplete retinal information, and highly depends on stimulus complexity and saliency, and therefore also give rise to a variety of observed neural patterns."

Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is a glycoprotein needed for the entry of enveloped influenza viruses into host cells and is a potential target for anti-influenza humoral immune responses. In recent years, a number of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been isolated, and their relative structural information obtained from the crystallization of influenza antigens in complex with bnAbs has provided some new insights into future influenza vaccine research. Here, we review the current knowledge of the HA-targeted bnAbs and the structure-based mechanisms contributing to neutralization.

Throughout this time, the notion of informed consent has shifted tremendously, both due to advances in medicine, as well as the type of data being gathered. As such, informed consent has misaligned with the goals of medical research. It is becoming more and more vital to address this chasm, and begin building new frameworks to link this disconnect. Thus, we address three goals in this paper. First, we discuss the history of informed consent and unify the varying definitions of the term. Second, we evaluate the current research on the topic, classify them into themes, and attend to the problems therein. Lastly, we employ these themes of informed consent research mentioned previously to provide guidance and insight for future research in the arena.","Computational Prediction of MoRFs, Short Disorder-to-order Transitioning Protein Binding Regions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007871,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2019 04 24,"Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are short protein-binding regions that undergo disorder-to-order transitions (induced folding) upon binding protein partners. These regions are abundant in nature and can be predicted from protein sequences based on their distinctive sequence signatures. This first-of-its-kind survey covers 14 MoRF predictors and six related methods for the prediction of short protein-binding linear motifs, disordered protein-binding regions and semi-disordered regions. We show that the development of MoRF predictors has accelerated in the recent years. These predictors depend on machine learning-derived models that were generated using training datasets where MoRFs are annotated using putative disorder. Our analysis reveals that they generate accurate predictions. We identified eight methods that offer area under the ROC curve (AUC) ≥ 0.7 on experimentally-validated test datasets. We show that modern MoRF predictors accurately find experimentally annotated MoRFs even though they were trained using the putative disorder annotations. They are relatively highly-cited, particularly the methods available as webservers that on average secure three times more citations than methods without this option. MoRF predictions contribute to the experimental discovery of protein-protein interactions, annotation of protein functions and computational analysis of a variety of proteomes, protein families, and pathways. We outline future development and application directions for these tools, stressing the importance to develop novel tools that would target interactions of disordered regions with other types of partners.",Treatment According to Molecular Profiling in Relapsed/Refractory Cancer Patients: A Review Focusing on Latest Profiling Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007870,Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2019 04 24,"In this review we aim to summarize studies investigating the impact of a molecular profiling (MP)-guided treatment approach in heavily pretreated cancer patients. In summary, many independent single- and multicenter studies showed a significant benefit of MP-guided treatment regarding response rates and survival. However, in the only randomized trial conducted so far, no benefit of MP-guided targeted therapy was observed. Notably, various profiling approaches were conducted in the respective studies: some studies used a single analytic approach (i.e. next-generation sequencing), others applied multiple analytic methods to perform comprehensive molecular profiling. It seems that multiplatform profiling analyses, detected an increased number of druggable molecular targets or signaling pathway alterations and that a higher proportion of patients was treated according to the molecular cancer profile. Even though no randomized study has shown a benefit of molecular profiling so far, many studies indicate that MP-guided treatment can be beneficial in patients with relapsed and/or refractory cancer. Currently ongoing large randomized trials (i.e. NCI-MATCH, TAPUR) will add evidence to the role of profiling-guided cancer treatment.",Psychometric evaluation of the Hamburg Nightmare Questionnaire (HNQ).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007869,European journal of psychotraumatology,2019 04 24,"Background: Nightmares are a widespread phenomenon. In comparison to the general population, they occur in mentally ill and especially in traumatized individuals with an increased frequency. Despite the high prevalence, there is no short questionnaire in the German language that is able to characterize nightmares, to differentiate between different nightmare types and to assess their impact on daytime functioning. Objective: The Hamburg Nightmare Questionnaire (HNQ) has been developed as a short self-rating instrument to fill this gap. Method: Psychometric characteristics of the HNQ were evaluated in a sample of 707 German soldiers passing through the standard diagnostics of the Center for Mental Health at the German Armed Forces Hospital Hamburg. Results: The results of this study show satisfactory psychometric characteristics as a sound factorial structure and adequate internal consistency for the HNQ as well as initial indications of the construct validity of its subscales. Conclusions: The HNQ is a reliable and economic tool for the assessment of posttraumatic nightmares in clinical as well as research settings.","The effectiveness of narrative exposure therapy: a review, meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007868,European journal of psychotraumatology,2019 04 24,"Background: Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is a short-term psychological treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that has been investigated in various contexts among traumatized refugees and other trauma survivors. Sustained treatment results have been reported, but the methodological quality of the trials needs a more thorough examination. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of NET for survivors of trauma, using a quality assessment, an updated meta-analysis, and a meta-regression analysis. Method: Following a systematic literature selection, the methodological quality of the included studies was assessed; Non-controlled and controlled effect sizes (Hedges' g) were estimated using a random effects model. Predictor analyses were performed. Non-controlled effect sizes for PTSD and depression included symptom change at post-treatment and follow-up time-points. Controlled effect sizes included post-treatment comparisons of NET with non-active and active comparators: both trauma-focused (TF) and non-trauma-focused (non-TF) interventions. Results: The selected studies showed high external validity; methodological quality was equivalent to other guideline-supported TF interventions. In 16 randomized controlled trials, involving 947 participants, large non-controlled effect sizes were found for PTSD symptoms, at post-treatment (g = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [0.87; 1.50]) and follow-up (g = 1.37 [0.96; 1.77]). For depression symptoms, medium non-controlled effect sizes were found, at post-treatment (g = 0.47 [0.23; 0.71]) and follow-up (g = 0.60 [0.26; 0.94]). Post-treatment, NET outperformed non-active comparators and non-TF active comparators for PTSD, but not the combined active comparators. For depression, NET only outperformed non-active comparators. Advancing age predicted better treatment results for PTSD and depression symptoms; a history of migration predicted smaller treatment results for depression symptoms. Conclusions:The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that patients and providers may expect sustained treatment results from NET. Controlled comparisons with other guideline-supported TF interventions are not yet available.",Metatranscriptomic analysis of an in vitro biofilm model reveals strain-specific interactions among multiple bacterial species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007867,Journal of oral microbiology,2019 04 24,"Interactions among bacteria can affect biofilm properties. Method: Here, we investigated the role of different bacteria in functional dysbiosis of an in vitro polymicrobial subgingival plaque model using both 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic sequencing. Results: We found that high-virulence Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 had greater effects on the symbiotic species than the low-virulence P. gingivalis ATCC33277, and that Prevotella intermedia exacerbated the effects of W83. P. gingivalis significantly influenced the expression of genes related to metabolic pathways and quorum sensing of commensal oral species in a strain-specific manner. P. intermedia exerted synergistic effects with P. gingivalis W83 but antagonistic effects with strain ATCC33277, which may regulate the expression of virulence factors of P. gingivalis through the clp regulator. Discussion: The interaction networks indicated that the strongest correlation was between Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis, which demonstrated their bridge and cornerstone roles in biofilm. Changes in the expression of genes relating to outer membrane proteins in F. nucleatum indicated that the addition of different bacteria can interfere with the co-adherence among F. nucleatum and other partners. Conclusion: We report here the existence of strain-specific interactions in subgingival plaque, which may enhance our understanding of periodontal micro-ecology and facilitate the development of improved plaque control strategies.",Characterization of the phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase pathway for ATP production in Porphyromonas gingivalis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007866,Journal of oral microbiology,2019 04 24,"Acetyl phosphate (AcP) is generally produced from acetyl coenzyme A by phosphotransacetylase (Pta), and subsequent reaction with ADP, catalyzed by acetate kinase (Ack), produces ATP. The mechanism of ATP production in Porphyromonas gingivalis is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular basis of the Pta-Ack pathway in this microorganism. Pta and Ack from P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 were enzymatically and structurally characterized. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that Pta is a dimer with two substrate-binding sites in each subunit. Ack is also dimeric, with a catalytic cleft in each subunit, and structural analysis indicates a dramatic domain motion that opens and closes the cleft during catalysis. ATP formation by Ack proceeds via a sequential mechanism. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis demonstrated that the pta (PGN_1179) and ack (PGN_1178) genes, tandemly located in the genome, are cotranscribed as an operon. Inactivation of pta or ack in P. gingivalis by homologous recombination was successful only when the inactivated gene was expressed in trans. Therefore, both pta and ack genes are essential for this microorganism. Insights into the Pta-Ack pathway reported herein would be helpful to understand the energy acquisition in P. gingivalis.",Biomedical applications of mRNA nanomedicine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007865,Nano research,2019 04 26,"As an attractive alternative to plasmid DNA, messenger RNA (mRNA) has recently emerged as a promising class of nucleic acid therapeutics for biomedical applications.

IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,2019 04 26,"Manifold-based models have been recently exploited for accelerating dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). While manifold-based models have shown to be more efficient than conventional low-rank approaches, joint low-rank and sparsity-aware modeling still appears to be very efficient due to the inherent sparsity within dMR images. In this paper, we propose a joint manifold-learning and sparsity-aware framework for dMRI. The proposed method establishes a link between the recently developed manifold models and conventional sparsity-aware models. Dynamic MR images are modeled as points located on or close to a smooth manifold, and a novel data-driven manifold-learning approach, which preserves affine relation among images, is used to learn the low-dimensional embedding of the dynamic images. The temporal basis learnt from such an approach efficiently captures the inherent periodicity of dynamic images and hence sparsity along temporal direction is enforced during reconstruction. The proposed framework is validated by extensive numerical tests on phantom and in-vivo data sets.",THE FOURIER RADIAL ERROR SPECTRUM PLOT: A MORE NUANCED QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION OF IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION QUALITY.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007839,Proceedings. IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging,2019 04 26,"In the modern biomedical image reconstruction literature, the quality of a reconstructed image is often numerically quantified using scalar error measures such as mean-squared error or the structural similarity index. While such measures provide a rough summary of image quality, they also suffer from well-known limitations. For example, a substantial amount of information is necessarily lost whenever the characteristics of a high-dimensional image are summarized by a single number. In this work, we introduce the Fourier radial Error Spectrum Plot (ESP), which provides a novel and more nuanced assessment of error by decomposing the error into its different spatial frequency components. The usefulness of ESP is illustrated in the context of MRI reconstruction from under-sampled data. In addition, we demonstrate that the extra dimension of insight provided by ESP can be used to improve the performance of existing image reconstruction techniques.","Updates to the Noah Land Surface Model in WRF-CMAQ to Improve Simulated Meteorology, Air Quality, and Deposition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007838,Journal of advances in modeling earth systems,2019 04 24,"Regional, state, and local environmental regulatory agencies often use Eulerian models to investigate the potential impacts on pollutant deposition and air quality from changes in land use, anthropogenic and natural emissions, and climate. The Noah land surface model (LSM) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is widely used with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model for such investigations, but there are many inconsistencies that need to be changed so that they are consistent with dry deposition and emission processes. In this work, the Noah LSM in WRFv3.8.1 is improved in its linkage to CMAQv5.2 by adding important parameters to the WRF/Noah output, updating the WRF soil and vegetation reference tables that influence CMAQ wet and dry photochemical deposition processes, and decreasing WRF/Noah's top soil layer depth to be consistent with CMAQ processes (e.g., windblown dust and bidirectional ammonia exchange). The modified WRF/Noah-CMAQ system (both off-line and coupled) impacts meteorological predictions of 2-m temperature (T2; increases and decreases), 2-m mixing ratio (Q2; decreases), and 10-m wind speed (WSPD10; decreases) in the United States. These changes are mostly driven by leaf area index values and aerodynamic roughness lengths updated in the vegetation tables based on satellite data, with additional impacts from soil tables updated based on recent soil data. Improvements in the consistency in the treatment of land surface processes between CMAQ and WRF resulted in improvements in both estimated meteorological (e.g., T2, WSPD10, and latent heat fluxes) and chemical (e.g., ozone, sulfur dioxide, and windblown dust) model estimates.","On the Interplay Between Convective Aggregation, Surface Temperature Gradients, and Climate Sensitivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007836,Journal of advances in modeling earth systems,2019 04 24,"This study explores the extent to which convective aggregation interacts with sea surface temperature (SST) and affects climate sensitivity. For this purpose, radiative-convective equilibrium simulations are run with a general circulation model coupled to an ocean mixed layer, and several types of perturbations are imposed to the ocean-atmosphere system. Convective aggregation turns out to be much more sensitive to temperature in coupled experiments than in prescribed SST experiments. But changes in convective aggregation induced by a doubling of the CO2 concentration are always smaller than changes associated with the transition from a non-aggregated to an aggregated state. If aggregation changes were acting alone, they would exert a strong negative feedback on global mean surface temperature. However, in a coupled framework, aggregation changes interact with the SST and generate SST gradients that strengthen the positive low-cloud feedback associated with changes in SST pattern. This overcompensates the negative feedback due to aggregation changes and leads to a larger equilibrium climate sensitivity than in the absence of SST gradients. Although this effect might be model specific, interactions between convective aggregation and the spatial distribution of SST appear crucial to assess the impact of convective aggregation on climate sensitivity.",Thinning Can Reduce Losses in Carbon Use Efficiency and Carbon Stocks in Managed Forests Under Warmer Climate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007835,Journal of advances in modeling earth systems,2019 04 24,"Forest carbon use efficiency (CUE, the ratio of net to gross primary productivity) represents the fraction of photosynthesis that is not used for plant respiration. Although important, it is often neglected in climate change impact analyses. Here we assess the potential impact of thinning on projected carbon cycle dynamics and implications for forest CUE and its components (i.e., gross and net primary productivity and plant respiration), as well as on forest biomass production. Using a detailed process-based forest ecosystem model forced by climate outputs of five Earth System Models under four representative climate scenarios, we investigate the sensitivity of the projected future changes in the autotrophic carbon budget of three representative European forests. We focus on changes in CUE and carbon stocks as a result of warming, rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, and forest thinning. Results show that autotrophic carbon sequestration decreases with forest development, and the decrease is faster with warming and in unthinned forests. This suggests that the combined impacts of climate change and changing CO2 concentrations lead the forests to grow faster, mature earlier, and also die younger. In addition, we show that under future climate conditions, forest thinning could mitigate the decrease in CUE, increase carbon allocation into more recalcitrant woody pools, and reduce physiological-climate-induced mortality risks. Altogether, our results show that thinning can improve the efficacy of forest-based mitigation strategies and should be carefully considered within a portfolio of mitigation options.",WISHE-Moisture Mode in an Aquaplanet Simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007834,Journal of advances in modeling earth systems,2019 04 26,"This study aims to understand the nature of the tropical intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) in an aquaplanet simulation performed using Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's AM2.1 with a uniform sea surface temperature within the deep tropics. The simulated ISO resembles the observed Madden-Julian Oscillation in that the spectral peak in precipitation appears at zonal wave number 1 and a period of ~60 days. Vertically integrated moist static energy budget of the simulated ISO shows that enhanced latent heat flux to the east of anomalously active convection causes eastward propagation of the ISO mode, which is weakly opposed by horizontal moisture advection. A series of mechanism denial experiments are conducted either by homogenizing select variables-surface wind stress, longwave radiative heating, and surface evaporation-with their zonal means from the control simulation or by suppressing free-tropospheric moisture variation. Results of the mechanism denial experiments show that the simulated ISO disappears when the interactive surface evaporation is disabled, suggesting that the wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) mechanism is essential to the simulated ISO. Longwave cloud-radiation feedbacks and moisture-convection feedbacks affect horizontal scale and phase speed of the simulated ISO, respectively. Our results strongly suggest that the simulated ISO is the linear WISHE-moisture mode of Fuchs and Raymond under horizontally uniform boundary conditions.",Suppression of Gut Bacterial Translocation Ameliorates Vascular Calcification through Inhibiting Toll-Like Receptor 9-Mediated BMP-2 Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007833,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 04 24,"Vascular calcification (VC) is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients; thus, effective therapeutic targets are urgently needed to be explored.

Damage to mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA accumulates with age in the postmitotic retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which could lead to RPE cell death and trigger disease. One possible mechanism for cells to avoid cell death is mitophagy, the targeted clearance of damaged mitochondria by autophagy. Here, we induced mitochondrial damage in human RPE cells (ARPE-19 and hRPE), using antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III of the electron transport chain, and investigated cellular viability, mitochondrial structure and function, and autophagy activity. We observed that antimycin A evoked dose-dependent cell death, a rapid loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, and a collapse of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria appeared swollen and there was clear damage to their cristae structure. At the same time, cells were undergoing active autophagy and were sensitive to autophagy inhibition by bafilomycin A1 or chloroquine. These results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction can cause significant RPE damage and that autophagy is an important survival mechanism for cells suffering from mitochondrial damage.","Amyloid Peptide β1-42 Induces Integrin αIIbβ3 Activation, Platelet Adhesion, and Thrombus Formation in a NADPH Oxidase-Dependent Manner.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007831,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2019 04 24,"The progression of Alzheimer's dementia is associated with neurovasculature impairment, which includes inflammation, microthromboses, and reduced cerebral blood flow. Here, we investigate the effects of β amyloid peptides on the function of platelets, the cells driving haemostasis. Amyloid peptide β1-42 (Aβ1-42), Aβ1-40, and Aβ25-35 were tested in static adhesion experiments, and it was found that platelets preferentially adhere to Aβ1-42 compared to other Aβ peptides. In addition, significant platelet spreading was observed over Aβ1-42, while Aβ1-40, Aβ25-35, and the scAβ1-42 control did not seem to induce any platelet spreading, which suggested that only Aβ1-42 activates platelet signalling in our experimental conditions. Aβ1-42 also induced significant platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in whole blood under venous flow condition, while other Aβ peptides did not. The molecular mechanism of Aβ1-42 was investigated by flow cytometry, which revealed that this peptide induces a significant activation of integrin αIIbβ3, but does not induce platelet degranulation (as measured by P-selectin membrane translocation). Finally, Aβ1-42 treatment of human platelets led to detectable levels of protein kinase C (PKC) activation and tyrosine phosphorylation, which are hallmarks of platelet signalling. Interestingly, the NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor VAS2870 completely abolished Aβ1-42-dependent platelet adhesion in static conditions, thrombus formation in physiological flow conditions, integrin αIIbβ3 activation, and tyrosine- and PKC-dependent platelet signalling. In summary, this study highlights the importance of NOXs in the activation of platelets in response to amyloid peptide β1-42. The molecular mechanisms described in this manuscript may play an important role in the neurovascular impairment observed in Alzheimer's patients."

Supported cobalt metal nanoparticles next to a (very small) fraction of cobalt(II) titanate, which is an inactive phase for FTS, were detected, with no signs of re-oxidation of the supported cobalt metal nanoparticles during FTS at 523 K, 5 bar and 200 h, indicating that cobalt metal is maintained as the main active phase during FTS.",A Cptt-Based Trioxo-Rhenium Catalyst for the Deoxydehydration of Diols and Polyols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007775,ChemCatChem,2019 04 24,"Trioxo-rhenium complexes are well known catalysts for the deoxydehydration (DODH) of vicinal diols (glycols). In this work, we report on the DODH of diols and biomass-derived polyols using CpttReO3 as a new catalyst (Cptt=1,3-di-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl). The DODH reaction was optimized using 2 mol % of CpttReO3 and 3-octanol as both reductant and solvent. The CpttReO3 catalyst exhibits an excellent activity for biomass-derived polyols. Specifically, glycerol is almost quantitatively converted to allyl alcohol and mucic acid gives 75 % of muconates at 91 % conversion. In addition, the loading of CpttReO3 can be reduced to 0.1 mol % to achieve a turn-over number as high as 900 per Re when using glycerol as substrate. Examination of DODH reaction profiles by NMR spectroscopy indicates that catalysis is related to Cp-ligand release, which raises questions on the nature of the actual catalyst.",Electrochemical and Kinetic Insights into Molecular Water Oxidation Catalysts Derived from Cp*Ir(pyridine-alkoxide) Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007774,ChemCatChem,2019 04 24,"We report the solution-phase electrochemistry of seven half-sandwich iridium(III) complexes with varying pyridine-alkoxide ligands to quantify electronic ligand effects that translate to their activity in catalytic water oxidation. Our results unify some previously reported electrochemical data of Cp*Ir complexes by showing how the solution speciation determines the electrochemical response: cationic complexes show over 1 V higher redox potentials that their neutral forms in a distinct demonstration of charge accumulation effects relevant to water oxidation. Building on previous work that analysed the activation behaviour of our pyalk-ligated Cp*Ir complexes 1-7, we assess their catalytic oxygen evolution activity with sodium periodate (NaIO4) and ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in water and aqueous tBuOH solution. Mechanistic studies including H/D kinetic isotope effects and reaction progress kinetic analysis (RPKA) of oxygen evolution point to a dimer-monomer equilibrium of the IrIV resting state preceding a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) in the turnover-limiting step (TLS). Finally, true electrochemically driven water oxidation is demonstrated for all catalysts, revealing surprising trends in activity that do not correlate with those obtained using chemical oxidants.",Understanding the CO Oxidation on Pt Nanoparticles Supported on MOFs by Operando XPS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007773,ChemCatChem,2019 04 24,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are playing a key role in developing the next generation of heterogeneous catalysts. In this work, near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) is applied to study in operando the CO oxidation on Pt@MOFs (UiO-67) and Pt@ZrO2 catalysts, revealing the same Pt surface dynamics under the stoichiometric CO/O2 ambient at 3 mbar. Upon the ignition at ca. 200 °C, the signature Pt binding energy (BE) shift towards the lower BE (from 71.8 to 71.2 eV) is observed for all catalysts, confirming metallic Pt nanoparticles (NPs) as the active phase. Additionally, the plug-flow light-off experiments show the superior activity of the Pt@MOFs catalyst in CO oxidation than the control Pt@ZrO2 catalyst with ca. 28 % drop in the T50% light-off temperature, as well as high stability, due to their sintering-resistance feature. These results provide evidence that the uniqueness of MOFs as the catalyst supports lies in the structural confinement effect.",Degradation and Remodeling of Epitaxially Grown Collagen Fibrils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007771,Cellular and molecular bioengineering,2019 04 26,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tumor microenvironment contains high densities of collagen that are highly aligned, resulting in directional migration called contact guidance that facilitates efficient migration out of the tumor.

A useful concept introduced for Gaussian mixtures by Malsiner Walli et al. (Stat Comput 26:303-324, 2016) are sparse finite mixtures, where the prior distribution on the weight distribution of a mixture with K components is chosen in such a way that a priori the number of clusters in the data is random and is allowed to be smaller than K with high probability. The number of clusters is then inferred a posteriori from the data. The present paper makes the following contributions in the context of sparse finite mixture modelling. First, it is illustrated that the concept of sparse finite mixture is very generic and easily extended to cluster various types of non-Gaussian data, in particular discrete data and continuous multivariate data arising from non-Gaussian clusters. Second, sparse finite mixtures are compared to Dirichlet process mixtures with respect to their ability to identify the number of clusters. For both model classes, a random hyper prior is considered for the parameters determining the weight distribution. By suitable matching of these priors, it is shown that the choice of this hyper prior is far more influential on the cluster solution than whether a sparse finite mixture or a Dirichlet process mixture is taken into consideration.",Fatal and near-fatal thunderstorm asthma epidemic in a desert country.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007768,Annals of thoracic medicine,2019 04 24,"Reports of thunderstorm asthma in the Middle East are few.

The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), which are expressed in blood vessel endothelium, contribute to the mitigation of vascular endothelium-dependent dysfunction by aerobic exercise in prediabetes mellitus. A prediabetic rat model was established by feeding the rats an additional high-energy diet, and was confirmed by testing blood glucose levels, the area-under-the-curve for the blood glucose tests (P<0.05) and the changes to the histological morphology of the thoracic aorta. Further examination identified that NOS expression changed significantly between the control and prediabetes groups, indicating endothelial dysfunction in the prediabetic rats. Following aerobic exercise, a significant increase in NOS, endothelial (eNOS) mRNA and protein expression (P<0.05), and a significant decrease in NOS, inducible (iNOS) mRNA and protein expression (P<0.05) was identified in the prediabetic rats compared with the control group. No significant change in nitric oxide synthase, brain expression was observed in the prediabetic rat group compared with the control group. Notably, there was also a significant increase and decrease in eNOS and iNOS activity, respectively, in the prediabetes group compared with the control group (P<0.05). Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) concentration in the vascular endothelium was detected, which revealed a significant increase in NO concentration in the prediabetic rats following aerobic exercise compared with the control (P<0.05). The present study provided results that demonstrated that aerobic exercise ameliorated the vascular endothelium-dependent dysfunction through the NOS/NO signaling pathway, which is primarily regulated by NOS expression and activity, in prediabetes mellitus. The current study provided the theoretical basis for the use of exercise intervention to prevent diabetes mellitus during the early stage.",Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of characteristics of vascular invasion in intermediate and advanced hepatic alveolar echinococcosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007751,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"The objective of the present study was to provide a basis for the personalized treatment of intermediate and advanced hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE) by elucidating the characteristics of vascular invasion and lesion growth. A total of 160 patients with intermediate and advanced HAE who were subjected to plain as well as contrast-enhanced 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging prior to surgery were analyzed. Pathological and intra-operative observations of the subjects were also considered. The size and location of HAE lesions, vascular invasion characteristics and growth patterns were assessed. A total of 78 patients (48.75%) had lesions involving the S5-8 segment/partial right liver lobe, 21 (13.13%) had involvement in the S2-4 segment/partial left liver lobe and 61 (38.13%) had lesions that transcended the left and right liver lobes. Pathological examination revealed that the vascular invasion rates of the hepatic portal veins, intrahepatic veins (left, central and right vein, and inferior vena cava) and hepatic arteries were 51.88, 43.28 and 26.87%, respectively. Liver hilum invasion was observed in 128 patients (80.00%), 71 of which (44.38%) presented with invasion of the primary porta hepatis, 11 (6.88%) with invasion of the secondary porta hepatis and 46 (28.75%) with invasion of the primary as well as the secondary porta hepatis. In conclusion, the growth pattern of intermediate and advanced HAE is determined by the site, blood supply and activity of the lesion. The current study demonstrated that lesions tend to invade the intrahepatic venous system and porta hepatis, and to target veins rather than arteries.",Enhanced plasma miR-142-5p promotes the progression of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma via targeting PTEN.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007750,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression and specific role of microRNA (miR)-142-5p in the progression of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate miR-142-5p expression in patients with ICC and healthy control subjects. The results revealed that plasma miR-142-5p was significantly increased in patients with ICC compared with the control group. Furthermore, miR-142-5p was also increased in ICC tissues compared with adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. Compared with patients with Ta-T1 stage ICC, miR-142-5p was significantly elevated in patients with ICC ≥T2 stage. Patients with ICC at G3 stage had much higher plasma miR-142-5p levels compared with those at G1/2 stage. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that miR-142-5p could be used as a biomarker to differentiate patients with ICC from healthy controls. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that plasma miR-142-5p was negatively correlated with survival in patients with ICC. A dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-142-5p significantly suppressed the relative luciferase activity of pmirGLO-PTEN-3' untranslated region compared with the control group. In summary, the results of the present study provide novel data indicating that plasma miR-142-5p is significantly upregulated in patients with ICC. miR-142-5p may therefore have potential as a biomarker for screening patients with ICC from healthy controls.",Long-term results of liver transplantation for polycystic liver disease: Single-center experience in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007749,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"The aim of the present study was to explore the indications for and safety of orthotopic liver transplantation for polycystic liver disease (PLD). Orthotopic liver transplantation in 11 patients with PLD between May 2004 and September 2013 was retrospectively analyzed. Patient epidemiological, clinical and follow-up data were collected. The survival rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Over the 10-year period, 11 patients received orthotopic liver transplantation (n=9) and combined liver-kidney transplantation (n=2) for PLD. The recipients' median age was 56 years [(interquartile range (IQR), 52-57 years], and 7 of the patients (63.6%) were classified as having Gigot type II PLD and 4 (36.4%) as having Gigot type III. A total of 8 (72.7%) patients had a severely decreased quality of life (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score, ≥3). Only 3 cases (27.3%) were of Class C stage. The mean hospitalization duration was 45.4±15.3 days and the mean length of stay at the intensive care unit was 4.1±1.9 days. The peri-operative mortality was 18.2% and the morbidity was 54.5%. The median follow-up period was 111 months (IQR, 33-132 months). A total of 2 patients died of severe complications after combined liver-kidney transplantation. Furthermore, 1 patient died of ischemia cholangitis during the follow-up period. The actuarial 1-, 5- and 10-year survival rate during the follow-up period was 81.8, 81.8 and 65.5%, respectively. The mean physical component summary score was 87.1±6.9 and the mean mental component summary score was 81.5±6.4. In conclusion, liver transplantation is the only curative procedure for PLD, and the present study indicated that it is relatively and safe and leads to good long-term prognosis and high quality of life. Based on our experience and results, liver transplantation is a primary option for cases of PLD with progressive or advanced symptomatic disease where previous other forms of therapy to palliate symptoms have been insufficient.",Prediction of seed gene function in progressive diabetic neuropathy by a network-based inference method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007748,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"Guilt by association (GBA) algorithm has been widely used to statistically predict gene functions, and network-based approach increases the confidence and veracity of identifying molecular signatures for diseases. This work proposed a network-based GBA method by integrating the GBA algorithm and network, to identify seed gene functions for progressive diabetic neuropathy (PDN). The inference of predicting seed gene functions comprised of three steps: i) Preparing gene lists and sets; ii) constructing a co-expression matrix (CEM) on gene lists by Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) method and iii) predicting gene functions by GBA algorithm. Ultimately, seed gene functions were selected according to the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) index. A total of 79 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 40 background gene ontology (GO) terms were regarded as gene lists and sets for the subsequent analyses, respectively. The predicted results obtained from the network-based GBA approach showed that 27.5% of all gene sets had a good classified performance with AUC >0.5. Most significantly, 3 gene sets with AUC >0.6 were denoted as seed gene functions for PDN, including binding, molecular function and regulation of the metabolic process. In summary, we predicted 3 seed gene functions for PDN compared with non-progressors utilizing network-based GBA algorithm. The findings provide insights to reveal pathological and molecular mechanism underlying PDN.",Downregulation of lncRNA BANCR participates in the development of retinopathy among diabetic patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007747,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"The long non-coding (lnc)RNA B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase-activated non-protein coding RNA (BANCR) is a well-characterized oncogene, while its potential functions in other diseases remain elusive. In the present study, the possible association of BANCR with diabetic retinopathy was investigated. A total of 244 patients with diabetes were followed up every 6 months for 8 years to record the occurrence of retinopathy. A total of 38 patients developed diabetic retinopathy. During the follow-up, the plasma levels of lncRNA BANCR decreased in those patients with diabetic retinopathy but not in those with other complications or without any complications. The plasma levels of lncRNA BANCR at 12 months prior to the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy are able to sufficiently distinguish diabetic retinopathy patients from healthy controls and diabetic patients without any obvious complications. In vitro, high-glucose treatment failed to affect the expression of lncRNA BANCR in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19. However, lncRNA BANCR overexpression inhibited the apoptosis of ARPE-19 cells under high-glucose conditions. Therefore, it is indicated that lncRNA BANCR participates in the development of retinopathy in diabetic patients through its regulatory role in cell apoptosis, and may serve as a novel prognostic indicator and therapeutic target.",miRNA-766 induces apoptosis of human colon cancer cells through the p53/Bax signaling pathway by MDM4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007746,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"miRNAs are closely associated with tumor genesis and development. The present study investigated the role of the expression of miRNA-766 in the survival of patients with colon cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and microarray analysis were used to analyze the expression of miRNA-766. The results revealed that the expression of miRNA-766 was decreased in patients with colon cancer. The overall survival and disease-free survival rates of patients with colon cancer with a high expression of miRNA-766 were prolonged, compared with those with a low expression of miRNA-766. The overexpression of miRNA-766 reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells through suppression of the MDM4/p53 pathway. By contrast, the downregulation of miRNA-766 promoted cell growth and reduced apoptosis in colon cancer cells through activation of the MDM4/p53 pathway. The promotion of MDM4 attenuated the anticancer effect of miRNA-766 in colon cancer cells. These results demonstrated that miRNA-766 induced cell apoptosis in human colon cancer through MDM4/p53.",Identification of key candidate genes and pathways in oral squamous cell carcinoma by integrated Bioinformatics analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007745,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common types of malignant head and neck tumor, which poses a serious threat to human health. In recent years, the incidence of OSCC has been increasing, while the prognosis has not significantly improved. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of OSCC may provide novel therapeutic strategies. In the present study, the gene expression profiles from 4 datasets, including 244 OSCC and 95 normal oral mucosa samples, were subjected to statistical and Bioinformatics analysis. A total of 34 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, among which 14 were upregulated and 20 were downregulated in OSCC compared with normal oral mucosa tissues. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were mainly involved in regulation of the immune response, cell adhesion and cell proliferative processes. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly associated with the phosphoinositide-3 kinase Akt and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The key candidate DEGs were identified from the complex protein-protein interaction network, and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), integrin subunit α 3 and plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU) were confirmed to be significantly associated with the survival rate. Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell assays demonstrated that SPP1 and PLAU regulate cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The candidate genes/pathways identified in the present study may include promising diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for OSCC.",Downregulated expression of CFHL1 is associated with unfavorable prognosis in postoperative patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007744,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"Complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHL1) was recently reported to be a potential biomarker in several types of cancer. CFHL1, however, has not been found to be of prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to date. In the present study, the expression levels of CFHL1 were evaluated in 8 pairs fresh frozen tissue samples using western blotting. Furthermore, the expression level of CFHL1 was evaluated in 76 pairs of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) HCC and peritumoral tissues (expression pattern cohort), and 278 FFPE HCC tissues (prognostic cohort) using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry. The Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression proportional hazard model and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were used to evaluate prognostic factors. The expression level of CFHL1 was reduced in HCC tissues in 67.1% (51/76) of the cases compared with the corresponding peritumoral tissues. Survival analyses indicated that patients with HCC with low CFHL1 expression had a worse time-to-recurrence (TTR) and overall survival (OS) compared with those with high CFHL1 expression in the prognostic cohort (P=0.002 for OS and P=0.017 for TTR). Both univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that CHFL1 was an independent prognostic factor for TTR and OS (P=0.017 and P=0.002, respectively). In addition, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Human Protein Atlas were used for further validation. Furthermore, a prognostic model included tumor size, tumor number, liver cirrhosis and CFHL1 expression was evaluated. The results of the present study demonstrated that CFHL1 was downregulated in HCC and its level was associated with patient prognosis; therefore, CFHL1 is a potential prognostic marker for HCC.",H2S attenuates sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007743,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"The heart is the most vulnerable target organ in sepsis, and it has been previously reported that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has a protective role in heart dysfunction caused by sepsis. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway has a protective function during sepsis. However, the potential association between H2S and PI3K/Akt in sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction is unclear. Therefore, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used to investigate the role of PI3K/Akt signaling in the protective effects of H2S during sepsis-induced myocardial injury. A rat sepsis model was established using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery. Sodium hydrosulfide, a H2S donor, was administered intraperitoneally (8.9 µmol/kg), and serum myocardial enzyme levels, inflammatory cytokine levels, cardiac histology and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were assessed to determine the extent of myocardial damage. The results demonstrated that exogenous H2S reduced serum myocardial enzyme levels, decreased the levels of the inflammatory factors tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, and increased the level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 following CLP. Staining of histological sections demonstrated that myocardial damage and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were alleviated by the administration of exogenous H2S. Western blot analysis was used to detect phosphorylated and total PI3K and Akt levels, as well as NF-κB, B-cell lymphoma-2, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase levels, and the results demonstrated that H2S significantly increased PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. This indicated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was activated by H2S. Additionally, H2S reduced Bax and caspase expression, indicating that apoptosis was inhibited, and decreased NF-κB levels, indicating that inflammation was reduced. Furthermore, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 eliminated the protective effects of H2S. In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that exogenous H2S activates PI3K/Akt signaling to attenuate myocardial damage in sepsis."

Therefore, the development of alternative therapeutic agents for the treatment of SCI is of great clinical significance. In the present study, an acute SCI rat model was induced and, following a modified Allen method, the function of pectolinarigenin (PG) in SCI was investigated. A total of 36 rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=6 in each group); a sham surgery group and an SCI + saline group were used as negative controls and an SCI + MP (30 mg/kg) group was used as a positive control. The remaining animals were subdivided into three groups: SCI + PG (10 mg/kg); SCI + PG (30 mg/kg); and SCI + PG (50 mg/kg). Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan locomotor rating scoring was performed to assess functional recovery. Nissl staining and TUNEL staining were used to evaluated neuronal lesion volume and apoptosis, respectively. The results demonstrated that PG significantly improved functional recovery and reduced tissue loss, and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, a western blotting assay was conducted to measure the expression of genes associated with apoptosis. The data suggested that PG downregulated the activated caspase-3, caspase-9 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase expression and reduced the Bax: Bcl2 ratio. The findings of the present study suggested that PG may exert a protective effect against SCI in rats, potentially by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and PG may therefore serve as a novel therapeutic agent against SCI.",Role of macrophages in experimental liver injury and repair in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007731,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"Liver macrophages make up the largest proportion of tissue macrophages in the host and consist of two dissimilar groups: Kupffer cells (KCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMø). As the liver is injured, KCs sense the injury and initiate inflammatory cascades mediated by the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Subsequently, inflammatory monocytes accumulate in the liver via chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions, resulting in massive inflammatory MoMø infiltration. When live r injury ceases, restorative macrophages, derived from recruited inflammatory monocytes (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus Chi monocytes), promote the resolution of hepatic damage and fibrosis. Consequently, a large number of studies have assessed the mechanisms by which liver macrophages exert their opposing functions at different time-points during liver injury. The present review primarily focuses on the diverse functions of macrophages in experimental liver injury, fibrosis and repair in mice and illustrates how macrophages may be targeted to treat liver disease.",Denitrase activity of Debaryomyces hansenii reduces the oxidized compound 3-nitrotyrosine in mice liver with colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007730,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"The oxidation of tyrosine to 3-nitrotyrosine is irreversible, and due to this characteristic, 3-nitrotyrosine is used as a marker for oxidative stress in a range of diverse chronic and degenerative diseases. It has been established that the yeast Debaryomyces hansenii (D. hansenii) can assimilate free 3-nitrotyrosine as unique source of nitrogen, and during saline stress, has a high denitrase activity to detoxify this compound in a reaction that involves the liberation of nitrogen dioxide from 3-nitrotyrosine. However, until now it has not been determined whether D. hansenii can detoxify protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine such as nitrated proteins present in different chronic illnesses. TThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the denitrase activity of D. hansenii to reduce 3-nitrotyrosine from liver proteins of mice with colitis. Firstly, the levels of reactive oxygen species of liver tissue of colitic and control mice were measured by the reaction with the 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Denitrase activity of D. hansenii was evaluated by incubating cell extracts of the yeast with protein extracts from livers of mice with colitis. Following incubation, 3-nitrotyrosine was measured, and to corroborate that denitrase reaction had occurred, the production of nitrites was measured. In samples of liver tissue from mice with colitis, the maximum levels of reactive oxygen species were up to two times higher compared with the control livers. Following the incubation of colitic liver samples with cell extracts of D. hansenii, it was observed that 3-nitrotyrosine decreased to the basal concentration of control liver samples, and that the concentration of nitrites was increased. These results indicate that denitrase of D. hansenii extracts can effectively detoxify 3-nitrotyrosine bound to proteins and that the extracts could be used to decrease protein oxidation damage in chronic degenerative diseases.",Investigation of transcriptome mechanism associated with osteoporosis explored by microarray analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007729,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2019 04 24,"Microarray data of osteoporosis (OP) were analyzed based on prediction of transcription factors (TFs) or their targets as well as influences of TFs or TF network to uncover key TFs in OP. The microarray data E-GEOD-35956 was downloaded from the GPL570 platform. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with logarithm of fold change (|logFC|) >2 and P-value <0.05 were identified between OP samples and normal controls. TF genes were screened from the DEGs based on ITFP, Marbach 2016, TRRUST databases. TF targets were enriched from DEGs using Fisher's exact test. TF targets were selected based on their impact factors. TF targets were chosen from TF network analysis. Finally, key TFs were identified by based on TFs coverage. A total of 300 DEGs were obtained. There were no TF genes screened from the DEGs. In total 165, 87 and 178 TF targets were screened from DEGs respectively based on Fisher's exact test, influence of TFs or TF network analysis. According to the optimal TF set with TFs having maximum coverage of DEGs, 178 TF targets was the most. Thus, the optimal sets of TFs were FOXO1, KLF16, RXRA, RARA, HNF4A, CEBPB, ESR1, SOX8, ZNF219, and SP1. Altogether, these results suggested identified crucial TFs in OP might play a significant role in OP development, showing these key TFs probably would aid in unveiling the underlying molecular mechanisms and may be therapeutic targets, diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for OP.",Subtype classification and functional annotation of L1Md retrotransposon promoters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007728,Mobile DNA,2019 04 26,"L1Md retrotransposons are the most abundant and active transposable elements in the mouse genome. The promoters of many L1Md retrotransposons are composed of tandem repeats called monomers. The number of monomers varies between retrotransposon copies, thus making it difficult to annotate L1Md promoters. Duplication of monomers contributes to the maintenance of L1Md promoters during truncation-prone retrotranspositions, but the associated mechanism remains unclear. Since the current classification of monomers is based on limited data, a comprehensive monomer annotation is needed for supporting functional studies of L1Md promoters genome-wide.",Interactions between vitamin D binding protein variants and major dietary patterns on the odds of metabolic syndrome and its components in apparently healthy adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007727,Diabetology & metabolic syndrome,2019 04 24,"Recent studies have shown that the risks of chronic diseases resulting from high-risk alleles, such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome (MetS), can be affected by various dietary patterns.

Climate change,2019 04 24,"The varied effects of recent extreme weather events around the world exemplify the uneven impacts of climate change on populations, even within relatively small geographic regions. Differential human vulnerability to environmental hazards results from a range of social, economic, historical, and political factors, all of which operate at multiple scales. While adaptation to climate change has been the dominant focus of policy and research agendas, it is essential to ask as well why some communities and peoples are disproportionately exposed to and affected by climate threats. The cases and synthesis presented here are organized around four key themes (resource access, governance, culture, and knowledge), which we approach from four social science fields (cultural anthropology, archaeology, human geography, and sociology). Social scientific approaches to human vulnerability draw vital attention to the root causes of climate change threats and the reasons that people are forced to adapt to them. Because vulnerability is a multidimensional process rather than an unchanging state, a dynamic social approach to vulnerability is most likely to improve mitigation and adaptation planning efforts. This article is categorized under:Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change > Values-Based Approach to Vulnerability and Adaptation.",Soil N2O emissions with different reduced tillage methods during the establishment of Miscanthus in temperate grassland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007725,Global change biology. Bioenergy,2019 04 24,"An increase in renewable energy and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops is expected in order to meet global greenhouse gas (GHG) targets. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas, and this paper addresses a knowledge gap concerning soil N2O emissions over the possible ""hot spot"" of land use conversion from established pasture to the biofuel crop Miscanthus. The work aims to quantify the impacts of this land use change on N2O fluxes using three different cultivation methods. Three replicates of four treatments were established: Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) planted without tillage; Mxg planted with light tillage; a novel seed-based Miscanthus hybrid planted with light tillage under bio-degradable mulch film; and a control of uncultivated established grass pasture with sheep grazing. Soil N2O fluxes were recorded every 2 weeks using static chambers starting from preconversion in April 2016 and continuing until the end of October 2017. Monthly soil samples were also taken and analysed for nitrate and ammonium. There was no significant difference in N2O emissions between the different cultivation methods. However, in comparison with the uncultivated pasture, N2O emissions from the cultivated Miscanthus plots were 550%-819% higher in the first year (April to December 2016) and 469%-485% higher in the second year (January to October 2017). When added to an estimated carbon cost for production over a 10 year crop lifetime (including crop management, harvest, and transportation), the measured N2O conversion cost of 4.13 Mg CO2-eq./ha represents a 44% increase in emission compared to the base case. This paper clearly shows the need to incorporate N2O fluxes during Miscanthus establishment into assessments of GHG balances and life cycle analysis and provides vital knowledge needed for this process. This work therefore also helps to support policy decisions regarding the costs and benefits of land use change to Miscanthus.",Characterization of Miscanthus cell wall polymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007724,Global change biology. Bioenergy,2019 04 24,"Efficient utilization of lignocellulosic Miscanthus biomass for the production of biochemicals, such as ethanol, is challenging due to its recalcitrance, which is influenced by the individual plant cell wall polymers and their interactions. Lignocellulosic biomass composition differs depending on several factors, such as plant age, harvest date, organ type, and genotype. Here, four selected Miscanthus genotypes (Miscanthus sinensis, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Miscanthus × giganteus, Miscanthus sinensis × Miscanthus sacchariflorus hybrid) were grown and harvested, separated into stems and leaves, and characterized for their non-starch polysaccharide composition and structures, lignin contents and structures, and hydroxycinnamate profiles (monomers and ferulic acid dehydrodimers). Polysaccharides of all genotypes are mainly composed of cellulose and low-substituted arabinoxylans. Ratios of hemicelluloses to cellulose were comparable, with the exception of Miscanthus sinensis that showed a higher hemicellulose/cellulose ratio. Lignin contents of Miscanthus stems were higher than those of Miscanthus leaves. Considering the same organs, the four genotypes did not differ in their Klason lignin contents, but Miscanthus × giganteus showed the highest acetylbromide soluble lignin content. Lignin polymers isolated from stems varied in their S/G ratios and linkage type distributions across genotypes. p-Coumaric acid was the most abundant ester-bound hydroxycinnamte monomer in all samples. Ferulic acid dehydrodimers were analyzed as cell wall cross-links, with 8-5-coupled diferulic acid being the main dimer, followed by 8-O-4-, and 5-5-diferulic acid. Contents of p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and ferulic acid dimers varied depending on genotype and organ type. The largest amount of cell wall cross-links was analyzed for Miscanthus sinensis.",Soil nitrous oxide flux following land-use reversion from Miscanthus and SRC willow to perennial ryegrass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007723,Global change biology. Bioenergy,2019 04 24,"Decarbonization of the world's energy supply is essential to meet the targets of the 2016 Paris climate change agreement. One promising opportunity is the utilization of second generation, low input bioenergy crops such as Miscanthus and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow. Research has previously been carried out on the greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of growing these feedstocks and land-use changes involved in converting conventional cropland to their production; however, there is almost no body of work understanding the costs associated with their end of life transitions back to conventional crops. It is likely that it is during crop interventions and land-use transitions that significant GHG fluxes might occur. Therefore, in this study, we investigated soil GHG fluxes over 82 weeks during transition from Miscanthus and SRC willow into perennial ryegrass in west Wales, UK. This study captured soil GHG fluxes at a weekly time step, alongside monthly changes in soil nitrogen and labile carbon and reports the results of regression modelling of suspected drivers. Methane fluxes were typically trivial; however, nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were notably affected, reverted plots produced significantly more N2O than retained controls and Miscanthus produced significantly higher fluxes overall than willow plots. N2O costs of reversion appeared to be contained within the first year of reversion when the Miscanthus plots produced an average pregrass flux of 0.13 mg N2O m-2 hr-1 while for willow, this was 0.03 mg N2O m-2 hr-1. Total N2O emission from reversion increased the carbon cost over the lifetime of the Miscanthus from 6.50 to 9.91 Mg CO2 eq. ha-1 while for the willow, this increase was from 9.61 to 10.42 Mg CO2 eq. ha-1. Despite these significant increases, the carbon cost of energy contained in these perennial crops remained far lower than the equivalent carbon cost of energy in coal."

Accumulation of solids with recycling of treated blackwater increases the energy required for disinfection with an electrochemical process. We hypothesized that improving the preprocess settling of blackwater by increasing the tortuosity of the liquid flow path would reduce this energy demand by reducing particle-associated chemical oxygen demand (COD). This approach successfully reduced the total suspended solids and turbidity in the process liquid accumulated per user-day equivalent. A modest reduction in the apparent steady-state accumulation of COD was also observed, likely because of the retention of COD associated with larger particles in the settling tanks. Interestingly, these improvements did not improve the energy efficiency of the electrochemical disinfection process, as predicted. These observations suggest that improving the energy efficiency of electrochemical disinfection will require remediation of dissolved COD.","A novel resveratrol derivative induces mitotic arrest, centrosome fragmentation and cancer cell death by inhibiting γ-tubulin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007707,Cell division,2019 04 24,"Resveratrol and its natural stilbene-containing derivatives have been extensively investigated as potential chemotherapeutic agents.

While the concept has been adopted into global health, its conceptualisation and especially its role in the conceptualisation of risk and therefore in risk assessments is still lacking. This paper uses the risk concept pioneered in hazard research that assumes that risk is a function of the interaction between hazard and vulnerability rather than the neo-liberal conceptualisation of vulnerability and vulnerable groups and communities. By seeking to modify the original pressure and release model, the paper unpacks the representation or lack of representation of vulnerability in risk assessments in global health emergency response and discusses what benefits can be gained from making the underlying assumptions about vulnerability, which are present whether vulnerability is sufficiently conceptualised and consciously included or not, explicit. The paper argues that discussions about risk in global health emergencies should be better grounded in a theoretical understanding of the concept of vulnerability and that this theoretical understanding needs to inform risk assessments which implicitly used the concept of vulnerability. By using the hazard research approach to vulnerability, it offers an alternative narrative with new perspectives on the value and limits of vulnerability as a concept and a tool.",Formononetin Enhances the Tumoricidal Effect of Everolimus in Breast Cancer MDA-MB-468 Cells by Suppressing the mTOR Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007702,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 04 24,"Formononetin, an active ingredient isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus, has anticancer and chemoresistance-reducing biological activities.

Here we established an in vitro inflammatory injury model by stimulating RAW246.7 cells with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and detected the intervention effects of curcumin and curcumol on CSE-treated Raw246.7 macrophage cells to explore whether the two compounds inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. We detected the antifibrosis effects of curcumin and curcumol via TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathways. The model of macrophage damage group was established by CSE stimulation. Curcumol and curcumin were administered to Raw246.7 macrophage cells. The efficacy of curcumol and curcumin was evaluated by comparing the activation of proinflammatory factors, profibrotic factors, and NF-κB and TGF-β1/Smads signaling pathway. In addition, CSE-treated group was employed to detect whether the efficacy of curcumol and curcumin was dependent on the NF-κB signaling via the pretreatment with the inhibitor of NF-κB.

In this study, the influences of steaming process with wine (SPW) from Cistanche deserticola on chemical compositions and biological effects were investigated. The principal component analysis (PCA) and quantitative analysis were used to study the differences of the chemical compositions. The effects of nourishing kidney were also investigated to compare the differences between the RCD and the WSCD. The PCA results indicated that the obvious separation was achieved in the RCD and WSCD. The results of quantitative analysis showed that the WSCD has higher amounts of total polysaccharides, total PhGs, isoacteoside, and osmanthuside B than RCD, while the content of 2'-acetylacteoside and acteoside decreased after the SPW. The comparison of RCD and WSCD on biological activities showed that both could restore the level of sex hormone in the model of kidney-yang deficiency and improve the antioxidant effect.

Experts also insist on the importance of considering obesity as a chronic disease and one of the main contributors to the worldwide burden of other nontransmissible chronic diseases, which have a great impact on health, lifestyle, and economic cost. One of the most current challenges of biomedical science faces is to understand the origin of the chronic nontransmissible diseases, such as obesity and cancer. There is a large evidence, both in epidemiological studies in humans and in animal models, of the association between obesity and an increased risk of cancer incidence. In the last years, the initial discovery of epigenetic mechanisms represents the most relevant finding to explain how the genome interacts with environmental factors and the ripple effects on disease pathogeneses. Since then, all epigenetic process has been investigated by the scientific communities for nearly two decades to determine which components are involved in this process. DNA/RNA methylation and miRNA are classified as two of the most important representative classes of such epigenetic mechanisms and dysregulated activity of such mechanism can certainly contribute to disease pathogenesis and/or progression especially in tumors.

Optogenetics is a functional and structural connection-based approach that can selectively activate or inhibit specific subtype neurons with a higher precision, and it has been widely applied to build up neuronal plasticities of the nervous system, which shows a great potential in restoring motor functions in stroke animal models. Here, we reviewed neurobiological mechanisms of enhanced brain plasticities underlying motor recovery through the optogenetic stimulation after ischemic stroke.

Previously, we reported that the AbSte7 gene, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in Alternaria brassicicola, plays a central role in pathogenicity against host cabbage plants. In this research, we further characterized the role of AbSte7 in the pathogenicity of this fungus using ΔAbSte7 mutants. Disruption of the AbSte7 gene of A. brassicicola reduced accumulation of metabolites toxic to the host plant in liquid culture media. The ΔAbSte7 mutants could not efficiently detoxify cruciferous phytoalexin brassinin, possibly due to reduced expression of the brassinin hydrolase gene involved in detoxifying brassinin. Disruption of the AbSte7 gene also severely impaired fungal detoxification of reactive oxygen species. AbSte7 gene disruption reduced the enzymatic activity of cell wall-degrading enzymes, including cellulase, β-glucosidase, pectin methylesterase, polymethyl-galacturonase, and polygalacturonic acid transeliminase, during host plant infection. Altogether, the data strongly suggest the MAPKK gene AbSte7 plays a pivotal role in A. brassicicola during host infection by regulating multiple steps, and thus increasing pathogenicity and inhibiting host defenses.",Early adulthood housing transitions in Amsterdam: Understanding dependence and independence between generations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007633,"Population, space and place",2019 04 24,"The housing context has a profound influence on how different generations within families negotiate dependence and independence. This article investigates the nature of intergenerational relations during early adulthood housing transitions. We consider an original dataset of qualitative interviews with young adults and their parents living in and around Amsterdam, where recent housing market liberalisation is challenging home-leaving norms. We find that while strong norms regarding early home-leaving and independence persist, market conditions prompt significant intergenerational support to sustain this ""independence."" Support for renting and homeownership are part of different intergenerational dynamics. The first marks a process of easing into adulthood, whereas the latter solidifies new sets of relationships between fully adult generations supporting one another on equal terms. Despite professed individualization in Western European societies, the analysis of early adulthood housing transitions show that intergenerational dependencies can emerge in specific housing markets, requiring creative approaches to support young adult autonomy.",Saturating Splines and Feature Selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007630,Journal of machine learning research : JMLR,2019 04 26,"We extend the adaptive regression spline model by incorporating saturation, the natural requirement that a function extend as a constant outside a certain range. We fit saturating splines to data via a convex optimization problem over a space of measures, which we solve using an efficient algorithm based on the conditional gradient method. Unlike many existing approaches, our algorithm solves the original infinite-dimensional (for splines of degree at least two) optimization problem without pre-specified knot locations. We then adapt our algorithm to fit generalized additive models with saturating splines as coordinate functions and show that the saturation requirement allows our model to simultaneously perform feature selection and nonlinear function fitting. Finally, we briefly sketch how the method can be extended to higher order splines and to different requirements on the extension outside the data range.",Meta-analysis comparing the effects of statins on the risk of Clostridium difficile diarrhea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007627,Proceedings (Baylor University.

Studies that compared the risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and/or the clinical outcomes of CDI in patients who received statin treatment versus those who did not receive statins were included. Ten observational studies with 37,109 patients were included. Compared to no treatment, statins reduced the risk of CDI development (odds ratio [OR] = 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.99). However, among patients who developed CDI, the use of statins did not significantly reduce recurrent CDI risk (OR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.28-1.71) or 30-day mortality (OR = 0.77, 95% CI, 0.51-1.14). In conclusion, our study demonstrates a significant association between statin use and a reduced risk of CDI development. However, the findings of our study suggest no significant associations between statin use and improvement in clinical outcomes of CDI. These findings might impact the clinical management and primary prevention of CDI.","Recycled Components in Mantle Plumes Deduced From Variations in Halogens (Cl, Br, and I), Trace Elements, and 3He/4He Along the Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Chain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007626,"Geochemistry, geophysics, geosystems : G(3)",2019 04 24,"Halogens are primarily located within surface reservoirs of the Earth; as such they have proven to be effective tracers for the identification of subducted volatiles within the mantle. Subducting lithologies exhibit a wide variety of halogen compositions, yet the mantle maintains a fairly uniform signature, suggesting halogens may be homogenized during subduction to the mantle or during eruption. Here we present halogen (Cl, Br, and I), K, noble gas, and major and trace element data on olivines from three seamounts along the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain to determine if the deep mantle source has retained evidence of halogen heterogeneities introduced through subduction. High Ni contents indicate that the Hawaiian-Emperor mantle source contains a recycled oceanic crust component in the form of pyroxenite, which increases from the 46% in the oldest (Detroit) to 70% in the younger seamount (Koko). Detroit seamount retains mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB)-like Br/Cl and I/Cl, while the Br/Cl and I/Cl of Suiko and Koko seamounts are higher than MORB and similar to altered oceanic crust and dehydrated serpentinite. Helium isotopes show a similar evolution, from MORB-like values at Detroit seamount toward higher values at Suiko and Koko seamounts. The correlation between pyroxenite contributions, Br/Cl, I/Cl, and 3He/4He indicates that subducted material has been incorporated into the primordial undegassed Hawaiian mantle plume source. The identification of recycled oceanic crustal signatures in both the trace elements and halogens indicates that subduction and dehydration of altered oceanic crust may exert control on the cycling of volatile elements to the deep mantle.",The Melting Column as a Filter of Mantle Trace-Element Heterogeneity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007625,"Geochemistry, geophysics, geosystems : G(3)",2019 04 24,"The observed variability of trace-element concentration in basaltic lavas and melt inclusions carries information about heterogeneity in the mantle. The difficulty is to disentangle the contributions of source heterogeneity (i.e., spatial variability of mantle composition before melting) and process heterogeneity (i.e., spatial and temporal variability in melt transport). Here we investigate the end-member hypothesis that variability arises due to source heterogeneity alone. We model the attenuation of trace-element variability introduced into the bottom of a one-dimensional, steady-state melting column. Our results show that the melting column can be considered to be a filter that attenuates variability according to the wavelength of heterogeneity, the partition coefficient of the trace element, melt productivity, and the efficiency of melt segregation. We further show that while the model can be fit to the observations, this requires assumptions inconsistent with constraints on the timescales of magma assembly. Hence, we falsify the end-member hypothesis and, instead, conclude that observed variability requires heterogeneity of melt transport. This might take the form of channels or waves and would almost certainly interact with source heterogeneity.","Insights on Upper Mantle Melting, Rheology, and Anelastic Behavior From Seismic Shear Wave Tomography.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007624,"Geochemistry, geophysics, geosystems : G(3)",2019 04 24,"In seismic tomography we map the wave speed structure inside the Earth, but we ultimately seek to interpret those images in terms of physical parameters. This is challenging because many parameters can trade-off with each other to produce a given wave speed. The problem is compounded by the convention of mapping seismic structures as perturbations relative to a 1-D reference model, rather than absolute wave speeds. Using a full waveform tomography model of Europe as a case study, we quantify the extent to which thermochemical and dynamic properties can be constrained using only S wave speed, expressed in absolute values. The wave speed distributions of this tomography model are compared with 4 million thermochemical models, whose seismic properties are computed via thermodynamic modeling. These models sample the full range of realistic mantle compositions, including variable water and melt contents, and mineral intrinsic anelasticity is taken into account. Intrinsic anelasticity causes waves to travel more slowly at higher temperatures, leading to seismic attenuation, but the sensitivity of the wave speed reduction to temperature is, in turn, controlled by the wave frequency. Global studies of surface waves indicate an anticorrelation between S wave speed and attenuation. We therefore only retain thermochemical models satisfying this anticorrelation. Our study indicates that the frequency dependence of anelasticity, α, depends on temperature or rheology, with α ≈ 0.1 being most appropriate in cold or lithospheric mantle and α ≈ 0.3 in warmer regions (i.e., the asthenosphere). Additionally, the slowest regions require specific compositions and/or a velocity-weakening mechanism, such as partial melting, elastically accommodated grain boundary sliding, or water.","Raccoon rabies outbreak in Hamilton, Ontario: A progress report.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007622,Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,2019 04 24,"Raccoon rabies is caused by a variant of the rabies virus found in raccoons but transmissible to other mammalian species, including humans.

The Annex emphasizes the importance of communicating with both the public and key stakeholders (e.g., health care providers, professional organizations and policymakers) before, during and after a pandemic. This strategy is grounded in several communications guiding principles: putting the health of Canadians first; providing timely and sound information; communicating in a coordinated fashion from across all levels of government; protecting confidentiality; and monitoring and adapting to the public's perception of risk. The Annex outlines a risk communications approach, proposes triggers for action based on pandemics of varying impact, and includes a Communication Protocol that will be used countrywide in the event of a pandemic."

In addition, abnormal signal transduction and dysfunctional DNA repair genes are common features with breast cancer resistance. Chemo-resistance of breast cancer associated with multidrug resistance events utilizes ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters to decrease drug intracellular concentration. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the treatment that involves a combination of a photosensitizer (PS), light and molecular oxygen to induce cell death. This treatment modality has been considered as a possible approach in combatting multidrug resistance phenomenon although its therapeutic potential towards chemo-resistance is still unclear. Attempts to minimize the impact of efflux transporters on drug resistance suggested concurrent use of chemotherapy agents, nanotechnology, endolysosomal release of drug by photochemical internalization and the use of structurally related compound inhibitors to block the transport function of the multidrug resistant transporters. In this review, we briefly summarize the role of membrane ABC efflux transporters in therapeutic outcomes and highlight research findings related to PDT and its applications on breast cancer with multidrug resistance phenotype. With the development of an ideal PS for photodynamic cancer treatment, it is possible that light activation may be used not only to sensitize the tumour but also to enable release of PS into the cytosol and as such bypass efflux membrane proteins and inhibit escape pathways that may lead to resistance.",Construction and comprehensive analysis of a ceRNA network to reveal potential prognostic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007608,Cancer cell international,2019 04 24,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act as microRNA (miRNA) sponges to regulate protein-coding gene expression; therefore, lncRNAs are considered a major part of the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and have attracted growing attention.

However, wheat products are typically low in bioavailable iron and zinc, contributing to deficiencies in these micronutrients in countries where wheat is consumed as a staple food. Two factors contribute to the low contents of bioavailable iron and zinc in wheat: the low concentrations of these minerals in white flour, which is most widely consumed, and the presence of phytates in mineral-rich bran fractions. Although high zinc types of wheat have been developed by conventional plant breeding (biofortification), this approach has failed for iron. However, studies in wheat and other cereals have shown that transgenic (also known as genetically modified; GM) strategies can be used to increase the contents of iron and zinc in white flour, by converting the starchy endosperm tissue into a 'sink' for minerals. Although such strategies currently have low acceptability, greater understanding of the mechanisms which control the transport and deposition of iron and zinc in the developing grain should allow similar effects to be achieved by exploiting naturally induced genetic variation. When combined with conventional biofortification and innovative processing, this approach should provide increased mineral bioavailability in a range of wheat products, from white flour to wholemeal.",Traditional plant functional groups explain variation in economic but not size-related traits across the tundra biome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007605,Global ecology and biogeography : a journal of macroecology,2019 04 24,"Plant functional groups are widely used in community ecology and earth system modelling to describe trait variation within and across plant communities.

In the current study, we investigated relevant molecule expressions and cytokine levels in blood samples from 49 SLE patients and 22 healthy control subjects. The expression of HLA-DR and costimulatory molecules on T cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Concentrations of serum C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody, total lgG, complement 3, and complement 4 were measured. Serum cytokines and chemokines were measured by a cytometric bead array assay. Elevated frequencies of HLA-DR+ T cells and ICOS+ T cells were observed in SLE patients with positive anti-dsDNA antibodies compared with those in healthy controls (P < 0.001). The expression of HLA-DR+ T cells was positively correlated with SLEDAI (r = 0.15, P < 0.01). Furthermore, levels of serum IL-6, MCP-1, TNFRI, IL-10, IL-12, and CCL20 were higher in SLE patients compared with healthy controls. In addition, patients with hematologic manifestations displayed elevated frequencies of HLA-DR+ T cells and ICOS+ T cells. Patients with renal manifestations had a decreased frequency of TIGIT+ T cells. These results suggested a dysregulated T cell activity and cytokine expression profiles in SLE subjects.

Classically activated (M1) macrophages are characterized by strong antimicrobicidal properties, whereas alternatively activated (M2) macrophages are involved in wound healing. Severe inflammation can induce postoperative complications during the perioperative period. Invasive surgical procedures induce polarization to M1 macrophages and associated complications. As perioperative management, it is an important strategy to regulate polarization and functions of macrophages during inflammatory processes. Although propofol has been found to exhibit anti-inflammatory activities in monocytes and macrophages, it is unclear whether propofol regulates the functions of M1 and M2 macrophages during inflammatory processes. This study therefore investigated the effects of propofol on human macrophage polarization. During M1 polarization, propofol suppressed the production of IL-6 and IL-1β but did not affect TNF-α production. In contrast, propofol did not affect the gene expression of M2 markers, such as IL-10, TGF-β, and CD206, during M2 polarization. Propofol was similar to the GABAA agonist muscimol in inducing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and inhibiting IL-6 and IL-1β, but not TNF-α, production. Knockdown of Nrf2 using siRNA significantly reduced the effect of propofol on IL-6 and IL-1β production. These results suggest that propofol prevents inflammatory responses during polarization of human M1 macrophages by suppressing the expression of IL-6 and IL-1β through the GABAA receptor and the Nrf2-mediated signal transduction pathway.",An institutional analysis to address climate change adaptation in Tenerife (Canary Islands).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007600,Environmental science & policy,2019 04 24,"Heat waves and Saharan dust outbreaks have been acquiring more frequency and intensity in the Canary Islands during the last decades.

It explores the institutional setting of climate change adaptation planning in Tenerife and evaluates the statu quo of adaptation planning in the island through the engagement of key social actors. An historical review of the local and regional press articles and legislation, an in-depth round of interviews, together with questionnaires to the main social actors allows framing the social and political context in which climate change adaptation in Tenerife is embedded. Key social actors were engaged, including international organisations, atmospheric research centres, local Universities, regional and insular governments, trade unions, and environmental NGOs, among others. The main obstacles mentioned by the social actors that hinder the development of an effective climate adaptation policy address scientific knowledge, data collection and policy making, focusing on the uncertainty of climate models, the lack of epidemiological data and contrasting opinions regarding the existing climate adaptation policies. Public participation, mainstreaming of climate policies and an integrated approach between mitigation and adaptation plans were identified as key policy issues. The outcomes of this study could be meaningful for climate adaptation initiatives at local or regional level, such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, that intend to promote climate resilience through the setup of climate adaptation strategies and plans at municipality level."

Moreover, through constructing novel upper/lower solutions, we give explicit conditions for the speed sign to be positive or negative. The obtained results are efficiently applied to three classical forms of the kernel functions.",Turbulent wind field representation and conditional mean-field simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007560,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 24,"The covariance structure of a homogeneous isotropic turbulent wind velocity field is derived in terms of modified Bessel functions for an extended form of the Kàrmàn velocity spectrum, including explicit expressions for the transverse coherence functions. A concept of transformed isotropic turbulence is introduced to account for differences in the axial, transverse and vertical fluctuating wind velocities and length scales in natural wind. A special form of the auto-regressive simulation format is developed for convected turbulence with exponentially increasing intervals to the regression planes. In each step, the wind velocity field in a transverse plane is represented by a conditional mean field and a stochastic contribution determined explicitly by the time-space covariances. Simulation results are presented for a square area of dimension less than the integral length scale, representative of buildings and wind turbines, and a horizontal line of length six times the length scale, representative of a long-span bridge. The simulations demonstrate high accuracy of simulated spectral densities, covariance functions and transverse coherence functions. The simulated results do not show visible dependence on the specific points used for the simulated records. The efficiency and the free simulation point configuration suggest high competitiveness compared to fast Fourier transform-based spectral methods.",Nonlinear dynamics of spherical shells buckling under step pressure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007559,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 24,"Dynamic buckling is addressed for complete elastic spherical shells subject to a rapidly applied step in external pressure. Insights from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics reveal essential mathematical features of the buckling phenomena. To capture the strong buckling imperfection-sensitivity, initial geometric imperfections in the form of an axisymmetric dimple at each pole are introduced. Dynamic buckling under the step pressure is related to the quasi-static buckling pressure. Both loadings produce catastrophic collapse of the shell for conditions in which the pressure is prescribed. Damping plays an important role in dynamic buckling because of the time-dependent nonlinear interaction among modes, particularly the interaction between the spherically symmetric 'breathing' mode and the buckling mode. In general, there is not a unique step pressure threshold separating responses associated with buckling from those that do not buckle. Instead, there exists a cascade of buckling thresholds, dependent on the damping and level of imperfection, separating pressures for which buckling occurs from those for which it does not occur. For shells with small and moderately small imperfections, the dynamic step buckling pressure can be substantially below the quasi-static buckling pressure.",Bed particle saltation in turbulent wall-shear flow: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007558,"Proceedings.

In this review, we report the current state of the art of bed particle saltation in turbulent wall-shear flow, highlighting the physical characteristics of bed particle saltation and its mathematical modelling. A critical appraisal of the mechanics of bed particle saltation is presented thorough ample experimental evidence. The salient features of bed particle saltation, encompassing the saltation height, saltation length, particle velocity, saltation duration, particle collision with the bed, particle rotation, particle resting time and particle re-entrainment, are thoroughly discussed. Both the deterministic and computational fluid dynamics approaches in modelling bed particle saltation are summarized, and the subtle role of the hydrodynamic forces is elaborated. The estimation of bedload flux in a fluvial environment, emanating from the mathematical modelling of bed particle saltation, is delineated using different modelling approaches. Finally, the challenges in modelling bed particle saltation are highlighted, and a new look at bed particle saltation is furnished.",Reactive learning strategies for iterated games.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007557,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 24,"In an iterated game between two players, there is much interest in characterizing the set of feasible pay-offs for both players when one player uses a fixed strategy and the other player is free to switch. Such characterizations have led to extortionists, equalizers, partners and rivals.

Here, we consider 'reactive learning strategies', which gradually modify their propensity to take certain actions based on past actions of the opponent. Every linear reactive learning strategy,

We also consider the junctures of dispersion branches and 'dense' clusters thereof, where the asymptotic analysis reveals several distinct regimes driven by the parity and symmetries of the germane eigenfunction basis. In the case of junctures, one of these asymptotic regimes is shown to describe the so-called Dirac points that are relevant to the phenomenon of topological insulation. On the other hand, the effective model for nearby solution branches is found to invariably entail a Dirac-like system of equations that describes the interacting dispersion surfaces as 'blunted cones'. For all cases considered, the effective description turns out to admit the same general framework, with differences largely being limited to (i) the eigenfunction basis, (ii) the reference cell of medium periodicity, and (iii) the wavenumber-frequency scaling law underpinning the asymptotic expansion. We illustrate the analytical developments by several examples, including Green's function near the edge of a band gap and clusters of nearby dispersion surfaces.",Model selection for hybrid dynamical systems via sparse regression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007544,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 24,"Hybrid systems are traditionally difficult to identify and analyse using classical dynamical systems theory. Moreover, recently developed model identification methodologies largely focus on identifying a single set of governing equations solely from measurement data. In this article, we develop a new methodology, Hybrid-Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics, which identifies separate nonlinear dynamical regimes, employs information theory to manage uncertainty and characterizes switching behaviour. Specifically, we use the nonlinear geometry of data collected from a complex system to construct a set of coordinates based on measurement data and augmented variables. Clustering the data in these measurement-based coordinates enables the identification of nonlinear hybrid systems. This methodology broadly empowers nonlinear system identification without constraining the data locally in time and has direct connections to hybrid systems theory. We demonstrate the success of this method on numerical examples including a mass-spring hopping model and an infectious disease model. Characterizing complex systems that switch between dynamic behaviours is integral to overcoming modern challenges such as eradication of infectious diseases, the design of efficient legged robots and the protection of cyber infrastructures.",Partitioning a reaction-diffusion ecological network for dynamic stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007543,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 24,"The loss of dispersal connections between habitat patches may destabilize populations in a patched ecological network. This work studies the stability of populations when one or more communication links is removed. An example is finding the alignment of a highway through a patched forest containing a network of metapopulations in the patches. This problem is modelled as that of finding a stable cut of the graph induced by the metapopulations network, where nodes represent the habitat patches and the weighted edges model the dispersal between habitat patches. A reaction-diffusion system on the graph models the dynamics of the predator-prey system over the patched ecological network. The graph Laplacian's Fiedler value, which indicates the well-connectedness of the graph, is shown to affect the stability of the metapopulations. We show that, when the Fiedler value is sufficiently large, the removal of edges without destabilizing the dynamics of the network is possible. We give an exhaustive graph partitioning procedure, which is suitable for smaller networks and uses the criterion for both the local and global stability of populations in partitioned networks. A heuristic graph bisection algorithm that preserves the preassigned lower bound for the Fiedler value is proposed for larger networks and is illustrated with examples.",Edgeworth expansions for slow-fast systems with finite time-scale separation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007542,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 24,"We derive Edgeworth expansions that describe corrections to the Gaussian limiting behaviour of slow-fast systems. The Edgeworth expansion is achieved using a semi-group formalism for the transfer operator, where a Duhamel-Dyson series is used to asymptotically determine the corrections at any desired order of the time-scale parameter ε. The corrections involve integrals over higher-order auto-correlation functions. We develop a diagrammatic representation of the series to control the combinatorial wealth of the asymptotic expansion in ε and provide explicit expressions for the first two orders. At a formal level, the expressions derived are valid in the case when the fast dynamics is stochastic as well as when the fast dynamics is entirely deterministic. We corroborate our analytical results with numerical simulations and show that our method provides an improvement on the classical homogenization limit which is restricted to the limit of infinite time-scale separation.",Hardy inequalities on metric measure spaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007541,"Proceedings.

Reference data are first produced with a multiscale model in the case of a magnetic field and uniaxial and shear stresses. The thermodynamic model fits well to the results of the multiscale model, after which the models are compared under complex multiaxial loadings. A surprisingly good agreement between the two models is found, but some differences in the magnetostrictive behaviour are also pointed out. Finally, the model is fitted to measurement results from an electrical steel sheet. The spline-based constitutive law overcomes several drawbacks of analytical approaches used earlier.

Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 04 24,"It has been frequently observed that humans and animals spontaneously stabilize their heads with respect to the gravitational vertical during body movements even in the absence of vision. The interpretations of this intriguing behaviour have so far not included the need, for survival, to robustly estimate verticality. Here we use a mechanistic model of the head/otolith organ to analyse the possibility for this system to render verticality 'observable', a fundamental prerequisite to the determination of the angular position and acceleration of the head from idiothetic, inertial measurements. The intrinsically nonlinear head-vestibular dynamics is shown to generally lack observability unless the head is stabilized in orientation by feedback. Thus, our study supports the hypothesis that a central function of the physiologically costly head stabilization strategy is to enable an organism to estimate the gravitational vertical and head acceleration during locomotion. Moreover, our result exhibits a rare peculiarity of certain nonlinear systems to fortuitously alter their observability properties when feedback is applied.","The role of dietary methionine concentrations on growth, metabolism and N-retention in cobia (Rachycentron canadum) at elevated water temperatures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31007538,Aquaculture nutrition,2019 04 24,"This study determined impacts of dietary methionine concentrations at two temperatures on growth, feeding efficiency and N-metabolites in juvenile cobia. Methionine concentrations of the experimental diets were deficient (M9; 9 g/kg), sufficient (M12; 12 g/kg) and surplus (M16, 16 g/kg). Water temperature was normal (30°C) or elevated (34°C). Twenty cobia in triplicate tanks were fed the experimental diets for 6 weeks. Both methionine and temperature affected cobia's growth and feeding efficiency. Cobia fed M9 performed lower than the fish fed M12 and M16 diets. Additionally, cobia reared at 34°C performed poorer than at 30°C, probably due to lower voluntary feed intake in the fish reared at 34°C. Protein efficiency ratio and protein productive value in cobia fed M9 diet were less than M12 or M16 diets. This was confirmed with the improved retentions of indispensable amino acids (AAs). No interactions between methionine and temperature were observed in growth and protein accretion. At 30°C, CF improved, while HSI and VSI declined upon methionine supplementation levels. Of which an interaction between temperature and methionine was present. Plasma, muscle and liver free AA and N-metabolites were affected by methionine and temperature.
