Such symptoms are often underreported or misdiagnosed and can lead to potentially premature treatment 'escalation' and under-utilisation of pelvic floor investigations. In this review article, we consider putative pathophysiological post-inflammatory changes resulting in altered anorectal sensitivity, motility and neuromuscular coordination and how this may drive symptoms in quiescent IBD. Finally, we discuss a pragmatic approach to investigating and managing anorectal dysfunction and highlight areas for future research for this often-neglected group of patients.","Role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in pathology of the gastrointestinal tract.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574192,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,2018 12 25,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) has the most important role in modulation of tryptophan-dependent effects in the gastrointestinal tract, including modulation of intestinal immune response. An increased IDO activity maintains immune tolerance and attenuates ongoing inflammation but allows immune escape and uncontrolled growth of gastrointestinal tumors. Accordingly, IDO represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. In this review article, we summarize current knowledge about molecular and cellular mechanisms that are involved in IDO-dependent effects. We provide a brief outline of experimental and clinical studies that increased our understanding of how enhanced IDO activity: controls host-microbiota interactions in the gut; regulates detrimental immune response in inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal system; and allows immune escape and uncontrolled growth of gastrointestinal tumors. Additionally, we present future perspectives regarding modulation of IDO activity in the gut as possible new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of inflammatory and malignant diseases of the gastrointestinal system.",Function and therapeutic advances of chemokine and its receptor in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574191,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,2018 12 25,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of hepatic pathology, ranging from simple accumulation of fat in its most benign form, steatohepatitis, to cirrhosis in its most advanced form. The prevalence of NAFLD is 20-30% in adults, and 10-20% of patients with NAFLD progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which is predicted to be the leading cause of liver transplantation over the next 10 years. Therefore, it is essential to explore effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for NAFLD patients. Chemokines are a family of small and highly conserved proteins (molecular weight ranging from 8 to 12 kDa) involved in regulating the migration and activities of hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (KCs), hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), endothelial cells and circulating immune cells. Accumulating data show that chemokine and its receptor act vital roles in the pathogenesis of NAFLD.

One pill fits all? Is it the end of the road?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574189,Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,2018 12 25,"The advent of oral direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) has dramatically improved the hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment landscape in the last 4 years, providing cure rates over 95% with a shorter duration of treatment and a very good safety profile. This has enabled access to treatment in nearly all HCV infected patients. The launch of two pangenotypic fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in 2017 made a new step forward in HCV treatment by slightly increasing efficacy and more importantly allowing the treatment of patients without HCV genotyping, and in some cases without fibrosis assessment. However, retreatment of the few DAA failure patients was still an issue for some HCV genotypes. The launch of the triple regimen FDC, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, solves this issue by providing a cure rate over 96% regardless of HCV genotype. In this review, we describe the current HCV treatment landscape and focus on the development of this triple FDC either in treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients with previous failure on a DAA regimen.",Comparative transcriptome and metabolome analysis suggests bottlenecks that limit seed and oil yields in transgenic Camelina sativa expressing diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574188,Biotechnology for biofuels,2018 12 25,"Camelina sativa has attracted much interest as alternative renewable resources for biodiesel, other oil-based industrial products and a source for edible oils. Its unique oil attributes attract research to engineering new varieties of improved oil quantity and quality.

In a previous study, we co-expressed the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1), involved in TAG metabolism, in Camelina seeds. Transgenic plants exhibited a higher-percentage seed oil content, a greater seed mass, and overall improved seed and oil yields relative to wild-type plants. To further increase seed oil content in Camelina, we utilized metabolite profiling, in conjunction with transcriptome profiling during seed development to examine potential rate-limiting step(s) in the production of building blocks for TAG biosynthesis.",An NIRS-based assay of chemical composition and biomass digestibility for rapid selection of Jerusalem artichoke clones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574187,Biotechnology for biofuels,2018 12 25,"High-throughput evaluation of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock quality is the key to the successful commercialization of bioethanol production. Currently, wet chemical methods for the determination of chemical composition and biomass digestibility are expensive and time-consuming, thus hindering comprehensive feedstock quality assessments based on these biomass specifications. To find the ideal bioethanol feedstock, we perform a near-infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) assay to rapidly and comprehensively analyze the chemical composition and biomass digestibility of 59 Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L., abbreviated JA) clones collected from 24 provinces in six regions of China.",Online evaluation of the metabolic activity of Ustilago maydis on (poly)galacturonic acid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574186,Journal of biological engineering,2018 12 25,"Pectin is a rather complex and highly branched polysaccharide strengthening the plant cell wall.

Galacturonic acid, the main sugar unit of pectin, is an uncommon substrate for microbial fermentations. Thus, growth and enzyme production of the applied strain has to be characterized in detail to understand the microbial system.

Despite the existence of several bioinformatic algorithms and servers that predict if a SAS is pathogenic or not, they give little or no information at all on the reasons for pathogenicity prediction and on the actual predicted effect of the SAS on the protein function. Moreover, few actual methods take into account structural information when available for automated analysis. Moreover, many of these algorithms are able to predict an effect that no necessarily translates directly into pathogenicity. VarQ is a bioinformatic pipeline that incorporates structural information for the detailed analysis and prediction of SAS effect on protein function. It is an online tool which uses UniProt id and automatically analyzes known and user provided SAS for their effect on protein activity, folding, aggregation and protein interactions, among others. We show that structural information, when available, can improve the SAS pathogenicity diagnosis and more important explain its causes. We show that VarQ is able to correctly reproduce previous analysis of RASopathies related mutations, saving extensive and time consuming manual curation. VarQ assessment was performed over a set of previously manually curated RASopathies (diseases that affects the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway) related variants, showing its ability to correctly predict the phenotypic outcome and its underlying cause.

The only recommended screening method is clinic based low-dose computed tomography (also called a low-dose CT scan, or LDCT). However, the effect of LDCT on overall mortality observed in lung cancer patients is not statistically significant. Over-diagnosis, excessive cost, risks associated with radiation exposure, false positive results and delay in the commencement of the treatment procedure questions the use of LDCT as a reliable technique for population-based screening. Therefore, identification of minimal-invasive biomarkers able to detect malignancies at an early stage might be useful to reduce the disease burden. Circulating nucleic acids are emerging as important source of information for several chronic pathologies including lung cancer. Of these, circulating cell free miRNAs are reported to be closely associated with the clinical outcome of lung cancer patients. Smaller size, sequence homology between species, low concentration and stability are some of the major challenges involved in characterization and specific detection of miRNAs. To circumvent these problems, synthesis of a quantum dot based nano-biosensor might assist in sensitive, specific and cost-effective detection of differentially regulated miRNAs. The wide excitation and narrow emission spectra of these nanoparticles result in excellent fluorescent quantum yields with a broader color spectrum which make them ideal bio-entities for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based detection for sequential or simultaneous study of multiple targets. In addition, photo-resistance and higher stability of these nanoparticles allows extensive exposure and offer state-of-the art sensitivity for miRNA targeting. A major obstacle for integrating QDs into clinical application is the QD-associated toxicity. However, the use of non-toxic shells along with surface modification not only overcomes the toxicity issues, but also increases the ability of QDs to quickly detect circulating cell free miRNAs in a non-invasive mode. The present review illustrates the importance of circulating miRNAs in lung cancer diagnosis and highlights the translational prospects of developing QD-based nano-biosensor for rapid early disease detection.",Long Noncoding RNA FAM201A Mediates the Radiosensitivity of Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer by Regulating ATM and mTOR Expression via miR-101.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574162,Frontiers in genetics,2018 12 25,"Background: The aim of the present study was to identify the potential long non-coding (lnc.)-RNA and its associated molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the radiosensitivity of esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) in order to assess whether it could be a biomarker for the prediction of the response to radiotherapy and prognosis in patients with ESCC. Methods: Microarrays and bioinformatics analysis were utilized to screen the potential lncRNAs associated with radiosensitivity in radiosensitive (n = 3) and radioresistant (n = 3) ESCC tumor tissues. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed in 35 ESCC tumor tissues (20 radiosensitive and 15 radioresistant tissues, respectively) to validate the lncRNA that contributed the most to the radiosensitivity of ESCC (named the candidate lncRNA). MTT, flow cytometry, and western blot assays were conducted to assess the effect of the candidate lncRNA on radiosensitivity in vitro in ECA109/ECA109R ESCC cells. A mouse xenograft model was established to confirm the function of the candidate lncRNA in the radiosensitivity of ESCC in vivo. The putative downstream target genes regulated by the candidate lncRNA were predicted using Starbase 2.0 software and the TargetScan database. The interactions between the candidate lncRNA and the putative downstream target genes were examined by Luciferase reporter assay, and were confirmed by PCR. Results: A total of 113 aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were identified by microarray analysis, of which family with sequence similarity 201-member A (FAM201A) was identified as the lncRNA that contributed the most to the radiosensitivity of ESCC. FAM201A was upregulated in radioresistant ESCC tumor tissues and had a poorer short-term response to radiotherapy resulting in inferior overall survival. FAM201A knockdown enhanced the radiosensitivity of ECA109/ECA109R cells by upregulating ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression via the negative regulation of miR-101 expression. The mouse xenograft model demonstrated that FAM201A knockdown improved the radiosensitivity of ESCC. Conclusion: The lncRNA FAM201A, which mediated the radiosensitivity of ESCC by regulating ATM and mTOR expression via miR-101 in the present study, may be a potential biomarker for predicting radiosensitivity and patient prognosis, and may be a therapeutic target for enhancing cancer radiosensitivity in ESCC.",Usefulness of a Multiparent Advanced Generation Intercross Population With a Greatly Reduced Mating Design for Genetic Studies in Winter Wheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574161,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 25,"Multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations were recently developed to allow the high-resolution mapping of quantitative traits. We present a genetic linkage map of an elite but highly diverse eight-founder MAGIC population in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Our MAGIC population is composed of 394 F6:8 recombinant inbred lines lacking significant signatures of population structure. The linkage map included 5435 SNP markers distributed over 2804 loci and spanning 5230 cM. The analysis of population parameters, including genetic structure, kinship, founder probabilities, and linkage disequilibrium and congruency to other maps indicated appropriate construction of both the population and the genetic map. It was shown that eight-founder MAGIC populations exhibit a greater number of loci and higher recombination rates, especially in the pericentromeric regions, compared to four-founder MAGIC, and biparental populations. In addition, our greatly simplified eight-parental MAGIC mating design with an additional eight-way intercross step was found to be equivalent to a MAGIC design with all 210 possible four-way crosses regarding the levels of missing founder assignments and the number of recombination events. Furthermore, the MAGIC population captured 71.7% of the allelic diversity available in the German wheat breeding gene pool. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated the application of the resource for quantitative trait loci mapping analyzing seedling resistance to powdery mildew. As wheat is a crop with many breeding objectives, this resource will allow scientists and breeders to carry out genetic studies for a wide range of breeder-relevant parameters in a single genetic background and reveal possible interactions between traits of economic importance.",Context-Dependent Parental Effects on Clonal Offspring Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574160,Frontiers in plant science,2018 12 25,"Parental environments may potentially affect offspring fitness, and the expression of such parental effects may depend on offspring environments and on whether one considers an individual offspring or all offspring of a parent. Using a well-studied clonal herb, Alternanthera philoxeroides, we first grew parent plants in high and low soil-nutrient conditions and obtained 1st generation clonal offspring from these two environments. Then we grew offspring of these two types of 1st generation clonal offspring also in high and low nutrient conditions. We measured and analyzed mean performance and summed performance of the four types of 2nd generation clonal offspring. High nutrient availability of parental environments markedly increased both mean performance (i.e., the average fitness measure across all individual offspring produced by a parent) and summed performance (i.e., the sum of the fitness measure of all offspring produced by a parent) of the 2nd generation clonal offspring. The positive parental effects on summed performance of the 2nd generation clonal offspring were stronger when the 1st generation clonal offspring grew in the high instead of the low nutrient conditions, but the positive parental effects on their mean performance did not depend on the nutrient environments of the 1st generation clonal offspring. The results provide novel evidence that parental environmental effects persist across vegetative generations and strongly depend on offspring environments and levels of plants."

Cross-reactivity to HLA-A and -B molecules has broadly been described, whereas responses to allo-HLA-C have remained ill defined. In contrast to the transplant setting, HLA-C is the only polymorphic HLA molecule expressed by extravillous trophoblasts at the maternal-fetal interface during pregnancy. Uncontrolled placental viral infections, accompanied by a pro-inflammatory milieu, can alter the activation status and stability of effector T cells. Potential cross-reactivity of maternal decidual virus-specific T cells to fetal allo-HLA-C may thereby have detrimental consequences for the success of pregnancy. To explore the presence of cross-reactivity to HLA-C and the other non-classical HLA antigens expressed by trophoblasts, HLA-A and -B-restricted CD8+ T cells specific for Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella-Zoster virus, and Influenza virus were tested against target cells expressing HLA-C, -E, and -G molecules. An HLA-B*08:01-restricted EBV-specific T cell clone displayed cross-reactivity against HLA-C*01:02. Furthermore, cross-reactivity of HLA-C-restricted virus-specific CD8+ T cells was observed for HCMV HLA-C*06:02/TRA CD8+ T cell lines and clones against HLA-C*03:02. Collectively, these results demonstrate that cross-reactivity against HLA-C can occur and thereby may affect pregnancy outcome.",The C-Terminal Transactivation Domain of STAT1 Has a Gene-Specific Role in Transactivation and Cofactor Recruitment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574148,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"STAT1 has a key role in the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity by inducing transcriptional changes in response to cytokines, such as all types of interferons (IFN). STAT1 exist as two splice isoforms, which differ in regard to the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). STAT1β lacks the C-terminal TAD and has been previously reported to be a weaker transcriptional activator than STAT1α, although this was strongly dependent on the target gene. The mechanism of this context-dependent effects remained unclear. By using macrophages from mice that only express STAT1β, we investigated the role of the C-terminal TAD during the distinct steps of transcriptional activation of selected target genes in response to IFNγ. We show that the STAT1 C-terminal TAD is absolutely required for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and for the establishment of active histone marks at the class II major histocompatibility complex transactivator (CIIta) promoter IV, whereas it is dispensable for histone acetylation at the guanylate binding protein 2 (Gbp2) promoter but required for an efficient recruitment of Pol II, which correlated with a strongly reduced, but not absent, transcriptional activity. IFNγ-induced expression of Irf7, which is mediated by STAT1 in complex with STAT2 and IRF9, did not rely on the presence of the C-terminal TAD of STAT1. Moreover, we show for the first time that the STAT1 C-terminal TAD is required for an efficient recruitment of components of the core Mediator complex to the IFN regulatory factor (Irf) 1 and Irf8 promoters, which both harbor an open chromatin state under basal conditions. Our study identified novel functions of the STAT1 C-terminal TAD in transcriptional activation and provides mechanistic explanations for the gene-specific transcriptional activity of STAT1β.",Restriction Factors: From Intrinsic Viral Restriction to Shaping Cellular Immunity Against HIV-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574147,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"Antiviral restriction factors are host cellular proteins that constitute a first line of defense blocking viral replication and propagation. In addition to interfering at critical steps of the viral replication cycle, some restriction factors also act as innate sensors triggering innate responses against infections. Accumulating evidence suggests an additional role for restriction factors in promoting antiviral cellular immunity to combat viruses. Here, we review the recent progress in our understanding on how restriction factors, particularly APOBEC3G, SAMHD1, Tetherin, and TRIM5α have the cell-autonomous potential to induce cellular resistance against HIV-1 while promoting antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses. Also, we provide an overview of how these restriction factors may connect with protein degradation pathways to modulate anti-HIV-1 cellular immune responses, and we summarize the potential of restriction factors-based therapeutics. This review brings a global perspective on the influence of restrictions factors in intrinsic, innate, and also adaptive antiviral immunity opening up novel research avenues for therapeutic strategies in the fields of drug discovery, gene therapy, and vaccines to control viral infections.",Expression of a Recombinant High Affinity IgG Fc Receptor by Engineered NK Cells as a Docking Platform for Therapeutic mAbs to Target Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574146,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"Anti-tumor mAbs are the most widely used and characterized cancer immunotherapy. Despite having a significant impact on some malignancies, most cancer patients respond poorly or develop resistance to this therapy. A known mechanism of action of these therapeutic mAbs is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), a key effector function of human NK cells. CD16A on human NK cells has an exclusive role in binding to tumor-bound IgG antibodies. Though CD16A is a potent activating receptor, it is also a low affinity IgG Fc receptor (FcγR) that undergoes a rapid downregulation in expression by a proteolytic process involving ADAM17 upon NK cell activation. These regulatory processes are likely to limit the efficacy of tumor-targeting therapeutic mAbs in the tumor environment. We sought to enhance NK cell binding to anti-tumor mAbs by engineering these cells with a recombinant FcγR consisting of the extracellular region of CD64, the highest affinity FcγR expressed by leukocytes, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of CD16A. This novel recombinant FcγR (CD64/16A) was expressed in the human NK cell line NK92 and in induced pluripotent stem cells from which primary NK cells were derived. CD64/16A lacked the ADAM17 cleavage region in CD16A and it was not rapidly downregulated in expression following NK cell activation during ADCC. CD64/16A on NK cells facilitated conjugation to antibody-treated tumor cells, ADCC, and cytokine production, demonstrating functional activity by its two components. Unlike NK cells expressing CD16A, CD64/16A captured soluble therapeutic mAbs and the modified NK cells mediated tumor cell killing. Hence, CD64/16A could potentially be used as a docking platform on engineered NK cells for therapeutic mAbs and IgG Fc chimeric proteins, allowing for switchable targeting elements and a novel cancer cellular therapy.",Interleukin-33 Contributes Toward Loss of Tolerance by Promoting B-Cell-Activating Factor of the Tumor-Necrosis-Factor Family (BAFF)-Dependent Autoantibody Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574145,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"Breaking tolerance is a key event leading to autoimmunity, but the exact mechanisms responsible for this remain uncertain. Here we show that the alarmin IL-33 is able to drive the generation of autoantibodies through induction of the B cell survival factor BAFF. A temporary, short-term increase in IL-33 results in a primary (IgM) response to self-antigens. This transient DNA-specific autoantibody response was dependent on the induction of BAFF. Notably, radiation resistant cells and not myeloid cells, such as neutrophils or dendritic cells were the major source of BAFF and were critical in driving the autoantibody response. Chronic exposure to IL-33 elicited dramatic increases in BAFF levels and resulted in elevated numbers of B and T follicular helper cells as well as germinal center formation. We also observed class-switching from an IgM to an IgG DNA-specific autoantibody response. Collectively, the results provide novel insights into a potential mechanism for breaking immune-tolerance via IL-33-mediated induction of BAFF.",Reduced mRNA and Protein Expression Levels of Tet Methylcytosine Dioxygenase 3 in Endothelial Progenitor Cells of Patients of Type 2 Diabetes With Peripheral Artery Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574144,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) with immunological properties repair microvasculature to prevent the complications in patients with diabetes. Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation alter the functions of cells. Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases (TETs) are enzymes responsible for the demethylation of cytosine on genomic DNA in cells. We hypothesized that EPCs of diabetic patients with peripheral artery disease (D-PAD) might have altered expression levels of TETs. Subjects who were non-diabetic (ND, n = 22), with diabetes only (D, n = 29) and with D-PAD (n = 22) were recruited for the collection of EPCs, which were isolated and subjected to analysis. The mRNA and protein expression levels of TET1, TET2, and TET3 were determined using real-time PCR and immunoblot, respectively. The TET1 mRNA expression level in ND group was lower than that in the D and D-PAD groups. The TET3 mRNA level in the ND group was higher than that in the D group, which was higher than that in the D-PAD group. The TET1 protein level in the D-PAD group, but not the D group, was higher than that in the ND group. The TET2 protein level in the D-PAD group, but not the D group, was lower than that in the ND group. The TET3 protein level in the ND group was higher than that in the D group, which was higher than that in the D-PAD group, which is the lowest among the three groups. The changes of TETs protein levels were due to the alterations of their transcripts. These probably lead to epigenetic changes, which may be responsible for the reductions of EPCs numbers and functions in patients with the D-PAD. The expression pattern of TET3 mRNA and TET3 protein in EPCs may be a biomarker of angiopathy in diabetic patients.",The Role of Micronutrients in Graft-VS.-Host Disease: Immunomodulatory Effects of Vitamins A and D.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574143,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"Graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) remains a major obstacle to the success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). GVHD occurs because donor T cells in the allograft recognize the genetically disparate host as foreign and attack the transplant recipient's tissues. While genetic incompatibility between donor and recipient is the primary determinant for the extent of alloimmune response, GVHD incidence and severity are also influenced by non-genetic factors. Recent advances in immunology establish that environmental factors, including dietary micronutrients, contribute significantly to modulating various immune responses and may influence the susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of experimental animals and humans. Emerging clinical and preclinical evidence indicates that certain micronutrients may participate in regulating GVHD risk after allogeneic HSCT. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding with respect to the potential role of micronutrients in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic GVHD, focusing on vitamins A and D.",The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor as an Immune-Modulator of Atmospheric Particulate Matter-Mediated Autoimmunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574142,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"This review examines the current literature on the effects of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) on autoimmune disease and proposes a new role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) as a modulator of T cells in PM-mediated autoimmune disease. There is a significant body of literature regarding the strong epidemiologic correlations between PM exposures and worsened autoimmune diseases. Genetic predispositions account for 30% of all autoimmune disease leaving environmental factors as major contributors. Increases in incidence and prevalence of autoimmune disease have occurred concurrently with an increase in air pollution. Currently, atmospheric PM is considered to be the greatest environmental health risk worldwide. Atmospheric PM is a complex heterogeneous mixture composed of diverse adsorbed organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxins, among others. Exposure to atmospheric PM has been shown to aggravate several autoimmune diseases. Despite strong correlations between exposure to atmospheric PM and worsened autoimmune disease, the mechanisms underlying aggravated disease are largely unknown. The AHR is a ligand activated transcription factor that responds to endogenous and exogenous ligands including toxicants present in PM, such as PAHs and dioxins. A few studies have investigated the effects of atmospheric PM on AHR activation and immune function and demonstrated that atmospheric PM can activate the AHR, change cytokine expression, and alter T cell differentiation. Several studies have found that the AHR modulates the balance between regulatory and effector T cell functions and drives T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo using murine models of autoimmune disease. However, there are very few studies on the role of AHR in PM-mediated autoimmune disease. The AHR plays a critical role in the balance of effector and regulatory T cells and in autoimmune disease. With increased incidence and prevalence of autoimmune disease occurring concurrently with increases in air pollution, potential mechanisms that drive inflammatory and exacerbated disease need to be elucidated. This review focuses on the AHR as a potential mechanistic target for modulating T cell responses associated with PM-mediated autoimmune disease providing the most up-to-date literature on the role of AHR in autoreactive T cell function and autoimmune disease.",MicroRNA-31 Reduces the Motility of Proinflammatory T Helper 1 Lymphocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574141,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"Proinflammatory type 1 T helper (Th1) cells are enriched in inflamed tissues and contribute to the maintenance of chronic inflammation in rheumatic diseases. Here we show that the microRNA- (miR-) 31 is upregulated in murine Th1 cells with a history of repeated reactivation and in memory Th cells isolated from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatic joint disease. Knock-down of miR-31 resulted in the upregulation of genes associated with cytoskeletal rearrangement and motility and induced the expression of target genes involved in T cell activation, chemokine receptor- and integrin-signaling. Accordingly, inhibition of miR-31 resulted in increased migratory activity of repeatedly activated Th1 cells. The transcription factors T-bet and FOXO1 act as positive and negative regulators of T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated miR-31 expression, respectively. Taken together, our data show that a gene regulatory network involving miR-31, T-bet, and FOXO1 controls the migratory behavior of proinflammatory Th1 cells.",Induction of Proinflammatory Multiple Sclerosis-Associated Retrovirus Envelope Protein by Human Herpesvirus-6A and CD46 Receptor Engagement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574140,Frontiers in immunology,2018 12 25,"The aberrant expression of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) elements of the HERV-W family has been associated with different diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). In particular, the expression of the envelope protein (Env) from the multiple sclerosis-associated retrovirus (MSRV), a member of HERV-W family and known for its potent proinflammatory activity, is repeatedly detected in the brain lesions and blood of MS patients. Furthermore, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection has long been suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS and neuroinflammation. We show here that both HHV-6A and stimulation of its receptor, transmembrane glycoprotein CD46, induce the expression of MSRV-Env. The engagement of extracellular domains SCR3 and SCR4 of CD46-Cyt1 isoform was required for MSRV-env transactivation, limiting thus the MSRV-Env induction to the CD46 ligands binding these domains, including C3b component of complement, specific monoclonal antibodies, and both infectious and UV-inactivated HHV-6A, but neither HHV-6B nor measles virus vaccine strain. Induction of MSRV-Env required CD46 Cyt-1 singling and was abolished by the inhibitors of protein kinase C. Finally, both membrane-expressed and secreted MSRV-Env trigger TLR4 signaling, displaying thus a proinflammatory potential, characteristic for this viral protein. These data expand the specter of HHV-6A effects in the modulation of the immune response and support the hypothesis that cross-talks between exogenous and endogenous viruses may contribute to inflammatory diseases and participate in neuroinflammation. Furthermore, they reveal a new function of CD46, known as an inhibitor of complement activation and receptor for several pathogens, in transactivation of HERV env genes, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases."

Compared to low voltage long time ohmic heating (5 V/cm, 8.50 min, LVLT) and WB (5.50 min), the high voltage short time ohmic heating (10 V/cm, 1.75 min, HVST) had much shorter heating time. Compared to the samples of control (CT), there were a total of 213 differential metabolites identified, among them, 73, 78, and 62 were presented in HVST, LVLT, and WB samples, revealing a stronger metabolomic response of E. coli cells to HVST and LVLT than WB. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the significantly enriched pathways were biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids (alanine, arginine, aspartate, and glutamate, etc.), followed by aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis among the three treatments. This is the first metabolomic study of E. coli cells in response to ohmic heating and presents an important step toward understanding the mechanism of ohmic heating on microbial inactivation, and can serve as a theoretical basis for better application of ohmic heating in food products.",A Nanostructured Lipid System to Improve the Oral Bioavailability of Ruthenium(II) Complexes for the Treatment of Infections Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574128,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 25,"Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious, airborne disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis that mainly affects the lungs. Fortunately, tuberculosis is a curable disease, and in recent years, death rates for this disease have decreased. However, the existence of antibiotic-resistant strains and the occurrence of co-infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have led to increased mortality in recent years. Another area of concern is that one-third of the world's population is currently infected with M. tuberculosis in its latent state, serving as a potential reservoir for active TB. In an effort to address the failure of current TB drugs, greater attention is being given to the importance of bioinorganic chemistry as an ally in new research into the development of anti-TB drugs. Ruthenium (Ru) is a chemical element that can mimic iron (Fe) in the body. In previous studies involving the following heteroleptic Ru complexes, [Ru(pic)(dppb)(bipy)]PF6 (SCAR1), [Ru(pic)(dppb)(Me-bipy)]PF6 (SCAR2), [Ru(pic)(dppb)(phen)]PF6 (SCAR4), cis-[Ru(pic)(dppe)2]PF6 (SCAR5), and [Ru(pic)(dppe)(phen)]PF6 (SCAR7), we observed excellent anti-TB activity, moderate cell-toxicity, and a lack of oral bioavailability in an in vivo model of these complexes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity and oral bioavailability of these complexes by loading them into a nanostructured lipid system. The nanostructured lipid system was generated using different ratios of surfactant (soybean phosphatidylcholine, Eumulgin®, and sodium oleate), aqueous phase (phosphate buffer with a concentration of 1X and pH 7.4), and oil (cholesterol) to generate a system for the incorporation of Ru(II) compounds. The anti-TB activity of the compounds was determined using a microdilution assay with Resazurin (REMA) against strains of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and clinical isolates resistant. Cytotoxicity assay using J774.A1 cells (ATCC TIB-67) and intra-macrophage activity were performed. The oral bioavailability assay was used to analyze blood collected from female BALB/C mice. Plasma collected from the same mice was analyzed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to quantify the number of Ru ions. The complexes loaded into the nanostructured lipid system maintained in vitro activity and toxicity was found to be reduced compared with the compounds that were not loaded. The complexes showed intra-macrophagic activity and were orally bioavailable.",Development of Neutralizing and Non-neutralizing Antibodies Targeting Known and Novel Epitopes of TcdB of Clostridioides difficile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574127,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 25,"Clostridioides difficile is the causative bacterium in 15-20% of all antibiotic associated diarrheas. The symptoms associated with C. difficile infection (CDI) are primarily induced by the two large exotoxins TcdA and TcdB. Both toxins enter target cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Although different toxin receptors have been identified, it is no valid therapeutic option to prevent receptor endocytosis. Therapeutics, such as neutralizing antibodies, directly targeting both toxins are in development. Interestingly, only the anti-TcdB antibody bezlotoxumab but not the anti-TcdA antibody actoxumab prevented recurrence of CDI in clinical trials. In this work, 31 human antibody fragments against TcdB were selected by antibody phage display from the human naive antibody gene libraries HAL9/10. These antibody fragments were further characterized by in vitro neutralization assays. The epitopes of the neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody fragments were analyzed by domain mapping, TcdB fragment phage display, and peptide arrays, to identify neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes. A new neutralizing epitope within the glucosyltransferase domain of TcdB was identified, providing new insights into the relevance of different toxin regions in respect of neutralization and toxicity.",Water Quality and Total Microbial Load: A Double-Threshold Identification Procedure Intended for Space Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574126,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 25,"During longer-lasting future space missions, water renewal by ground-loaded supplies will become increasingly expensive and unmanageable for months. Space exploration by self-sufficient spacecrafts is thus demanding the development of culture-independent microbiological methods for in-flight water monitoring to counteract possible contamination risks. In this study, we aimed at evaluating total microbial load data assessed by selected early-warning techniques with current or promising perspectives for space applications (i.e., HPC, ATP-metry, qPCR, flow cytometry), through the analysis of water sources with constitutively different contamination levels (i.e., chlorinated and unchlorinated tap waters, groundwaters, river waters, wastewaters). Using a data-driven double-threshold identification procedure, we presented new reference values of water quality based on the assessment of the total microbial load. Our approach is suitable to provide an immediate alert of microbial load peaks, thus enhancing the crew responsiveness in case of unexpected events due to water contamination and treatment failure. Finally, the backbone dataset could help in managing water quality and monitoring issues for both space and Earth-based applications.",Predominant Yeasts During Artisanal Mezcal Fermentation and Their Capacity to Ferment Maguey Juice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574125,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 25,"Artisanal mezcal is produced by the natural fermentation of maguey juice, which frequently results in a process that becomes stuck or is sluggish. Using selected indigenous starter inoculums of Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces yeasts is considered beneficial in overcoming these problems and thereby preserving the essence of the artisanal process. In this work, three hundred and four yeast isolates were recovered from 17 distilleries and then grouped by the ARDRA analysis, their restriction profiles were clustered in 15 groups. Four of them included 90% of all isolates, and these were identified using the sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the large-subunit rDNA. Pichia kudriavzevii, Pichia manshurica, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Kluyveromyces marxianus were detected as predominant species. Both species belonging to the Pichia genus were detected in 88% of the distilleries, followed by S. cerevisiae (70%) and K. marxianus (50%). In order to evaluate the fermentative capacity, one strain of each species was assessed in a pure and mixed culture in two culture media, filtered maguey juice (MJ) and maguey juice including its bagasse (MJB). Findings demonstrated that non-Saccharomyces yeast presented better growth than that of S. cerevisiae. K. marxianus PA16 was more efficient for ethanol production than S. cerevisiae DI14. It produced 32 g/L of ethanol with a yield of 0.47 g/g and efficient of 90%. While, P. kudriavzevii produced more ethyl acetate (280 mg/L) than the others species. All fermentations were characterized by the presence of isobutyl and isoamyl alcohol. The presence of K. marxianus in a mixed culture, improved the ethanol production and volatile compounds increased using co-cultures.",Hospitalized Pets as a Source of Carbapenem-Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574124,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 25,"The massive and irrational use of antibiotics in livestock productions has fostered the occurrence and spread of resistance to ""old class antimicrobials."" To cope with that phenomenon, some regulations have been already enforced in the member states of the European Union. However, a role of livestock animals in the relatively recent alerts on the rapid worldwide increase of resistance to last-choice antimicrobials as carbapenems is very unlikely. Conversely, these antimicrobials are increasingly administered in veterinary hospitals whose role in spreading bacteria or mobile genetic elements has not adequately been addressed so far. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 105 hospitalized and 100 non-hospitalized pets with the aim of measuring the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) colonizing dogs and cats, either hospitalized or not hospitalized and estimating the relative odds. Stool samples were inoculated on MacConkey agar plates containing 1 mg/L imipenem which were then incubated aerobically at 37°C ± 1 for 48 h. Isolated bacteria were identified first by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were confirmed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The genetic basis of resistance was investigated using PCR methods, gene or whole genome sequencing (WGS). The prevalence of pets harboring carbapenem-resistant bacteria was 11.4 and 1.0% in hospitalized and not-hospitalized animals, respectively, with an odds ratio of 12.8 (p < 0.01). One pet carried two diverse isolates. Overall, 14 gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria, specifically, one Acinetobacter radioresistens, five Acinetobacter baumannii, six Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were isolated. The Acinetobacter species carried acquired carbapenemases genes encoded by blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-23. In contrast, Pseudomonas phenotypic resistance was associated with the presence of mutations in the oprD gene. Notably, inherent carbapenem-resistant isolates of S. maltophilia were also resistant to the first-line recommended chemotherapeutic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This study estimates the risk of colonization by carbapenem-resistant non-fermenting GNB in pets hospitalized in veterinary tertiary care centers and highlights their potential role in spreading resistance genes among the animal and human community. Public health authorities should consider extending surveillance systems and putting the release of critical antibiotics under more strict control in order to manage the infection/colonization of pets in veterinary settings.","Combining Phylogenetic and Network Approaches to Identify HIV-1 Transmission Links in San Mateo County, California.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574123,Frontiers in microbiology,2018 12 25,"The HIV epidemic in San Mateo County is sustained by multiple overlapping risk groups and is an important hub for HIV transmission in northern California. Limited access to care has led historically to delayed clinical presentation, higher rates of opportunistic infections, and an increased prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance. The virologic and clinical consequences of treatment within these multiple ethnic and behavioral groups are poorly understood, highlighting the need for efficient surveillance strategies that are able to elucidate transmission networks and drug resistance patterns. We obtained sequence data from a group of 316 HIV-positive individuals in the San Mateo AIDS Program over a 14-year period and integrated epidemiologic, phylogenetic, and network approaches to characterize transmission clusters, risk factors and drug resistance. Drug resistance mutations were identified using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. A maximum likelihood tree was inferred in RAxML and subjected to clustering analysis in Cluster Picker. Network analysis using pairwise genetic distances was performed in HIV-TRACE. Participants were primarily male (60%), white Hispanics and non-Hispanics (32%) and African American (20.6%). The most frequent behavior risk factor was male-male sex (33.5%), followed by heterosexual (23.4%) and injection drug use (9.5%). Nearly all sequences were subtype B (96%) with subtypes A, C, and CRF01_AE also observed. Sequences from 65% of participants had at least one drug resistance mutation. Clustered transmissions included a higher number of women when compared to non-clustered individuals and were more likely to include heterosexual or people who inject drugs (PWID). Detailed analysis of the largest network (N = 47) suggested that PWID played a central role in overall transmission of HIV-1 as well as bridging men who have sex with men (MSM) transmission with heterosexual/PWID among primarily African American men. Combined phylogenetic and network analysis of HIV sequence data identified several overlapping risk factors in the epidemic, including MSM, heterosexual and PWID transmission with a disproportionate impact on African Americans and a high prevalence of drug resistance.",Sirtuins and Insulin Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574122,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 25,"The mammalian Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are an evolutionarily conserved family of NAD+-dependent deacylase and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase. Sirtuins display distinct subcellular localizations and functions and are involved in cell survival, senescence, metabolism and genome stability. Among the mammalian Sirtuins, SIRT1 and SIRT6 have been thoroughly investigated and have prominent metabolic regulatory roles. Moreover, SIRT1 and SIRT6 have been implicated in obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), fatty liver disease and cardiovascular diseases. However, the roles of other Sirtuins are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown that these Sirtuins also play important roles in inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and energy metabolism. Insulin resistance is the critical pathological trait of obesity and metabolic syndrome as well as the core defect in T2DM. Accumulating clinical and experimental animal evidence suggests the potential roles of the remaining Sirtuins in the regulation of insulin resistance through diverse biological mechanisms. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the functions of Sirtuins in various insulin resistance-associated physiological processes, including inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, the insulin signaling pathway, glucose, and lipid metabolism. In addition, we highlight the important gaps that must be addressed in this field.",Magnetic Resonance Imaging Features of Normal Thyroid Parenchyma and Incidental Diffuse Thyroid Disease: A Single-Center Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574121,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 25,"Background: No previous studies have investigated the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) diagnosis for detecting incidental diffuse thyroid disease (DTD). This study investigated MRI features of normal thyroid parenchyma and incidental DTD. Methods: From January 2008 to December 2017, 387 patients underwent neck MRI in our hospital due to tumor/nodal staging (n = 137), lymphadenopathy (n = 122), inflammatory neck lesion (n = 85), congenital neck lesion (n = 12), and patient request (n = 31). Among them, 375 patients were excluded because of a lack of appropriate histopathological data on the thyroid parenchyma. Results: Among the patients included, 10 had normal thyroid parenchyma, 1 had Hashimoto thyroiditis, and 1 had diffuse hyperplasia. The common MRI features of normal thyroid parenchyma include iso-/slightly high and homogeneous signal intensity on T1/T2-weighted images, normal anteroposterior diameter of the thyroid gland, smooth margin, and homogeneously increased enhancement as compared to adjacent muscle. Hashimoto thyroiditis exhibited high and inhomogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images, while diffuse hyperplasia revealed an increased anteroposterior diameter and lobulated margin of the thyroid gland, and inhomogeneous enhancement. Conclusions: MRI may be helpful for detection of incidental DTD.",A Rhodnius prolixus Insulin Receptor and Its Conserved Intracellular Signaling Pathway and Regulation of Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574120,Frontiers in endocrinology,2018 12 25,"The insulin signaling pathway is a modulator of metabolism in insects and can regulate functions associated with growth and development, as well as lipid and carbohydrate balance. We have previously reported the presence of an insulin-like peptide and an insulin-like growth factor in Rhodnius prolixus, which are involved in the homeostasis of lipids and carbohydrates in post-feeding and non-feeding periods. In the present study, we have characterized the first insulin receptor (IR) to be discovered in R. prolixus, Rhopr-IR, and investigated its intracellular signaling cascade and its role in nutrient control. We identified a candidate protein sequence within R. prolixus putative peptidome and predicted its conserved features using bioinformatics. Tissue-specific expression analyses indicated that the Rhopr-IR transcript is differentially-expressed in all tissues tested, with the highest values observed in the central nervous system (CNS). Treatment of insects with the IR kinase activator BpV(phen), glucose, or porcine insulin resulted in the activation of protein phosphorylation in the fat body, and stimulated the phosphorylation of protein kinase Akt, an evolutionarily conserved key regulator of the intracellular insulin signaling cascade. We also observed activation of Akt and phosphorylation of its downstream targets glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β) and the transcription factor FOXO for several days following a blood meal. We used dsRNA to knockdown transcript expression and examined the resulting effects on metabolism and intracellular signaling. Furthermore, knockdown of the Rhopr-IR transcript increased lipid levels in the hemolymph, while reducing lipid content in the fat body. Interestingly, the levels of carbohydrates in the hemolymph and in the fat body did not show any alterations. The activation of Akt and phosphorylation of FOXO were also reduced in knockdown insects, while the phosphorylation pattern of GSK3β did not change. Our results support the identification of the first IR in R. prolixus and suggest that Rhopr-IR signaling is involved in hemolymph nutrient homeostasis and fat body storage both in post-feeding and in non-feeding stages. These metabolic effects are likely regulated by the activation of Akt and downstream cascades similar to mammalian insulin signaling pathways."

While these wide accounts override traditional methodological individualism, the study of cognition has already progressed beyond these proposed perspectives toward building integrated explanations of the mechanisms involved, including not only internal submechanisms but also interactions with others, groups, cognitive artifacts, and their environment. Wide perspectives are essentially research heuristics for building mechanistic explanations. The claim is substantiated with reference to recent developments in the study of ""mindreading"" and debates on emotions. We argue that the current practice in cognitive (neuro)science has undergone, in effect, a silent mechanistic revolution, and has turned from initial binary oppositions and abstract proposals toward the integration of wide perspectives with the rest of the cognitive (neuro)sciences.",Measuring Athletic Mental Energy (AME): Instrument Development and Validation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574106,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 25,"Although considerable research indicates that mental energy is an important factor in many domains, including athletic performance (Cook and Davis, 2006), athletic mental energy (AME) has never been conceptualized and measured. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conceptualize and develop a reliable and valid instrument to assess AME. In Study 1, a focus group interview established the initial framework of AME. Study 2 used a survey to collect athletes' experiences of AME and develop a scale draft titled ""Athletic Mental Energy Scale (AMES)."" In Study 3, we examined the psychometric properties and the underlying structure of AMES via item analysis, internal consistency, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). In Study 4, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to examine AMES's factorial validity; and examined concurrent and discriminant validity by examining correlations with athletes' life stress, positive state of mind, and burnout. In study 5, we examined the measurement invariance of the 6-factor, 18-item AMES with Taiwanese and Malaysian samples. Study 6 examined the predictive validity by comparing AMES scores of successful and unsuccessful martial artists. Across these phases, results showed a 6-factor, 18-item AMES had adequate content validity, factorial structure, nomological validity, discriminant validity, predictive validity, measurement invariance, and reliability. We suggest future studies may use AMES to examine its relationships with athletes' cognition, affect, and performance. The application of AMES in sport psychology was also discussed.",Salutogenic Affordances and Sustainability: Multiple Benefits With Edible Forest Gardens in Urban Green Spaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574105,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 25,"With increased urbanization, ecological challenges such as climate change and loss of biodiversity, and stress-related disorders globally posing a major threat to public health and wellbeing, the development of efficient multiple-use strategies for urban green spaces and infrastructures is of great importance. In addition to benefits such as climate and water regulation, food production, and biodiversity conservation, green spaces and features have been associated with various health and wellbeing outcomes from a psychological perspective. Research suggests links between exposure to green environmental qualities and restoration from psycho-physiological stress and attention fatigue, promotion of physical activity, increased neighborhood satisfaction and even reduced mortality. Especially strong associations have been observed in urban and socio-economically challenged areas. Usually such salutogenic, i.e., health-promoting, effects are explained through theories related to the notion of biophilia, i.e., the idea that humans share innate tendencies to attend to natural environments and features that have been beneficial during evolution. This paper assumes an ecological approach to perception and behavior to be fruitful in order to analyze the salutogenic potential of environments such as urban green spaces and to step beyond the ""green vs. gray"" dichotomy that has been prevalent through much of the research on health-promoting environments. Through an analysis of environmental affordances for certain perceived qualities such an approach is explored through a proposed concept for urban green space use and management, the edible forest garden. Such gardens, based on agroecological principles, have emerged as one of the most promising models regarding ecologically sustainable food production. In addition to potential contributions of importance for urban sustainability and biodiversity, we argue that the inclusion of edible forest gardens in urban green spaces - today globally dominated by lawns - also potentially could reinforce several affordances of salutogenic importance, both in terms of, e.g., social cohesion but also in regard to restoration from psycho-physiological stress and attention fatigue. Increased opportunities for contact with nature and processes of food production may also reinforce pro-environmental behaviors in the population and thus also affect long-term sustainability.",Child-Centered Design: Developing an Inclusive Letter Writing App.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574104,Frontiers in psychology,2018 12 25,"Everywhere there are children, there are screens, and child-computer interaction is ubiquitous. Despite their omnipresence, research on the impact of screens on children's learning lags behind the development of digital tools. Apple's App Store has an abundance of ""educational"" apps, but many of these apps' claims are unsubstantiated. Organizations responsible for vetting quality products for young people, such as the American Library Association, are developing resources to help identify the best digital products available, but they remain difficult to find, and there is limited guidance for app designers when it comes to designing apps for younger audiences. Our interdisciplinary, empirical study was inspired by ""co-creation"" (Sanders and Stappers, 2008) and ""cooperative inquiry"" (Druin, 2005). Starting with a seed grant from Kent State University's College of Communication and Information, our team sought to create a high-quality and inclusive alphabet app with haptic interactions and simplified gamification to reinforce the basic letter writing skills of young children. The app rewards a child's successful handwriting with an animation of a verb that corresponds with the letter they traced. Concrete animations and digital and verbal demonstrations connect the typographic letter to the handwritten counterpart. Librarian Claudia Haines' rubric (Haines, 2016) and the Dig Checklist (Kidmap, 2018.) guided our definition of ""quality,"" and children served as co-designers in two qualitative user studies. Our young designers tested prototypes, completed task booklets, and were interviewed about their preferences and their feedback informed our design. Additionally, a focus group interview with kindergarten and preschool teachers provided further feedback about the typographic design, stroke order, and gaming rewards. To be inclusive, children in both our app design and user studies were selected from a diverse pool. Our research contributes to work on co-design and cooperative inquiry in the fields of User Experience Design, human-computer interaction, human information behavior, information science, interface design, motion design, typeface design and typography for children, and early literacy development. A post-study is planned upon completion of the app.",Low Field Magnetic Stimulation Ameliorates Schizophrenia-Like Behavior and Up-Regulates Neuregulin-1 Expression in a Mouse Model of Cuprizone-Induced Demyelination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574102,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 25,"White matter and myelin sheath integrity are disrupted in schizophrenia, and non-invasive magnetic brain stimulation targeting these tracts is a promising new therapeutic approach. In particular, deep-brain reachable low field magnetic stimulation (DMS) could alleviate cognitive impairment and depressive-like behaviors in animal models. In this study, we sought to assess the effects of DMS on myelin sheath damage and schizophrenia-like behaviors in the cuprizone-induced demyelination mouse model. Mice were fed cuprizone (copper ion chelating agent, 0.2% w/w mixed with food) for 6 weeks to induce demyelination. During these 6 weeks, mice were stimulated with either sham, low-frequency (LFS, delta frequency) DMS or high-frequency (HFS, gamma Hz) DMS for 20 min each day. Behavioral tests were conducted 24 h after the final DMS session. The myelin sheath was examined by immunohistochemistry and the expression of neuregulin-1 (NRG1)/ErbB4 in the prefrontal cortex was measured with Western blotting. Six weeks of HFS significantly alleviated schizophrenia-like behaviors in cuprizone mice, including improved nesting, social interaction and sensorimotor gating, while LFS improved sensorimotor gating only. HFS and LFS both repaired the myelin sheath and increased the expression of neuregulin-1 and its receptor ErbB4, in the prefrontal cortex of demyelinated mice. Our findings show that DMS is a potential effective neuromodulation technique for the treatment of schizophrenia. One possible mechanism underlying these therapeutic effects could involve the up-regulation of NRG1/ErbB4 signaling in the prefrontal cortex.",Neurobiological Determinants of Tobacco Smoking in Schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574101,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 25,"Purpose of review: To provide an overview of the underlying neurobiology of tobacco smoking in schizophrenia, and implications for treatment of this comorbidity. Recent findings: Explanations for heavy tobacco smoking in schizophrenia include pro-cognitive effects of nicotine, and remediation of the underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Nicotine may ameliorate neurochemical deficits through nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) located on the dopamine, glutamate, and GABA neurons. Neurophysiological indices including electroencephalography, electromyography, and smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) paradigms may be biomarkers for underlying neuronal imbalances that contribute to the specific risk of tobacco smoking initiation, maintenance, and difficulty quitting within schizophrenia. Moreover, several social factors including socioeconomic factors and permissive smoking culture in mental health facilities, may contribute to the smoking behaviors (initiation, maintenance, and inability to quit smoking) within this disorder. Summary: Tobacco smoking may alleviate specific symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings and psychosocial determinants of this comorbidity may better explain these potential beneficial effects, while also providing important insights into effective treatments for smoking cessation.",Advances in Resting State Neuroimaging of Mild Cognitive Impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574100,Frontiers in psychiatry,2018 12 25,"The rapidly increasing number of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide has become a major public concern. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), characterized with accelerated memory decline than normal aging, is a stage between cognitively unimpaired and dementia. Identification of MCI in the Alzheimer's continuum from normal aging, is important for early diagnosis and improved intervention of AD. The imaging technique has been extensively used for diagnose and understanding the mechanisms of MCI. Firstly, we review the recent progresses in the research framework of MCI depending on the clinical and/or biomarker findings. Secondly, we cover studies that use of rs-fMRI (resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging) for the brain activities and functional connectivity between normal aging and MCI. Other methodologies and multi-modal studies for investigating the mechanism and early diagnosis of MCI are also discussed. Finally, we discuss how genetic and environmental factors such as education could interact with in MCI. Overall, MCI is a heterogeneous state and employing resting state neuroimaging with other AD biomarker approaches will be able to target in the more precise population and AD-related pathology process.",Identification of Crucial Genes and Pathways in Human Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy by Coexpression Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574098,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 25,"As one common disease causing young people to die suddenly due to cardiac arrest, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a disorder of heart muscle whose progression covers one complicated gene interaction network that influence the diagnosis and prognosis of it. In our research, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened, and we established a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and gene set net correlations analysis (GSNCA) for identifying crucial genes as well as pathways related to ARVC pathogenic mechanism (n = 12). In the research, the results demonstrated that there were 619 DEGs in total between non-failing donor myocardial samples and ARVC tissues (FDR < 0.05). WGCNA analysis identified the two gene modules (brown and turquoise) as being most significantly associated with ARVC state. Then the ARVC-related four key biological pathways (cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway) and four hub genes (CXCL2, TNFRSF11B, LIFR, and C5AR1) in ARVC samples were further identified by GSNCA method. Finally, we used t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for validating hub genes, results showed significant differences in t-test and their AUC areas all greater than 0.8. Together, these results revealed that the new four hub genes as well as key pathways that might be involved into ARVC diagnosis. Even though further experimental validation is required for the implication by association, our findings demonstrate that the computational methods based on systems biology might complement the traditional gene-wide approaches, as such, might offer a new insight in therapeutic intervention within rare diseases of people like ARVC.",Redox Dependent Modifications of Ryanodine Receptor: Basic Mechanisms and Implications in Heart Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574097,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 19,"Heart contraction vitally depends on tightly controlled intracellular Ca regulation. Because contraction is mainly driven by Ca released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), this organelle plays a particularly important role in Ca regulation. The type two ryanodine receptor (RyR2) is the major SR Ca release channel in ventricular myocytes. Several cardiac pathologies, including myocardial infarction and heart failure, are associated with increased RyR2 activity and diastolic SR Ca leak. It has been suggested that the increased RyR2 activity plays an important role in arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. Several studies have linked increased SR Ca leak during myocardial infarction and heart failure to the activation of RyR2 in response to oxidative stress. This activation might include direct oxidation of RyR2 as well as indirect activation via phosphorylation or altered interactions with regulatory proteins. Out of ninety cysteine residues per RyR2 subunit, twenty one were reported to be in reduced state that could be potential targets for redox modifications that include S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation, and disulfide cross-linking. Despite its clinical significance, molecular mechanisms of RyR dysfunction during oxidative stress are not fully understood. Herein we review the most recent insights into redox-dependent modulation of RyR2 during oxidative stress and heart diseases.",Intermittent Hypoxia Activates Duration-Dependent Protective and Injurious Mechanisms in Mouse Lung Endothelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574096,Frontiers in physiology,2018 12 25,"Intermittent hypoxia is a major factor in clinical conditions like the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome or the cyclic recruitment and derecruitment of atelectasis in acute respiratory distress syndrome and positive pressure mechanical ventilation. In vivo investigations of the direct impact of intermittent hypoxia are frequently hampered by multiple co-morbidities of patients. Therefore, cell culture experiments are important model systems to elucidate molecular mechanisms that are involved in the cellular response to alternating oxygen conditions and could represent future targets for tailored therapies. In this study, we focused on mouse lung endothelial cells as a first frontier to encounter altered oxygen due to disturbances in airway or lung function, that play an important role in the development of secondary diseases like vascular disease and pulmonary hypertension. We analyzed key markers for endothelial function including cell adhesion molecules, molecules involved in regulation of fibrinolysis, hemostasis, redox balance, and regulators of gene expression like miRNAs. Results show that short-time exposure to intermittent hypoxia has little impact on vitality and health of cells. At early timepoints and up to 24 h, many endothelial markers are unchanged in their expression and some indicators of injury are even downregulated. However, in the long-term, multiple signaling pathways are activated, that ultimately result in cellular inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis."

Additionally, AβOs-exposed neurons exhibit a decrease in the protein content of type-2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2) Ca2+ channels, which exert critical roles in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory processes. The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevents these deleterious effects of AβOs in vitro. The main contribution of the present work is to show that AβOs injections directly into the hippocampus, by engaging oxidation-mediated reversible pathways significantly decreased RyR2 protein content but increased single RyR2 channel activation by Ca2+ and caused considerable spatial memory deficits. AβOs injections into the CA3 hippocampal region impaired rat performance in the Oasis maze spatial memory task, decreased hippocampal glutathione levels and overall content of plasticity-related proteins (c-Fos, Arc, and RyR2) and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, in hippocampus-derived mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) AβOs injections increased RyR2 levels. Rats fed with NAC for 3-weeks prior to AβOs injections displayed comparable redox potential, RyR2 and Arc protein contents, similar ERK1/2 phosphorylation and RyR2 single channel activation by Ca2+ as saline-injected (control) rats. NAC-fed rats subsequently injected with AβOs displayed the same behavior in the spatial memory task as control rats. Based on the present in vivo results, we propose that redox-sensitive neuronal RyR2 channels partake in the mechanism underlying AβOs-induced memory disruption in rodents.",Effects of Phase-Locking Deficits on Speech Recognition in Older Adults With Presbycusis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574084,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2018 12 25,"Objective: People with presbycusis (PC) often report difficulties in speech recognition, especially under noisy listening conditions. Investigating the PC-related changes in central representations of envelope signals and temporal fine structure (TFS) signals of speech sounds is critical for understanding the mechanism underlying the PC-related deficit in speech recognition. Frequency-following responses (FFRs) to speech stimulation can be used to examine the subcortical encoding of both envelope and TFS speech signals. This study compared FFRs to speech signals between listeners with PC and those with clinically normal hearing (NH) under either quiet or noise-masking conditions. Methods: FFRs to a 170-ms speech syllable /da/ were recorded under either a quiet or noise-masking (with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8 dB) condition in 14 older adults with PC and 13 age-matched adults with NH. The envelope (FFRENV) and TFS (FFRTFS) components of FFRs were analyzed separately by adding and subtracting the alternative polarity responses, respectively. Speech recognition in noise was evaluated in each participant. Results: In the quiet condition, compared with the NH group, the PC group exhibited smaller F0 and H3 amplitudes and decreased stimulus-response (S-R) correlation for FFRENV but not for FFRTFS. Both the H2 and H3 amplitudes and the S-R correlation of FFRENV significantly decreased in the noise condition compared with the quiet condition in the NH group but not in the PC group. Moreover, the degree of hearing loss was correlated with noise-induced changes in FFRTFS morphology. Furthermore, the speech-in-noise (SIN) threshold was negatively correlated with the noise-induced change in H2 (for FFRENV) and the S-R correlation for FFRENV in the quiet condition. Conclusion: Audibility affects the subcortical encoding of both envelope and TFS in PC patients. The impaired ability to adjust the balance between the envelope and TFS in the noise condition may be part of the mechanism underlying PC-related deficits in speech recognition in noise. FFRs can predict SIN perception performance.",A Novel Approach for Modeling Neural Responses to Joint Perturbations Using the NARMAX Method and a Hierarchical Neural Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574083,Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2018 12 25,"The human nervous system is an ensemble of connected neuronal networks. Modeling and system identification of the human nervous system helps us understand how the brain processes sensory input and controls responses at the systems level. This study aims to propose an advanced approach based on a hierarchical neural network and non-linear system identification method to model neural activity in the nervous system in response to an external somatosensory input. The proposed approach incorporates basic concepts of Non-linear AutoRegressive Moving Average Model with eXogenous input (NARMAX) and neural network to acknowledge non-linear closed-loop neural interactions. Different from the commonly used polynomial NARMAX method, the proposed approach replaced the polynomial non-linear terms with a hierarchical neural network. The hierarchical neural network is built based on known neuroanatomical connections and corresponding transmission delays in neural pathways. The proposed method is applied to an experimental dataset, where cortical activities from ten young able-bodied individuals are extracted from electroencephalographic signals while applying mechanical perturbations to their wrist joint. The results yielded by the proposed method were compared with those obtained by the polynomial NARMAX and Volterra methods, evaluated by the variance accounted for (VAF). Both the proposed and polynomial NARMAX methods yielded much better modeling results than the Volterra model. Furthermore, the proposed method modeled cortical responded with a mean VAF of 69.35% for a three-step ahead prediction, which is significantly better than the VAF from a polynomial NARMAX model (mean VAF 47.09%). This study provides a novel approach for precise modeling of cortical responses to sensory input. The results indicate that the incorporation of knowledge of neuroanatomical connections in building a realistic model greatly improves the performance of system identification of the human nervous system.",Volumetric MRI Analysis of a Case of Severe Ventriculomegaly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574082,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 25,"We present a case of a 60-year-old male referred to a tertiary psychiatric facility for diagnostic assessment due to low mood and behavioral changes. Neurological examination of the patient was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated overt ventriculomegaly with gross dilatation of lateral and third ventricles. Manual segmentation of gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated that the patient had a ventricular volume almost 46 times greater than that of healthy volunteers in the same age range. Despite his striking degree of ventriculomegaly and cortical thinning, he presented primarily with psychiatric and cognitive complaints. These represented a major neurocognitive disorder. His behavior improved with a structured environment and routine instituted by the treating team. This is a dramatic example of the brain's response to extreme structural remodeling. Elements of pluripotentiality may counteract degeneracy to preserve functions in cases of serious structural stress in the brain. Changes in the neural circuitry of emotional processing, and/or disruption in signaling pathways important for synaptogenesis may influence depression pathophysiology. How this circuitry is modified in cases of extreme structural stress such as long-standing overt ventriculomegaly, is unclear. This case demonstrates the ability of the brain to generate a normal phenotype despite structural changes that seem incompatible with advanced cognitive function, illustrating the substantial potential for adaptability and plasticity in the brain.",Investigating Multiple Streams of Consciousness: Using Descriptive Experience Sampling to Explore Internally and Externally Directed Streams of Thought.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574081,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 25,"Research into resting-state cognition has often struggled with the challenge of assessing inner experience in the resting state. We employed Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES), a method aimed at generating detailed and high-fidelity descriptions of experience, to investigate how experience in the resting state can vary between internal, external, and multiple simultaneous streams. Using a large body of experiential and brain activation data acquired from five DES participants, independent raters classified sampled moments of experience according to whether they were internally directed, externally directed, or contained elements of both at the same time. In line with existing models, comparison of internal with external experience samples identified a network of regions associated with the default mode network. Regions of interest resulting from the whole-brain contrasts successfully predicted independent raters' forced-choice categorizations of samples for which experience had a simultaneous internal and external focus. The present study is distinctive in tying neural activations in the resting state to detailed descriptions of specific phenomenology, and in demonstrating how the DES method enables a particularly nuanced analysis of moments of experience, especially their ability simultaneously to incorporate both an internal and an external focus. The study represents an integration of rich phenomenology and characterizations of brain activity, tracing interpretive paths from phenomenology to neural activation and vice versa.",Brain Mechanisms Underlying Visuo-Orthographic Deficits in Children With Developmental Dyslexia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574080,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 25,"Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the reading difficulty caused by developmental dyslexia (DD). The current study examined visuo-orthographic processing in children with dyslexia to determine whether orthographic deficits are explainable based solely on visual deficits. To identify orthographic-specific, visual perception-specific, and overlapping deficits, we included two tasks (lexical and perceptual) in three Chinese subject groups: children with DD, age-matched controls (AC), and reading matched controls (RC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the left precuneus showed decreased activation across both tasks for the DD group compared to the two control groups, thus reflecting visual processing deficits in children with DD, which also affects orthographic processing. Furthermore, we found that the functional connectivity between left middle occipital gyrus (LMOG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was decreased in the DD group compared to AC and RC for only the lexical task. This suggests a weaker association between orthography and phonology for children with DD. In addition, the children with DD showed decreased functional connectivity between the LMOG and right parahippocampal gyrus for only the visual perceptual task, thereby indicating a weaker association between visual regions for DD during visual symbol processing. Taken together, our findings suggest that the observed orthographic processing deficit in DD might be driven by both a basic visual deficit, and a linguistic deficit.",Age-Related Alterations in Electroencephalography Connectivity and Network Topology During n-Back Working Memory Task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574079,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 25,"The study of the healthy brain in elders, especially age-associated alterations in cognition, is important to understand the deficits created by Alzheimer's disease (AD), which imposes a tremendous burden on individuals, families, and society. Although, the changes in synaptic connectivity and reorganization of brain networks that accompany aging are gradually becoming understood, little is known about how normal aging affects brain inter-regional synchronization and functional networks when items are held in working memory (WM). According to the classic Sternberg WM paradigm, we recorded multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) from healthy adults (young and senior) in three different conditions, i.e., the resting state, 0-back (control) task, and 2-back task. The phase lag index (PLI) between EEG channels was computed and then weighted and undirected network was constructed based on the PLI matrix. The effects of aging on network topology were examined using a brain connectivity toolbox. The results showed that age-related alteration was more prominent when the 2-back task was engaged, especially in the theta band. For the younger adults, the WM task evoked a significant increase in the clustering coefficient of the beta-band functional connectivity network, which was absent in the older adults. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between the behavioral performance of WM and EEG metrics in the theta and gamma bands, suggesting the potential use of those measures as biomarkers for the evaluation of cognitive training, for instance. Taken together, our findings shed further light on the underlying mechanism of WM in physiological aging and suggest that different EEG frequencies appear to have distinct functional correlates in cognitive aging. Analysis of inter-regional synchronization and topological characteristics based on graph theory is thus an appropriate way to explore natural age-related changes in the human brain.",Role of Sensorimotor Cortex in Gestural-Verbal Integration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574078,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2018 12 25,"Action comprehension that is related to language or gestural integration has been shown to engage the motor system in the brain, thus providing preliminary evidence for the gestural-verbal embodiment concept. Based on the involvement of the sensorimotor cortex (M1) in language processing, we aimed to further explore its role in the cognitive embodiment necessary for gestural-verbal integration. As such, we applied anodal (excitatory) and sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left M1 (with reference electrode over the contralateral supraorbital region) during a gestural-verbal integration task where subjects had to make a decision about the semantic congruency of the gesture (prime) and the word (target). We used a cross-over within-subject design in young subjects. Attentional load and simple reaction time (RT) tasks served as control conditions, applied during stimulation (order of three tasks was counterbalanced). Our results showed that anodal (atDCS) compared to sham tDCS (stDCS) reduced RTs in the gestural-verbal integration task, specifically for incongruent pairs of gestures and verbal expressions, with no effect on control task performance. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of the sensorimotor system in gestural-verbal integration performance. Further, our results suggest that functional modulation induced by sensorimotor tDCS may be specific to gestural-verbal integration. Future studies should now evaluate the modulatory effect of tDCS on semantic congruency by using tDCS over additional brain regions and include assessments of neural connectivity.",The Mitochondrion as Potential Interface in Early-Life Stress Brain Programming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574076,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018 12 25,"Mitochondria play a central role in cellular energy-generating processes and are master regulators of cell life.

By this means, mitochondria are particularly apt to mediate brain programming by early-life stress (ELS) and to serve at the same time as subcellular substrate in the programming process. With a focus on mitochondria's integrated role in metabolism, steroidogenesis and oxidative stress, we review current findings on altered mitochondrial function in the brain, the placenta and peripheral blood cells following ELS-dependent programming in rodents and recent insights from humans exposed to early life adversity (ELA).

Young (2-months) and aged (18-months) male Wistar rats were exposed to the EPM test, at the beginning, mid-time or at the end of the light period. On the acquisition trial, the animals were placed individually at the end of one of the open arms of the EPM and the latency to enter in the enclosed arms was registered (cut-off time 60 s). The test was repeated 24 h later on. A longer latency period to reach the enclosed arm indicated poor retention compared to significantly shorter latencies. There were no significant differences between groups on the acquisition trial. In all tested periods, the latency time on the 24 h retention trial was significantly shorter in the young rats compared to the old ones. Furthermore, in the early and mid-time period of the light period, the young rats showed significantly decreased transfer latency (TL) time on the 24 h retention trial in comparison with the acquisition trial. In the aged rats, the TL time on the 24 h retention trial was significantly longer at the end of the light period, in comparison to the two other testing periods. In conclusion, aging significantly affects memory and the more critical period for memory process in both young and old animals, particularly at the end of the light period of the circadian cycle."

In detail, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data of 69 MCI patients and 63 HC matched well on gender, age, and education level were collected and analyzed with voxel-based morphometry method first, then the volume features of every region of interest (ROI) belonging to the above-mentioned three atlases were calculated and compared between MCI and HC groups, respectively. At last, the abnormal volume features were selected as the classification features for a proposed support vector machine based identification method. After the leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate the classification performance, our results reported accuracies of 83, 92, and 89% with AAL-90, BN-246, and AAL-1024 atlas, respectively, suggesting that future studies should pay more attention to the selection of brain partition schemes in the atlas-based studies.

Administration of tideglusib to these lines led to the rescue of neuritic impairments. Moreover, the treatment restored increased cell death and ameliorated the membranous inclusions in iPSC derived SPG11 neurons. Our results provide a first evidence for the rescue of neurite pathology in SPG11-HSP by tideglusib. The current lack of disease-modifying treatments for SPG11 and related types of complicated HSP renders tideglusib a candidate compound for future clinical application.",Regional Homogeneity and Multivariate Pattern Analysis of Cervical Spondylosis Neck Pain and the Modulation Effect of Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574062,Frontiers in neuroscience,2018 12 25,"Objects: We investigated brain functional alteration in patients with chronic cervical spondylosis neck pain (CSNP) compared to healthy controls (HCs) and the effect of intervention. Methods: 104 CSNP patients and 96 matched HCs were recruited. Patients received 4 weeks of treatment. Resting-state fMRI and Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) were collected before and after treatment. Resting state regional homogeneity (rs-ReHo) and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) were applied to (1) investigate rs-ReHo differences between CSNP patients and controls and the effect of longitudinal treatment and (2) classify CSNP patients from HCs and predict clinical outcomes before treatment using MVPA. Results: We found that (1) CSNP patients showed decreased rs-ReHo in the left sensorimotor cortex and right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ), and rs-ReHo at the rTPJ significantly increased after treatment; (2) rs-ReHo at rTPJ was associated with NPQ at baseline, and pre- and post-treatment rs-ReHo changes at rTPJ were associated with NPQ changes in CSNP patients; and (3) MVPA could discriminate CSNP patients from HCs with 72% accuracy and predict clinical outcomes with a mean absolute error of 19.6%. Conclusion: CSNP patients are associated with dysfunction of the rTPJ and sensorimotor area. Significance: rTPJ plays on important role in the pathophysiology and development of CSNP.",Efficacy of Antenatal Intravenous Immunoglobulin Treatment in Pregnancies at High Risk due to Alloimmunization to Red Blood Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574060,Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,2018 12 25,Alloimmunization to red blood cells (RBCs) may result in fetal anemia prior to 20 weeks gestation.

Three metabolic pathways of ethanol were describe in human - alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), microsomal ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS, CYP2E1) and catalase. Ethanol directly bounds to different molecules (e.g. etylglucuronid) and ethanol per se and its metabolites have toxic effect on biological stuctures. Alcohol abuse is well known for its liver diseases e.g. cirrhosis (the most frequent cause in Europe and US) and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic alcohol comsumption leads to cardiovascular diseases (e.g. hypertension, cardiomyopathy), pancreas damage, myopathies, osteoporosis, neurological and psychiatry diseases including fetal alcohol syndrome and addiction. Alcohol consumption may lead to cancer via several mechanisms, per se (solvent for carcinogens) and its metabolites. Acetaldehyde, a cancerogen, has mutagenic effect on DNA, oxidation of ethanol produces the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with different effects e.g. cell transformation, DNA, protein and lipid damage. The changes of folate metabolism, altered methylation of DNA, reduction of retionic acid influences on cancer development. The high rate of alcohol consumption has become a great social-health problem. Consumption of alcohol is still increasing in many countries, but in some countries is stable or decreasing (e.g. Mediterranean region). The data across Europe shows that 10% of all cancers in men and 3% of all cancers in women can be attributed to alcohol consumption. Australian data suggests that alcohol intake accounts for 5% of the total cancer burden of disease. Alcohol consumption is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in many developed countries.",The Role of Laboratory Medicine for Health During Pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574038,EJIFCC,2018 12 25,"Pregnancy produces profound physiological changes that increase in significance as it progresses. These changes include hormonal changes, metabolic changes, increases of plasma volume up to 50%, alterations to the balance of the coagulation system in favour of clotting, and GFR increases to a peak 50% above prepregnancy levels. Since healthy physiological changes occur during pregnancy, different reference intervals may be needed. First antenatal screens usually include Complete blood count, Blood group and antibody screen, rubella antibody status, syphilis serology, Hepatitis B serology and HIV abs testing. Additional testing in early pregnancy may be added to the first antenatal screen such as varicella, Chlamydia and vitamin D tests. The most important test in the second antenatal testing screen is gestational diabetes screening and protein detection in urine to rule out preeclampsia. Screening for Down syndrome, other chromosomal abnormalities and neural tube defects is recommended for all pregnant women above the age of 35 years. Additionally, 37 weeks into pregnancy, a swab to detect Group B streptococcal (GBS) infection is recommended.",Prenatal Screening for Chromosomal Abnormalities: Where do We Stand Today in Mediterranean Countries?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30574037,EJIFCC,2018 12 25,"Over the last 4 decades the practice of prenatal screening has evolved from the second-trimester triple test to complex combinations of biophysical and biochemical testing for aneuploidy, testing of fetal DNA in the maternal circulation and development of screening tests for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Presently, combined test in the 1st trimester is the preferred multimarker screening protocol in most countries. Since 2010, cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma, in combination with the next generation sequencing techniques, made a big breakthrough step in screening for Down Syndrome (DS) and other aneuploidies. It seems that the position of cffDNA in the current screening strategies is a secondary contingent use to combined test, at least as long as its price is still high and its use as a primary test is not cost effective.

Relationships between the temperature, the bed mass and the location of the combustion zone and the NOx and CO concentrations in exhaust gases are described. The concentrations of both gases increase with rising temperature and then quickly decline. It has been shown that despite the increase in average bed temperature the drop in the emission of nitrogen oxides is connected with lower temperatures inside the exploding bubbles. These temperatures strongly depend on the quantity of solid contained in them. The paper also presents the results of modeling the combustion process in a fuel-air bubble. The modeling carried out has shown that above the temperature at which bubble self-ignition becomes possible inside the bed, with further bed temperature rise there is an increase in the solids content inside the bubbles at the moment of explosion. As a result, the maximum temperature inside the bubbles falls and the emission of nitrogen oxides is reduced. In turn, the emission of CO is linked to the propagation of combustion between bubbles when self-ignition cannot take place inside them.

In this article, we analyze the effect of diurnal IF on the circadian clock, sleep, and daytime sleepiness. In free-living, unconstrained environments that do not control for lifestyle changes such as sleep/wake schedules, sleep duration, and light exposure, studies have demonstrated sudden and significant delays in bedtime and wake time during diurnal intermittent fasting for Ramadan.

While there is substantial evidence that caffeine enhances performance, caffeine withdrawal leads to deficits at both the individual (eg, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes) and societal (eg, increases in work accidents) level. Scholars for some time have considered that the supposed psychoactive benefits of caffeine may be the result of the mere reversal of deleterious effects of caffeine withdrawal, rather than a net benefit of caffeine ingestion. In this integrative review, we examine evidence illuminating the relationship between caffeine consumption and subsequent quality and quantity of nighttime rest. Secondly, we consider evidence as to whether performance deficits caused by sleep deprivation linked to caffeine can be reversed by caffeine consumption during the subsequent daytime period. Finally, we consider how these two stages can be reconciled in a single model that enables calculation of the net caffeine effect on daytime functioning. The literature highlights a range of positive impacts of caffeine consumption on both physical and cognitive functioning. There are also a number of factors that complicate any conclusions that can be drawn regarding the potential of caffeine to improve performance. Most critically, performance improvements the next day may simply be a result of the reversal of caffeine withdrawal. Animal studies and well-controlled human studies involving high habitual and low habitual users tend to confirm a ""net benefit"" for caffeine use. Further research, particularly with (necessarily rare) caffeine-naive populations, is required to elucidate the complexities of the relationship between caffeine, sleep, and daytime functioning.

Contributing to the worse prognosis in TNBC is the higher rates of relapse and rapid progression after relapse. Advances in targeted therapeutics and conventional chemotherapy for TNBC have been stymied due to the lack of specific targets. Moreover, the responses to chemotherapy in TNBC lack durability, partially accounting for the higher rates of relapse. Immunotherapy, notably immune-checkpoint blockade, has shown to improve survival and maintain robust antitumor responses in both hematologic and solid malignancies. Unlike lung cancer, melanoma, and bladder cancer, most breast cancers are not inherently immunogenic and typically have low T cell infiltration. However, among breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is characterized by greater tumor immune infiltrate and higher degree of stromal and intratumoral tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a predictive marker for responses to immunotherapy. Moreover, in TNBC, the high number of stromal TILs is predictive of more favorable survival outcomes and response to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy is being extensively explored in TNBC and clinical trials are showing some promising results. This article focuses on the rationale for immunotherapy in TNBC, to explore and discuss preclinical data, results from early clinical trials, and to summarize some ongoing trials. We will also discuss the potential application of immunotherapy in TNBC from a clinician's perspective.","Is the History Repeated? Can (2R,6R)-Hydroxynorketamine be Another Antidepressant?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573991,Journal of experimental neuroscience,2018 12 25,"Historically, identification of active metabolites has contributed to drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. It has led to the identification of new medications such as desipramine (a metabolite of imipramine) and paliperidone (a metabolite of risperidone). (R,S)-Ketamine, which has been regarded as the greatest breakthrough in depression research, is rapidly and stereoselectively metabolized into a variety of metabolites. Therefore, identification of an active substance after administration of (R,S)-ketamine is a critical issue, not only to delineate the underlying mechanisms but also to pave the way to develop a new antidepressant. Recently, one of the metabolites of (R,S)-ketamine, namely, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) was proposed as an active metabolite formed after administration of (R,S)-ketamine, and even as being essential for (R,S)-ketamine to exert its antidepressant effects. However, this is still controversial. Indeed, we demonstrated that the antidepressant effect of (2R,6R)-HNK is not as potent as that of its parent compounds ((R)-ketamine and (R,S)-ketamine), and that (2R,6R)-HNK is not essential for (R)-ketamine to exert its antidepressant effects. From the historical point of view, however, there is potential to discover new medications by further investigations of (2R,6R)-HNK. Therefore, more careful and thorough investigation of (2R,6R)-HNK is needed for the discovery of more efficacious and safer antidepressants.","Potential use of a ""Blood Pressure Action Sheet"" for Indonesian patients with hypertension living in rural villages: a qualitative study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573990,Integrated blood pressure control,2018 12 25,"The aim of the study was to obtain feedback on the layout, content, and potential use of a blood pressure (BP) action sheet, a purpose-designed written resource for Indonesian patients with hypertension."

Quantitative measurement of suboptimal visual acuity can potentially be corrected optically with proper refraction in some cases, but in many cases of reduced vision there is something else more serious that can potentially impact other aspects of visual function such as contrast sensitivity, color discrimination, peripheral field of view and higher-order visual processing. The measurement of visual acuity typically requires stimuli subject to some degree of standardization or calibration and has thus often been limited to clinical settings. However, we are spending increasing amounts of time interacting with devices that present high-resolution, full color images and video (hereafter, digital media) and can record our responses. Most of these devices can be used to measure visual acuity and other aspects of visual function, not just with targeted testing experiences but from typical device interactions. There is growing evidence that prolonged exposure to digital media can lead to various vision-related issues (eg, computer vision syndrome, dry eye, etc.). Our regular, daily interactions (digital behavior) can also be used to assess our visual function, passively and continuously. This allows us to expand vision health assessment beyond the clinic, to collect vision-related data in the whole range of settings for typical digital behavior from practically any population(s) of interest and to further explore just how our increasingly virtual interactions are affecting our vision. We present a tool that can be easily integrated into digital media to provide insights into our digital behavior."

However, most existing cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) are unilevel in nature and become inapplicable when data have a multilevel structure. In this study, using the log-linear CDM as the item-level model, multilevel CDMs were developed based on the latent continuous variable approach and the multivariate Bernoulli distribution approach. In a series of simulations, the newly developed multilevel deterministic input, noisy, and gate (DINA) model was used as an example to evaluate the parameter recovery and consequences of ignoring the multilevel structures. The results indicated that all parameters in the new multilevel DINA were recovered fairly well by using the freeware Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS) and that ignoring multilevel structures by fitting the standard unilevel DINA model resulted in poor estimates for the student-level covariates and underestimated standard errors, as well as led to poor recovery for the latent attribute profiles for individuals.

Although most applied studies have utilized the Generalized Graded Unfolding Model (GGUM), many others have been developed. Most notably, David Andrich and colleagues published a series of papers comparing dominance and ideal point measurement perspectives, and they proposed ideal point models for dichotomous and polytomous single-stimulus responses, known as the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (HCM) and the General Hyperbolic Cosine Model (GHCM), respectively. These models have item response functions resembling the GGUM and its more constrained forms, but they are mathematically simpler. Despite the apparent impact of Andrich's work on ensuing investigations, the HCM and GHCM have been largely overlooked by applied researchers. This may stem from questions about the compatibility of the parameter metric with other ideal point estimation and model-data fit software or seemingly unrealistic parameter estimates sometimes produced by the original joint maximum likelihood (JML) estimation software. Given the growing list of ideal point applications and variations in sample and scale characteristics, the authors believe these HCMs warrant renewed consideration. To address this need and overcome potential JML estimation difficulties, this study developed a marginal maximum likelihood (MML) estimation algorithm for the GHCM and explored parameter estimation requirements in a Monte Carlo study manipulating sample size, scale length, and data types. The authors found a sample size of 400 was adequate for parameter estimation and, in accordance with GGUM studies, estimation was superior in polytomous conditions.",Modeling Response Style Using Vignettes and Person-Specific Item Response Theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573931,Applied psychological measurement,2018 12 25,"Responses to survey data are determined not only by item characteristics and respondents' trait standings but also by response styles. Recently, methods for modeling response style with personality and attitudinal data have turned toward the use of anchoring vignettes, which provide fixed rating targets. Although existing research is promising, a few outstanding questions remain. First, it is not known how many vignettes and vignette ratings are necessary to identify response style parameters. Second, the comparative accuracy of these models is largely unexplored. Third, it remains unclear whether correcting for response style improves criterion validity. Both simulated data and data observed from a population-representative sample responding to a measure of personality pathology (the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 [PID-5]) were modeled using an array of response style models. In simulations, most models estimating response styles outperformed the graded response model (GRM), and in observed data, all response style models were superior to the GRM.

These reflectances, namely the ratio of spectral upwelled radiances to spectral downwelled irradiances, describe the light exiting a water mass that defines its color. IOPs are the spectral absorption and scattering characteristics of ocean water and its dissolved and particulate constituents. Because of their dependence on the concentration and composition of marine constituents, IOPs can be used to describe the contents of the upper ocean mixed layer. This information is critical to further our scientific understanding of biogeochemical oceanic processes, such as organic carbon production and export, phytoplankton dynamics, and responses to climatic disturbances. Given their importance, the international ocean color community has invested significant effort in improving the quality of satellite-derived IOP products, both regionally and globally. Recognizing the current influx of data products into the community and the need to improve current algorithms in anticipation of new satellite instruments (e.g., the global, hyperspectral spectroradiometer of the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission), we present a synopsis of the current state of the art in the retrieval of these core optical properties. Contemporary approaches for obtaining IOPs from satellite ocean color are reviewed and, for clarity, separated based their inversion methodology or the type of IOPs sought. Summaries of known uncertainties associated with each approach are provided, as well as common performance metrics used to evaluate them.

Any real-world application of Bayes' theorem is approximate, and therefore we cannot expect that data assimilation will preserve all of the information available from models and observations. We outline a framework for measuring information in models, observations, and evaluation data in a way that allows us to quantify information loss during (necessarily imperfect) data assimilation. This facilitates quantitative analysis of tradeoffs between improving (usually expensive) remote sensing observing systems vs. improving data assimilation design and implementation. We demonstrate this methodology on a previously published application of the Ensemble Kalman Filter used to assimilate remote sensing soil moisture retrievals from AMSR-E into the Noah land surface model.",Generations of Advantage. Multigenerational Correlations in Family Wealth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573927,Social forces; a scientific medium of social study and interpretation,2019 06 10,"Inequality in family wealth is high, yet we know little about how much and how wealth inequality is maintained across generations. We argue that a long-term perspective reflective of wealth's cumulative nature is crucial to understand the extent and channels of wealth reproduction across generations. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that span nearly half a century, we show that a one-decile increase in parents' wealth position is associated with an increase of about four percentiles in their offspring's wealth position in adulthood. We show that grandparental wealth is a unique predictor of grandchildren's wealth, above and beyond the role of parental wealth, suggesting that a focus on only parent-child dyads understates the importance of family wealth lineages. Second, considering five channels of wealth transmission-gifts and bequests, education, marriage, homeownership, and business ownership-we find that most of the advantages arising from family wealth begin much earlier in the life course than the common focus on bequests implies, even when we consider the wealth of grandparents. We also document the stark disadvantage of African American households in terms of not only their wealth attainment but also their intergenerational wealth mobility compared to whites.",From the top down and back up again: star cluster structure from hierarchical star formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573926,Monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,2018 12 25,"Young massive star clusters spanning ~104-108M⊙ in mass have been observed to have similar surface brightness profiles. We show that recent hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation have also produced star clusters with this structure. We argue analytically that this type of mass distribution arises naturally in the relaxation from a hierarchically clustered distribution of stars into a monolithic star cluster through hierarchical merging. We show that initial profiles of finite maximum density will tend to produce successively shallower power-law profiles under hierarchical merging, owing to certain conservation constraints on the phase-space distribution. We perform N-body simulations of a pairwise merger of model star clusters and find that mergers readily produce the shallow surface brightness profiles observed in young massive clusters. Finally, we simulate the relaxation of a hierarchically clustered mass distribution constructed from an idealized fragmentation model. Assuming only power-law spatial and kinematic scaling relations, these numerical experiments are able to reproduce the surface density profiles of observed young massive star clusters. Thus, we bolster the physical motivation for the structure of young massive clusters within the paradigm of hierarchical star formation. This could have important implications for the structure and dynamics of nascent globular clusters.",Through a Smoother Lens: An expected absence of LCDM substructure detections from hydrodynamic and dark matter only simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573925,Monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,2018 12 25,"A fundamental prediction of the cold dark matter cosmology is the existence of a large number of dark subhalos around galaxies, most of which should be entirely devoid of stars. Confirming the existence of dark substructures stands among the most important empirical challenges in modern cosmology: if they are found and quantified with the mass spectrum expected, then this would close the door on a vast array of competing theories. But in order for observational programs of this kind to reach fruition, we need robust predictions. Here we explore substructure predictions for lensing using galaxy lens-like hosts at z=0.2 from the Illustris simulations both in full hydrodynamics and dark matter only. We quantify substructures more massive than ~ 109 M☉, comparable to current lensing detections derived from HST, Keck, and ALMA. The addition of full hydrodynamics reduces the overall subhalo mass function by about a factor of two. Even for the dark matter only runs, most (~85 per cent) projections through the halo of size close to an Einstein radius contain no substructures larger than 109 M☉. The fraction of empty projections through the halo rises to ~95 per cent in full physics simulations. This suggests we will likely need hundreds of strong lensing systems suitable for substructure studies, as well as predictions that include the effects of baryon physics on substructure, to properly constrain cosmological models. Fortunately, the field is poised to fulfill these requirements.",The origin of ultra diffuse galaxies: stellar feedback and quenching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573924,Monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,2018 12 25,"We test if the cosmological zoom-in simulations of isolated galaxies from the FIRE project reproduce the properties of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We show that outflows that dynamically heat galactic stars, together with a passively aging stellar population after imposed quenching, naturally reproduce the observed population of red UDGs, without the need for high spin haloes, or dynamical influence from their host cluster. We reproduce the range of surface brightness, radius, and absolute magnitude of the observed red UDGs by quenching simulated galaxies at a range of different times. They represent a mostly uniform population of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies with M* ~ 108 M☉, low metallicity, and a broad range of ages; the more massive the UDGs, the older they are. The most massive red UDG in our sample(M* ~ 3 × 108 M☉) requires quenching at z ~ 3 when its halo reached Mh ~ 1011M☉. Our simulated UDGs form with normal stellar-to-halo ratios and match the central enclosed masses and the velocity dispersions of the observed UDGs. Enclosed masses remain largely fixed across a broad range of quenching times because the central regions of their dark matter haloes complete their growth early. If our simulated dwarfs are not quenched, they evolve into bluer low surface brightness galaxies with M/L similar to observed field dwarfs. While our simulation sample covers a limited range of formation histories and halo masses, we predict that UDG is a common, and perhaps even dominant, galaxy type around M* ~ 108 M☉, both in the field and in clusters."

Toward the goal of achieving further improvement in LDLT survival, we investigated factors affecting recipient survival. We evaluated the prognostic factors of 60 pediatric recipients (< 16 years old) who underwent LDLT between 1997 and 2015. In a univariate analysis, non-cholestatic (NCS) disease, graft/recipient body weight ratio, cold and warm ischemic times, and intraoperative blood loss were significant factors impacting survival. In a multivariate analysis, NCS disease was the only significant factor worsening survival (p=0.0021). One-and 5-year survival rates for the cholestatic disease (CS, n=43) and NCS (n=17) groups were 100% vs. 70.6% and 97.4% vs. 58.8% (p=0.004, log-rank). Intergroup comparisons revealed that CS was significantly associated with operation time, cold ischemia, hepatomegaly of the native liver, and portal plasty. These data suggest that a cirrhotic, swollen, artery-dominant liver did not increase graft size-related risks despite the surgical complexity of preceding operations. The NCS group's poorer survival originated from recurrence of the primary disease and liver manifestation of systemic disease untreatable by transplantation. Improving the survival of pediatric recipients requires intensive efforts to prevent primary disease relapse and more rapid diagnoses to exclude contraindications from NCS disease.","Difference between the Right and Left Phrenic Nerve Conduction Times, Latency, and Amplitude.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573910,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 09,"We studied phrenic nerve conduction times in 90 phrenic nerves of 45 normal subjects. The phrenic nerve was stimulated at the posterior border of the sternomastoid muscle in the supraclavicular fossa, just above the clavicle, with bipolar surface electrodes. For recording, positive and negative electrodes were placed on the xiphoid process and at the eighth intercostal bone-cartilage transition, respectively. We studied both the right and left sides to determine whether there was any difference between the two sides. The mean onset latency (± SD) of the right compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) (5.99±0.39 msec) was significantly shorter than that of the left CMAPs (6.45±0.50 msec). The mean peak latency was significantly shorter in the right CMAPs (10.22±1.33 msec) than the left CMAPs (12.48±2.02 msec). The mean (± SD) amplitude was significantly lower in the left CMAPs (0.42±0.11 mV) than the right CMAPs (0.49±0.10 mV).

Their chief complaints were classified into 8 major symptoms: visceral pain, somatic pain, fever, cough, dizziness, fatigue, appetite loss, and edema. We compared the laboratory data obtained from the patients with complaints with the data of symptom-free (control) patients. The serum sodium and potassium levels in the fever group were decreased compared to those in the control group. In the fever group, the serum sodium level was inversely correlated with age. The ratio of serum urea nitrogen to creatinine (UN/Cr) was increased in the appetite-loss group. There were significant age-dependent increases in the UN/Cr ratio in the appetite-loss and edema groups. Of note, serum levels of free thyroxin were lower in the dizziness group compared to the control group. In addition, the free thyroxin level was inversely correlated with age in the dizziness group but not in the asymptomatic control group. Collectively, the results indicated that osmolality-related laboratory data are strongly associated with individual primary symptoms at the first visit regardless of the final diagnosis. The consideration of age-dependent changes of these markers is helpful for diagnosing latent disorders based on various primary symptoms.",Association between the Critical Shoulder Angle and Rotator Cuff Tears in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573908,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 09,"Distinct anatomic variants of the scapula such as the critical shoulder angle (CSA) were found to be associated with rotator cuff tears (RCTs), but it is unclear whether the CSA is a risk factor in Japanese. Here we sought to determine whether the CSA is associated with RCTs in a Japanese population, and whether the CSA is a more useful parameter than the conventionally used parameters. Our RCT group and non-RCT group each consisted of 54 consecutive cases. We compared the groups' values of CSA, the acromion index (AI), and the lateral acromion angle (LAA) obtained by X-ray imaging. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to determine cutoff values and the area under the curve (AUC), and to assess the odds ratio. The means of the CSA and the AI in the RCT group were significantly larger (36.3° vs. 33.7°, 0.74 vs 0.68), but the LAA did not show a significant between-group difference. The AUCs for the CSA and AI were 0.678 and 0.658, the cutoff values were 35.0° and 0.72, and the odds ratios were 3.1 and 2.5, respectively. In conclusion, the CSA was a strong risk factor compared to the AI and LAA for rotator cuff tears.",Zerobot®: A Remote-controlled Robot for Needle Insertion in CT-guided Interventional Radiology Developed at Okayama University.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573907,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 09,"Since 2012, we have been developing a remote-controlled robotic system (Zerobot®) for needle insertion during computed tomography (CT)-guided interventional procedures, such as ablation, biopsy, and drainage. The system was designed via a collaboration between the medical and engineering departments at Okayama University, including various risk control features. It consists of a robot with 6 degrees of freedom that is manipulated using an operation interface to perform needle insertions under CT-guidance. The procedure includes robot positioning, needle targeting, and needle insertion. Phantom experiments have indicated that robotic insertion is equivalent in accuracy to manual insertion, without physician radiation exposure. Animal experiments have revealed that robotic insertion of biopsy introducer needles and various ablation needles is safe and accurate in vivo. The first in vivo human trial, therefore, began in April 2018. After its completion, a larger clinical study will be conducted for commercialization of the robot. This robotic procedure has many potential advantages over a manual procedure: 1) decreased physician fatigue; 2) stable and accurate needle posture without tremor; 3) procedure automation; 4) less experience required for proficiency in needle insertion skills; 5) decreased variance in technical skills among physicians; and 6) increased likelihood of performing the procedure at remote hospitals (i.e., telemedicine).",Fabricated facial rash - an unusual presentation of factitious disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573903,British dental journal,2019 01 08,"Patients with factitious disorder typically present with signs or symptoms suggesting a medical problem, but which transpire to be self-induced or fabricated. Repeated investigations and treatments are often carried out to no avail before this possibility is considered. In this case, a 51-year-old female presented to the oral and maxillofacial surgery unit with toothache and a facial rash. Following admission to hospital a range of investigations were performed, and a tooth was extracted. Judicious attention by nursing staff led to the discovery that the patient had been applying make-up to mimic a skin rash. This concern was raised with the patient and she admitted falsifying the rash. Although this patient may have been experiencing pain, by applying make-up in this manner she sought to exaggerate the severity of her condition and as a result underwent potentially unnecessary procedures. This case provides a reminder that the possibility of factitious disorder should be considered in cases where patients present with symptoms or signs which appear fabricated or self-inflicted, defy anatomical or physiological principles, or do not correlate with the history. Thorough history taking is essential, and access to electronic care records may be informative.

This paper describes the multiple missed opportunities to diagnose sepsis in a baby and it is hoped the impact of reading this from the mother's perspective will reduce the risk of this happening again.",Spectrum of tau pathologies in Huntington's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573872,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 01 07,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene. Recently, a new role for tau has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HD, whereas others have argued that postmortem tau pathology findings are attributable to concurrent Alzheimer's disease pathology. The frequency of other well-defined common age-related tau pathologies in HD has not been examined in detail. In this single center, retrospective analysis, we screened seven cases of Huntington's disease (5 females, 2 males, age at death: 47-73 years) for neuronal and glial tau pathology using phospho-tau immunohistochemistry. All seven cases showed presence of neuronal tau pathology. Five cases met diagnostic criteria for primary age-related tauopathy (PART), with three cases classified as definite PART and two cases as possible PART, all with a Braak stage of I. One case was diagnosed with low level of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change. In the youngest case, rare perivascular aggregates of tau-positive neurons, astrocytes and processes were identified at sulcal depths, meeting current neuropathological criteria for stage 1 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Although the patient had no history of playing contact sports, he experienced several falls, but no definitive concussions during his disease course. Three of the PART cases and the CTE-like case showed additional evidence of aging-related tau astrogliopathy. None of the cases showed significant tau pathology in the striatum. In conclusion, while we found evidence for tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in all seven of our HD cases, the tau pathology was readily classifiable into known diagnostic entities and most likely represents non-specific age- or perhaps trauma-related changes. As the tau pathology was very mild in all cases and not unexpected for a population of this age range, it does not appear that the underlying HD may have promoted or accelerated tau accumulation.",Luminex-based quantification of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change in formalin-fixed post-mortem human brain tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573871,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 01 07,"The vast majority of archived research and clinical pathological specimens are stored in the form of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, but, unlike fresh frozen tissue samples, highly quantitative measures in FFPE tissues are limited to immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence thresholding image analysis studies, cell counting, and ordinal ranking systems. This poses a significant obstacle for clinical investigations that aim to correlate diagnostic markers of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD) with parameters like age, gender, drug exposures, genotype, disease stage, co-morbidities, or environmental factors. To overcome this limitation, we have developed Luminex-based techniques and protocols for the quantification of amyloid β and hyperphosphorylated Tau in FFPE brain sections. We validated the Luminex assay in FFPE sections from prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and neostriatum from 30 cases that underwent prior neuropathological diagnostic assessment of AD following the current NIA-AA recommendations for AD: 10 cases diagnosed as not or low, 10 cases as intermediate, and 10 cases as high AD neuropathologic change. Consistent with the neuropathologic assessment, Luminex assay detected high amounts of amyloid beta in the frontal cortex and striatum, and high amounts of hyperphosphorylated Tau in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, of cases with high AD neuropathologic change. This assay can be expanded to detect diverse antigenic targets of interest, as we show here with IBA1 and GFAP. This novel approach supports multiplexed highly quantitative, molecularly specific neuropathology measures to further explore mechanisms of neurodegeneration in AD.",Rapid diagnosis of IDH1-mutated gliomas by 2-HG detection with gas chromatography mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573870,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,2019 03 26,"The metabolic genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1, 2) are frequently mutated in gliomas. Mutation of IDH defines a distinct subtype of glioma and predicts therapeutic response. IDH mutation has a remarkable neomorphic activity of converting α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which is now commonly referred to as an oncometabolite and biomarker for gliomas. PCR-sequencing (n = 220), immunohistochemistry staining (IHC, n = 220), and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS, n = 87) were applied to identify IDH mutation in gliomas, and the sensitivity and specificity of these strategies were compared. PCR-sequencing and IHC staining are reliable for retrospective assessment of IDH1 mutation in gliomas, but both methods usually take 1-2 days, which hinders their application for rapid diagnosis. GC-MS-based methods can detect 2-HG qualitatively and quantitatively, offering information on the IDH1 mutation status in gliomas with the sensitivity and specificity being 100%. Further optimization of the GC-MS based methodology (so called as the mini-column method) enabled us to determine 2-HG within 40 min in glioma samples without complex or time-consuming preparation. Most importantly, the ratio of 2-HG/glutamic acid was shown to be a reliable parameter for determination of mutation status. The mini-column method enables rapid identification of 2-HG, providing a promising strategy for intraoperative diagnosis of IDH1-mutated gliomas in the future."

This series of 10 cases (including the original three cases) describes an expanded clinicopathological spectrum and the molecular findings of this histiocytic proliferation. Six patients had disseminated disease: five presented in early infancy with eventual disease resolution, and the sixth presented at 2 years of age and died of intestinal, bone marrow, and brain involvement. The other four patients had localized disease involving nasal skin, foot, breast, and intracranial cavernous sinus - the first three had no recurrence after surgical resection, while the cavernous sinus lesion showed complete resolution with crizotinib therapy. The lesional histiocytes were very large, with irregularly folded nuclei, fine chromatin, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, sometimes with emperipolesis. There could be an increase in foamy histiocytes and Touton giant cells with time, resembling juvenile xanthogranuloma. Immunostaining showed that the histiocytes were positive for ALK, histiocytic markers (CD68, CD163) and variably S100, while being negative for CD1a, CD207, and BRAF-V600E. Next-generation sequencing-based anchored multiplex PCR (Archer® FusionPlex®) performed in six cases identified KIF5B-ALK gene fusion in five and COL1A2-ALK fusion in one. There was no correlation of gene fusion type with disease localization or dissemination. The clinicopathological spectrum of ALK-positive histiocytosis is broader than originally described, and this entity is characterized by frequent presence of KIF5B-ALK gene fusion. We recommend that every unusual histiocytic proliferative disorder, especially disseminated lesions, be tested for ALK expression because of the potential efficacy of ALK inhibitor therapy in unresectable or disseminated disease.",Mechanisms regulating zygotic genome activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573849,Nature reviews. Genetics,2019 06 12,"Following fertilization, the two specified gametes must unite to create an entirely new organism. The genome is initially transcriptionally quiescent, allowing the zygote to be reprogrammed into a totipotent state. Gradually, the genome is activated through a process known as the maternal-to-zygotic transition, which enables zygotic gene products to replace the maternal supply that initiated development. This essential transition has been broadly characterized through decades of research in several model organisms. However, we still lack a full mechanistic understanding of how genome activation is executed and how this activation relates to the reprogramming of the zygotic chromatin architecture. Recent work highlights the central role of transcriptional activators and suggests that these factors may coordinate transcriptional activation with other developmental changes.",Reliability of human cortical organoid generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573846,Nature methods,2019 06 10,"The differentiation of pluripotent stem cells in three-dimensional cultures can recapitulate key aspects of brain development, but protocols are prone to variable results.

Single-cell profiling revealed shifts in nephron patterning and proportions of component cells. Distinct induced pluripotent stem cell clones showed congruent transcriptional programs, with interexperimental and interclonal variation also strongly associated with nephron patterning. Epithelial cells isolated from organoids aligned with total organoids at the same day of differentiation, again implicating relative maturation as a confounder. This understanding of experimental variation facilitated an optimized analysis of organoid-based disease modeling, thereby increasing the utility of kidney organoids for personalized medicine and functional genomics."

We draw on individual and family semi-structured interviews with participants recruited through a national patient's association (n = 25). Qualitative thematic analysis revealed three main categories of accounts: (1) justifying the decision ""not to know"", because either no clinical benefit was expected or predictive knowledge was anticipated as psychologically burdensome; (2) prioritizing everyday life, maintaining hope and the goal of living a valid life; and (3) the wish to know: ambivalence and conflict within the family. Findings suggest the value of genetic information is often questioned when no effective treatment or cure is available; and that people have different tolerance thresholds for predictive information, and this impacts individuals within the family differently. We discuss this in the context of the making of ""responsible"" decisions, and of the tensions that may arise within families between the best interests or wishes of a person and those of other family members. We hope this will clarify the reasoning of those who opt for non-engagement with medical genetic services and, more specifically, pre-symptomatic testing. Further, we hope it will be relevant for the provision of genetic counselling and psychosocial support to such families.",A game of hide and seq: Identification of parallel Y-STR evolution in deep-rooting pedigrees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573800,European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2019 03 29,"Short tandem repeats on the Y-chromosome (Y-STRs) are common DNA polymorphisms useful for genetic genealogy, population and evolutionary genetics, human genetics, pathology and forensic sciences. It is important to identify all Y-STR variants and to have knowledge of Y-STR mutation rates in order to correctly estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) between paternally related individuals. When capillary electrophoresis (CE) is performed to analyze genealogical pairs, Y-STR sequence variations remain hidden when the number of repeats is identical. These hidden variations could be due to parallel Y-STR changes or modifications (PM) that occur independently in different lineages leading to alleles with identical number of repeats. In this study, we detect for the first time twelve PM by analyzing 133 males (960 meiosis) in extended deep-rooting family pedigrees on 42 Y-STRs. These PM were observed in nine Y-STR loci with mutation rates of at least 5.94 × 10-3 per generation. Sequencing analysis made it possible to distinguish insertions/deletions in different repeat regions revealing the presence of two unique changes in three PM on rapidly mutating and complex Y-STRs DYS724-ab and DYS518. Sequencing unraveled more information concerning the identity of alleles, and increased allelic discrimination possibilities which is of great importance in population genetics and forensic analysis. Limiting the analysis to CE could lead to wrong ancestral allele assumptions, to false negative interpretations and to tMRCA underestimations. These observations highlight the importance and added value of sequencing analysis and suggest a shift in genotyping methods from CE to next generation sequencing.",Cancer communication research in the era of genomics and precision medicine: a scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573799,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2018 12 21,"Effective use of genetic and genomic data in cancer prevention and treatment depends on adequate communication with patients and the public. Although relevant empirical work has emerged, the scope and outcomes of this communication research have not been characterized. We conducted a comprehensive scoping review of recent published research (2010-2017) on communication of cancer-related genetic and genomic testing (CGT) information. Searches in six databases revealed 9243 unique records; 513 papers were included. Most papers utilized an observational quantitative design; fewer utilized an experimental design. More attention has been paid to outcomes of CGT results disclosure than to decision making regarding CGT uptake or the process of results disclosure. Psychosocial outcomes were most common across studies. This literature has a strong focus on BRCA1/2, with few papers focused on Lynch syndrome or next-generation technologies. Women, Caucasians, older adults, and those of higher socioeconomic status were overrepresented. Research gaps identified include the need for studies on the process of CGT communication; examining behavioral, decision making, and communication outcomes; and inclusion of diverse populations. Addressing these gaps can help improve the use of genomics in cancer control and reduce disparities in access to and use of CGT.",Biallelic germline nonsense variant of MLH3 underlies polyposis predisposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573798,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2019 05 02,Some 10% of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 80% of attenuated polyposis (AFAP) cases remain molecularly unexplained.

Here, we investigated the effects of radiofrequency (RF) fields emitted by new-generation mobile technologies, specifically, Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE), on intrinsic scalp EEG activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) and cognitive performance in the Stroop test. The study involved 60 healthy, young-adult university students (34 for UMTS and 26 for LTE) with double-blind administration of Real and Sham exposure in separate sessions. EEG was recorded before, during and after RF exposure, and Stroop performance was assessed before and after EEG recording. Both RF exposure types caused a notable decrease in the alpha power over the whole scalp that persisted even after the cessation of the exposure, whereas no effects were found on any aspects of performance in the Stroop test. The results imply that the brain networks underlying global alpha oscillations might require minor reconfiguration to adapt to the local biophysical changes caused by focal RF exposure mimicking MP use.",B7-H3 promotes multiple myeloma cell survival and proliferation by ROS-dependent activation of Src/STAT3 and c-Cbl-mediated degradation of SOCS3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573782,Leukemia,2019 06 06,"B7-H3 (CD276) is broadly overexpressed by multiple human cancers. It plays a vital role in tumor progression and has been accepted as one of the inhibitory B7 family checkpoint molecules. To identify the functions and underlying mechanisms of B7-H3 in multiple myeloma, we analyzed B7-H3 expression in myeloma patients and used siRNAs and overexpression plasmid of B7-H3 to investigate its roles and downstream signaling molecules in myeloma cell lines. The results showed that surface expression of B7-H3 was upregulated in myeloma samples and cell lines. Lower expression of B7-H3 in myeloma cells was associated with better progression-free survival. Myeloma cell survival, drug resistance, and tumor growth could be promoted by B7-H3. The molecular basis for these functional roles of B7-H3 involved the activation of JAK2/STAT3 via redox-mediated oxidation and activation of Src. We further identified a STAT3-promoting signaling pathway by which oxidant-mediated Src phosphorylation led to secondary activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Activated c-Cbl subsequently caused specific proteasomal degradation of SOCS3, a negative regulator of JAK2/STAT3. These data indicate B7-H3's important role in the activation of ROS/Src/c-Cbl pathway in multiple myeloma which integrates redox regulation and sustained STAT3 activation at the level of degradation of STAT3 suppressor.","PRR14L mutations are associated with chromosome 22 acquired uniparental disomy, age-related clonal hematopoiesis and myeloid neoplasia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573780,Leukemia,2019 05 02,"Acquired uniparental disomy (aUPD, also known as copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) is a common feature of cancer cells and characterized by extended tracts of somatically-acquired homozygosity without any concurrent loss or gain of genetic material. The presumed genetic targets of many regions of aUPD remain unknown. Here we describe the association of chromosome 22 aUPD with mutations that delete the C-terminus of PRR14L in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), related myeloid neoplasms and age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). Myeloid panel analysis identified a median of three additional mutated genes (range 1-6) in cases with a myeloid neoplasm (n = 8), but no additional mutations in cases with ARCH (n = 2) suggesting that mutated PRR14L alone may be sufficient to drive clonality. PRR14L has very limited homology to other proteins and its function is unknown. ShRNA knockdown of PRR14L in human CD34+ cells followed by in vitro growth and differentiation assays showed an increase in monocytes and decrease in neutrophils, consistent with a CMML-like phenotype. RNA-Seq and cellular localization studies suggest a role for PRR14L in cell division. PRR14L is thus a novel, biallelically mutated gene and potential founding abnormality in myeloid neoplasms.",Recurrent activating STAT5B N642H mutation in myeloid neoplasms with eosinophilia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573779,Leukemia,2019 05 20,"Determining the underlying cause of persistent eosinophilia is important for effective clinical management but remains a diagnostic challenge in many cases. We identified STAT5B N642H, an established oncogenic mutation, in 27/1715 (1.6%) cases referred for investigation of eosinophilia. Of the 27 mutated cases, a working diagnosis of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES; n = 7) or a myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia (n = 20) had been made prior to the detection of STAT5B N642H. Myeloid panel analysis identified a median of 2 additional mutated genes (range 0-4) with 4 cases having STAT5B N642H as a sole abnormality. STAT5B N642H was absent in cultured T cells of 4/4 positive cases. Individuals with SF3B1 mutations (9/27; 33%) or STAT5B N642H as a sole abnormality had a markedly better overall survival compared to cases with other additional mutations (median 65 months vs. 14 months; hazard ratio = 8.1; P < 0.001). The overall survival of STAT5B-mutated HES cases was only 30 months, suggesting that these cases should be reclassified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL-NOS). The finding of STAT5B N642H as a recurrent mutation in myeloid neoplasia with eosinophilia provides a new diagnostic and prognostic marker as well as a potential target for therapy.","Responses in multiple myeloma should be assigned according to serum, not urine, free light chain measurements.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573778,Leukemia,2019 05 20,"The most recent update to the International Myeloma Working Group consensus criteria places a strong emphasis on the need for more sensitive haematological markers of response driven by the success of novel therapies. One such marker is serum free light chain (sFLC) analysis, which was first incorporated into the definition of stringent complete response in 2006. However, over the past decade there has been some reluctance to extend the role of the sFLC assays to replace 24 h urine electrophoresis for monitoring multiple myeloma (MM). In this review, we lay out the evidence in favour of serum over urine for monoclonal FLC measurements and propose modified criteria for response assignment in myeloma."

We trained two macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) on a delayed grasping task where grip type and grip force were instructed. Neural population activity was recorded from areas relevant for grasp planning and execution: the anterior intraparietal area (AIP), F5 of the ventral premotor cortex, and the hand area of the primary motor cortex (M1). Grasp force was strongly encoded by neural populations of all three areas, thereby demonstrating for the first time the coding of grasp force in single- and multi-units of AIP. Neural coding of intended grasp force was most strongly represented in area F5. In addition to tuning analysis, a dimensionality reduction method revealed low-dimensional responses to grip type and grip force. Additionally, this method revealed a high correlation between latent variables of the neural population representing grasp force and the corresponding latent variables of electromyographic forearm muscle activity. Our results therefore suggest an important role of the cortical areas AIP, F5, and M1 in coding grasp force during movement execution as well as of F5 for coding intended grasp force.",Different pro-angiogenic potential of γ-irradiated PBMC-derived secretome and its subfractions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573762,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Secretomes from various cell sources exert strong regenerative activities on numerous organs, including the skin. Although secretomes consist of many diverse components, a growing body of evidence suggests that small extracellular vesicles (EVs) account for their regenerative capacity. We previously demonstrated that the secretome of γ-irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exhibits wound healing capacity. Therefore, we sought to dissect the molecular composition of EVs present in the secretome and compared wound healing-related activities of these EVs to other subfractions of the secretome and the fully supplemented secretome (MNCaposec). Compared to EVs derived from non-irradiated PBMCs, γ-irradiation significantly increased the size and number and changed the composition of released EVs. Detailed characterization of the molecular components of EVs, i.e. miRNA, proteins, and lipids, derived from irradiated PBMCs revealed a strong association with regenerative processes. Reporter gene assays and aortic ring sprouting assays revealed diminished activity of the subfractions compared to MNCaposec. In addition, we showed that MNCaposec accelerated wound closure in a diabetic mouse model. Taken together, our results suggest that secretome-based wound healing represents a promising new therapeutic avenue, and strongly recommend using the complete secretome instead of purified subfractions, such as EVs, to exploit its full regenerative capacity.",Immunotherapy in myasthenia gravis in the era of biologics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573759,Nature reviews. Neurology,2019 02 01,"No consensus has been reached on the ideal therapeutic algorithm for myasthenia gravis (MG). Most patients with MG require induction therapy with high doses of corticosteroids and maintenance with an immunosuppressant. Severe cases and acute worsening require intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis before oral immunosuppressants start having an effect. However, biologics are emerging as important therapeutic tools that promise to provide better corticosteroid sparing effects than standard treatments and can even induce remission. In particular, eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against complement C5, has been approved by the FDA for refractory MG on the basis of a phase III trial. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes peripheral B cells, has also been effective in many large uncontrolled series, although was not in a small phase III trial. Whether the newer anti-CD20 agents ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, ublituximab or inebilizumab will be more effective remains unclear. Belimumab, an antibody against the B cell trophic factor BAFF, was ineffective in phase III trials, and efgartigimod, which depletes antibodies, was effective in a phase II study. Some anti-cytokine agents relevant to MG immunopathogenesis also seem promising. Checkpoint inhibitors can trigger MG in some patients, necessitating early intervention. Increased availability of new biologics provides targeted immunotherapies and the opportunities to develop more specific therapies.",Interactions of Functionalized Multi-Wall Carbon Nanotubes with Giant Phospholipid Vesicles as Model Cellular Membrane System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573758,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are considered alternative materials for the design of advanced drug and gene delivery vectors. However, the mechanism responsible for the cellular membrane intake of CNTs is not well understood. In the present study, we show how multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) owning different surface properties, interact with giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), a simple model system for cellular membranes. In particular, we want to address the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interactions between MWCNTs and lipid membranes and the subsequent mechanical properties changes of the systems. In order to elucidate this interaction, we made the following chemical modifications on MWCNTs: oxidized MWCNTs (ox-MWCNTs) displaying reduced hydrophobic surface character, pristine MWCNTs (p-MWCNTs), and alkyl functionalized MWCNTs (alk-MWCNTs) exhibiting enhanced hydrophobic surface properties, were put in contact with GUVs and observed by confocal microscopy. Our observations revealed that the interaction between the CNTs and GUVs depends on the type of chemical functionalization: ox-MWCNTs remain at the membrane interacting with the polar head of the phospholipids, p-MWCNTs internalize GUVs spontaneously, and alk-MWCNTs persist inside the membrane. The mechanical properties of MWCNTs@GUVs systems were measured using the electrodeformation method, which shows an increased bending stiffness (κ) of the GUVs as MWCNTs concentration increases. High concentrations of p-MWCNTs and alk-MWCNTs induced vesicle adhesion; p-MWCNTs produced a considerable reduction in the average size of the GUVs, while alk-MWCNTs form complex stable structures inside the membrane. The statistical analyses of the experimental results are compared with available computer simulations. The picture emerging from our results is that the interaction between GUVs and MWCNTs is due mainly to hydrophobicity.",Intratumoral heterogeneity of endogenous tumor cell invasive behavior in human glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573757,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Intratumoral genetic heterogeneity is a widely accepted characteristic of human cancer, including the most common primary malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma. However, the variability in biological behaviors amongst cells within individual tumors is not well described. Invasion into unaffected brain parenchyma is one such behavior, and a leading mechanism of tumor recurrence unaddressed by the current therapeutic armamentarium. Further, providing insight into variability of tumor cell migration within individual tumors may inform discovery of novel anti-invasive therapeutics. In this study, ex vivo organotypic slice cultures from EGFR-wild type and EGFR-amplified patient tumors were treated with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib to evaluate potential sub-population restricted intratumoral drug-specific responses. High-resolution time-lapse microscopy and quantitative path tracking demonstrated migration of individual cells are punctuated by intermittent bursts of movement. Elevation of population aggregate mean speeds were driven by subpopulations of cells exhibiting frequent high-amplitude bursts, enriched within EGFR-amplified tumors. Treatment with gefitinib specifically targeted high-burst cell subpopulations only in EGFR-amplified tumors, decreasing bursting frequency and amplitude. We provide evidence of intratumoral subpopulations of cells with enhanced migratory behavior in human glioblastoma, selectively targeted via EGFR inhibition. These data justify use of direct human tumor slice cultures to investigate patient-specific therapies designed to limit tumor invasion.",Molecular comparison of Neanderthal and Modern Human adenylosuccinate lyase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573755,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"The availability of genomic data from extinct homini such as Neanderthals has caused a revolution in palaeontology allowing the identification of modern human-specific protein substitutions. Currently, little is known as to how these substitutions alter the proteins on a molecular level. Here, we investigate adenylosuccinate lyase, a conserved enzyme involved in purine metabolism for which several substitutions in the modern human protein (hADSL) have been described to affect intelligence and behaviour. During evolution, modern humans acquired a specific substitution (Ala429Val) in ADSL distinguishing it from the ancestral variant present in Neanderthals (nADSL). We show here that despite this conservative substitution being solvent exposed and located distant from the active site, there is a difference in thermal stability, but not enzymology or ligand binding between nADSL and hADSL. Substitutions near residue 429 which do not profoundly affect enzymology were previously reported to cause neurological symptoms in humans. This study also reveals that ADSL undergoes conformational changes during catalysis which, together with the crystal structure of a hitherto undetermined product bound conformation, explains the molecular origin of disease for several modern human ADSL mutants.",Intracellular albumin overload elicits endoplasmic reticulum stress and PKC-delta/p38 MAPK pathway activation to induce podocyte apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573754,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Podocyte injury is closely related to proteinuria and the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Currently, there is no conclusive understanding about the mechanisms involved in albumin overload and podocyte apoptosis response. In this study, we sought to explore the ways by which intracellular albumin can mediate podocyte apoptosis. Here, immortalized mouse podocytes were treated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) at different times and concentrations, in the presence or absence of SB203580 (0.1 µM, inhibitor of mitogen-activated-protein kinase - p38MAPK). Using immunofluorescence images, flow cytometry and immunoblotting, we observed a time-dependent intracellular accumulation of fluorescent albumin-FITC-BSA, followed by concentration-and time-dependent effect of intracellular albumin overload on podocyte apoptosis, which was mediated by increased expression of the chaperone glucose-regulated-protein 78 (GRP 78) and phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (pIRE1-α), as well as protein kinase C delta (PKC-δ), p38MAPK and cleaved caspase 12 expression. SB203580 prevented the cleavage of caspase 12 and the albumin-mediated podocyte apoptosis. These results suggest that intracellular albumin overload is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and upregulation of PKC-δ/p38MAPK/caspase 12 pathway, which may be a target for future therapeutic of albumin-induced podocyte apoptosis.",Risk of preterm and early term birth by maternal drug use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573752,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2019 01 29,"Examine the risk of preterm birth (PTB, < 37 weeks) and early term birth (37-38 weeks) for women with reported drug abuse/dependence.",Drivers of referrals to a children's hospital neonatal-infant intensive care unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573751,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2019 01 29,"Evaluate the outreach program of a regional NICU for referral satisfaction, drivers and barriers, preferences for service methods, outreach communication, and education.",Mathematical-model-guided development of full-thickness epidermal equivalent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573749,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Epidermal equivalents prepared with passaged keratinocytes are typically 10-20 μm thick, whereas intact human epidermis is up to 100 μm thick. Our established mathematical model of epidermal homeostasis predicted that the undulatory pattern of the papillary layer beneath the epidermis is a key determinant of epidermal thickness. Here, we tested this prediction by seeding human keratinocytes on polyester textiles with various fiber-structural patterns in culture dishes exposed to air, aiming to develop a more physiologically realistic epidermal model using passaged keratinocytes. Textile substrate with fiber thickness and inter-fiber distance matching the computer predictions afforded a three-dimensional epidermal-equivalent model with thick stratum corneum and intercellular lamellar lipid structure. The basal layer structure was similar to that of human papillary layer. Cells located around the textile fibers were proliferating, as indicated by BrdU and YAP (Yes-associated protein) staining and expression of melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. Filaggrin, loricrin, claudin 1 and ZO-1 were all appropriately expressed. Silencing of transcriptional coactivator YAP with siRNA disturbed construction of the three-dimensional structure. Measurement of trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) indicated that the model has excellent barrier function. Our results support the idea that mathematical modeling of complex biological processes can have predictive ability and practical value."

Walp.) is indigenous to Africa, and highly valued for its N2-fixing trait and the nutritional attributes of its grain and leaves. The species' ability to establish effective symbiosis with diverse rhizobial populations gives it survival and growth advantage in N-limited environments. To explore the functional diversity and phylogenetic positions of rhizobia nodulating cowpea in Africa, nodules were collected from various cowpea varieties grown in soils from the Guinea savanna and Sudano-sahelian agroecologies of Northern Ghana, and from the lowveld and middleveld areas of Mpumalanga Province in South Africa. Box-PCR profiling and multilocus sequence analysis revealed the presence of diverse microsymbionts responsible for cowpea nodulation across the study sites. BOX-PCR amplifications yielded variable band sizes, ranging from 618 bp to 5354 bp, which placed the isolates in six major clusters (Cluster A-F). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA, atpD, glnII, gyrB, rpoB, nifH and nodC genes revealed the presence of diverse Bradyrhizobium sp. closely related to Bradyrhizobium daqingense, Bradyrhizobium subterraneum, Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense, Bradyrhizobium embrapense, Bradyrhizobium pachyrhizi, Bradyrhizobium elkanii and novel Bradyrhizobium species in the soils studied, a finding that could be attributed to the unique edapho-climatic conditions of the contrasting environments. The test isolates exhibited distinct symbiotic efficiencies, and also induced variable (p ≤ 0.001) photosynthetic rates, leaf transpiration, total chlorophyll and shoot biomass accumulation on cowpea (their homologous host). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the distribution of these microsymbionts was influenced by the concentrations of macro- and micronutrients in soils. The pairwise genetic distances derived from phylogenies and nodule functioning showed significant (p < 0.05) correlation, which suggests that local environmental factors played a major role in the cowpea-Bradyrhizobium symbiosis.",Oxytocin and vasopressin increase male-directed threats and vocalizations in female macaques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573736,Scientific reports,2019 01 07,"In a previous study, we reported that intranasal delivery of both oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) to male macaques relaxes spontaneous social interactions, flattens the existing dominance hierarchy, and increases behavioral synchrony with other monkeys. Here we report that intranasal OT and AVP administration modulates the behaviors of female macaque monkeys, but in robustly different ways from males. Most notably, both neuropeptides increase threatening and vocalization behaviors of females when they encounter males, and these behaviors effectively increase the social status of females over males. While OT and AVP heighten the confrontational nature of intersexual encounters, both peptides relax interactions between females. Finally, as previously reported for males, treating an individual female monkey with OT or AVP significantly modulates the behavior of her non-treated partner. Together, these findings show that OT and AVP can either inhibit or promote aggression, depending on sex and behavioral context, and call for a more careful, systematic examination of the functions of these neuropeptides in both sexes, especially in the context of therapeutics for human social disorders.","Screening of 109 neuropeptides on ASICs reveals no direct agonists and dynorphin A, YFMRFamide and endomorphin-1 as modulators.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573735,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) belong to the DEG/ENaC gene family. While ASIC1a, ASIC1b and ASIC3 are activated by extracellular protons, ASIC4 and the closely related bile acid-sensitive ion channel (BASIC or ASIC5) are orphan receptors. Neuropeptides are important modulators of ASICs. Moreover, related DEG/ENaCs are directly activated by neuropeptides, rendering neuropeptides interesting ligands of ASICs. Here, we performed an unbiased screen of 109 short neuropeptides (<20 amino acids) on five homomeric ASICs: ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC3, ASIC4 and BASIC. This screen revealed no direct agonist of any ASIC but three modulators. First, dynorphin A as a modulator of ASIC1a, which increased currents of partially desensitized channels; second, YFMRFamide as a modulator of ASIC1b and ASIC3, which decreased currents of ASIC1b and slowed desensitization of ASIC1b and ASIC3; and, third, endomorphin-1 as a modulator of ASIC3, which also slowed desensitization. With the exception of YFMRFamide, which, however, is not a mammalian neuropeptide, we identified no new modulator of ASICs. In summary, our screen confirmed some known peptide modulators of ASICs but identified no new peptide ligands of ASICs, suggesting that most short peptides acting as ligands of ASICs are already known.",Hollow-core fibres for temperature-insensitive fibre optics and its demonstration in an Optoelectronic oscillator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573734,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"Many scientific and practical applications require the propagation time through cables to be well defined and known, e.g., an error in the evaluation of signal propagation time in the OPERA experiment in 2011 initially erroneously concluded that Neutrinos are faster than light.

Time synchronization is also of importance in new practical applications like autonomous manufacturing (e.g., synchronization of assembly line robots) and upcoming 5G networks. Even when the propagation time through a coaxial cable or optical fibre is carefully calibrated, it is affected by changes in the ambient temperature, posing a serious technological challenge. We show how hollow-core optical fibres can address this issue.",Cloning and expression of L-asparaginase from Bacillus tequilensis PV9W and therapeutic efficacy of Solid Lipid Particle formulations against cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573733,Scientific reports,2018 12 27,"L-asparaginase, a therapeutic involved in cancer therapy, from Bacillus tequilensis PV9W (ansA gene) was cloned and over expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), achieved the aim of maximizing the yield of the recombinant enzyme (6.02 ± 1.77 IU/mL) within 12 h. The native L-asparaginase of B. tequilensis PV9W was encapsulated using solid lipid particles by hot lipid emulsion method, which is reported for first time in this study. Subsequently, the lipid encapsulated L-asparaginase (LPE) was characterized by SEM, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, SDS-PAGE and its thermo stability was also analyzed by TGA. Further characterization of LPE revealed that enzyme was highly stable for 25 days when stored at 25 °C, showed high pH (9) tolerance and longer trypsin half-life (120 min). In addition, the cytotoxic ability of LPE on HeLa cells was highly enhanced compared to the native L-asparaginase from Bacillus tequilensis PV9W. Moreover, better kinetic velocity and lower Km values of LPE aided to detect L-asparagine in cell extracts by Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) method. The LPE preparation also showed least immunogenic reaction when tested on normal macrophage cell lines. This LPE preparation might thus pave way for efficient drug delivery and enhancing the stability of L-asparaginase for its therapeutic applications.",High-resolution acoustophoretic 3D cell patterning to construct functional collateral cylindroids for ischemia therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573732,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"The fabrication of functional tissues is essential for clinical applications such as disease treatment and drug discovery. Recent studies have revealed that the mechanical environments of tissues, determined by geometric cell patterns, material composition, or mechanical properties, play critical roles in ensuring proper tissue function. Here, we propose an acoustophoretic technique using surface acoustic waves to fabricate therapeutic vascular tissue containing a three-dimensional collateral distribution of vessels. Co-aligned human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human adipose stem cells that are arranged in a biodegradable catechol-conjugated hyaluronic acid hydrogel exhibit enhanced cell-cell contacts, gene expression, and secretion of angiogenic and anti-inflammatory paracrine factors. The therapeutic effects of the fabricated vessel constructs are demonstrated in experiments using an ischemia mouse model by exhibiting the remarkable recovery of damaged tissue. Our study can be referenced to fabricate various types of artificial tissues that mimic the original functions as well as structures.","CD36 plays a critical role in proliferation, migration and tamoxifen-inhibited growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573731,Oncogenesis,2018 12 25,"Tamoxifen inhibits estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer growth while CD36 potentiates cancer metastasis. The effects of CD36 on proliferation/migration of breast cancer cells and tamoxifen-inhibited ER-positive cell growth are unknown. In this study, we correlated the mortality of breast cancer patients to tumor CD36 expression levels. We also found CD36 was higher in ER-rich (MCF-7>T-47D~ZR-75-30) than ER-negative (MDA-MB-231) cells. CD36 siRNA decreased viability and migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with more potent effects on MCF-7 cells. Inversely, high expressing CD36 enhanced cell growth/migration. Mechanistically, CD36 increased expression of genes responsible for cell proliferation, migration and anti-apoptosis. CD36 also activated ERα and ER-targeted genes for cell cycles, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2). Tamoxifen inhibited CD36 and p-ERK1/2 in ERα-positive but not ERα-negative cells. Reciprocally, inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth by tamoxifen was attenuated by high expressing CD36. CD36, ERα and p-ERK1/2 expression was higher in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/TAMR) cells than normal MCF-7 cells. However, CD36 siRNA restored the capacity of tamoxifen inhibiting MCF-7/TAMR cell growth. CD36 antibody inhibited cell growth and expression of ERα, p-ERK1/2 and CCND1. Therefore, our study unveils a pro-tumorigenic role of CD36 in breast cancer by enhancing proliferation/migration of breast cancer cells while attenuating tamoxifen-inhibited ER-positive cell growth.",Electrical appliances moderate households' water demand response to heat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573730,Nature communications,2019 01 28,"Analysis of potentially interconnected residential water and energy demand is sparse. In a 1-in-10 random sample of Singapore households living in apartments, water use per capita declines over the socioeconomic distribution, whereas electricity use rises. Here I show that in this leading Asian city and tropical climate, water and electricity demand respond differentially to heat across different socioeconomic groups. When temperatures rise, water demand increases among lower-income households but remains unchanged among higher-income households. In sharp contrast, heat induces larger shifts in electricity demand among higher-income households. With air-conditioner penetration ranging from 14 to 99% across different socioeconomic groups, my interpretation is that water provides heat relief for households that have yet to adopt air conditioning. How Singaporeans' resource demands respond to heat at different income levels can inform the future responses of a vast urban population on rising incomes living in the water-stressed tropics, in similar and warming climates.",Murine hematopoietic stem cell activity is derived from pre-circulation embryos but not yolk sacs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573729,Nature communications,2019 02 15,"The embryonic site of definitive hematopoietic stem cell (dHSC) origination has been debated for decades. Although an intra-embryonic origin is well supported, the yolk sac (YS) contribution to adult hematopoiesis remains controversial. The same developmental origin makes it difficult to identify specific markers that discern between an intraembryonic versus YS-origin using a lineage trace approach. Additionally, the highly migratory nature of blood cells and the inability of pre-circulatory embryonic cells (i.e., 5-7 somite pairs (sp)) to robustly engraft in transplantation, even after culture, has precluded scientists from properly answering these questions. Here we report robust, multi-lineage and serially transplantable dHSC activity from cultured 2-7sp murine embryonic explants (Em-Ex). dHSC are undetectable in 2-7sp YS explants. Additionally, the engraftment from Em-Ex is confined to an emerging CD31+CD45+c-Kit+CD41- population. In sum, our work supports a model in which the embryo, not the YS, is the major source of lifelong definitive hematopoiesis.",Regulation of mycobacterial infection by macrophage Gch1 and tetrahydrobiopterin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573728,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a crucial role in controlling growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), presumably via nitric oxide (NO) mediated killing. Here we show that leukocyte-specific deficiency of NO production, through targeted loss of the iNOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), results in enhanced control of M.tb infection; by contrast, loss of iNOS renders mice susceptible to M.tb. By comparing two complementary NO-deficient models, Nos2-/- mice and BH4 deficient Gch1fl/flTie2cre mice, we uncover NO-independent mechanisms of anti-mycobacterial immunity. In both murine and human leukocytes, decreased Gch1 expression correlates with enhanced cell-intrinsic control of mycobacterial infection in vitro. Gene expression analysis reveals that Gch1 deficient macrophages have altered inflammatory response, lysosomal function, cell survival and cellular metabolism, thereby enhancing the control of bacterial infection. Our data thus highlight the importance of the NO-independent functions of Nos2 and Gch1 in mycobacterial control."

To address this problem, we devised a novel PCA-based method for correcting genome-wide screening data, bolstering the sensitivity and specificity of detection for genetic interactions. Applying this strategy to a set of 436 whole genome CRISPR screens, we report more than 1.5 million pairs of correlated ""co-functional"" genes that provide finer-scale information about cell compartments, biological pathways, and protein complexes than traditional gene sets. Lastly, we employed a gene community detection approach to implicate core genes for cancer growth and compress signal from functionally related genes in the same community into a single score.

To address this, we compiled and benchmarked sequence and structure-based variant effect predictors and we computed the impact of nearly all possible amino acid and nucleotide variants in the reference genomes of Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli Studied mechanisms include protein stability, interaction interfaces, post-translational modifications and transcription factor binding sites. We apply this resource to the study of natural and disease coding variants. We also show how variant effects can be aggregated to generate protein complex burden scores that uncover protein complex to phenotype associations based on a set of newly generated growth profiles of 93 sequenced S. cerevisiae strains in 43 conditions.

However, how F-actin assembly at the apical surface is regulated in mammalian neurulation remains largely unknown. We report here that formin homology 2 domain-containing 3 (Fhod3), a formin protein that mediates F-actin assembly, is essential for cranial neural tube closure in mouse embryos. We found that Fhod3 is expressed in the lateral neural plate but not in the floor region of the closing neural plate at the hindbrain. Consistently, in Fhod3-null embryos, neural plate bending at the midline occurred normally, but lateral plates seemed floppy and failed to flex dorsomedially. Because the apical accumulation of F-actin and constriction were impaired specifically at the lateral plates in Fhod3-null embryos, we concluded that Fhod3-mediated actin assembly contributes to lateral plate-specific apical constriction to advance closure. Intriguingly, Fhod3 expression at the hindbrain was restricted to neuromeric segments called rhombomeres. The rhombomere-specific accumulation of apical F-actin induced by the rhombomere-restricted expression of Fhod3 was responsible for the outward bulging of rhombomeres involving apical constriction along the anteroposterior axis, as rhombomeric bulging was less prominent in Fhod3-null embryos than in the wild type. Fhod3 thus plays a crucial role in the morphological changes associated with neural tube closure at the hindbrain by mediating apical constriction not only in the mediolateral but also in the anteroposterior direction, thereby contributing to tube closure and rhombomere segmentation, respectively.",Estrogen receptor α promotes protein synthesis by fine-tuning the expression of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit f (eIF3f).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573685,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"Approximately two thirds of all breast cancer cases are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive. The treatment of this breast cancer subtype with endocrine therapies is effective in the adjuvant and recurrent settings. However, their effectiveness is compromised by the emergence of intrinsic or acquired resistance. Thus, identification of new molecular targets can significantly contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In recent years, many studies have implicated aberrant levels of translation initiation factors in cancer etiology and provided evidence that identifies these factors as promising therapeutic targets. Accordingly, we observed reduced levels of the eIF3 subunit eIF3f in ER-positive breast cancer cells compared with ER-negative cells, and determined that low eIF3f levels are required for proper proliferation and survival of ER-positive MCF7 cells. The expression of eIF3f is tightly controlled by ERα at the transcriptional (genomic pathway) and translational (nongenomic pathway) level. Specifically, estrogen-bound ERα represses transcription of the EIF3F gene, while promoting eIF3f mRNA translation. To regulate translation, estrogen activates the mTORC1 pathway, which enhances the binding of eIF3 to the eIF4F complex and, consequently, the assembly of the 48S preinitiation complexes and protein synthesis. We observed preferential translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5'-UTRs that usually encode factors involved in cell proliferation and survival (e.g. cyclin D1 and survivin). Our results underscore the importance of estrogen-ERα-mediated control of eIF3f expression for the proliferation and survival of ER-positive breast cancer cells. These findings may provide rationale for the development of new therapies to treat ER-positive breast cancer.",Inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 following gemcitabine-mediated S phase arrest results in CDC7- and CDK2-dependent replication catastrophe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573684,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 22,"Combining DNA-damaging drugs with DNA checkpoint inhibitors is an emerging strategy to manage cancer. Checkpoint kinase 1 inhibitors (CHK1is) sensitize most cancer cell lines to DNA-damaging drugs and also elicit single-agent cytotoxicity in 15% of cell lines. Consequently, combination therapy may be effective in a broader patient population. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanism of sensitization to gemcitabine by the CHK1i MK8776. Brief gemcitabine incubation irreversibly inhibited ribonucleotide reductase, depleting dNTPs, resulting in durable S phase arrest. Addition of CHK1i 18 h after gemcitabine elicited cell division cycle 7 (CDC7)- and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)-dependent reactivation of the replicative helicase, but did not reinitiate DNA synthesis due to continued lack of dNTPs. Helicase reactivation generated extensive single-strand (ss)DNA that exceeded the protective capacity of the ssDNA-binding protein, replication protein A. The subsequent cleavage of unprotected ssDNA has been termed replication catastrophe. This mechanism did not occur with concurrent CHK1i plus gemcitabine treatment, providing support for delayed administration of CHK1i in patients. Alternative mechanisms of CHK1i-mediated sensitization to gemcitabine have been proposed, but their role was ruled out; these mechanisms include premature mitosis, inhibition of homologous recombination, and activation of double-strand break repair nuclease (MRE11). In contrast, single-agent activity of CHK1i was MRE11-dependent and was prevented by lower concentrations of a CDK2 inhibitor. Hence, both pathways require CDK2 but appear to depend on different CDK2 substrates. We conclude that a small-molecule inhibitor of CHK1 can elicit at least two distinct, context-dependent mechanisms of cytotoxicity in cancer cells.",Sonic hedgehog signaling instigates high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance by targeting PPARγ stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573683,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 06,"Obesity is a major risk for patients with chronic metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a morphogen that regulates the pancreas and adipose tissue formation during embryonic development. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and one of the most important regulators of insulin action. Here, we evaluated the role and mechanism of Shh signaling in obesity-associated insulin resistance and characterized its effect on PPARγ. We showed that Shh expression was up-regulated in subcutaneous fat from obese mice. In differentiated 3T3-L1 and primary cultured adipocytes from rats, recombinant Shh protein and SAG (an agonist of Shh signaling) activated an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent noncanonical pathway and induced PPARγ phosphorylation at serine 112, which decreased PPARγ activity. Meanwhile, Shh signaling degraded PPARγ protein via binding of PPARγ to neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-1 (NEDD4-1). Furthermore, vismodegib, an inhibitor of Shh signaling, attenuated ERK phosphorylation induced by a high fat diet (HFD) and restored PPARγ protein level, thus ameliorating glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in obese mice. Our finding suggests that Shh in subcutaneous fat decreases PPARγ activity and stability via activation of an ERK-dependent noncanonical pathway, resulting in impaired insulin action. Inhibition of Shh may serve as a potential therapeutic approach to treat obesity-related diabetes.",Interleukin 34 (IL-34) cell-surface localization regulated by the molecular chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein facilitates the differentiation of monocytic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573681,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"Interleukin 34 (IL-34) constitutes a cytokine that shares a common receptor, colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), with CSF-1. We recently identified a novel type of monocytic cell termed follicular dendritic cell-induced monocytic cells (FDMCs), whose differentiation depended on CSF-1R signaling through the IL-34 produced from a follicular dendritic cell line, FL-Y. Here, we report the functional mechanisms of the IL-34-mediated CSF-1R signaling underlying FDMC differentiation. CRIPSR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the Il34 gene confirmed that the ability of FL-Y cells to induce FDMCs completely depends on the IL-34 expressed by FL-Y cells. Transwell culture experiments revealed that FDMC differentiation requires a signal from a membrane-anchored form of IL-34 on the FL-Y cell surface, but not from a secreted form, in a direct interaction between FDMC precursor cells and FL-Y cells. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis using an anti-IL-34 antibody indicated that IL-34 was also expressed on the FL-Y cell surface. Thus, we explored proteins interacting with IL-34 in FL-Y cells. Mass spectrometry analysis and pulldown assay identified that IL-34 was associated with the molecular chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) in the plasma membrane fraction of FL-Y cells. Consistent with this finding, GRP78-heterozygous FL-Y cells expressed a lower level of IL-34 protein on their cell surface and exhibited a reduced competency to induce FDMC differentiation compared with the original FL-Y cells. These results indicated a novel GRP78-dependent localization and specific function of IL-34 in FL-Y cells related to monocytic cell differentiation.",TRAF3-interacting JNK-activating modulator promotes inflammation by stimulating translocation of Toll-like receptor 4 to lipid rafts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573680,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key players of the innate immune system and contribute to inflammation and pathogen clearance. Although TLRs have been extensively studied, it remains unclear how exactly bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced conformational changes of the extracellular domain of the TLRs trigger the dimerization of their intracellular domain across the plasma membrane and thereby stimulate downstream signaling. Here, using LPS-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages and murine macrophages along with immunoblotting and immunofluorescence and quantitative analyses, we report that in response to inflammatory stimuli, the coiled-coil protein TRAF3-interacting JNK-activating modulator (T3JAM) associates with TLR4, promotes its translocation to lipid rafts, and thereby enhances macrophage-mediated inflammation. T3JAM overexpression increased and T3JAM depletion decreased TLR4 signaling through both the MyD88-dependent pathway and TLR4 endocytosis. Importantly, deletion or mutation of T3JAM to disrupt its coiled-coil-mediated homoassociation abrogated TLR4 recruitment to lipid rafts. Consistently, T3JAM depletion in mice dampened TLR4 signaling and alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory damage. Collectively, our findings reveal an additional molecular mechanism by which TLR4 activity is regulated and suggest that T3JAM may function as a molecular clamp to ""tighten up"" TLR4 and facilitate its translocation to lipid rafts.",Histone acetyltransferase CBP is critical for conventional effector and memory T-cell differentiation in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573679,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"Compared with naïve T cells, memory CD8+ T cells have a transcriptional landscape and proteome that are optimized to generate a more rapid and robust response to secondary infection. Additionally, rewired kinase signal transduction pathways likely contribute to the superior recall response of memory CD8+ T cells, but this idea has not been experimentally confirmed. Herein, we utilized an MS approach to identify proteins that are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to Listeria-induced T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in both naïve and memory CD8+ T cells from mice and separated by fluorescence- and flow cytometry-based cell sorting. This analysis identified substantial differences in tyrosine kinase signaling networks between naïve and memory CD8+ T cells. We also observed that an important axis in memory CD8+ T cells couples Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) hyperactivation to the phosphorylation of CREB-binding protein (CBP). Functionally, JAK2-catalyzed phosphorylation enabled CBP to bind with higher affinity to acetylated histone peptides, indicating a potential epigenetic mechanism that could contribute to rapid initiation of transcriptional programs in memory CD8+ T cells. Moreover, we found that CBP itself is essential for conventional effector and memory CD8+ T-cell formation. These results indicate how signaling pathways are altered to promote CD8+ memory cell formation and rapid responses to and protection from repeat infections.",The Legionella effector LtpM is a new type of phosphoinositide-activated glucosyltransferase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573678,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Legionella pneumophila causes Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia. L. pneumophila translocates more than 300 effectors into host cells via its Dot/Icm (Defective in organelle trafficking/Intracellular multiplication) type IV secretion system to enable its replication in target cells. Here, we studied the effector LtpM, which is encoded in a recombination hot spot in L. pneumophila Paris. We show that a C-terminal phosphoinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-binding domain, also found in otherwise unrelated effectors, targets LtpM to the Legionella-containing vacuole and to early and late endosomes. LtpM expression in yeast caused cytotoxicity. Sequence comparison and structural homology modeling of the N-terminal domain of LtpM uncovered a remote similarity to the glycosyltransferase (GT) toxin PaTox from the bacterium Photorhabdus asymbiotica; however, instead of the canonical DxD motif of GT-A type glycosyltransferases, essential for enzyme activity and divalent cation coordination, we found that a DxN motif is present in LtpM. Using UDP-glucose as sugar donor, we show that purified LtpM nevertheless exhibits glucohydrolase and autoglucosylation activity in vitro and demonstrate that PI3P binding activates LtpM's glucosyltransferase activity toward protein substrates. Substitution of the aspartate or the asparagine in the DxN motif abolished the activity of LtpM. Moreover, whereas all glycosyltransferase toxins and effectors identified so far depend on the presence of divalent cations, LtpM is active in their absence. Proteins containing LtpM-like GT domains are encoded in the genomes of other L. pneumophila isolates and species, suggesting that LtpM is the first member of a novel family of glycosyltransferase effectors employed to subvert hosts."

The most common infectious etiology is Neisseria meningitidis sepsis, and less commonly it has been documented as a complication of invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae In children who are otherwise healthy, splenic dysfunction is a significant predisposing factor for invasive pneumococcal infection. We present the case of a 10-month-old girl with a history of developmental delay, who developed an overwhelming infection complicated by purpura fulminans and was found to have previously undiagnosed Mowat-Wilson syndrome with anatomic asplenia. We propose screening patients with clinical features suggestive of Mowat-Wilson syndrome for asplenia to evaluate the need for additional preventive care.",Patient and Caregiver Priorities for Outcomes in Peritoneal Dialysis: Multinational Nominal Group Technique Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573659,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2019 04 18,"The absence of accepted patient-centered outcomes in research can limit shared decision-making in peritoneal dialysis (PD), particularly because PD-related treatments can be associated with mortality, technique failure, and complications that can impair quality of life.

Among the list of such bacteria released by WHO, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, for which almost no treatment exists, tops the list. A. baumannii is one of the most troublesome ESKAPE pathogens and mechanisms that have facilitated its rise as a successful pathogen are not well studied. Efforts in this direction have resulted in the identification of Hpa2-Ab, an uncharacterized histone acetyltransferase enzyme of GNAT superfamily. Here, we show that Hpa2-Ab confers resistance against aminoglycoside antibiotics using Escherichia coli DH5α strains in which Hpa2 gene is expressed. Resistivity for aminoglycoside antibiotics is demonstrated with the help of CLSI-2010 and KB tests. Isothermal titration calorimetry, MALDI and acetylation assays indicate that conferred resistance is an outcome of evolved antibiotic acetylation capacity in this. Hpa2 is known to acetylate nuclear molecules; however, here it is found to cross its boundary and participate in other functions. An array of biochemical and biophysical techniques were also used to study this protein, which demonstrates that Hpa2-Ab is intrinsically oligomeric in nature, exists primarily as a dimer and its interface is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Our work demonstrates an evolved survival strategy by A. baumannii and provides insights into the mechanism that facilitates it to rise as a successful pathogen.",The peroxisomal zebrafish SCP2-thiolase (type-1) is a weak transient dimer as revealed by crystal structures and native mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573650,The Biochemical journal,2019 01 26,"The SCP2 (sterol carrier protein 2)-thiolase (type-1) functions in the vertebrate peroxisomal, bile acid synthesis pathway, converting 24-keto-THC-CoA and CoA into choloyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. This conversion concerns the β-oxidation chain shortening of the steroid fatty acyl-moiety of 24-keto-THC-CoA. This class of dimeric thiolases has previously been poorly characterized. High-resolution crystal structures of the zebrafish SCP2-thiolase (type-1) now reveal an open catalytic site, shaped by residues of both subunits. The structure of its non-dimerized monomeric form has also been captured in the obtained crystals. Four loops at the dimer interface adopt very different conformations in the monomeric form. These loops also shape the active site and their structural changes explain why a competent active site is not present in the monomeric form. Native mass spectrometry studies confirm that the zebrafish SCP2-thiolase (type-1) as well as its human homolog are weak transient dimers in solution. The crystallographic binding studies reveal the mode of binding of CoA and octanoyl-CoA in the active site, highlighting the conserved geometry of the nucleophilic cysteine, the catalytic acid/base cysteine and the two oxyanion holes. The dimer interface of SCP2-thiolase (type-1) is equally extensive as in other thiolase dimers; however, it is more polar than any of the corresponding interfaces, which correlates with the notion that the enzyme forms a weak transient dimer. The structure comparison of the monomeric and dimeric forms suggests functional relevance of this property. These comparisons provide also insights into the structural rearrangements that occur when the folded inactive monomers assemble into the mature dimer.",Double trouble? Gag in conjunction with double insert in HIV protease contributes to reduced DRV susceptibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573649,The Biochemical journal,2019 02 01,"HIV protease is essential for processing the Gag polyprotein to produce infectious virions and is a major target in antiretroviral therapy. We have identified an unusual HIV-1 subtype C variant that contains insertions of leucine and asparagine (L38↑N↑L) in the hinge region of protease at position 38. This was isolated from a protease inhibitor naïve infant. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that 10% less of L38↑N↑L protease was in the active conformation as compared with a reference strain. L38↑N↑L protease displayed a ±50% reduction in KM and kcat The catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of L38↑N↑L protease was not significantly different from that of wild type although there was a 42% reduction in specific activity for the variant. An in vitro phenotypic assay showed the L38↑N↑L protease to be susceptible to lopinavir (LPV), atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir in the context of an unrelated Gag. However, in the presence of the related Gag, L38↑N↑L showed reduced susceptibility to darunavir while remaining susceptible to LPV and ATV. Furthermore, a reduction in viral replication capacity (RC) was observed in combination with the related Gag. The reduced susceptibility to darunavir and decrease in RC may be due to PTAPP duplication in the related Gag. The present study shows the importance of considering the Gag region when looking at drug susceptibility of HIV-1 protease variants.",Cross-Modal Competition: The Default Computation for Multisensory Processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573648,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 05 08,"Mature multisensory superior colliculus (SC) neurons integrate information across the senses to enhance their responses to spatiotemporally congruent cross-modal stimuli. The development of this neurotypic feature of SC neurons requires experience with cross-modal cues. In the absence of such experience the response of an SC neuron to congruent cross-modal cues is no more robust than its response to the most effective component cue. This ""default"" or ""naive"" state is believed to be one in which cross-modal signals do not interact. The present results challenge this characterization by identifying interactions between visual-auditory signals in male and female cats reared without visual-auditory experience. By manipulating the relative effectiveness of the visual and auditory cross-modal cues that were presented to each of these naive neurons, an active competition between cross-modal signals was revealed. Although contrary to current expectations, this result is explained by a neuro-computational model in which the default interaction is mutual inhibition. These findings suggest that multisensory neurons at all maturational stages are capable of some form of multisensory integration, and use experience with cross-modal stimuli to transition from their initial state of competition to their mature state of cooperation. By doing so, they develop the ability to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events thereby increasing their impact on the sensorimotor circuitry of the SC, and the likelihood that biologically significant events will elicit SC-mediated overt behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The present results demonstrate that the default mode of multisensory processing in the superior colliculus is competition, not non-integration as previously characterized. A neuro-computational model explains how these competitive dynamics can be implemented via mutual inhibition, and how this default mode is superseded by the emergence of cooperative interactions during development.","ARL13B, a Joubert Syndrome-Associated Protein, Is Critical for Retinogenesis and Elaboration of Mouse Photoreceptor Outer Segments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573647,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 03 06,"Mutations in the Joubert syndrome-associated small GTPase ARL13B are linked to photoreceptor impairment and vision loss. To determine the role of ARL13B in the development, function, and maintenance of ciliated photoreceptors, we generated a pan-retina knock-out (Six3-Cre) and a rod photoreceptor-specific inducible conditional knock-out (Pde6g-CreERT2) of ARL13B using murine models. Embryonic deletion of ARL13B led to defects in retinal development with reduced cell proliferation. In the absence of ARL13B, photoreceptors failed to develop outer segment (OS) membranous discs and axonemes, resulting in loss of function and rapid degeneration. Additionally, the majority of photoreceptor basal bodies did not dock properly at the apical edge of the inner segments. The removal of ARL13B in adult rod photoreceptor cells after maturation of OS resulted in loss of photoresponse and vesiculation in the OS. Before changes in photoresponse, removal of ARL13B led to mislocalization of rhodopsin, prenylated phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6), and intraflagellar transport protein-88 (IFT88). Our findings show that ARL13B is required at multiple stages of retinogenesis, including early postnatal proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, development of photoreceptor cilia, and morphogenesis of photoreceptor OS discs regardless of sex. Last, our results establish a need for ARL13B in photoreceptor maintenance and protein trafficking.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The normal development of photoreceptor cilia is essential to create functional, organized outer segments with stacked membrane discs that house the phototransduction proteins necessary for sight. Our study identifies a complex role for ARL13B, a small GTPase linked to Joubert syndrome and visual impairment, at various stages of photoreceptor development. Loss of ARL13B led to defects in retinal proliferation, altered placement of basal bodies crucial for components of the cilium (transition zone) to emanate, and absence of photoreceptor-stacked discs. These defects led to extinguished visual response and dysregulated protein trafficking. Our findings show the complex role ARL13B plays in photoreceptor development, viability, and function. Our study accounts for the severe retinal impairment observed in ARL13B-linked Joubert syndrome patients."

The contribution of genetic factors to this risk is unclear. We therefore examined 211 155 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for gene-radiation interaction on breast cancer risk in a case-only analysis including 327 breast cancer patients after chest RT for HL and 4671 first primary breast cancer patients. Nine SNPs showed statistically significant interaction with RT on breast cancer risk (false discovery rate, <20%), of which 1 SNP in the PVT1 oncogene attained the Bonferroni threshold for statistical significance. A polygenic risk score (PRS) composed of these SNPs (RT-interaction-PRS) and a previously published breast cancer PRS (BC-PRS) derived in the general population were evaluated in a case-control analysis comprising the 327 chest-irradiated HL patients with breast cancer and 491 chest-irradiated HL patients without breast cancer. Patients in the highest tertile of the RT-interaction-PRS had a 1.6-fold higher breast cancer risk than those in the lowest tertile. Remarkably, we observed a fourfold increased RT-induced breast cancer risk in the highest compared with the lowest decile of the BC-PRS. On a continuous scale, breast cancer risk increased 1.4-fold per standard deviation of the BC-PRS, similar to the effect size found in the general population. This study demonstrates that genetic factors influence breast cancer risk after chest RT for HL. Given the high absolute breast cancer risk in radiation-exposed women, these results can have important implications for the management of current HL survivors and future patients.",ATP-dependent force generation and membrane scission by ESCRT-III and Vps4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573630,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) catalyze reverse-topology scission from the inner face of membrane necks in HIV budding, multivesicular endosome biogenesis, cytokinesis, and other pathways. We encapsulated ESCRT-III subunits Snf7, Vps24, and Vps2 and the AAA+ ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) Vps4 in giant vesicles from which membrane nanotubes reflecting the correct topology of scission could be pulled. Upon ATP release by photo-uncaging, this system generated forces within the nanotubes that led to membrane scission in a manner dependent upon Vps4 catalytic activity and Vps4 coupling to the ESCRT-III proteins. Imaging of scission revealed Snf7 and Vps4 puncta within nanotubes whose presence followed ATP release, correlated with force generation and nanotube constriction, and preceded scission. These observations directly verify long-standing predictions that ATP-hydrolyzing assemblies of ESCRT-III and Vps4 sever membranes.",NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity contributes to tumor control by a cytostatic drug combination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573629,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 19,"Molecularly targeted therapies aim to obstruct cell autonomous programs required for tumor growth. We show that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors act in combination to suppress the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells while simultaneously provoking a natural killer (NK) cell surveillance program leading to tumor cell death. The drug combination, but neither agent alone, promotes retinoblastoma (RB) protein-mediated cellular senescence and activation of the immunomodulatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP components tumor necrosis factor-α and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 are required for NK cell surveillance of drug-treated tumor cells, which contributes to tumor regressions and prolonged survival in a KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse model. Therefore, molecularly targeted agents capable of inducing senescence can produce tumor control through non-cell autonomous mechanisms involving NK cell surveillance.",A hidden cradle of plant evolution in Permian tropical lowlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573628,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"The latitudinal biodiversity gradient today has deep roots in the evolutionary history of Earth's biota over geologic time. In the marine realm, earliest fossil occurrences at low latitudes reveal a tropical cradle for many animal groups. However, the terrestrial fossil record-especially from drier environments that are thought to drive evolutionary innovation-is sparse. We present mixed plant-fossil assemblages from Permian equatorial lowlands in present-day Jordan that harbor precocious records of three major seed-plant lineages that all became dominant during the Mesozoic, including the oldest representative of any living conifer family. These finds offer a glimpse of the early evolutionary origins of modern plant groups in disturbance-prone tropical habitats that are usually hidden from observation.",The strength of long-range ties in population-scale social networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573627,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"Long-range connections that span large social networks are widely assumed to be weak, composed of sporadic and emotionally distant relationships. However, researchers historically have lacked the population-scale network data needed to verify the predicted weakness. Using data from 11 culturally diverse population-scale networks on four continents-encompassing 56 million Twitter users and 58 million mobile phone subscribers-we find that long-range ties are nearly as strong as social ties embedded within a small circle of friends. These high-bandwidth connections have important implications for diffusion and social integration.",Elevated trawling inside protected areas undermines conservation outcomes in a global fishing hot spot.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573625,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly used as a primary tool to conserve biodiversity. This is particularly relevant in heavily exploited fisheries hot spots such as Europe, where MPAs now cover 29% of territorial waters, with unknown effects on fishing pressure and conservation outcomes. We investigated industrial trawl fishing and sensitive indicator species in and around 727 MPAs designated by the European Union. We found that 59% of MPAs are commercially trawled, and average trawling intensity across MPAs is at least 1.4-fold higher as compared with nonprotected areas. Abundance of sensitive species (sharks, rays, and skates) decreased by 69% in heavily trawled areas. The widespread industrial exploitation of MPAs undermines global biodiversity conservation targets, elevating recent concerns about growing human pressures on protected areas worldwide.",Single-component quasicrystalline nanocrystal superlattices through flexible polygon tiling rule.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573624,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"Quasicrystalline superlattices (QC-SLs) generated from single-component colloidal building blocks have been predicted by computer simulations but are challenging to reproduce experimentally. We discovered that 10-fold QC-SLs could self-organize from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots with anisotropic patchiness. Transmission electron microscopy and tomography measurements allow structural reconstruction of the QC-SL from the nanoscale packing to the atomic-scale orientation alignments. The unique QC order leads to a tiling concept, the ""flexible polygon tiling rule,"" that replicates the experimental observations. The keys for the single-component QC-SL formation were identified to be the anisotropic shape and patchiness of the building blocks and the assembly microscopic environment. Our discovery may spur the creation of various superstructures using anisotropic objects through an enthalpy-driven route.",Cascading regime shifts within and across scales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573623,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"Regime shifts are large, abrupt, and persistent critical transitions in the function and structure of ecosystems. Yet, it is unknown how these transitions will interact, whether the occurrence of one will increase the likelihood of another or simply correlate at distant places. We explored two types of cascading effects: Domino effects create one-way dependencies, whereas hidden feedbacks produce two-way interactions. We compare them with the control case of driver sharing, which can induce correlations. Using 30 regime shifts described as networks, we show that 45% of regime shift pairwise combinations present at least one plausible structural interdependence. The likelihood of cascading effects depends on cross-scale interactions but differs for each type. Management of regime shifts should account for potential connections.","Platelet-specific deletion of SNAP23 ablates granule secretion, substantially inhibiting arterial and venous thrombosis in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573565,Blood advances,2019 01 08,"Platelet secretion is central to physiological and pathophysiological platelet function. SNAP23 has long been implicated as being a principal SNARE protein regulating platelet granule secretion, although this has not been definitively demonstrated in genetic models. Here, using a platelet-specific conditional SNAP23 knockout mouse, we show that absence of SNAP23 results in complete ablation of dense granule, α granule, and lysosomal secretion. Measured granule cargo content and granule numbers were normal, suggesting SNAP23 regulates fusion of granules with the extracellular membrane, rather than granule loading or formation. A macrothrombocytopenia was also observed, which, combined with ablation of secretion, resulted in a pronounced bleeding defect in a tail bleed assay and almost complete ablation of arterial and venous thrombosis. The macrothrombocytopenia was not due to reduced megakaryopoiesis but instead likely was due to the increased loss of platelets through bleeding, consistent with an increase in platelet total RNA content indicating a greater number of reticulated platelets. The data definitively show SNAP23 to be critical for granule release of any kind from platelets, irrespective of stimulus, and this is the first single gene to be shown to be universally essential for exocytosis in platelets.",Safety and efficacy of an oncolytic viral strategy using bortezomib with ICE/R in relapsed/refractory HIV-positive lymphomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573564,Blood advances,2019 01 08,"HIV-associated lymphomas (HALs) have high rates of latent infection by gammaherpesviruses (GHVs). We hypothesized that proteasome inhibition would induce lytic activation of GHVs and inhibit HIV infectivity via preservation of cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G, improving lymphoma control. We tested this oncolytic and antiviral strategy by using bortezomib combined with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) alone or with rituximab (ICE/R) in relapsed/refractory HAL. A 3+3 dose-escalation design was used with a 7-day lead-in period of single-agent bortezomib. Bortezomib was administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each cycle at 1 of 4 dose levels: 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, or 1.5 mg/m2 ICE began day 8 of cycle 1 and day 1 of subsequent cycles. Rituximab was included on day 1 of cycles 2 to 6 for CD20+ lymphomas. Twenty-three patients were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib was not reached. Grade 4 toxicities attributable to bortezomib were limited to myelosuppression. Responses occurred in 17 (77%) of 22 patients receiving any protocol therapy. The 1-year overall survival was 57%. After bortezomib alone, both patients with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)-positive lymphoma had more than a 1-log increase in KSHV viral load. In 12 patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphoma, median values of EBV viral load increased. Undetectable HIV viremia at baseline in the majority of patients limited evaluation of HIV inhibition. APOBEC3G levels increased in 75% of evaluable patients. Bortezomib combined with ICE/R in patients with relapsed/refractory HAL is feasible with response and survival comparing favorably against previously reported second-line therapies. Changes in GHV viral loads and APOBEC3G levels trended as hypothesized. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00598169."

Studies on IPV and mental health show that experiencing more than one type of IPV often enhances women's depression or depressive symptoms. However, most of these studies conceptualize IPV as physical, psychological, or sexual violence. Little is known about specific experiences of severe IPV, such as strangulation, that put victims at greater risk of lethality and serious injury and their association with women's depression. This study examined associations between IPV, strangulation, and depression among women using secondary data collected for a randomized clinical trial testing an integrated HIV-IPV prevention intervention for abused women. Women were recruited from healthcare service delivery organizations, Department of Health and Human Services, and family court. Women (n = 175) completed assessments on IPV, strangulation, mental health, social support, and self-esteem. The majority reported strangulation (n = 103) and depressive symptoms (n = 101). Women who experienced strangulation also reported more severe physical (p < .001), sexual (p < .001), and psychological (p < .001) abuse. However, in multivariate logistic regression with sociodemographics, violence variables, and strangulation, none of these variables were associated with a higher risk for depressive symptoms. Social support had a protective effect on depressive symptoms. Findings suggest strangulation is prevalent among abused women seeking services, warranting screening, assessment, and referral in these settings.",Correlates of Cyberstalking Victimization and Perpetration Among College Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573549,Violence and victims,2019 06 07,"Few studies have examined theoretical predictors of cyberstalking victimization and offending.

College women were at increased risk of cyberstalking victimization, but were also more likely to report having engaged in cyberstalking perpetration. Higher levels of self-control reduced the likelihood of cyberstalking victimization and offending. While Greek life membership and holding adversarial heterosexual beliefs did not affect cyberstalking victimization and offending, gender stereotyping decreased the odds of experiencing cyberstalking victimization.

The current study seeks to fill this gap by exploring factors related to risk of victimization in a male forensic psychiatric sample using a relatively new risk assessment measure. The Short-Term Assessment of Risk and Treatability (START) is a short-term risk assessment measure that compiles information about several clinically relevant risk factors to evaluate risk of victimization, among other adverse outcomes. Nearly one-third (31.3%) of the sample experienced some type of victimization during their hospitalization. The summary risk judgment and subsets of select START items effectively predicted risk of victimization in this sample with a fair degree of accuracy over a 2-month period.",Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573546,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 12,"In vaccine design, antigens are often arrayed in a multivalent nanoparticle form, but in vivo mechanisms underlying the enhanced immunity elicited by such vaccines remain poorly understood. We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or ""free"" forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-, and immunogen glycan-dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via immunogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses. These findings identify an innate immune-mediated recognition pathway promoting antibody responses to particulate antigens, with broad implications for humoral immunity and vaccine design.",Structural adaptations of photosynthetic complex I enable ferredoxin-dependent electron transfer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573545,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 12,"Photosynthetic complex I enables cyclic electron flow around photosystem I, a regulatory mechanism for photosynthetic energy conversion.

By mimicking cyclic electron flow with isolated components in vitro, we demonstrate that ferredoxin directly mediates electron transfer between photosystem I and complex I, instead of using intermediates such as NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).

We chronicle here the case of an otherwise healthy woman who developed ventricular fibrillation-related cardiac arrest secondary to the use of Hydroxycut and Metaboost preparations. Published medical literature has a handful of case reports associating these products with potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The proposed hypothesis implicates ingredients of these diet aids to have proarrhythmogenic effects. Physicians should remain vigilant for possible cardiotoxicity associated with the use of dietary supplements. Individuals who are at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias should avoid herbal weight-loss formulas, given the serious clinical implications. Additionally, this paper highlights the need for a proper framework to delineate the magnitude and scope of this association.",Pseudo-Wellens' syndrome in pulmonary embolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573540,BMJ case reports,2019 04 03,"Wellens' syndrome is described as characteristic biphasic or symmetrical T-wave inversion with normal precordial R-wave progression and the absence of Q waves in the right precordial leads. It is seen during chest pain-free interval in a subset of patients with unstable angina. Wellens' syndrome is associated with critical stenosis of proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Similar characteristic ECG changes associated with causes other than LAD stenosis have been described as pseudo-Wellens' syndrome. In this case report, we present a young 22-year-old man who presented with characteristic Wellens' ECG changes in the setting of pulmonary embolism with right ventricular strain. T-wave inversion in right precordial leads is a well-recognised ECG manifestation of right ventricular strain; however, biphasic T waves in the setting of pulmonary embolism are rare. Pulmonary embolism was seen in our patient a week after starting risperidone. There is a reported association between antipsychotic drugs and increased risk of thromboembolism. Risperidone could have potentially contributed to the pulmonary embolism in our patient given the temporal association and absence of risk factors.",Closed loop small bowel obstruction due to paracaecal internal herniation: a lesson in rarity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573539,BMJ case reports,2019 04 03,"A 40-year-old man presented to the emergency department of our tertiary hospital with acute abdominal pain since 1 day, which responded to conservative measures initially.

Underpinning Tmem survival is a shift in cellular metabolism away from aerobic glycolysis towards fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Here we investigated the impact of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist GW501516 (GW), an agent known to boost FAO in other tissues, on CD8+ T-cell metabolism, function, and efficacy in a murine ACT model. Via activation of both PPARα and PPARδ/β, GW treatment increased expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1a, the rate-limiting enzyme of FAO, in activated CD8+ T cells. Using a metabolomics approach, we demonstrated that GW increased the abundance of multiple different acylcarnitines, consistent with enhanced FAO. T cells activated in the presence of GW and inflammatory signals, either mature dendritic cells or IL12, also demonstrated enhanced production of IFNγ and expression of T-bet. Despite high expression of T-bet, a characteristic of short-lived effector cells, GW-treated cells demonstrated enhanced persistence in vivo and superior efficacy in a model of ACT. Collectively, these data identify combined PPARα and PPARδ/β agonists as attractive candidates for further studies and rapid translation into clinical trials of ACT. SIGNIFICANCE: Dual activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α and δ improves the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy by reprogramming T-cell metabolism and cytokine expression.",Hypermethylation of SHISA3 Promotes Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Metastasis by Reducing SGSM1 Stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573520,Cancer research,2019 03 27,"Altered DNA methylation is a key feature of cancer, and aberrant methylation is important in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) development. However, the methylation mechanisms underlying metastasis of NPC remain unclear. Analyzing data from public databases and conducting our own experiments, we report here that promoter hypermethylation of SHISA3 is common and contributes to the downregulation of this gene in many types of tumors, including NPC. SHISA3 suppressed NPC cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo by impeding the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation small G protein signaling modulator 1 (SGSM1) and by inhibiting the MAPK pathway activation. Silencing SGSM1 abrogated the inhibitory effect of SHISA3 on NPC cell migration and invasion. This newly identified SHISA3-TRIM21-SGSM1 axis could be a novel therapeutic target in NPC. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight the mechanism by which a newly identified tumor suppressor SHISA3 suppresses invasion and metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",Early Noninvasive Detection of Response to Targeted Therapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573519,Cancer research,2019 04 26,"With the advent of precision oncology, there is an urgent need to develop improved methods for rapidly detecting responses to targeted therapies. Here, we have developed an ultrasensitive measure of cell-free tumor load using targeted and whole-genome sequencing approaches to assess responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced lung cancer. Analyses of 28 patients treated with anti-EGFR or HER2 therapies revealed a bimodal distribution of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) after therapy initiation, with molecular responders having nearly complete elimination of ctDNA (>98%). Molecular nonresponders displayed limited changes in ctDNA levels posttreatment and experienced significantly shorter progression-free survival (median 1.6 vs. 13.7 months, P < 0.0001; HR = 66.6; 95% confidence interval, 13.0-341.7), which was detected on average 4 weeks earlier than CT imaging. ctDNA analyses of patients with radiographic stable or nonmeasurable disease improved prediction of clinical outcome compared with CT imaging. These analyses provide a rapid approach for evaluating therapeutic response to targeted therapies and have important implications for the management of patients with cancer and the development of new therapeutics.Significance: Cell-free tumor load provides a novel approach for evaluating longitudinal changes in ctDNA during systemic treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and serves an unmet clinical need for real-time, noninvasive detection of tumor response to targeted therapies before radiographic assessment.See related commentary by Zou and Meyerson, p. 1038.",Acid-Induced Downregulation of ASS1 Contributes to the Maintenance of Intracellular pH in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573518,Cancer research,2019 03 27,"Downregulation of the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1) by either promoter methylation or by HIF1α is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in multiple cancers. We have previously shown that in normoxic conditions, ASS1 downregulation facilitates cancer cell proliferation by increasing aspartate availability for pyrimidine synthesis by the enzyme complex CAD. Here we report that in hypoxia, ASS1 expression in cancerous cells is downregulated further by HIF1α-mediated induction of miR-224-5p, making the cells more invasive and dependent on upstream substrates of ASS1 for survival. ASS1 was downregulated under acidic conditions, and ASS1-depleted cancer cells maintained a higher intracellular pH (pHi), depended less on extracellular glutamine, and displayed higher glutathione levels. Depletion of substrates of urea cycle enzymes in ASS1-deficient cancers decreased cancer cell survival. Thus, ASS1 levels in cancer are differentially regulated in various environmental conditions to metabolically benefit cancer progression. Understanding these alterations may help uncover specific context-dependent cancer vulnerabilities that may be targeted for therapeutic purposes. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer cells in an acidic or hypoxic environment downregulate the expression of the urea cycle enzyme ASS1, which provides them with a redox and pH advantage, resulting in better survival.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/3/518/F1.large.jpg.",Intraindividual Variation in Markers of Intestinal Permeability and Adipose Tissue Inflammation in Healthy Normal-Weight to Obese Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573517,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2019 03 07,"Intestinal permeability and adipose tissue inflammation are considered mechanistic links in the relationship between diet, obesity, and chronic disease.

Modern risk stratification includes both clinical and biological features. A validated clinical risk model employing the five traditional International Prognostic Index risk factors plus renal or adrenal involvement can identify a high-risk patient population with a central nervous system recurrence risk of greater than 10%. Lymphoma involvement of certain discrete extranodal sites such as the testis also confers increased risk, even in stage I disease. Adverse biological risk factors for central nervous system relapse include presence of translocations of MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6, in so-called double- or triple-hit lymphoma. Immunohistochemically detectable co-expression of MYC and BCL2 in the absence of translocations also portends an increased risk of relapse within the central nervous system, particularly in the setting of the activated B-cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The role, method, and timing of prophylactic therapy remain controversial based on the available data. We review both intrathecal and systemic strategies for prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Our preference is for systemic methotrexate in concert with standard chemoimmunotherapy in the majority of cases. Several novel agents have also demonstrated clinical activity in primary and secondary central nervous system lymphoma and warrant future investigation in the prophylactic setting.",Peering through zebrafish to understand inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573510,Haematologica,2019 01 08,"Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are experiments of nature characterized by impaired hematopoiesis with cancer and leukemia predisposition. The mutations associated with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes affect fundamental cellular pathways, such as DNA repair, telomere maintenance, or proteostasis. How these disturbed pathways fail to produce sufficient blood cells and lead to leukemogenesis are not understood. The rarity of inherited cytopenias, the paucity of affected primary human hematopoietic cells, and the sometime inadequacy of murine or induced pluripotential stem cell models mean it is difficult to acquire a greater understanding of them. Zebrafish offer a model organism to study gene functions. As vertebrates, zebrafish share with humans many orthologous genes involved in blood disorders. As a model organism, zebrafish provide advantages that include rapid development of transparent embryos, high fecundity (providing large numbers of mutant and normal siblings), and a large collection of mutant and transgenic lines useful for investigating the blood system and other tissues during development. Importantly, recent advances in genomic editing in zebrafish can speedily validate the new genes or novel variants discovered in clinical investigation as causes for marrow failure. Here we review zebrafish as a model organism that phenocopies Fanconi anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and severe congenital neutropenia. Two important insights, provided by modeling inherited cytopenias in zebrafish, widen understanding of ribosome biogenesis and TP53 in mediating marrow failure and non-hematologic defects. They suggest that TP53-independent pathways contribute to marrow failure. In addition, zebrafish provide an attractive model organism for drug development.",Tspan18 is a novel regulator of the Ca2+ channel Orai1 and von Willebrand factor release in endothelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573509,Haematologica,2019 05 14,"Ca2+ entry via Orai1 store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane is critical to cell function, and Orai1 loss causes severe immunodeficiency and developmental defects. The tetraspanins are a superfamily of transmembrane proteins that interact with specific partner proteins and regulate their trafficking and clustering. The aim of this study was to functionally characterize tetraspanin Tspan18. We show that Tspan18 is expressed by endothelial cells at several-fold higher levels than most other cell types analyzed. Tspan18-knockdown primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells have 55-70% decreased Ca2+ mobilization upon stimulation with the inflammatory mediators thrombin or histamine, similar to Orai1-knockdown. Tspan18 interacts with Orai1, and Orai1 cell surface localization is reduced by 70% in Tspan18-knockdown endothelial cells. Tspan18 over-expression in lymphocyte model cell lines induces 20-fold activation of Ca2+-responsive NFAT signaling, in an Orai1-dependent manner. Tspan18-knockout mice are viable. They lose on average 6-fold more blood in a tail-bleed assay. This is due to Tspan18 deficiency in non-hematopoietic cells, as assessed using chimeric mice. Tspan18-knockout mice have 60% reduced thrombus size in a deep vein thrombosis model, and 50% reduced platelet deposition in the microcirculation following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Histamine- or thrombin-induced von Willebrand factor release from endothelial cells is reduced by 90% following Tspan18-knockdown, and histamine-induced increase of plasma von Willebrand factor is reduced by 45% in Tspan18-knockout mice. These findings identify Tspan18 as a novel regulator of endothelial cell Orai1/Ca2+ signaling and von Willebrand factor release in response to inflammatory stimuli.",Poor prognosis of chromosome 7 clonal aberrations in Philadelphia-negative metaphases and relevance of potential underlying myelodysplastic features in chronic myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573507,Haematologica,2019 06 01,"Clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells could concern chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The European LeukemiaNet distinguishes -7/del(7q) abnormalities as a ""warning"". However, the impact of clonal chromosome abnormalities, and specifically those of -7/del(7q), in Philadelphia-negative cells on clinical outcomes is unclear and based on case-reports showing morphological dysplasia and increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting the coexistence of chronic myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. The aim of this study was to determine whether the impact of -7/del(7q) clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells on the clinical outcome is different from that of other types of abnormalities, and we argue for an underlying associated high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Among 102 chronic myeloid leukemia patients with clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells with more than a median of 6 years of follow up, patients with -7/del(7q) more frequently had signs of dysplasia, a lower cumulative incidence of deep molecular response and often needed further treatment lines, with the consequent impact on event-free and progression-free survival. Morphological features of dysplasia are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia mutations and compromise the optimal response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, irrespectively of the type of clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells. However, mutation patterns determined by next-generation sequencing could not clearly explain the underlying high-risk disease. We hereby confirm the pejorative prognostic value of -7/del(7q) clonal chromosome abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells and suggest that myelodysplastic features constitute a warning signal that response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be less than optimal.","The thymidine dideoxynucleoside analog, alovudine, inhibits the mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ, impairs oxidative phosphorylation and promotes monocytic differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573504,Haematologica,2019 06 10,"Mitochondrial DNA encodes 13 proteins that comprise components of the respiratory chain that maintain oxidative phosphorylation. The replication of mitochondrial DNA is performed by the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ. As acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and stem cells have an increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, we sought to evaluate polymerase γ inhibitors in AML. The thymidine dideoxynucleoside analog, alovudine, is an inhibitor of polymerase γ. In AML cells, alovudine depleted mitochondrial DNA, reduced mitochondrial encoded proteins, decreased basal oxygen consumption, and decreased cell proliferation and viability. To evaluate the effects of polymerase γ inhibition with alovudine in vivo, mice were xenografted with OCI-AML2 cells and then treated with alovudine. Systemic administration of alovudine reduced leukemic growth without evidence of toxicity and decreased levels of mitochondrial DNA in the leukemic cells. We also showed that alovudine increased the monocytic differentiation of AML cells. Genetic knockdown and other chemical inhibitors of polymerase γ also promoted AML differentiation, but the effects on AML differentiation were independent of reductions in oxidative phosphorylation or respiratory chain proteins. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism by which mitochondria regulate AML fate and differentiation independent of oxidative phosphorylation. Moreover, we highlight polymerase γ inhibitors, such as alovudine, as novel therapeutic agents for AML."

Despite their crucial role in promoting virulence, relatively few T3SEs have well-characterized enzymatic activities or host targets. This is in part due to functional redundancy within pathogen T3SE repertoires as well as the promiscuity of individual T3SEs that can have multiple host targets. To overcome these challenges, we generated and characterized a collection of yeast strains stably expressing 75 T3SE constructs from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae This collection is devised to facilitate heterologous genetic screens in yeast, a non-host organism, to identify T3SEs that target conserved eukaryotic processes. Among 75 T3SEs tested, we identified 16 that inhibited yeast growth on rich media and eight that inhibited growth on stress-inducing media. We utilized Pathogenic Genetic Array (PGA) screens to identify potential host targets of P. syringae T3SEs. We focused on the acetyltransferase, HopZ1a, which interacts with plant tubulin and alters microtubule networks. To uncover putative HopZ1a host targets, we identified yeast genes with genetic interaction profiles most similar (i.e., congruent) to the PGA profile of HopZ1a and performed a functional enrichment analysis of these HopZ1a-congruent genes. We compared the congruence analyses above to previously described HopZ physical interaction datasets and identified kinesins as potential HopZ1a targets. Finally, we demonstrated that HopZ1a can target kinesins by acetylating the plant kinesins HINKEL and MKRP1, illustrating the utility of our T3SE-expressing yeast library to characterize T3SE functions.",Suppression of Hepatic CYP3A4 Expression and Activity by 3-Methylcholanthrene in Humanized PXR-CAR-CYP3A4/3A7 Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573465,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 03 28,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are environmental pollutants that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, thereby triggering a range of biologic responses, exemplified by the induction of CYP1A1 PAHs can also regulate the expression of members of the CYP3A subfamily, with reports of mainly suppressive effects on mouse hepatic Cyp3a11 expression, but paradoxically both inductive and suppressive effects on human hepatic CYP3A4 expression. Understanding the regulation of CYP3A4 expression by PAHs is important because of the widespread exposure of humans to these chemicals and the central role of the CYP3A4 enzyme in the metabolism of clinically important drugs and endogenous substances. The present study used 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) as a model PAH to characterize the in vivo regulation of CYP3A4 expression and activity in humanized pregnane X receptor-constitutive androstane receptor-CYP3A4/3A7 mice. Adult mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection with MC (80 mg/kg), or corn oil vehicle, and euthanized 24 or 72 hours later. As a positive control response, pronounced induction of hepatic Cyp1a1 by MC was confirmed at both time points in males and females at the mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels. Basal hepatic CYP3A4 expression and activity were significantly higher in female versus male mice. MC treatment suppressed hepatic CYP3A4 in female mice at 72 hours postdosing at the mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels. A similar response was observed in male mice, although the suppression of CYP3A4 protein levels did not achieve statistical significance.

The structure of the desired complex was characterized by UV-Vis. spectroscopy, FT-IR, EDX, MS, SEM, TG/DTA and CHN-analysis. The octahedral-structure of the desired Cu(II) complex was proven via XRD single-crystal diffraction and its molecular interactions were computed by Hirschfeld surface analysis. Alcohol (as solvent) and short ultrasonic vibration dose period played a critical role in sonochemistry synthesis of octahedral neutral trans-CuBr2(N ∩ N)2 complex instead of trigonal bi-pyramidal monocation [CuBr(N ∩ N)2]Br one. Due to the Jahn-Teller effect, the complex exhibited a trans bonds elongation along Br-Cu-Br axis originating a distorted-octahedral Cu(II), as revealed by the XRD measurements (Br-Cu = 3.04 Å). Therefore, the Solvatochromic behavior of the complex was successfully performed since the trans di-bromide ions are loosely coordinated to Cu(II) center, the change in complex solutions colors by using different solvents which can be detected even by naked-eye supported atypical Jahn-Teller elongation effect formation.

Propagation and repeated reflection of ultrasound within cleaning baths build standing-wave-like acoustic fields; when an ultrasound intensity gradient appears in the acoustic fields, it can in principle induce steady streaming flow. When the ultrasound intensity is sufficiently large, cavitation occurs and oscillating cavitation bubbles are either trapped in the acoustic fields or advected in the flow. These phenomena are believed to produce mechanical action to remove contaminant particles attached at material surfaces. Recent studies suggest that the mechanical action of cavitation bubbles is the dominant factor of particle removal in ultrasonic cleaning, but the bubble collapse resulting from high-intensity ultrasound may be violent enough to give rise to surface erosion. In this paper, we aim to carefully examine the role of cavitation bubbles from ultrasonic cleaning tests with varying dissolved gas concentration in water. In our cleaning tests using 28-kHz ultrasound, oxygen-supersaturated water is produced by oxygen-microbubble aeration and used as a cleaning solution, and glass slides spin-coated with silica particles of micron/submicron sizes are used to define cleaning efficiency. High-speed camera recordings and Particle Image Velocimetry analysis with a pressure oscillation amplitude of 1.4 atm at the pressure antinode show that the population of cavitation bubbles increases and streaming flow inside the bath is promoted, as the dissolved oxygen supersaturation increases. The particle removal is found to be achieved mainly by the action of cavitation bubbles, but there exists optimal gas supersaturation to maximize the removal efficiency. Our finding suggests that low-intensity ultrasound irradiation under the optimal gas supersaturation in cleaning solutions allows for having mild bubble dynamics without violent collapse and thus cleaning surfaces without cavitation erosion. Finally, observations of individual bubble dynamics and the resulting particle removal are reported to further support the role of cavitation bubbles as cleaning agents.",Experimental and numerical investigation of cavitation-induced erosion in thermal sprayed single splats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573433,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,2019 04 29,"Hydraulic components are coated by thermal spraying to protect them against cavitation erosion.

The velocity and temperature of particles upon impact were measured and the samples were subsequently exposed to cavitation erosion tests.

Although the results suggested that high stress levels resulted from cavitation loading, it was clear that weak adhesion interfaces played a crucial role in the accelerated cavitation-induced degradation.",Influence of humeral abduction angle on axial rotation and contact area at the glenohumeral joint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573432,Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,2019 03 29,"Although the elevation angle of the arm affects the range of rotation, it has not been evaluated up to the maximal abduction angle.

Thus, PD has become an important contributor to the neurological disease burden. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, and alarmingly, approximately 5.25 million Nigerians are above 65 years and are therefore at risk for developing PD. We carried out a critical review of published literature on PD in Nigeria to summarize the findings and to evaluate gaps in knowledge. Seven electronic databases were searched for studies published in English before 18th July 2018. Search terms were [""Parkinson's disease"" OR ""Parkinson disease"" OR ""parkinsonian disorders"" OR ""Parkinsonism""] AND ""Nigeria"". A total of 44 articles (including eight reviews) published since 1969 were identified and reviewed. Amongst the original research articles, most (23) were on PD symptoms or prevalence. There were only two studies on genetics and two on environmental factors. The estimated crude prevalence of PD in Nigeria was lower (10-249/100 000) compared to studies published in Europe (65.6-12 500/100 000). Our findings suggest that PD is under-diagnosed in Nigeria. Possible environmental risk factors identified include blacksmithing and well-water contaminated with trace metals. Given the rising numbers of the ageing population in Nigeria, more studies to evaluate the prevalence and causes of PD in this country are urgently needed. To this end, more funding, resources and a workforce of well-trained neurologists and scientists are essential to manage the impending health burden of PD and related disorders in this country.","Carriers of both GBA and LRRK2 mutations, compared to carriers of either, in Parkinson's disease: Risk estimates and genotype-phenotype correlations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573413,Parkinsonism & related disorders,2018 12 21,The clinical characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with both the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation and a GBA variant (LRRK2-GBA-PD) have not yet been determined.,SYNE1-ataxia: Novel genotypic and phenotypic findings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573412,Parkinsonism & related disorders,2018 12 21,"SYNE1 encodes nesprin-1, a scaffold protein which is involved in the binding between cytoskeleton, nuclear envelope and other subcellular compartments.

Clinical,2019 05 28,"Children born very preterm (VPT; <32 weeks gestational age [GA]) are at greater risk for a range of cognitive deficits that typically manifest at school age. Here we examine the hypothesis that these children have altered myelin maturational that can be detected by myelin sensitive MRI measures prior to school age. We included 33 four-year old children born VPT (mean GA; 28.7 weeks) and 23 four-year old full term (FT) children and completed magnetization transfer (MT), T1-weighted (T1-w) and T2-weighted (T1-w) magnetic resonance imaging as well as developmental assessments. Both MT ratio (MTR) and T1-w/T2-w ratio images were calculated, and group differences were probed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) in white matter, and region of interest (ROI) analysis in white, subcortical gray and cortical gray matter. The relations between MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio, as well as with developmental assessments, were investigated in all three brain divisions. In children born VPT, TBSS and ROI analysis revealed that both MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio were significantly reduced in white matter compared to children born FT. ROI analysis showed reductions in T1-w/T2-w ratio in VPT children compared to FT children in the thalamus, putamen and amygdala, as well as in the occipital and temporal lobes. Across the VPT and FT children, T1-w/T2-w ratio and MTR were highly correlated across white, subcortical gray and cortical gray matter. Both measures correlated positively with developmental assessments in individual white matter tracts and cortical and subcortical ROIs, suggesting that higher MTR and T1-w/T2-w ratio is related to better cognitive performance. Together these findings are consistent with delayed myelination in VPT born children.",Changes in default mode network connectivity in different glucose metabolism status and diabetes duration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573410,NeuroImage.

The neural and psychological mechanisms mediating this relationship remain unclear. In parallel, alterations in corticostriatal connectivity and abnormalities in the processing of salience, are seen in psychotic disorders. Aberrant functioning of these mechanisms secondary to chronic stress exposure, could help explain how common environmental exposures are associated with a diverse range of symptoms. In the current study, we recruited two groups of adults, one with a high degree of exposure to chronic psychosocial stressors (the exposed group, n = 20), and one with minimal exposure (the unexposed group, n = 22). All participants underwent a resting state MRI scan, completed the Aberrant Salience Inventory, and performed a behavioural task - the Salience Attribution Test (SAT). The exposed group showed reduced explicit adaptive salience scores (cohen's d = 0.69, p = 0.03) and increased aberrant salience inventory scores (d = 0.65, p = 0.04). The exposed group also showed increased corticostriatal connectivity between the ventral striatum and brain regions previously implicated in salience processing. Corticostriatal connectivity in these regions negatively correlated with SAT explicit adaptive salience (r = -0.48, p = 0.001), and positively correlated with aberrant salience inventory scores (r = 0.42, p = 0.006). Furthermore, in a mediation analysis there was tentative evidence that differences in striato-cortical connectivity mediated the group differences in salience scores.","Specificity of resting-state heart rate variability in psychosis: A comparison with clinical high risk, anxiety, and healthy controls.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573408,Schizophrenia research,2019 05 18,"Maladaptability, particularly of autonomic activity, is described as a central component of vulnerability-stress-models for the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms. Investigating heart rate variability (HRV) as an index of autonomic adaptability is thus likely to improve our understanding of psychosis. In clinically vulnerable groups for psychosis, it is unclear whether maladaptability is already evident. Moreover, to investigate specificity, direct comparisons to other mental disorders are required. In the present study, we analyzed 3 min of resting-state heart rate, HRV, and negative affect in 130 participants; consisting of participants with psychotic disorders (PSY; n = 44), clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR; n = 22), anxiety disorders (anxiety controls, AC; n = 29) and healthy controls (HC; n = 35). ANCOVAs controlling for age revealed significant group differences for both investigated vagal HRV parameters, which were reduced in PSY compared to HC. The high-frequency domain HRV in PSY was also lower than in CHR and - in a non-significant trend - than in AC. Also, ANOVAs for heart rate and negative affect revealed significant increases in PSY compared to HC. Exploratory analyses of medication effects showed moderate dosage associations with heart rate and high-frequency HRV. Thus, in the present study, the activity of the autonomic nervous system was altered in psychosis but not in an at-risk group. A potential specificity of the effect can be speculated in contrast to anxiety disorders. Future studies should investigate the predictive value of HRV for increased stress-sensitivity or transition to clinical symptoms as well as the implications for daily threat perception and symptom maintenance.",Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in schizophrenia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573407,Schizophrenia research,2019 05 18,"The immune system appears to be dysregulated in schizophrenia (SZ).

We used Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) to evaluate their dimensional structure in two large, independent samples (n = 6265 and n = 1000). We then used Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to compare the fit of the theoretical dimensions with the EGA dimensions. For the MSS, EGA identified four dimensions: positive schizotypy, two dimensions of negative schizotypy (affective and social anhedonia), and disorganized schizotypy. For the MSS-B, EGA identified three dimensions, which corresponded to the theorized positive, negative, and disorganized dimensions. Based on the MSS's EGA dimensions, we also estimated a four-factor model for the MSS-B. The CFA comparison found that the four-factor model fit significantly better than the theoretical three-factor model for both the MSS and MSS-B, providing support for the theoretical model and offering a more nuanced interpretation of the negative schizotypy factor. In addition, EGA also revealed that the positive and negative schizotypy dimensions of the MSS and MSS-B might be mediated by the disorganized dimension. Our findings offer new implications for future research on the MSS and MSS-B dimensions that may provide differential associations with interview and questionnaire measures."

However, in the first 24 h the growth in the glucose culture was greater than in the xylose culture. Based on these results, glucose was used for cell growth (at the initial stage) and xylose was used for polymer production (at the feeding stage). As expected, in the glucose/xylose switching fermentation method, polymer production was significantly enhanced, eventually reaching 26.7 g/L. The enhanced polymer production obtained by using xylose was presumably due to overflow metabolism. In fact, during xylose feeding, acetic acid excretion was greater than that in case of the glucose grown culture, suggesting the channeling of the metabolic flux from acetyl-CoA towards polymer production over into the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the xylose-fed cultures. Therefore, this sequential glucose/xylose feed strategy is potentially useful for production of acetyl-CoA derived compounds in E. coli.","In vitro and in vivo inhibition of Hass avocado polyphenol oxidase enzymatic browning by paeonol, β-cyclodextrin, and paeonol:β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573385,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019 05 21,"Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was extracted from Hass avocados and its physicochemical properties were analyzed. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were pH 7.5 and 20°C. This PPO showed a high thermal stability, since 26% of the initial activity was retained by the enzyme after heating at 60°C for 40 min. Inhibition studies were performed using different chemical reagents, and the order in the inhibition efficiency was paeonol > 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde > β-cyclodextrin (β-CD). The first two inhibitors presented a non-competitive mechanism while the inhibition by β-CD results from a mixed type mechanism. Since the aqueous solubility of paeonol (a natural compound) is very low, the inclusion complex between this drug and β-CD was obtained in solution and solid state. The stoichiometry of the paeonol:β-CD complex was 1:1 and its ΔG° of formation was -26 kJ/mol. The complexation of paeonol by β-CD not only enhances the aqueous solubility and thermal stability of the drug, but also improves the in vitro inhibition efficiency against PPO. Colorimetric analysis on avocados pulp (in vivo) showed that the inclusion complex does not increase the inhibitory effect of paeonol, remaining practically unchanged. However, the formulation of paeonol:β-CD inclusion complex allows employing this compound as PPO inhibitor in aqueous solutions.",Production of highly thermo-tolerant laccase from novel thermophilic bacterium Bacillus sp. PC-3 and its application in functionalization of chitosan film.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573384,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019 05 21,"In this study, a novel thermophilic bacterial strain was isolated from Tattapani hot spring located in the Chhattisgarh state of India. The laccase was produced via submerged fermentation and purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography up to 13.7 fold. The 16S rRNA gene sequence and biochemical analysis revealed that the bacterial isolate is Bacillus sp. strain PC-3. The activity of extracellular crude laccase was determined to be 11.2 U/mL using 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) as a substrate. The SDS-PAGE revealed that the enzyme consists of single subunit with molecular size of 36 kDa. The laccase exhibited the maximum enzyme activity at temperature of 60°C and pH 7. Moreover, the laccase retained 99.1% of its original activity for 180 min and exhibited half-life of 3.75 h at 60°C. Similarly, the laccase retained 95% activity at pH 7 for 240 min and displayed significant activity at wider pH range. In addition, the laccase was used for functionalization of chitosan film and characterized for antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, the functionalized chitosan film showed the improved antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.","Epidemiology of Lyme disease among US Veterans in Long Island, New York.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573383,Ticks and tick-borne diseases,2019 04 04,"In North America, Lyme disease (LD) is caused predominantly by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferisensu stricto, and is transmitted by blacklegged ticks. Long Island, New York, is highly endemic for the disease. The C6 peptide (C6P) is currently used as a screening test for LD in our institution. Our objective was to examine how screening with C6P concorded with diagnosis of LD at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Northport, Long Island. A retrospective chart-review of 2558 C6P tests was performed during the period of 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2016. Patients were categorized by Lyme Disease (LD) or no LD groups. LD group was defined as having an erythema migrans (EM) rash, or ≥ 2 IgM bands or ≥ 5 IgG bands on immunoblot. Out of the 409 patients with positive or equivocal C6P, 181 patients with LD were based on presence of EM, or Western blot IgM and IgG test results; 228 did not have LD. The positive predictive value of C6P was 44.5%. EM was the most common presentation. In the LD group, history of tick bite (P: 0.0001), headache (P: 0.0036), joint swelling (P: 0.0086) and myalgias (P: 0.0005) were more likely to be present. Zip code mapping of our cases mirrored those previously reported in the Suffolk County Department of Health. In our review we encountered a significant number of false positive C6 assays. False positive C6P tests were ordered by primary care physicians (PCP) (37%) followed by neurologists (33%). A history of tick exposure and clinical findings of early Lyme disease such as headaches or joint aches were more likely to denote a true positive C6 peptide test. Rigorous education of physicians about Lyme disease and pitfalls of our available diagnostic tests are needed for their proper utilization.",Gut mucosal-associated microbiota better discloses inflammatory bowel disease differential patterns than faecal microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573380,Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver,2019 05 21,Growing evidence supports the potential role of intestinal microbiota in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) even if the literature does not reveal uniform alterations.

Some of these techniques are microarrays and next-generation sequencing that provide genome level insight of living cells. As a result, the size of most of the biological databases, such as NCBI-GEO, NCBI-SRA, etc., is growing exponentially. These biological data are analyzed using various computational techniques for knowledge discovery - which is also one of the objectives of bioinformatics research. Gene regulatory network (GRN) is a gene-gene interaction network which plays a pivotal role in understanding gene regulation processes and disease mechanism at the molecular level. From last couple of decades, researchers are interested in developing computational algorithms for GRN inference (GRNI) from high-throughput experimental data. Several computational approaches have been proposed for inferring GRN from gene expression data including statistical techniques (correlation coefficient), information theory (mutual information), regression-based approaches, probabilistic approaches (Bayesian networks, naïve byes), artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic, along with its hybridization with other intelligent approaches, is a well-studied technique in GRNI due to its several advantages. In this paper, we present a consolidated review on fuzzy logic and its hybrid approaches developed during last two decades for GRNI."

Recent studies suggest that m6A has a regulatory role in mRNA degradation and translation initiation or efficiency, involving in cell fate determination in yeast, plants, and stem cells of mammalian. Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) regulates gene expression through post-transcriptional fashion, which heavily relies on mRNA cis-motifs. However, internal mRNA modification in T. brucei has not been reported yet. Here we found m6A modification is abundant in T. brucei and presented a transcriptome wide methylome of m6A in both life stages of T. brucei. We identified 355 and 95 peaks in procyclic form and blood stream form trypanosomes respectively. A consensus motif of CAU was shared in both life stages of T. brucei. mRNA abundance of m6A-containing genes is higher in procyclic form and tend to be down-regulated in bloodstream form trypanosomes. Furthermore, m6A-containing transcripts harbor relative longer half-lives, and are enriched in pathways of cell morphology and movement in procyclic form trypanosomes. By m6A-containing RNA pulldown in both life stages, we identified TRRM2 as a potential m6A reader in T. brucei. Uncovering the m6A methylome and its binding proteins may provide a new post-transcriptional regulatory pathway in T. brucei.","CFTR activation suppresses glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573361,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 02,"The aim of this study was to investigate the function of Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in human glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Data dining results of the Human Protein Atlas showed that low CFTR expression was associated with poor prognosis for GBM patients. We found that CFTR protein expression was lower in U87 and U251 GBM cells than that in normal humane astrocyte cells. CFTR activation significantly reduced GBM cell proliferation. In addition, CFTR activation significantly abrogated migration and invasion of GBM cells. Besides, CFTR activator Forskolin treatment markedly reduced MMP-2 protein expression. These effects of CFTR activation were significantly inhibited by CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 pretreatment. Our findings suggested that JAK2/STAT3 signaling was involved in the anti-glioblastoma effects of CFTR activation. Moreover, CFTR overexpression in combination with Forskolin induced a synergistic anti-proliferative response in U87 cells. Overall, our findings demonstrated that CFTR activation suppressed GBM cell proliferation, migration and invasion likely through the inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling.",Long non-coding RNA FENDRR inhibits proliferation and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma by down-regulating glypican-3 expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573358,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 01 04,"Long non-coding RNA FENDRR is implicated in progression of several cancers, but its exact role and mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression and biological roles of FENDRR in HCC tissues and cell lines. We found that the expression levels of FENDRR were significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and cells. FENDRR overexpression could inhibit the growth of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, up-regulation of FENDRR suppressed the migration and invasion of HCC cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that FENDRR interacted directly with Glypican-3 (GPC3) promoter and methylated GPC3 promoter, which led to down-regulation of GPC3 expression. Ectopic expression of GPC3 ablated the inhibitory effects of FENDRR on HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Taken together, we provided the first evidence for the inhibitory activity of FENDRR in HCC, which is causally linked to targeting GPC3 at the epigenetic level. Restoration of FENDRR may be a potential approach to prevent HCC progression and metastasis.",Barriers and enablers to adolescent self-consent for vaccination: A mixed-methods evidence synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573357,Vaccine,2019 04 21,"The recent global expansion of routine adolescent vaccination programmes has the potential to protect young people against infectious diseases and improve their health.

A group of male participants receiving IBSM was compared to a group receiving Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) training and a waiting-list control group. All groups underwent the TSST-G following a 6-week training/waiting period. Both the IBSM and PMR group reported lower subjective stress levels than the control group. However, the IBSM group exhibited the lowest free salivary cortisol responses to the TSST-G, with significantly lower levels than the PMR group. The waiting-list control group exhibited an intermediate cortisol response. These preliminary results suggest that a 6-week internet-based stress management program is effective in reducing the subjective stress levels, and might be associated with an attenuated salivary cortisol response to an acute stressor."

Therefore, we carried out a study to determine the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus after intramuscular (IM) injection and to determine the optimal IM dosing regimens in primate models. Six male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were used in the study. Doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 5 mg were administered via IM injection and oral administration, respectively, once to determine single-dose pharmacokinetics and once daily for 5 days to determine multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. According to pharmacokinetic model estimates, the inter- and intra-individual variabilities in bioavailability following IM injection were remarkably reduced compared with those following oral administration. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that Cpeak, Ctrough and AUC would also have less variability following IM injection compared with oral administration. In this study, we found that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of tacrolimus were more constant following IM injection compared with oral administration. These results suggest that IM injection can be an alternative route of administration fin non-human primate model studies."

A,2019 02 15,"This study presents the development and validation of a method for the multi-class multi-residue analysis of pesticide residues in edible oils using liquid-liquid extraction followed by EMR-Lipid (enhanced matrix removal - lipid) cartridge cleanup, and then analyzed by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS). The method was optimized for analyte recovery, matrix removal, and water removal during the sample extraction, sample cleanup and sample drying steps. The extraction efficiency of lipophilic pesticides (i.e. organochlorine) from the hydrophobic oil matrix was improved using a two-step liquid-liquid extraction with a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetonitrile. EMR-Lipid cartridges provided efficient and selective cleanup of the tested oil matrices. The developed method was verified by analyzing four edible oil matrices: olive oil, corn oil, soybean oil and canola oil. The results demonstrated that the method effectively removes unwanted matrix co-extractives better than conventional PSA/C18 dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) cleanup, while still delivering acceptable recovery results (recoveries of 60-120%) for the majority of pesticides tested.

These approaches improved resolution in QTL position and assisted in determining functional causative variations in genes. Examples of QTLs/genes associated with agronomic traits in crops and identified using different strategies based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/whole-genome resequencing (WGR) or RNA-seq are presented and discussed in this review.

These include the rapid recognition of reversible causes, the accurate identification of patients who will progress to severe stages of AKI, and the subsequent management of complications resulting from severe renal dysfunction. Unfortunately, the inherent limitations of physical examination and laboratory parameter results are often responsible for suboptimal clinical management. In this review article, the authors explore how point-of-care ultrasound, including renal and extrarenal ultrasound, can be used to complement all aspects of the care of cardiac surgery patients with AKI, from the initial approach of early AKI to fluid balance management during renal replacement therapy.

We address this problem by presenting a system that can automatically estimate the fetal head circumference (HC) from data obtained with use of the obstetric sweep protocol (OSP). The OSP consists of multiple pre-defined sweeps with the ultrasound transducer over the abdomen of the pregnant woman. The OSP can be taught within a day to any health care worker without prior knowledge of ultrasound. An experienced sonographer acquired both the standard plane-to obtain the reference HC-and the OSP from 183 pregnant women in St. Luke's Hospital, Wolisso, Ethiopia. The OSP data, which will most likely not contain the standard plane, was used to automatically estimate HC using two fully convolutional neural networks. First, a VGG-Net-inspired network was trained to automatically detect the frames that contained the fetal head. Second, a U-net-inspired network was trained to automatically measure the HC for all frames in which the first network detected a fetal head. The HC was estimated from these frame measurements, and the curve of Hadlock was used to determine gestational age (GA). The results indicated that most automatically estimated GAs fell within the P2.5-P97.5 interval of the Hadlock curve compared with the GAs obtained from the reference HC, so it is possible to automatically estimate GA from OSP data. Our method therefore has potential application for providing maternal care in resource-constrained countries.",Meta-analysis of the Correlation Between Schizophrenia and Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573304,Clinical breast cancer,2019 01 29,To determine the correlation between schizophrenia and breast cancer (BC).,Postural control in healthy young adults using a double seesaw device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573303,Journal of biomechanics,2019 05 02,"Postural control on single and double seesaws was investigated in young healthy adults required to stand as still as possible on two side-by-side seesaws favoring pitch motion and lying on two separate force platforms. The device offers the possibility to get associated or dissociated seesaws and, if dissociated, to induce asymmetric patterns for the centers-of-pressure (CP) under both left and right feet by using different radii for the two seesaws. Substituting a parallelepiped volume to one seesaw offering a firm contact to one foot is also possible. The results indicated that dissociating the two seesaws led to increased resultant CP (CPRes) and vertically projected center-of-gravity movements (CGv) only along the mediolateral axis, whereas a slight decreasing tendency characterized these movements along the antero-posterior axis. When standing on two independent seesaws with different radii, significantly larger CP displacements were seen along the antero-posterior axis under the foot lying on the more stable support, i.e., the seesaw with the longer radius or the parallelepiped volume. In these two asymmetrical conditions, the CPRes output results from a compensatory mechanism, i.e. larger movements under one foot to compensate for the decreased movements occurring under the opposite foot. This postural control strategy is aimed at allowing sufficient CPRes displacements in order to appropriately secure balance. Because of the complex sensorimotor coordination induced, involving differentially in certain cases both legs, the double seesaw device can be viewed as a possible tool for challenging postural control by inducing asymmetrical patterns between left and right feet CP movements."

A review of the evidence base on MRTA in prostate cancer will enable discussion of the utility of this field while also indicating recommendations to future research. Radiomic textural analysis allows the assessment of spatial inter-relationships between pixels within an image by use of mathematical methods. First-order textural analysis is better understood and may have more clinical validity than higher-order textural features. Textural features extracted from apparent diffusion coefficient maps have shown the most potential for clinical utility in MRTA of prostate cancers. Future studies should aim to integrate machine learning techniques to better represent the role of MRTA in prostate cancer clinical practice. Nomenclature should be used to reduce misidentification between first-order and second-order energy and entropy. Automated methods of segmentation should be encouraged in order to reduce problems associated with inclusion of normal tissue within regions of interest.

Engineering hydrogels have rarely possessed both high stiffness and toughness, because compliant hydrogels usually become brittle when excess crosslinker is added to make the gel stiff. Furthermore, conventional hydrogels usually swell under physiological conditions, weakening their mechanical properties. Here, we designed a non-swellable hydrogel with high stiffness and toughness by interpenetrating covalently and ionically crosslinked networks. The stiffness is enhanced by utilizing ionic crosslinking sites fully, and the toughness is enhanced by adopting synergistic effects between energy-dissipation by ionic networks and crack-bridging by covalent networks.

Compared to Cu2O spheres, electrochemical results reveal that the Cu2O@Cu1.8S material exhibits a much higher catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation due to synergistic effect between Cu2O and Cu1.8S. The as-prepared Cu2O@Cu1.8S produces a high sensitivity, a fast sensing response, a wide linear range in concentrations of 1-1000 μM, and an excellent selectivity, thus prove to be a promising catalyst for enzyme free glucose detection.",Polyelectrolyte-coated ultra-small nanoparticles with Tb(III)-centered luminescence as cell labels with unusual charge effect on their cell internalization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573238,"Materials science & engineering.

The flow cytometry data revealed the enhanced cellular uptake of negatively charged nanoparticles coated by the polystyrenesulfonate (PSS)-monolayer versus the positively charged nanoparticles. The latter are obtained by layer-by-layer deposition of polyethyleneimine (PEI) onto PSS-coated ones. Confocal and TEM images of Hep-2 cells exposed by the colloids confirm favorable cell internalization of the PSS- compared to PEI-PSS-coated colloids illustrating unusual charge-effect. Dynamic light scattering data indicate significant effect of the biological background exemplified by serum bovine albumin and phosphatidylcholine-based bilayers on the exterior charge and aggregation behavior of the colloids. The obtained results reveal the PSS-coated nanoparticles based on water insoluble Tb(III) complex as promising cell labels.,A biocompatible thermoset polymer binder for Direct Ink Writing of porous titanium scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573237,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 20,"There is increasing demand for synthetic bone scaffolds for bone tissue engineering as they can counter issues such as potential harvesting morbidity and restrictions in donor sites which hamper autologous bone grafts and address the potential for disease transmission in the case of allografts. Due to their excellent biocompatibility, titanium scaffolds have great potential as bone graft substitutes as they mimic the structure and properties of human cancellous bone. Here we report on a new thermoset bio-polymer which can act as a binder for Direct Ink Writing (DIW) of titanium artificial bone scaffolds. We demonstrate the use of the binder to manufacture porous titanium scaffolds with evenly distributed and highly interconnected porosity ideal for orthopaedic applications. Due to their porous structure, the scaffolds exhibit an effective Young's modulus similar to human cortical bone, alleviating undesirable stress-shielding effects, and possess superior strength. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds was investigated in vitro by cell viability and proliferation assays using human bone-marrow-derived Mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The hMSCs displayed well-spread morphologies, well-organized F-actin and large vinculin complexes confirming their excellent biocompatibility. The vinculin regions had significantly larger Focal Adhesion (FA) area and equivalent FA numbers compared to that of tissue culture plate controls, showing that the scaffolds support cell viability and promote attachment. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the excellent potential of the thermoset bio-polymer as a Direct Ink Writing ready binder for manufacture of porous titanium scaffolds for hard tissue engineering.",Voltammetric glucose biosensor based on glucose oxidase encapsulation in a chitosan-kappa-carrageenan polyelectrolyte complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573236,"Materials science & engineering.

A conductometric monitoring of this is performed. Spectroscopic and morphological characterization of the PEC film encapsulating GOx is carried out. Compared to biosensors based on a chitosan film, a more sensitive voltammetric detection of glucose is obtained. Using square wave voltammetry (SWV), the CHIT/CAR PEC based biosensor exhibits a wide linearity range from 5 μM to 7 mM glucose with a detection limit of 5 μM. Excellent selectivity against ascorbic acid, uric acid and urea is observed and the applicability of the biosensor for glucose detection in spiked saliva samples was demonstrated.",Reaction parameters of in situ silver chloride precipitation on cellulose fibres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573234,"Materials science & engineering.

The studied reaction parameters were as follows: time, temperature, and reactants´ concentration. AgCl was bound on the cellulose via two-step process. Firstly, the silver ions (Ag+) were attracted to cellulose in the solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3). Secondly, Ag+ were precipitated directly on the cellulose by immersing the samples into the solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). The prepared samples were examined on the amount of bound and released Ag, and the release was studied both in water and in simulated body fluids. The reaction parameters significantly affected the amount of bound and released Ag, the difference of released Ag was as high as 75%. The key parameter in the process was reactants´ concentration.

The functional membrane surfaces with any polymer chains of hydrophilic, ionic polymer, and polysaccharide segments, for example, the copolymers of N-vinyl pyrrolidone, sodium p-styrenesulfonate hydrate, and glucose allyl amide, are easily designed and fabricated; and the thickness of polymer brushes are efficiently controlled by polymerization conditions like monomer concentration and initiator amount. As a key bio-plastic, the modified polyethersulfone membrane shows suppressed platelet adhesion, significant decreases in thrombin-antithrombin generation, and the complement activations on C3a and C5a levels compared with pristine polyethersulfone membrane; while the platelet activation (PF4) decreased. Due to the similar groups as heparin-like structure, the modified membrane effectively prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time. The water contact angle of the modified membrane decreases from 89.2 to 22.3°, and the cytocompatibility of the modified membranes largely enhanced. It could be concluded that the new approach could be widely used for polymer membrane modification, and the mimic heparin-like surface seems to be a promising structure to improve the biocompatibility for blood purification application.",Bioactivity of micropatterned TiO2 nanotubes fabricated by micro-milling and anodic oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573232,"Materials science & engineering.

In this study, an ordered structure of micropatterned TiO2 nanotubes was produced on titanium surface by the combined use of micro-milling and anodic oxidation. The surface properties of different modified titanium samples were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, laser scanning microscope, X-ray diffraction, and contact angle goniometer. The corrosion resistance of different samples was evaluated by an electrochemical workstation. A series of cell experiments were performed to evaluate the responses of osteoblasts to the modified titanium substrates. The results indicated that the surface roughness and hydrophilicity of micro/nanostructured titanium remarkably increased compared to the polished titanium. In addition, the corrosion resistance of micro/nanostructured titanium samples was also improved in comparison to the polished titanium samples. More importantly, the proliferation and differentiation of cells were significantly promoted on micro/nanostructure titanium substrates.

Herein, we designed a new type of composite particle, apoferritin (APO) encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX), and the surface of APO was modified with Au nanoshell. As a nanocarrier, APO can carry chemotherapy drug DOX (APODOX) and release drug under acidic and high temperature conditions to reduce side effects of anticancer drugs. After covering Au nanoshell (APODOX-Au), the photothermal effect can be produced because of the unique surface plasmon resonance properties of gold nanoshell. This nanoplatform also provides the multi-stimuli responsive drug release system, which can achieve drug release in different conditions and have great potential in biomedical applications. Our investigation has demonstrated that APODOX-Au has good stability, high dispersibility and biocompatibility in vitro. The strong near-infrared absorption and good photothermal effect make sure the quick response to environmental changes (pH, temperature) to achieve drug release.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 03 20,"In the field of modern nanomedicine, ZnO nanoparticles were considered as an emerging candidate for drug delivery because of their inherent biocompatibility and stability. However, the poor dispersibility in a physiological medium obstructed their clinic applications. In this paper, the red fluorescence ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized, using a facile chemical method of polyol in boiling trimethylene glycol (TREG) with zinc acetate. The as-synthesized ZnO nanoparticles were first time grafted with PG layer through ring-opening polymerization of glycidol (ZnO-PG). As calculated from the TGA data, the weight ratio of the grafted PG was about 68 wt%. Then, the ZnO-PG engineered to conjugate with arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptide by stepwise organic reactions. Finally, anticancer drugs Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was immobilized on ZnO-PG-RGD (approximately 21.8 ± 0.9 nm) to form ZnO-PG-RGD/DOX. The drug release percentage reaches 70.6% within 48 h under pH 5.2, which was more than 3-fold higher than that pH 7.4. The properties of ZnO nanoparticles and its derivatives were detected by power XRD, TEM, EDS, FTIR, TGA, DLS, Zeta potential and UV. The grafted PG layer not only largely enhanced the dispersibility, but also inhibited ZnO nanoparticles from the uptake by U87MG and Hela cells. In contrast, ZnO-PG-RGD was selectively taken up by U87MG, not Hela cells, demonstrating an obvious targeting property. When ZnO-PG-RGD/DOX was used, U87MG cells showed specificity damaged compared with Hela cells. Thus, functionalized ZnO nanoparticle was a promising nanomaterial in cancer theranostics."

These cancer therapy related toxicities may occur acutely during treatment resulting in reduced or missed therapy agent administration or after the completion of therapy resulting in significant chronic morbidities that significantly diminish patient quality of life. Radiation and chemotherapy induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) both in normal tissues and tumor cells. One type of ROS common to both chemotherapy and radiation therapy is the formation of superoxide (O2•-). Fortunately, due to metabolic differences between cancer and normal cell metabolism, as well as improved targeting techniques, ROS generation following radiation and chemotherapy is generally greater in cancer cells compared to normal tissues. However, the levels of ROS generated in normal tissues are capable of inducing significant toxicity. Thus, several groups are focusing on metabolism-based approaches to mitigate normal tissue effects occurring both during and following cancer therapy. This review will summarize the most current preclinical and clinical data available demonstrating the efficacy of small molecule, superoxide dismutase mimetics in minimizing radiation and chemotherapy-induced normal tissue injury, resulting in enhanced patient outcomes.",Soy Isoflavones Protect Normal Tissues While Enhancing Radiation Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573186,Seminars in radiation oncology,2019 03 04,"Soy isoflavones have demonstrated chemopreventive and anticancer properties in epidemiology and biological studies, in addition to their function as antioxidants in prevention of cardiovascular disease. We have explored the potential of soy isoflavones, as a safe biological approach, to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy for local tumor control and limit normal tissue damage in solid tumors. This review presents studies investigating the interaction between soy isoflavones and radiation in different malignancies, including prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and nonsmall cell lung cancer. Soy isoflavones were found to be potent sensitizers of cancer cells to radiation causing increased cell killing in vitro in human tumor cell lines and greater tumor inhibition in vivo in preclinical orthotopic murine tumor models. In the course of these studies, radioprotection of normal tissues and organs in the field of radiation was observed both in a clinical trial for prostate cancer and in preclinical models. The mechanisms of radiosensitization and radioprotection mediated by soy isoflavones are discussed and emphasize the role of soy isoflavones in increasing radiation effect on tumor and mitigating inflammatory responses induced by radiation in normal tissues. Soy isoflavones could be used as a safe, nontoxic complementary strategy that simultaneously increases radiation effectiveness on the malignancy while reducing damage in normal tissues in the field of radiation.",Targeting NAD+ Metabolism to Enhance Radiation Therapy Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573185,Seminars in radiation oncology,2019 05 08,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism is integrally connected with the mechanisms of action of radiation therapy and is altered in many radiation-resistant tumors.

This discovery was made difficult by the fact that the substance could be synthesized in human skin by exposure to UV light and could also be present in the diet in animal-derived (D3) and plant-derived forms (D2). Prior to 1920, the frequency of vitamin D deficiency in the general population of industrialized cities was high. The discovery of vitamin D led to the widespread fortification of foods e.g. milk and the virtual eradication of rickets in developed nations. Vitamin D3 was first chemically synthesized in the 1930s and its metabolism to the active form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its mode of action in calcium and phosphate homeostasis were elucidated in the latter half of the 20th century. Synthetic vitamin D analogs that mimic the physiological effects of vitamin D are now used therapeutically in diseases such as bone disease, chronic kidney disease and psoriasis. Thus, a wide range of disciplines played critical roles in the rich history of vitamin D and these are described in this short historical overview.",The epidemiology of rickets in the 17th-19th centuries: Some contributions from documentary sources and their value to palaeopathologists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573170,International journal of paleopathology,2019 05 29,"This article considers the nature of written sources on the epidemiology of rickets in the post-Mediaeval period, and examines the value of these sources for palaeopathologists. There is a progression from 17th-18th century sources, which generally make ex cathedra, qualitative statements on rickets frequency to, in the 19th century, semi-quantitative geographical surveys of its occurrence, through to reports of percentage prevalence in various groups. Of course, even these latter cannot be directly compared with prevalences calculated from excavated skeletal remains, but there are also considerable difficulties in comparing them with one another, and this effectively precludes synthesis to provide reliable information on geographic and temporal trends at anything more than a very broad-brush level. Their problematic nature mandates a cautious approach when using written sources to shed light on the epidemiology of rickets. For palaeopathologists, a useful way of incorporating these sources into a biocultural approach may be to use them in order to formulate hypotheses that can then be evaluated using skeletal evidence.","Rare paleopathological insights into vitamin D deficiency rickets, co-occurring illnesses, and documented cause of death in mid-19th century London, UK.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573169,International journal of paleopathology,2019 05 29,"Growing evidence suggests that vitamin D supports immune responses to infections, autoimmune conditions and cancers, although evidence from large-scale studies is limited. There is scope to better understand how vitamin D deficiency interacted with other diseases to affect health in past groups. This study investigated paleopathological evidence and documentary records of individual cause of death to examine disease co-occurrence in a group of mid-19th century child burials from London, UK. Twenty-one percent of children had vitamin D deficiency rickets (138/642) and 36 children with rickets had an identified cause of death. Cyclical episodes of metabolic and nutritional deficiencies (rickets and scurvy) had occurred during childhood. Active rickets co-occurred with respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in a small number of children, likely reflecting vitamin D's role in supporting immune function. Consideration of the stage of the vitamin D deficiency showed that the majority of children were affected by chronic disease loads indicative of multiple episodes of illness. Reconstructions of the wider health consequences of vitamin D deficiency in past groups are dependent on recognising whether the deficiency was active or healed. The variability of diseases identified illustrates the high disease burden that affected children in this socially disadvantaged group.",Gender-related vitamin D deficiency in a Dutch 19th century farming community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573168,International journal of paleopathology,2019 05 29,"The most common cause of vitamin D deficiency is inadequate dermal exposure to sunlight. Residual rickets is nonadult vitamin D deficiency still evident in an adult individual, whereas osteomalacia occurs in adulthood. Previous research on the Beemster population, a 19th century rural community in the Netherlands, identified rickets in 30.4% of the nonadults between the ages of two and four years (n=7/23). Because the sex of these nonadults was not known it was not possible to determine if there were differences between boys and girls. To overcome this gap in our knowledge, the aim of this paper is to determine if there are gender related differences in vitamin D deficiency in the Beemster skeletal collection, based on adults with residual rickets and osteomalacia. Out of 200 adults (100 females; 100 males) no cases of osteomalacia were detected. However, there were 29 cases of residual rickets (14.5%), with 21 of those cases in females (21.0%; 21/100). A complex interplay of multiple factors is proposed to have affected vitamin D levels in nonadults, including sociocultural variables such as gender-based labour norms. This research highlights the importance of continuing to explore gender-based health differences in past populations.","Osteological evidence for juvenile vitamin D deficiency in a 19th century suburban population from Surrey, England.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573167,International journal of paleopathology,2019 05 29,"Vitamin D deficiency rickets was considered endemic in the industrialized cities of 19th century England, but was rarely reported in more rural and suburban areas. The commercial excavation of St. John's Church, Redhill, Surrey, UK provided an opportunity to examine to what extent suburban children were affected by rickets and the factors responsible for its development. Seventy-nine non-adults (0-17 years) from St. John's Church were subjected to macroscopic and radiographic analysis to identify skeletal manifestations of vitamin D deficiency. Rachitic lesions were identified in 14/79 individuals (17.7%) aged from six months to six years. Active cases occurred from six months to two years of age with healed cases observed from three to six years. One seven month old infant also displayed healed lesions. The age-specific pattern of active and healed rickets suggests the population was vulnerable to the seasonal restriction of sunlight hours, with the considerably low vitamin D content of the infant diet unable to provide sufficient amounts to maintain metabolic functions. This research demonstrates that rickets was not simply a disease of industrialization but that a variety of factors contributed to its development in groups previously considered to be low risk.",Vitamin D's role in health and disease: How does the present inform our understanding of the past?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573166,International journal of paleopathology,2019 05 29,"While the role of vitamin D in supporting bone homeostasis during growth and maintenance is well substantiated, emerging evidence from ecological and observational studies suggests that a deficiency of vitamin D is associated with some cancers, immune disorders, cardiovascular disease, abnormal glucose metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. Biological plausibility for extraskeletal functions originated with the discovery of the vitamin D receptor in many body tissues and knowledge that the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) to its active metabolite 1,25(OH)2D occurs in many cell types in addition to the kidney. The association of vitamin D status in humans as an etiological factor in developmental programming of bone, in some chronic diseases, and in all-cause mortality, in addition to skeletal morbidity, is supported by some but not all observational studies and randomized controlled trials. These clinical observations have implications for paleopathology, both in terms of specific comorbidities and the potential role of vitamin D in individuals who display no evidence for skeletal disease. This paper outlines recent clinical research on vitamin D metabolism and its novel biological roles, and explores the possible relevance to paleopathological research designs, theoretical models, and interpretations of disease experience.",Analysis of patterning in the occurrence of skeletal lesions used as indicators of vitamin D deficiency in subadult and adult skeletal remains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573165,International journal of paleopathology,2019 05 29,"Paleopathological investigations of conditions linked to vitamin D deficiency have increased in the last twenty years, and a suite of skeletal lesions has been established to aid in the diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency disease in subadults and adults. This paper analyzes the occurrence of these lesions in a large skeletal series comprising 3541 Roman period individuals (1st-6th century AD). Sixteen lesions reported in rickets in subadults, and 13 associated with residual rickets and osteomalacia in adults, were analyzed. Among subadults, there were clear associations among post-cranial lesions. Porotic cranial changes were associated with each other, but not with post-cranial lesions. A range of conditions could have produced the cranial lesions. There was a general paucity of correlations between indicators found in adults, and the difficulty in recording bending deformities was clear. Pseudofractures appear to provide a useful means of investigating osteomalacia in adults. In general, a simple algorithmic approach using presence or absence of lesions is unlikely to provide an adequate means of diagnosing vitamin D deficiency in paleopathology. Knowledge and consideration of the underlying physiological mechanisms involved in lesion formation, combined with individual judgement, will be required to differentially diagnose cases.",The rachitic tooth: The use of radiographs as a screening technique.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573164,International journal of paleopathology,2019 05 29,"This study investigates morphological changes in pulp chambers of living and archaeological individuals with past vitamin D deficiency.

Measurements of pulp horns/chambers from radiographs were conducted to quantify morphological observations. One group had clear skeletal evidence of rickets from St. Matthew, Quebec (n=1) and St. Jacques, France (n=4); a second group had slight skeletal indicators from Bastion des Ursulines, Quebec (n=6); and a third group lacked both skeletal and radiological evidence of deficiency from St. Antoine (n=6) and Pointe-aux-Trembles (n=4). Results showed archaeological individuals with clear and slight skeletal evidence of past deficiency displayed constricted or chair shaped pulp horns.

The expressions of miR-210 and ATG7 in 30 cancer tissues and the adjacent tissues in patients with lung cancer were compared using RT-qPCR methods, Western Blot assay was carried out to test the expression of ATG7 in protein. Moreover, the dual luciferase reporter gene assay system was used to confirm ATG7 is a target gene of miR-210. Furthermore, lung cancer cell line A549 was transfected with either miR-210 mimics or inhibitors and RT-qPCR methods was used to detect the expression of miR-210 and ATG7. Next, MTT assay was used to examine the effect of miR-210 on the growth of the lung cancer cells, and finally, the expression of autophagy related genes, ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 were detected by Western Blot and ICC assay. We observed that miR-210 was significantly increased and ATG7 was markedly decreased in cancer tissue of patients with lung cancer compared with normal tissue. Moreover, results of dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that ATG7 is a direct target of miR-210. Next, transfection of miR-210 mimics in lung cancer cells induced significant increase in cell proliferation, and transfection of miR-210 inhibitors lead to inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-210 induced marked decrease in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1, while transfection of miR-210 inhibitors induced significant increase in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and beclin-1. Our results suggested that miR-210 plays a great role in autophagy of lung cancer cell by targeting ATG7.",Higher average potency across the United States is associated with progression to first cannabis use disorder symptom.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573162,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 04 25,"To determine if higher potency cannabis is associated with earlier progression to regular cannabis use, daily cannabis use, and cannabis use disorder symptom onset."

They were grown in soil containing up to 1000 mg/kg dry weight (dw) of cyanide (CN), added as 15N-labeled potassium ferrocyanide and prepared with a new method for synthesis of labeled iron cyanides. CN content and 15N enrichment were monitored weekly over the exposure in leaf tissue of different age. The 15N enrichment in the young and old leaf tissue reached up to 15.197‰ and 9063‰, respectively; it increased significantly over the exposure and with increasing exposure concentrations (p < 0.05). Although the CN accumulation in the old leaf tissue was higher, compared to the young leaf tissue (p < 0.05), the 15N enrichment in the two tissue types did not differ statistically. This indicates a non-uniform CN accumulation but a uniform 15N allocation throughout the leaf mass. Significant differences were detected between the measured CN content and the C15N content, calculated from the 15N enrichment (p < 0.05), revealing a significant CN fraction within the leaf tissue, which could not be detected as ionic CN. The application of labeled iron CN clearly shows that CN is detoxified during uptake by the willows. However, these results do not exclude other detoxification pathways, not related to the trees. Still, they are strongly indicative of the central role the trees played in CN removal and detoxification under the experimental conditions.",Evolution in physiochemical and cloud condensation nuclei activation properties of crop residue burning particles during photochemical aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573105,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"As a main form of biomass burning in agricultural countries, crop residue burning is a significant source of atmospheric fine particles. In this study, the aging of particles emitted from the burning of four major crop residues in China was investigated in a smog chamber. The particle size distribution, chemical composition and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity were simultaneously measured. The properties of crop residue burning particles varied substantially among different fuel types. During aging, the particle size and mass concentration increased substantially, suggesting condensational growth by formation of secondary aerosols. The particle composition was dominated by organics. Aging resulted in considerable enhancement of organics and inorganics, with enhancement ratios of 1.24-1.44 and 1.33-1.76 respectively, as well as a continuous increase in the oxidation level of organics. Elevated CCN activity was observed during aging, with the hygroscopicity parameter κ varying from 0.16 to 0.34 for fresh particles and 0.19 to 0.40 for aged particles. Based on the volume mixing rule, the hygroscopicity parameter of organic components (κorg) was derived. κorg exhibited an increasing tendency with aging, which was generally consistent with the tendency of the O:C ratio, indicating that the oxidation level was related to the hygroscopicity and CCN activity of organic aerosols from crop residue burning. Our results indicated that photochemical aging could significantly impact the CCN activation of crop burning aerosols, not only by the production of secondary aerosols, but also by enhancing the hygroscopicity of organic components, thereby contributing to the aerosol indirect climate forcing.",Response of ammonia-oxidizing archaea to heavy metal contamination in freshwater sediment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573104,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"It has been well-documented that the distribution of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in soils can be affected by heavy metal contamination, whereas information about the impact of heavy metal on these ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in freshwater sediment is still lacking. The present study explored the change of sediment ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in a freshwater reservoir after being accidentally contaminated by industrial discharge containing high levels of metals. Bacterial amoA gene was found to be below the quantitative PCR detection and was not successfully amplified by conventional PCR. The number of archaeal amoA gene in reservoir sediments were 9.62 × 102-1.35 × 107 copies per gram dry sediment. AOA abundance continuously decreased, and AOA richness, diversity and community structure also considerably varied with time. Therefore, heavy metal pollution could have a profound impact on freshwater sediment AOA community.

Visible-light-driven photocatalysis is a promising technology for virus inactivation. However, the existing photocatalytic antiviral research studies have mostly been carried out in single-component systems, neglecting the effect of natural organic matter, which exists widely in actual water bodies. In this paper, electrospun Cu-TiO2 nanofibers were prepared as photocatalysts, and their photocatalytic antiviral performance in the presence of humic acid (HA) was comprehensively studied for the first time. The properties of the reaction mixture were measured during the reaction. In addition, the safety, reliability and stability of photocatalytic disinfection in the mixed system were evaluated. The results showed that the virus removal efficiency decreased with the increase of the HA concentration. The type of reaction solution, such as PBS buffer solution or water, did not affect the removal efficiency noticeably. Under acidic conditions, the electrostatic forces between photocatalysts and viruses were strengthened, leading to higher virus removal efficiency. As the reaction time went on, the pH value in the solution increased first and then tended to be stable, the conductivity remained stable, and the dissolved oxygen increased first and then decreased. The safety test showed that the concentration of Cu ions released into the solution was lower than specified by the international standards. No photoreactivation was observed, and the addition of HA significantly reduced the reutilization efficiency of the photocatalysts.","Temporal variability of visibility and its parameterizations in Ningbo, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573102,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Simultaneous and continuous measurements of visibility, meteorological parameters and air pollutants were carried out at a suburban site in Ningbo from June 1, 2013 to May 31, 2015. The characteristics of visibility and their relationships with air pollutants and meteorological factors were investigated using multiple statistical methods. Daily visibility ranged from 0.6 to 34.1 km, with a mean value of 11.8 km. During the 2-year experiment, 43.4% of daily visibility was found to be less than 10.0 km and only 9.2% was greater than 20.0 km. Visibility was lower in winter with a frequency of 53.4% in the range of 0.0-5.0 km. Annual visibility had an obvious diurnal variation, with the lowest and highest visibility being 7.5 km at approximately 06:00 local time and 15.6 km at approximately 14:00 local time, respectively. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) indicated that the different ranges of visibility were significantly affected by different levels of pollutants and meteorological conditions. Based on the analyses, visibility was found to be an exponential function of PM2.5 concentrations within a certain range of relative humidity. Thus, non-linear models combining multiple linear regressions with exponential regression were subsequently developed using the data collected from June 2014 to May 2015, and the data from June 2013 to May 2014 was used to evaluate the performance of the model. It was demonstrated that the derived models can quantitatively describe the relationships between visibility, air quality and meteorological parameters in Ningbo.","Morphology, composition, and sources of individual aerosol particles at a regional background site of the YRD, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573100,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Aerosol samples were collected at Lin'an, a background site of Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Morphology, size, composition, and mixing state of individual aerosol particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and the soluble ions of PM1.0 were studied by aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). The daily average AMS mass concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium were about 5.8, 8.6, and 5.6 μg/m3, respectively. Individual aerosol particles were classified into seven types: S-rich, K-rich, organic matter (OM), soot, fly ash, metal, and mineral. S-rich particles were dominant in all size bins, and 51% (by number) of S-rich particles were internally mixed with other particles. The fraction of organic coating particles was 13.7% in morning, 25.2% in afternoon, and 11% in evening, suggesting that the strong photochemical process during afternoon produced more secondary organic aerosols (SOA) on the surface of inorganic particles. Fly ash and metal particles were abundant during the day, suggesting the influence of emissions from coal-fired power plants and steel plants. The results indicate that the intense industrial emissions in the YRD significantly transported to the background areas. PM2.5 concentration may be lower in background air than in urban air but complex mixing state of aerosol particles indicates that the long-range transported particles substantially influenced the background air quality.",The simultaneous removal of ammonium and manganese from surface water by MeOx: Side effect of ammonium presence on manganese removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573099,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Manganese and ammonium pollution in surface water sources has become a serious issue. In this study, a pilot-scale filtration system was used to investigate the effect of ammonium on manganese removal during the simultaneous removal of ammonium and manganese from surface water using a manganese co-oxide filter film (MeOx). The results showed that the manganese removal efficiency of MeOx in the absence of ammonium was high and stable, and the removal efficiency could reach 70% even at 5.5 °C. When the influent ammonium concentration was lower than 0.7 mg/L, ammonium and manganese could be removed simultaneously. However, at an ammonium concentration of 1.5 mg/L, the manganese removal efficiency of the filter gradually decreased with time (from 96% to 46.20%). Nevertheless, there was no impact of manganese on ammonium removal. The mechanism by which ammonium negatively affected manganese removal was investigated, demonstrating that ammonium affected manganese removal mainly through two possible mechanisms. On one hand, the decreased pH caused by ammonium oxidation was unfavorable for the oxidation of manganese by MeOx; on the other hand, the presence of ammonium slowed the growth of new MeOx and retarded the increase in the specific surface area of the MeOx-coated sand, and induced changes in the morphology and crystal structure of MeOx. Consequently, the manganese removal efficiency of the filter decreased when ammonium was present in the inlet water.",Pilot-scale experiments on multilevel contact oxidation treatment of poultry farm wastewater using saran lock carriers under different operation model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573098,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"A pilot-scale multilevel contact oxidation reactors system, coupled with saran lock carriers, was applied for the treatment of poultry farm wastewater. The removal efficiencies of CODcr, ammonia, and the total nitrogen as well as the elimination performance of CODcr and total nitrogen along the three-level contact oxidation tanks under six designed operational models were investigated. Based on the performance of the nitrogen removal of the saran lock carriers and the distribution of anoxic-aerobic interspace under the suitable operation model, the mechanism of nitrogen removal of the system was also explored. The results revealed that the intermittent aeration under parallel model is the most suitable operation model, while the removal efficiencies of CODcr, ammonia, and the total nitrogen were 86.86%, 84.04%, and 80.96%, respectively. The effluent concentration of CODcr, ammonia, and the total nitrogen were 55.6 mg/L, 8.3 mg/L, and 12.0 mg/L, which satisfy both the discharge standard of pollutants for livestock and poultry breeding industry (GB 18596-2001) and the first grade of the integrated wastewater discharge standard (GB 8978-1996). Moreover, the mechanism for the nitrogen removal should be attributed to the plenty of anoxic-aerobic interspaces of the biofilm and the three-dimensional spiral structure of the saran lock carriers, where the oxygen-deficient distribution was suitable for the happening of the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process. Therefore, the multilevel contact oxidation tanks system is an effective pathway for the treatment of the poultry farm wastewater on the strength of a suitable operation model and novel carriers.","Distribution and relationship between antimicrobial resistance genes and heavy metals in surface sediments of Taihu Lake, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573097,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, and other wastes released into the environment can significantly influence environmental antibiotic resistance. We investigated the occurrence of 22 antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and 10 heavy metal concentrations, and the relationship between ARGs and heavy metals in surface sediment from seven sites of Lake Taihu. The results showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between sediment ARG levels, especially for tetracycline and sulfonamides (e.g., tet(A), tet(D), tet(E), tet(O), sul1, sul2 and int-1) and specific heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, Zn, among others) in the Lake. In the surface sediments, heavy metals showed an interaction with resistance genes, but the strength of interaction was diminished with increasing depth. For most of the heavy metals, the concentration of elements in the top sediments was higher than that in other depths. Tetracycline resistance genes (tet(A), tet(B), tet(D), tet(E) and tet(O), β-lactam resistance genes (SHV, TEM, CTX, OXA and OXY) and sulfonamide resistance genes (sulA, sul1, sul2, sul3 and int-1) were detected. They showed a trend which inferred a statistically significant increase followed by decreases in the relative abundance of these ARGs (normalized to 16S rRNA genes) with increasing depth. This study revealed that tet(A), tet(O), TEM, OXY, int-1, sul1 and sul3 were widespread in surface sediments with high abundance, indicating that these genes deserve more attention in future work.",Effect of wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) on fine particle (PM2.5) emission from coal-fired boilers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573096,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"In this study, the characteristics of fine particles before and after wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) in three coal-fired heating boilers in northern China were investigated by using a dilution-based emission sampling experimental system. The influences of the WFGD process on the mass and number concentrations as well as the chemical composition of fine particles were analyzed. The removal efficiency of desulfurization processes on particulate matter mass was 30.06%-56.25% for the three study units. The WFGD had a great influence on the size distributions of particle mass concentration and number concentration. A significant increase in the number and mass concentration of particles in the size range of 0.094-0.946 μm was observed. The water-soluble ion content accounted for a very large proportion of PM2.5 mass, and its proportion in PM2.5 increased from 28.39%-41.08% to 48.96%-61.21% after the WFGD process for the three units. The desulfurizing process also drastically increased the proportion of cation component (Ca2+ for unit A, Mg2+ for unit B, and Na+ for unit C) and the proportion of SO42- in PM2.5, and it increased the CE/AE values of PM2.5 from 0.82-0.98 to 0.93-1.27 for the three study units."

Results demonstrated that the average numbers of gene copies of Legionella spp. and Mycobacterium spp. were significantly higher than those of Aeromonas spp. (p < 0.05). Legionella spp. and Mycobacterium spp. were 100% (44/44) positively detected while P. aeruginosa and Aeromonas spp. were 79.54% (35/44) and 77.27% (34/44) positively detected. Legionella pneumophila was only detected in 4 samples (4/44), demonstrating its occasional occurrence. No Mycobacterium avium or Naegleria fowleri was detected in any of the samples. The average gene copy numbers of target OPPPs were the highest in summer, suggesting seasonal prevalence of OPPPs. Average gene copy numbers of OPPPs in the taps of low-use-frequency were higher than in taps of high-use-frequency, but the difference was not significant for some OPPPs (p > 0.05). Moderate negative correlations between the chlorine concentration and the gene copy numbers of OPPPs were observed by Spearman analysis (rs ranged from -0.311 to -0.710, p < 0.05). However, no significant correlations existed between OPPPs and AOC, BDOC, or turbidity. Moderate positive correlations were observed between the target microorganisms, especially for Acanthamoeba spp., through Spearman analysis (p < 0.05). Based on our studies, it is proposed that disinfectant concentration, season, taps with different-use frequency, OPPP species, and potential microbial correlations should be considered for control of OPPPs in tap water.",Cytotoxicity and autophagy induction by graphene quantum dots with different functional groups.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573083,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) possess great potential in various applications due to their superior physicochemical properties and wide array of available surface modifications. However, the toxicity of GQDs has not been systematically assessed, thus hindered their further development; especially, the risk of surface modifications of GQDs is largely unknown. In this study, we employed a lung carcinoma A549 cells as the model to investigate the cytotoxicity and autophagy induction of three types GQDs, including cGQDs (COOH-GQDs), hGQDs (OH-GQDs), and aGQDs (NH2-GQDs). The results showed hGQDs was the most toxic, as significant cell death was induced at the concentration of 100 μg/mL, determining by WST-1 assay as well as Annexin-V-FITC/PI apoptosis analysis, whereas cGQDs and aGQDs were non-cytotoxic within the measured concentration. Autophagy detection was performed by TEM examination, LC3 fluorescence tracking, and Western-blot. Both aGQDs and hGQDs induced cellular autophagy to various degrees except for cGQDs. Further analysis on autophagy pathways indicated all GQDs significantly activated p-p38MAPK; p-ERK1/2 was inhibited by aGQDs and hGQDs but activated by cGQDs. p-JNK was inhibited by aGQDs and cGQDs, while activated by hGQDs. Simultaneously, Akt was activated by hGQDs but inhibited by aGQDs. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA significantly increased the cytotoxicity of GQDs, suggesting that autophagy played a protective role against the toxicity of GQDs. In conclusion, cGQDs showed excellent biocompatibility and may be considered for biological applications. Autophagy induction may be included in the health risk assessment of GQDs as it reflects the stress status which may eventually lead to diseases.","Influencing factors and prediction of ambient Peroxyacetyl nitrate concentration in Beijing, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573082,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Peroxyacyl nitrates (PANs) are important secondary pollutants in ground-level atmosphere.

Model 3 using a BP-ANN based on the original variables achieved the best prediction results among the four models, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.7089, mean bias error of -0.0043 ppb, mean absolute error of 0.4836 ppb, root mean squared error of 0.5320 ppb, and Willmott's index of agreement of 0.8214. Based on a comparison of the performance indices of the MLR and BP-ANN models, we concluded that the BP-ANN model was able to capture the highly non-linear relationships between PAN concentration and the conventional atmospheric pollutant and meteorological parameters, providing more accurate results than the traditional MLR models did, with a markedly higher goodness of R. The selected meteorological and atmospheric pollutant parameters described a sufficient amount of PAN variation, and thus provided satisfactory prediction results. More specifically, the BP-ANN model performed very well for capturing the variation pattern when PAN concentrations were low. The findings of this study address some of the existing knowledge gaps in this research field and provide a theoretical basis for future regional air pollution control.",Enhanced fat degradation following the addition of a Pseudomonas species to a bioaugmentation product used in grease traps.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573081,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"The presence of fats, oils and greases (FOGs) in wastewater can lead to many problems including blockages. Investigation of a bioaugmentation product, consisting of Bacillus spp., to degrade butter (1%, W/V) and olive oil (1%, V/V) was performed in aerobic batch cultures for 13-day incubation. Gravimetric analysis of the remaining substrates showed slowly degradation of the oil after a 2-day lag, but no degradation of the butter. Addition of a Pseudomonas putida strain CP1 to the Bacillus spp. population promoted rapidly degradation of both fats after 7 days of incubation. High fat accumulation revealed the potential use of the new bacterial mixture for production of added-value compounds. Lipase production only by the Bacillus spp. along with the analysis of the remaining lipids with thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography, suggested that the Bacillus spp. mainly only hydrolyzed the fat. The breakdown products were metabolized by the Pseudomonas putida CP1 performing preferential utilization of unsaturated fatty acids. Investigation of population dynamics using selective plating and a labeled Pseudomonas putida CP1::Tn7-gfp showed domination of the latter. The new mixture performed a successful cooperation with good potential for FOG treatment and an aggregative response desirable to fat degradation in grease traps.",Mechanism of oxidation and catalysis of organic matter abiotic humification in the presence of MnO2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573080,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Humification plays a critical role in the environmental fate of organic wastes, and MnO2 holds great promise for enhancing this reaction. However, the effects of MnO2 on the enhancement of the humification reaction remain ambiguous. To better reveal the mechanism by which MnO2 enhances the reaction and investigate the fate of the humification products, abiotic humification experiments were performed using increasing concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to a fixed amount of MnO2. DOM was represented by model humic precursors consisting of catechol, glucose and glycine. The results indicate that the reduction of MnO2 played a dominant role in the formation of fulvic-like acids (FLAs), and the subsequent reduction products, MnOOH and Mn(II), acted as catalysts in the formation of humic-like acids (HLAs). Moreover, CO2 release occurred during the formation of FLAs, and a strong linear correlation between CO2 release and the formation of FLAs was observed (p < 0.01), where 0.73-1.87 mg of CO2 was released per mg dissolved organic carbon (DOC) FLAs. Furthermore, the concentration of MnO2 had a pronounced influence on the product behavior, where a lower MnO2 concentration decreased the quantity of FLAs produced.",Three decades of changes in water environment of a large freshwater Lake and its relationship with socio-economic indicators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573079,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Tai Lake (Ch: Taihu) has attracted international attention forcyanobacteria blooms. However, the drivers of cultural eutrophication, especially long-term socio-economic indicators have been little researched. The results of research demonstrate how socio-economic development affected quality of water and how it has been improved by anthropogenic activities. This study described variability in indicators of water quality in Tai Lakeand investigated thedrivers. Significant relationships existed between concentrations of annual mean total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), and population, per capital gross domestic production (GDP) and sewage discharge (p < 0.05). However, mechanisms causing change varied among TN, TP, COD and BOD. Before 2000, the main contributors to increases in concentrations of TN were human population, GDP and volumes of domestic sewage discharges. After 2000, discharges of industrial sewage become the primary contributor. After 1998, the regressions of annual mean TN, TP and COD on per capital GDP, population and domestic sewage discharge were reversed compared to the former period. Since 1999, an apparent inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental pollution and economic development has developed, which indicated that actions taken by governments have markedly improved quality of water in Tai Lake. The statistical relationship between BOD and per capital GDP didn't conform to the Kuznet curve. The U-shaped Kuznet curve may offer hope for the future that with significant environmental investments a high GDP can be reached and maintained without degradation of the environment, especially through appropriate management of industrial sewage discharge.",Nitrite pre-treatment of dewatered sludge for microbial fuel cell application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573078,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"The effect of pre-treatment of dewatered sludge using different nitrite concentrations and pH for microbial fuel cell (MFC) application was investigated. The results show that the addition of nitrite was feasible to increase the solubilization rate of the sludge and may reduce mass transfer limitation at the anode. This helped the MFC to reach higher voltage and to generate more power. The higher free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration under the acidic condition helped to increase sludge solubilization. However, under an alkaline condition, during which the FNA concentration was relatively low, the solubilization of the sludge was higher. The highest voltage and power density produced was 390 mV and 153 mW/m2, respectively, with the addition of nitrite at 100 mg-N/L and pH 9. Furthermore, it was found that elevated levels of FNA could inhibit electrogenic bacteria thus reducing power generation.",Effect of photo-biodegradation and biodegradation on the biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic matter across diverse surface water bodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573077,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"The objective of this research was to quantify the temporal variation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in five distinct waterbodies in watersheds with diverse types of land use and land cover in the presence and absence of sunlight. The water bodies were an agricultural pond, a lake in a forested watershed, a man-made reservoir, an estuary, and a bay. Two sets of samples were prepared by dispensing unfiltered samples into filtered samples in 1:10 ratio (V/V). The first set was exposed to sunlight (10 hr per day for 30 days) for examining the combined effect of photo-biodegradation, while the second set was stored in dark for examining biodegradation alone. Spectroscopic measurements in tandem with multivariate statistics were used to interpret DOM lability and composition. The results suggest that the agricultural pond behaved differently compared to other study locations during degradation experiments due to the presence of higher amount of microbial humic-like and protein-like components derived from microbial/anthropogenic sources. For all samples, a larger decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (10.12% ± 9.81% for photo-biodegradation and 6.65% ± 2.83% for biodegradation) and rapid transformation of DOM components (i.e., terrestrial humic-like components into microbial humic and protein-like components) were observed during photo-biodegradation experiments. Results suggest that sunlight facilitated DOM biodegradation, resulting in simpler recalcitrant molecules regardless of original composition. Overall, it was found that combined effects of light and bacteria are more efficient than bacterial effects alone in remineralizing and altering DOM, which highlights the crucial importance of sunlight in transforming aquatic DOM.","Development of a model to simulate soil heavy metals lateral migration quantity based on SWAT in Huanjiang watershed, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573076,Journal of environmental sciences (China),2019 01 11,"Lateral transportation of soil heavy metals in rainfall events could significantly increase the scope of pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a model with high accuracy to simulate the migration quantity of heavy metals. A model for heavy metal migration simulation was developed based on the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. This model took into consideration the influence of soil pH value, soil particle size, runoff volume, sediment amount, concentration of water-soluble heavy metals dissolved in runoff and insoluble absorbed to the soil particles. This model was reasonable in Huanjiang watershed, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, south China, covering an area of 273 km2. The optimal drainage area threshold was determined by analyzing the effects of watershed subdivision on the simulation results to ensure the simulation accuracy. The main conclusions of this paper were: (1) watershed subdivision could affect simulation migration quantity of heavy metals; (2) the quantity of heavy metals transported by sediment accounted for 97%-99% of the total migration quantity in the study watershed. Therefore, sediment played the most important role in heavy metal migration; (3) the optimal drainage area threshold percentage to ensure high simulation accuracy was determined to be 2.01% of the total watershed; (4) with the optimal threshold percentage, this model could simulate the migration quantity of As, Pb and Cd accurately at the total watershed and sub-watershed level. The results of this paper were useful for identifying the key regions with heavy metal migration."

Thus, PNH cells show poor expression of surface proteins, such as CD55 and CD59, and dim or absent binding of fluorescently labeled modified aerolysin (FLAER). In clinical diagnostic laboratories, the detection and quantitation of PNH is currently performed by flow cytometry (FC) analysis of peripheral blood (PB) samples. Although PB remains the preferred source of cells for PNH detection, we and other authors have shown that a careful FC analysis of bone marrow (BM) aspirates can provide results for PNH detection and quantitation equivalent to those obtained with PB. Here, we review studies delineating the expression of GPI-anchored proteins and FLAER binding in normal BM cells, and summarize published findings demonstrating the feasibility of identifying and quantitating PNH cells in BM using FLAER as well as antibodies against GPI-anchored proteins. Detection of PNH cells in BM should be useful in patients with unsuspected PNH or with severe cytopenia in whom PB FC analysis may be challenging.",The challenging task of enumerating blasts in the bone marrow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573046,Seminars in hematology,2019 06 04,"Enumeration of blasts in the bone marrow is critical for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic response evaluation in myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute leukemias. However, few studies have examined the accuracy and precision of marrow blast counting using standard microscopic procedures. In our study, 4 experienced hematopathologists evaluated blast percentages in marrow using either differential counts on aspirate smears or visual estimates on CD34-stained trephine biopsies. Results of an independent observer's manual counts of individual labeled and unlabeled cells performed on high resolution digital images of CD34-stained trephine biopsies were designated as the ""Digital Reference."" Hematopathologists' blast counts showed excellent interobserver reproducibility, but the counts in smears and trephine biopsies correlated poorly with each other. Compared to the Digital Reference, both smear and trephine evaluations showed positive bias and high variability. The biopsy showed less variability but higher positive bias relative to the smears, indicating that counts were overestimated more in the hematopathologists' biopsy evaluation. Flow cytometric counts correlated well with the Digital Reference, and cases with high blast count generally showed worse cytogenetic findings. Our results demonstrate the need for better counting methods if significant decisions are made based on microscopic enumeration of blasts. Further efforts should be made to develop markers to better define blast cells and perhaps incorporate automated digital imaging technologies to enumerate them. Also, consideration should be given to quantifying blasts per marrow area in biopsies instead of per nucleated cells.",Mass spectrometry and proteomics in hematology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573045,Seminars in hematology,2019 06 04,"Mass spectrometry-based techniques now enable the unbiased identification of proteins in complex mixtures including proteins isolated from cells and tissues.

Molecular clonality assays are generally used when flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry has not sufficiently clarified the benign or malignant nature of a lymphoid proliferation. Additionally, since molecular clonality assays are tumor specific, they allow the clinician to distinguish recurrences from second tumors, and have the sensitivity to monitor minimal residual disease.

Although these alterations can be tested individually with high sensitivity and specificity using dedicated single gene tests, it is increasingly impractical and costly to test them separately as the number of alterations grows. Instead, multiplex testing platforms that can test multiple targets in a specimen have been developed. Among these platforms, massively parallel sequencing technologies (so-called next-generation sequencing [NGS] [4]) prove to be most versatile and is increasingly being used to build tests to meet the clinical testing need. In hematolymphoid neoplasms, the early incorporation of molecular findings into the diagnostic criteria by WHO [5] has further accelerated the adoption of NGS-based tests in routine clinical practice. This article focuses on what is used in the clinical diagnostic laboratories today and is not intended to be a review of the NGS technology or its future direction.

Genetic disturbances in folate metabolism such as Thymidylate synthase may increase risk for conotruncal heart defects. We evaluated two common Thymidylate synthase polymorphisms, including the 28 bp tandem repeat in the promoter enhancer region of the 5'-untranslated region and the 6 bp deletion in the 3'-untranslated region, as risk factors of conotruncal heart defects including various subtypes of malformations, in a total of 193 mothers with conotruncal heart defect in offspring and 234 healthy controls in the Chinese population. Logistic regression analyses revealed that mothers who were homozygotes with deletion (-/-) had a 1.8-fold (odds ratio: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.0-3.0, p = 0.040) increased risk for conotruncal heart defect in offspring, respectively, when compared with mothers carrying the wild type (+/+) genotype.

Thereafter, seeds were analyzed for physical properties and chemical composition to determine the main parameters of their resistance against C. maculatus. The SS was more suitable for insect infestation. Genotypes were classified into resistant to highly susceptible. Results showed that the physical characteristics of seeds were less important than the chemical components for conferring resistance to C. maculatus. Two genotypes, Samira and Lade, consistently demonstrated high tolerance to infestation by C. maculatus, and therefore may be recommended for use in breeding programs as a source of resistance and then to minimize the dependence on insecticides for the control of insect pests under subsistence farming conditions in Cameroon.",Effects of the long-term feeding of diets enriched with inorganic phosphorus on the adult feline kidney and phosphorus metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572965,The British journal of nutrition,2019 03 03,"Renal disease has a high incidence in cats, and some evidence implicates dietary P as well. To investigate this further, two studies in healthy adult cats were conducted. Study 1 (36 weeks) included forty-eight cats, stratified to control or test diets providing 1·2 or 4·8 g/1000 kcal (4184 kJ) P (0 or approximately 3·6 g/1000 kcal (4184 kJ) inorganic P, Ca:P 1·2, 0·6). Study 2 (29 weeks) included fifty cats, stratified to control or test diets, providing 1·3 or 3·6 g/1000 kcal (4184 kJ) P (0 or approximately 1·5 g/1000 kcal (4184 kJ) inorganic P, Ca:P 1·2, 0·9). Health markers, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and mineral balance were measured regularly, with abdominal ultrasound. Study 1 was halted after 4 weeks as the test group GFR reduced by 0·4 (95 % CI 0·3, 0·5) ml/min per kg, and ultrasound revealed changes in renal echogenicity. In study 2, at week 28, no change in mean GFR was observed (P &gt;0·05); however, altered renal echogenicity was detected in 36 % of test cats. In agreement with previous studies, feeding a diet with Ca:P &lt;1·0, a high total and inorganic P inclusion resulted in loss of renal function and changes in echogenicity suggestive of renal pathology. Feeding a diet containing lower total and inorganic P with Ca:P close to 1·0 led to more subtle structural changes in a third of test cats; however, nephrolithiasis occurred in both diet groups, complicating data interpretation. We conclude that the no observed adverse effects level for total dietary P in adult cats is lower than 3·6 g/1000 kcal (4184 kJ), however the effect of inorganic P sources and Ca:P require further investigation.","A new species of Raphidascaris (Nematoda: Raphidascarididae) infecting the fish Gymnogeophagus balzanii (Cichlidae) from the Pantanal wetlands, Brazil and a taxonomic update of the subgenera of Raphidascaris based on molecular phylogeny and morphology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572964,Journal of helminthology,2018 12 21,"Raphidascaris (Sprentascaris) andersoni n. sp.

The new species differs from its congeners mainly by having a conspicuous papilla-like formation slightly anterior to the cloacal aperture. Furthermore, males of R. (S.) lanfrediae and R. (S.) mahnerti have caudal alae, and R. (S.) hypostomi and R. (S.) pimelodi lack lateral alae, whereas in the new species caudal alae are absent and lateral alae present. The remaining congeners, namely, R. (S.) marano and R. (S.) saltaensis differ from Raphidascaris (Sprentascaris) andersoni n. sp. mainly because males have three pairs of postcloacal papillae (vs five pairs). In the phylogenetic reconstructions, using three nuclear genetic markers (18S, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and 28S rDNA) and one mitochondrial (cox1 mtDNA), the new species was separated from other representatives of Raphidascarididae, and the absence of monophyly in Hysterothylacium and Raphidascaroides was confirmed. Moreover, the subgenera Sprentascaris and Ichthyascaris appeared to be monophyletic. Therefore, even though Raphidascaris (Raphidascaris) was apparently not monophyletic, the subgenera of Raphidascaris should be re-erected as valid genera.

This article reviews recent developments in understanding the mechanisms underlying BBB dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress after ischemic stroke, and focuses on how cav-1 modulates a series of activities after ischemic stroke. In general, cav-1 reduces BBB permeability mainly by downregulating MMP9, reduces neuroinflammation through influencing cytokines and inflammatory cells, promotes nerve regeneration and angiogenesis via cav-1/VEGF pathway, reduces apoptosis, and reduces the damage mediated by oxidative stress.

The administration of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists prior to IVF/ICSI can improve the successful pregnancy rate. Whether a briefer treatment interval would be efficacious has not been studied."

They are a well-known consequence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, chronic hypertension, and diffuse axonal injury, among other causes. However, the frequency and location of new CMBs postadult cardiac surgery, in association with cognition and perioperative risk factors, have yet to be studied. Methods- Pre- and postsurgery magnetic resonance susceptibility-weighted images and neuropsychological tests were analyzed from a total of 75 patients undergoing cardiac surgery (70 men; mean age, 63±10 years). CMBs were identified by a neuroradiologist blinded to clinical details who independently assessed the presence and location of CMBs using standardized criteria. Results- New CMBs were identified in 76% of patients after cardiac surgery. The majority of new CMBs were located in the frontal lobe (46%) followed by the parietal lobe (15%), cerebellum (13%), occipital lobe (12%), and temporal lobe (8%). Patients with new CMBs typically began with a higher prevalence of preexisting CMBs ( P=0.02). New CMBs were associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass times ( P=0.003), and there was a borderline association with lower percentage hematocrit ( P=0.04). Logistic regression analysis suggested a ≈2% increase in the odds of acquiring new CMBs during cardiac surgery for every minute of bypass time (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; P=0.04). Postoperative neuropsychological decline was observed in 44% of patients and seemed to be unrelated to new CMBs. Conclusions- New CMBs identified using susceptibility-weighted images were found in 76% of patients who underwent cardiac surgery. CMBs were globally distributed with the highest numbers in the frontal and parietal lobes. Our regression analysis indicated that length of cardiopulmonary bypass time and lowered hematocrit may be significant predictors for new CMBs after cardiac surgery.

It is unknown, however, whether their antibacterial function is compromised. In this study, MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow samples provided by nine diabetic and six nondiabetic donors and treated with or without Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The supernatant of diabetic MSCs (MSCs-dia) and nondiabetic control MSCs (MSCs-c) was added into the cultures of E. coli for evaluation of the effect of MSCs-dia and MSCs-c on bacterial growth. The number of E. coli colonies increased when they were cultured with the supernatant of MSCs-dia, with or without LPS stimulation, compared with the E. coli cultured with the supernatant of MSCs-c. Human macrophages were co-cultured with either MSCs-dia or MSCs-c, for 24 h, and then cultured with heat-inactivated E. coli. Bacterial phagocytosis was reduced after macrophages were co-cultured with MSCs-dia. Gene expression of antibacterial peptide LL-37 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by MSCs-dia was reduced compared with MSCs-c. The supernatant of MSCs-dia and MSCs-c was applied to a 42-cytokine antibody array. While the cytokine profiles of MSCs-dia and MSCs-c were largely similar, the productions of MCP-1 and interleukin-6 distinguished MSCs-dia from MSCs-c in response to LPS treatment. In conclusion, MSCs-dia were less inhibitive of the growth of bacteria and compromised in regulation of macrophages for bacterial phagocytosis. The reduced expression of IDO and LL-37 and an altered cytokine profile in MSCs-dia should be taken into consideration in developing cell therapies for diabetic infection.",Fatal Complications of New-Onset Complicated Type B Aortic Dissection After Endovascular Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: Report of 2 Cases and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572794,Vascular and endovascular surgery,2019 04 09,"New-onset antegrade Stanford type B aortic dissection (TBAD) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is rare.

However, several clinical biases impede its clinical application. Recent recommendations suggest combining RDW with other biomarkers. Accordingly, we propose evaluating the well-recognized biomarkers of vascular aging (i.e., the leukocyte telomere length and telomerase activity, and reduced levels of endothelial progenitor cells [EPCs]) with RDW, for predicting the risk for vascular aging and onset and prognosis of age-related degenerative arterial diseases, such as sporadic ascending aorta aneurysm (AAA), characterized to have an increased incidence in old people. Consequently, in this study (and for the first time), we simultaneously investigated the relationship between RDW values, systemic inflammatory molecules, mean values of leukocyte telomere length, telomerase activity and EPCs, and the risk for vascular aging and AAA onset and prognosis. To achieve this aim, we selected 80 old and 80 young healthy subjects and 80 AAA cases. Appropriate methodologies were used for assessing blood parameters, aorta alterations, genotyping, impairment of the leukocyte telomere length, and telomerase activity. The main findings obtained demonstrated that increased RDW values along with the augmented blood levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein and the reduced mean values of both leukocyte telomere length, telomerase activity, and EPCs are independently associated with the high risk for both vascular aging and AAA onset and prognosis. They might be used as the best predictor biomarker profile for vascular aging, and for both diagnosis and outcome of sporadic AAA.",Using co-axial electrospray deposition to eliminate burst release of simvastatin from microparticles and to enhance induced osteogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572791,Journal of biomaterials science.

Molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-related metabolic disorders have not been completely elucidated. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and are key metabolic regulators of the whole-body energy metabolism. Certain enzymes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are directly regulated by PPARs via their interaction with specific response elements in their gene promoters. Many food factors act as ligands of PPARs and regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by regulating the activities of these nuclear receptors, leading to the attenuation of obesity-related metabolic disorders. In this review, we describe our current knowledge of the role of PPARs in the regulation of whole-body energy metabolism and several examples of food factors that act as ligands of PPARs, which may be useful in the management of obesity and the accompanying energy metabolism abnormalities.

Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine",2019 02 25,"Bone-drilling operation necessitates an accurate and efficient surgical drill bit to minimize thermal damage to the bone. This article provides a methodology for predicting the bone temperature elevation during surgical bone drilling and to gain a better understanding on the influences of the point angle, helix angle and web thickness of the drill bit. The proposed approach utilized the normalized Cockroft-Latham damage criterion to predict material cracking in the drilling process. Drilling simulation software DEFORM-3D is used to approximate the bone temperature elevation corresponding to different drill bit geometries. To validate the simulation results, bone temperature elevations were evaluated by comparison with ex vivo bone-drilling process using bovine femurs. The computational results fit well with the ex vivo experiments with respect to different drill geometries. All the investigated drill bit geometries significantly affect bone temperature rise. It is discovered that the thermal osteonecrosis risk regions could be reduced with a point angle of 110° to 140°, a helix angle of 5° to 30° and a web thickness of 5% to 40%. The drilling simulation could accurately estimate the maximum bone temperature elevation for various surgical drill bit point angles, web thickness and helix angles.

A common theme from the scant literature is that family members have a strong need to know how and why their loved one died. The inquisitorial nature of inquests suggests potential in uncovering this information, although little is known about families' experiences with these proceedings. Interviews with 40 bereaved relatives explored their views and experiences of inquests. Findings suggest that families, often frustrated with other investigative processes, want inquests to provide a better understanding of how and why the death occurred, uncover any failings/responsibilities, and thereby move closer to a sense of justice being obtained for the deceased. Families identified problems perceived to impair the process and where improvements could be made to secure a more effective and meaningful institutional response to the fatality.","Examining the Complex Relation Among Religion, Morality, and Death Anxiety: Religion Can Be a Source of Comfort and Concern Regarding Fears of Death.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572785,Omega,2018 12 21,"This study examined the relationship among religiosity, morality, and fear of death.

Frequency of immoral behavior was not related to fears of death, but both strength of religious views and behavior efficacy were negatively correlated with fears of death. In contrast, perceived failure to live up to religious standards was associated with more death anxiety, especially among those with punishing views of God. These findings support the idea that some aspects of religion can help protect people from death anxiety, whereas other aspects of religion can exacerbate fears of death."

Non-hematopoietic cells with aneuploid chromosome 8 (more than 2 copies) were regarded as positive CTCs. The results showed that none of CTCs was found in all 30 healthy samples. The overall positive rate of CTCs was 89.0% in diagnosed cancer patients (ranging from 75.0% to 100.0%). Average number of 11, 5, 8 and 4 CTCs per 7.5 mL was observed in lung cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer and colorectal cancer, respectively.

Epidemiological reports increasingly demonstrate that exposure to the particulate matter (PM) fraction of air pollution during neurodevelopment is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). These observations are supported by animal studies demonstrating prenatal exposure to concentrated ambient PM induces neuropathologies characteristic of ASD, including ventriculomegaly and aberrant corpus callosum (CC) myelination. Given the role of the CC and cerebellum in ASD etiology, this study tested whether prenatal exposure to concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) produced pathological features in offspring CC and cerebella consistent with ASD. Analysis of cerebellar myelin density revealed male-specific hypermyelination in CAPs-exposed offspring at postnatal days (PNDs) 11-15 without alteration of cerebellar area. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) revealed elevated iron (Fe) in the cerebellum of CAPs-exposed female offspring at PNDs 11-15, which connects with previously observed elevated Fe in the female CC. The presence of Fe inclusions, along with aluminum (Al) and silicon (Si) inclusions, were confirmed at nanoscale resolution in the CC along with ultrastructural myelin sheath damage. Furthermore, RNAseq and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed cerebellar gene expression was significantly affected by sex and prenatal CAPs exposure with significant enrichment in inflammation and transmembrane transport processes that could underlie observed myelin and metal pathologies.

Because wall tension increases with vessel diameter (Law of Laplace), this study tested the hypothesis that elevated tension led to the reduction of miR-133a in the TA . Methods and Results Elevated tension (1.5 g; 150 mm Hg) applied to murine TA ex vivo reduced miR-133a tissue abundance compared with TA held at normotension (0.7 g; 70 mm Hg). Cellular miR-133a levels were reduced with biaxial stretch of isolated murine TA fibroblasts, whereas smooth muscle cells were not affected. Mechanisms contributing to the loss of miR-133a abundance were further investigated in TA fibroblasts. Biaxial stretch did not reduce primary miR-133a transcription and had no effect on the expression/abundance of 3 micro RNA -specific exoribonucleases. Remarkably, biaxial stretch increased exosome secretion, and exosomes isolated from TA fibroblasts contained more miR-133a. Inhibition of exosome secretion prevented the biaxial stretch-induced reduction of miR-133a. Subsequently, 2 in vivo models of hypertension were used to determine the effect of elevated wall tension on miR-133a abundance in the TA : wild-type mice with osmotic pump-mediated angiotensin II infusion and angiotensin II -independent spontaneously hypertensive mice. Interestingly, the abundance of miR-133a was decreased in TA tissue and increased in the plasma in both models of hypertension compared with a normotensive control group.

The overexpression of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 protein with internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation protein was related to the poor prognosis and disease progression of leukemia. In this study, the cytotoxicity and inhibitory effect of curcumin on cell cycle of FLT3-ITD overexpressing MV4-11 leukemic cells were evaluated. Moreover, curcumin polymeric micelles conjugated with FLT3-specific peptide (FLT3-Cur-micelles) were prepared using a film hydration method to increase curcumin solubility and the inhibitory effect on MV4-11 cells was evaluated. Cytotoxicity and cell cycle analysis were performed using an MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Physical properties of FLT3-Cur-micelles, including particle size, size distribution, morphology, and entrapment efficiency (EE), were evaluated. Cellular uptake of the micelles on MV4-11 cells was determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. FLT3-Cur-micelles were observed with size less than 50 nm and high EE of >75%. In addition, FLT3-Cur-micelles demonstrated excellent internalization and increased curcumin accumulation in leukemic cells when compared to free curcumin. Furthermore, FLT3-Cur-micelles exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect on MV4-11 cells with IC50 value of 1.1 µM, whereas the blank micelles showed no effect. Furthermore, FLT3-Cur-micelles showed no significant effect on normal human PBMCs with IC50 value >25 µM. In summary, FLT3-Cur-micelles are a promising nanocarrier system for enhancing anti-leukemic activity of curcumin and suitable for further preclinical studies.",Cannabis for cancer - illusion or the tip of an iceberg: a review of the evidence for the use of Cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids in oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572744,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,2019 03 11,"A flowering plant of variegated ingredients and psychoactive qualities, Cannabis has long been used for medicinal and recreational purposes.

Cannabinoids are classified according to natural and synthetic subtypes and their mechanisms of action expounded. The variability of available products is discussed in the clinical context and data regarding chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, cancer-related pain, anorexia, insomnia, and anxiety are presented. Moreover, immunological and antineoplastic effects in preclinical and clinical trials are addressed. Concepts such as synergism or opposition with conventional treatment modalities, the sequence of administration and dosage, molecular cross-talk and malignancy-cannabinoid congruence, are explored. Finally, side-effects, limitations in trial design and legislation barriers are related.

Existing screening questionnaires focus predominately on neuropathic mechanisms without consideration of nociceptive mechanisms or mixed pain states. This study aimed to develop a new questionnaire, painPREDICT, using a wide set of patient-reported descriptors potentially associated with neuropathic and nociceptive pain mechanisms, and to explore sensory symptom patterns. Methods: PainPREDICT was constructed based on exploratory (n = 27 patients) and cognitive debriefing interviews (n = 49 patients and nine physicians), across five NeP conditions. The pilot questionnaire was then administered in a non-interventional, cross-sectional, multi-center study to 840 pain patients across the US and Germany. The identification of a sensory symptom pattern was based on hybrid clustering resulting from items standardization followed by principal component analysis. Results: The final questionnaire included 20 items covering: pain intensity, location of pain, course of pain, and sensory symptoms. Most patients participating in the cross-sectional study suffered either from painful diabetic polyneuropathy (n = 330) or radiculopathy (n = 349), fewer from central pain (n = 61) or other types of NeP (n = 100). The hybrid clustering of the new questionnaire data identified three different characteristic sensory symptom profiles in patients with NeP: ""Irritable nociceptors"", ""deafferentation pain"", and ""pain attacks with nociceptive component"". Although some differences in the distribution of the sensory profiles were found, all profiles were represented in all NeP etiology groups. Conclusions: This study set the ground of painPREDICT and showed promising results for its use to categorize patients according to sensory symptom patterns.",Combining stem cell-derived hepatocytes with impedance sensing to better predict human drug toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572740,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,2018 12 21,"The liver plays a central role in human drug metabolism.

CS is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, skeletal and psychological dysfunctions and can be fatal if left untreated. The first-line treatment for all forms of CS is a surgery. However, medical therapy has to be chosen if surgical resection is not an option or is deemed ineffective. Currently available therapeutics are either not selective and have side effects or are only available as an injection (pasireotide). Areas covered: The authors discuss the recent drug developments for the medical treatment of CS through two validated molecular targets. Specifically, the authors look at selective inhibitors of CYP11B1 that reduce cortisol production by inhibiting steroid 11beta-hydroxylase and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists that interrupt cortisol-mediating transcriptional regulation of related genes. Expert opinion: Patients with CS have limited treatment options; indeed, there is an unmet need for new compounds that target CYP11B1 selectively versus several steroidogenic enzymes and/or GR-signaling pathways. The complexity of steroid biosynthesis and signaling requires the application of structure-based drug discovery techniques that use molecular targets and highly similar off-targets. Significant differences in steroidogenesis between humans and other species necessitates caution over the choice of in vivo model for the preclinical evaluation of future potential compounds.",The prevalence of urinary incontinence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572737,Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,2019 04 29,"The reported prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) among women varies widely in different studies due to the use of different definitions, the heterogenicity of different study populations, and population sampling procedures. Population studies from numerous countries have reported that the prevalence of UI ranged from approximately 5% to 70%, with most studies reporting a prevalence of any UI in the range of 25-45%. Prevalence figures increase with increasing age, and in women aged ≥70 years more than 40% of the female population is affected. Prevalence rates are even higher in the elderly-elderly and amongst nursing home patients. There are only a few studies describing progression as well as remission of UI in the general population as well as in selected groups of the population. The mean annual incidence of UI has been reported to range from 1% to 9%, while estimates of remission are more varying, from 4% to 30%.

When surgery is not an option, treatment involves administration of targeted therapies. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway has been identified as an important mediator for the development of RCC. Numerous agents target VEGF-mediated signaling, yet resistance and progressive disease still persists. Novel small molecule VEGF inhibitors with high affinity for the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) have been discovered and are currently under investigation for the management of RCC. Areas covered: The VEGFR pathway, its aberrant signaling, and the agents under development that inhibit VEGFR signaling are discussed. The mechanism(s), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and toxicity of these investigational agents are also reviewed. Expert opinion: Management of metastatic RCC involves combination immunotherapy or administration of oral VEGFR inhibitors and largely depends on risk stratification. Emerging and investigational oral VEGFR inhibitors, given as monotherapy or in combination with immunotherapy, could augment current treatment approaches and may mitigate toxicities associated with VEGFR inhibition."

Dairy products may contain components other than calcium and fat, such as insulin-like growth factor-1, that may affect CRC risk. In the prospective Iowa Women's Health Study, calcium, dairy product, and vitamin D intakes were assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. To investigate dairy products independent of their calcium components, we estimated residuals from linear regression models of their associations with dietary calcium. Of the 35,221 55-69-year-old cancer-free women at baseline in 1986, 1,731 developed CRC during follow-up through 2012. For those in the highest relative to the lowest intake quintiles, the adjusted hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals from multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models for overall and distal CRC were 0.81 (0.67-0.98; Ptrend = 0.004) and 0.59 (0.44-0.80; Ptrend = 0.003), respectively, for total calcium; and 0.79 (0.66-0.94; Ptrend = 0.01) and 0.69 (0.53-0.90; Ptrend = 0.003) for total dairy products, respectively. The various dairy product residuals were not associated with CRC. These results support that, among women, calcium and dairy products may be inversely associated with CRC-perhaps primarily distal CRC-but suggest that the non-calcium, non-fat component of dairy products may not be associated with CRC.","Differential expressions of SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with type 2 diabetic retinopathy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572719,Archives of physiology and biochemistry,2018 12 21,"This study investigated the mRNA and protein levels of SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT4 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from type 2 diabetes patients with retinopathy (diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients) (n = 86) and those without retinopathy (n = 103).

This descriptive study aimed to assess UP among Tunisian UHDs. UHDs were recruited via electronic mails sent to all the Tunisian UHDs through the national health networks and by convenience sampling via a questionnaire provided directly to some UHDs. The French survey, available from the Laval University website, includes 11 questions related to UP, with three-choice answers (yes/no/may be). One point was awarded for each correct answer. A total score lower than six corresponded to a low level of UP. 96 UHDs (69 females) responded to the survey either through emails (39.6%) or by filled in the paper (60.4%). The mean ±SD (95% confidence interval) score of UP was considered low at 5.4 ± 1.9 (5.0 to 5.8); 74% of the participants had a low UP. The UP score was significantly different between the categories of assistants and professors. Data comparison between subjective and objective assessments revealed that significant percentages of UHDs underestimated their low UP. This was more marked in the professors' category. There was no significant correlation between the UP total score and the UHDs' age or professional experience. To conclude, plagiarism is not well-known to North African UHDs.

Using a fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas) oligonucleotide microarray, we compared altered transcripts in the liver and whole blood after exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and a mixture of seven types of perfluoro alkyl substances (PFAS), including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). We used quantitative polymerase chain reactions and cell-based assays to confirm the main effects and found that blood responded with a greater number of altered genes than the liver. The exposure to PFAS altered similar genes with central roles in a cellular pathway in both tissues, including estrogen receptor α and peroxisome proliferator activator β and γ, indicating that the genes previously associated with PFAS exposure are differentially expressed in blood and liver. The altered transcripts are involved with cholesterol metabolism and mitochondrial function. Our data confirmed that PFAS are weak xenoestrogens and exert effects on DNA integrity. Gene expression profiling from blood samples not related with the immune system, including very-low-density lipoprotein, vitellogenin, estrogen receptor, and thyroid hormone receptor, demonstrated that blood is a useful tissue for assessing endocrine disruption in non-mammalian vertebrates. We conclude that the use of blood for non-lethal sampling in genomics studies is informative and particularly useful for assessing the effects of pollution in endangered species.

Moreover, microinfarcts are only partially detectable in hematoxylin-eosin-stained (H and E) 4-10 µm paraffin sections at routine neuropathological examination. In this short report, we provide two staining protocols for visualizing cortical microinfarcts in 100-300 µm sections. For low-power microscopy, the first protocol combines aldehyde fuchsine staining for detection of lipofuscin granules and macrophages with Darrow red counterstaining for Nissl material. The second protocol combines collagen IV immunohistochemistry with aldehyde fuchsine/Darrow red or with erythrosin-phosphotungstic acid-aniline blue staining for detailed study of the capillary network. In the first protocol, microinfarcts are recognizable as radially-oriented funnel-like accumulations of aldehyde fuchsine-positive macrophages. The second protocol recognizes microinfarcts and alterations of the capillary network, at whose center accumulations of dead neurons and aldehyde fuchsine-positive macrophages cluster. In addition, the second protocol permits visualization of abnormalities within the capillary network associated with more recent microinfarcts.

Bulinus truncatus is important in urinary schistosomiasis epidemiology in Africa. Hence, there is a need to define the snails' phylogeography. This study assessed the population genetic structure of B. truncatus from Giza and Sharkia (Egypt), Barakat (Sudan) and Madziwa, Shamva District (Zimbabwe) using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene (COI) and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) markers. COI was sequenced from 94 B. truncatus samples including 38 (Egypt), 36 (Sudan) and 20 (Zimbabwe). However, only 51 ITS 1 sequences were identified from Egypt (28) and Sudan (23) (because of failure in either amplification or sequencing). The unique COI haplotypes of B. truncatus sequences observed were 6, 11, and 6 for Egypt, Sudan, and Zimbabwe, respectively. Also, 3 and 2 unique ITS 1 haplotypes were observed in sequences from Egypt and Sudan respectively. Mitochondrial DNA sequences from Sudan and Zimbabwe indicated high haplotype diversity with 0.768 and 0.784, respectively, while relatively low haplotype diversity was also observed for sequences from Egypt (0.334). The location of populations from Egypt and Sudan on the B. truncatus clade agrees with the location of both countries geographically. The clustering of the Zimbabwe sequences on different locations on the clade can be attributed to individuals with different genotypes within the population. No significant variation was observed within B. truncatus populations from Egypt and Sudan as indicated by the ITS 1 tree. This study investigated the genetic diversity of B. truncatus from Giza and Sharkia (Egypt), Barakat area (Sudan), and Madziwa (Zimbabwe), which is necessary for snail host surveillance in the study areas and also provided genomic data of this important snail species from the sampled countries.",Advances in the Synthesis of Lignan Natural Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572693,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Lignans comprise a family of secondary metabolites existing widely in plants and also in human food sources. As important components, these compounds play remarkable roles in plants' ecological functions as protection against herbivores and microorganisms. Meanwhile, foods rich in lignans have revealed potential to decrease of risk of cancers. To date, a number of promising bioactivities have been found for lignan natural products and their unnatural analogues, including antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, antiplatelet, phosphodiesterase inhibition, 5-lipoxygenase inhibition, HIV reverse transcription inhibition, cytotoxic activities, antioxidant activities, immunosuppressive activities and antiasthmatic activities. Therefore, the synthesis of this family and also their analogues have attracted widespread interest from the synthetic organic chemistry community.

The major issue in the retrofitting of concrete structures with FRP is the accurate evaluation of flexural and shear strains of polymer composites at the bonding interface of epoxy and concrete. To address it, a comprehensive experimental study was planned and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite was applied on the concrete surface with the help of adhesives. CFRP was used as an external mounted flexural and shear reinforcement to strengthen the beams. Flexural load tests were performed on a group of eight reinforced concrete beams. These beams were strengthened in flexural and shear by different reinforcement ratios of CFRP. The strain gauges were applied on the surface of concrete and CFRP strips to assess the strain of both CFRP and concrete under flexural and shear stresses. The resulting test data is presented in the form of load⁻deformation and strain values. It was found that the values of strains transferred to the FRP through the concrete are highly dependent on the surface tensile properties of concrete and debonding strength of the adhesive. The test results clearly indicated that the strength increment in flexural members is highly dependent on strain values of the CFRP.",Detection of RINEX-2 Files With Mixed GPS L2P(Y)/L2C Carrier Phase Observations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572691,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 07,"Presently, the global positioning system (GPS) satellite constellation consists of 40% older Block IIA and IIR space vehicles and 60% newer IIR-M and IIF satellites. Only newer GPS satellites are capable of transmitting the L2C signal which is in quadrature to the legacy L2P(Y) signal being broadcast by all satellites. The data format RINEX-2 is not prepared to contain carrier phase observations of both L2 signals, but should contain either one or the other. If a mix of unaligned L2P(Y) and L2C carrier phase observations are stored in a RINEX-2 file, the quarter cycle bias causes the file to be defective and not usable for precise positioning purposes. Algorithms that detect such files are presented in this study. They are mainly based on the analysis of widelane fractional ambiguities and were applied to RINEX-2 files of 2624 reference stations. Seventy-two station files (2.7%) were found to be defective since they contained mixed and unaligned L2P(Y) and L2C carrier phase observations. If such files are used for precise positioning with ambiguities being fixed to integer values, resulting coordinate errors in long baselines can reach centimeter levels. Unaligned L2 observations often prevent ambiguity fixing, especially in short baselines.",Engineering RNA Virus Interference via the CRISPR/Cas13 Machinery in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572690,Viruses,2019 04 15,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems are key immune mechanisms helping prokaryotic species fend off RNA and DNA viruses. CRISPR/Cas9 has broad applications in basic research and biotechnology and has been widely used across eukaryotic species for genome engineering and functional analysis of genes. The recently developed CRISPR/Cas13 systems target RNA rather than DNA and thus offer new potential for transcriptome engineering and combatting RNA viruses. Here, we used CRISPR/LshCas13a to stably engineer Arabidopsis thaliana for interference against the RNA genome of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Our data demonstrate that CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) guiding Cas13a to the sequences encoding helper component proteinase silencing suppressor (HC-Pro) or GFP target 2 (GFP-T2) provide better interference compared to crRNAs targeting other regions of the TuMV RNA genome. This work demonstrates the exciting potential of CRISPR/Cas13 to be used as an antiviral strategy to obstruct RNA viruses, and encourages the search for more robust and effective Cas13 variants or CRISPR systems that can target RNA."

However, the traditional STPAP beamforming algorithm, which requires a separate adaptive filter for each GNSS satellite, will make the process computationally intensive as there are multiple GNSS satellites in the field of view (FOV). In order to overcome the shortcoming, a novel STPAP beamforming algorithm based on the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) criterion is proposed. Compared with the traditional STPAP beamforming algorithm, the proposed STPAP beamforming algorithm can process multiple GNSS satellites at once using only one adaptive filter, which will greatly reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed algorithm will not lead to a sharp deterioration in the output carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N₀) performance if the number of GNSS satellites processed in the same adaptive filter is proper. Furthermore, to calculate weight vector iteratively, an adaptive algorithm based on the constrained least mean square (CLMS) method is derived for the proposed STPAP beamforming algorithm. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm is effective in mitigating interferences for GNSS receivers in the joint space⁻time-polarization domain and meanwhile has lower computational complexity when maintaining the output C/N₀ performance close to that of the traditional STPAP algorithm.",A Long Time-Series Radiometric Normalization Method for Landsat Images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572678,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 08,"Radiometric normalization attempts to normalize the radiomimetic distortion caused by non-land surface-related factors, for example, different atmospheric conditions at image acquisition time and sensor factors, and to improve the radiometric consistency between remote sensing images. Using a remote sensing image and a reference image as a pair is a traditional method of performing radiometric normalization. However, when applied to the radiometric normalization of long time-series of images, this method has two deficiencies: first, different pseudo-invariant features (PIFs)-radiometric characteristics of which do not change with time-are extracted in different pairs of images; and second, when processing an image based on a reference, we can minimize the residual between them, but the residual between temporally adjacent images may induce steep increases and decreases, which may conceal the information contained in the time-series indicators, such as vegetative index. To overcome these two problems, we propose an optimization strategy for radiometric normalization of long time-series of remote sensing images. First, the time-series gray-scale values for a pixel in the near-infrared band are sorted in ascending order and segmented into different parts. Second, the outliers and inliers of the time-series observation are determined using a modified Inflexion Based Cloud Detection (IBCD) method. Third, the variation amplitudes of the PIFs are smaller than for vegetation but larger than for water, and accordingly the PIFs are identified. Last, a novel optimization strategy aimed at minimizing the correction residual between the image to be processed and the images processed previously is adopted to determine the radiometric normalization sequence. Time-series images from the Thematic Mapper onboard Landsat 5 for Hangzhou City are selected for the experiments, and the results suggest that our method can effectively eliminate the radiometric distortion and preserve the variation of vegetation in the time-series of images. Smoother time-series profiles of gray-scale values and uniform root mean square error distributions can be obtained compared with those of the traditional method, which indicates that our method can obtain better radiometric consistency and normalization performance.",Effect of Effluent Recirculation on Biogas Production Using Two-stage Anaerobic Digestion of Citrus Waste.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572677,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Citrus waste is a promising potential feedstock for anaerobic digestion, yet the presence of inhibitors such as d-limonene is known to limit the process. Effluent recirculation has been proven to increase methane yield in a semi-continuous process for recalcitrant material, but it has never been applied to toxic materials. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of recirculation on biogas production from citrus waste as toxic feedstock in two-stage anaerobic digestion. The first digestion was carried out in a stirred tank reactor (STR). The effluent from the first-stage was filtered using a rotary drum filter to separate the solid and the liquid phase. The solid phase, rich in hydrophobic D-limonene, was discarded, and the liquid phase containing less D-limonene was fed into the second digester in an up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor. A high organic loading rate (OLR 5 g VS/(L·day)) of citrus waste was fed into the first-stage reactor every day. The effluent of the first-stage was then fed into the second-stage reactor. This experiment was run for 120 days. A reactor configuration without recirculation was used as control. The result shows that the reactor with effluent recirculation produced a higher methane yield (160⁻203 NmL/g·VS) compared to that without recirculation (66⁻113 NmL/g·VS). More stable performance was also observed in the reactor with recirculation as shown by the pH of 5⁻6, while without recirculation the pH dropped to the range of 3.7⁻4.7. The VS reduction for the reactor with recirculation was 33⁻35% higher than that of the control without recirculation. Recirculation might affect the hydrolysis-acidogenesis process by regulating pH in the first-stage and removing most of the D-limonene content from the substrate through filtration.",Construction of Novel Aspartokinase Mutant A380I and Its Characterization by Molecular Dynamics Simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572676,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"In this study, a novel monomer aspartokinase (AK) from Corynebacterium pekinense was identified, and its monomer model was constructed. Site 380 was identified by homologous sequencing and monomer model comparison as the key site which was conserved and located around the binding site of the inhibitor Lys. Furthermore, the mutant A380I with enzyme activity 11.32-fold higher than wild type AK (WT-AK), was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis and high throughput screening. In the mutant A380I, the optimal temperature was raised from 26 °C (WT-AK) to 28 °C, the optimal pH remained unchanged at 8.0, and the half-life was prolonged from 4.5 h (WT-AK) to 6.0 h, indicating enhanced thermal stability. The inhibition of A380I was weakened at various inhibitor concentrations and even activated at certain inhibitor concentrations (10 mM of Lys, 5 mM or 10 mM of Lys + Thr, 10 mM of Lys + Met, 5 mM of Lys + Thr + Met). Molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that the occupancy rate of hydrogen bond between A380I and ATP was enhanced, the effect of Lys (inhibitor) on the protein was weakened, and the angle between Ser281-Tyre358 and Asp359-Gly427 was increased after mutation, leading to an open conformation (R-state) that favored the binding of substrate.",Role of Autophagy in Proteostasis: Friend and Foe in Cardiac Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572675,Cells,2019 01 10,"Due to ageing of the population, the incidence of cardiovascular diseases will increase in the coming years, constituting a substantial burden on health care systems. In particular, atrial fibrillation (AF) is approaching epidemic proportions. It has been identified that the derailment of proteostasis, which is characterized by the loss of homeostasis in protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking, and clearance by protein degradation systems such as autophagy, underlies the development of common cardiac diseases. Among various safeguards within the proteostasis system, autophagy is a vital cellular process that modulates clearance of misfolded and proteotoxic proteins from cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, excessive autophagy may result in derailment of proteostasis and therefore cardiac dysfunction. Here, we review the interplay between autophagy and proteostasis in the healthy heart, discuss the imbalance between autophagy and proteostasis during cardiac diseases, including AF, and finally explore new druggable targets which may limit cardiac disease initiation and progression.",Hydrophobicity and Photocatalytic Activity of a Wood Surface Coated with a Fe3+-Doped SiO₂/TiO₂ Film.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572674,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 09,"A Fe3+-doped SiO₂/TiO₂ composite film (Fe3+-doped STCF) was prepared on a wood surface via a sol⁻gel method to improve its photocatalytic activity and hydrophobicity. The structure of the composite film was analyzed by Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The photocatalytic activity toward degradation of methyl orange and its hydrophobic nature were investigated. The results showed that the composite film was anatase TiO₂ crystal form, and the addition of Fe3+ ions and SiO₂ enhanced the diffraction peaks for the anatase crystal form. The photocatalytic activity of the wood coated with the composite film was enhanced. The highest degradation percentage was at 1 wt % Fe3+ (40.37%), and the degradation ability of the wood towards methyl orange solution was further improved under acidic conditions. In addition, the composite film was hydrophobic, and the hydrophobic property was enhanced as the immersion time in the sol increased. The wood surface coated with Fe3+-doped STCF exhibited strong hydrophobicity and photocatalytic activity, which could effectively prevent moisture from adhering to the surface and degrade organic pollutants; thus, the modified wood surface had good self-cleaning function.",Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Central Nervous System Myelination: A New Mechanism to Promote Myelin Plasticity and Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572673,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 01,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays vitally important roles in neural development and plasticity in both health and disease. Recent studies using mutant mice to selectively manipulate BDNF signalling in desired cell types, in combination with animal models of demyelinating disease, have demonstrated that BDNF not only potentiates normal central nervous system myelination in development but enhances recovery after myelin injury. However, the precise mechanisms by which BDNF enhances myelination in development and repair are unclear. Here, we review some of the recent progress made in understanding the influence BDNF exerts upon the myelinating process during development and after injury, and discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its effects. In doing so, we raise new questions for future research.",Benzophenone Derivatives from an Algal-Endophytic Isolate of Penicillium chrysogenum and Their Cytotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572672,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 20,"Chromatographic separation of a marine algal-derived endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum AD-1540, which was isolated from the inner tissue of the marine red alga Grateloupia turuturu, yielded two new benzophenone derivatives, chryxanthones A and B (compounds 1 and 2, respectively). Their structures were undoubtedly determined by comprehensive analysis of spectroscopic data (1D/2D NMR and HRESIMS). The relative and absolute configurations were assigned by analysis of the coupling constants and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of their electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra, respectively. Both compounds possessed an unusual dihydropyran ring (ring D) fused to an aromatic ring, rather than the commonly occurring prenyl moiety, and a plausible biosynthetic pathway was postulated. The cytotoxicities of compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated against six human cell lines, and both of the compounds demonstrated weak to moderate cytotoxicities with IC50 values ranging from 20.4 to 46.4 μM. These new compounds further demonstrate the potential of marine-derived fungi as an untapped source of pharmaceutical components with unique properties that could be developed as drug candidates.",Progression of Repair and Injury in Human Liver Slices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572671,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 01,"Human liver slice function was stressed by daily dosing of acetaminophen (APAP) or diclofenac (DCF) to investigate injury and repair. Initially, untreated human liver and kidney slices were evaluated with the global human U133A array to assess the extended culture conditions. Then, drug induced injury and signals of repair in human liver slices exposed to APAP or DCF (1 mM) were evaluated via specific gene expression arrays. In culture, the untreated human liver and kidney slices remained differentiated and gene expression indicated that repair pathways were activated in both tissues. Morphologically the human liver slices exhibited evidence of repair and regeneration, while kidney slices did not. APAP and DCF exposure caused a direct multi-factorial response. APAP and DCF induced gene expression changes in transporters, oxidative stress and mitochondria energy. DCF caused a greater effect on heat shock and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress gene expression. Concerning wound repair, APAP caused a mild repression of gene expression; DCF suppressed the expression of matrix collagen genes, the remodeling metalloproteases, cell adhesion integrins, indicating a greater hinderance to wound repair than APAP. Thus, human liver slices are a relevant model to investigate the mechanisms of drug-induced injury and repair.",A Wind Estimation Method with an Unmanned Rotorcraft for Environmental Monitoring Tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572670,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 08,"Wind velocity (strength and direction) is an important parameter for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based environmental monitoring tasks. A novel wind velocity estimation method is proposed for rotorcrafts. Based on an extended state observer, this method derives the wind disturbance from rotors' speeds and rotorcraft's acceleration and position. Then the wind disturbance is scaled to calculate the airspeed vector, which is substituted into a wind triangle to obtain the wind velocity. Easy-to-implement methods for calculating the rotorcraft's thrust and drag coefficient are also proposed, which are important parameters to obtain the wind drag and the airspeed, respectively. Simulations and experiments using a quadrotor in both hovering and flight conditions have validated the proposed method."
