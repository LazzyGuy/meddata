In the present study, we investigated the impact of task switching on subsequent memory performance. Participants had to switch between two semantic classification tasks. In Experiment 1, the stimuli were univalent; in Experiment 2, the stimuli were bivalent (relevant for both tasks). The aim was to disentangle the conflicts triggered by task switching and bivalency. In both experiments, recognition memory for switch and repeat stimuli was tested subsequently. During encoding, task switching produced switch costs. Critically, subsequent memory was lower for switch compared to repeat stimuli in both experiments, and this effect was increased in Experiment 2 with bivalent material. We suggest that the requirement to switch tasks hurts the encoding of task-relevant information and thus impairs subsequent memory performance.",Effect of Foreign Accent on Immediate Serial Recall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777508,Experimental psychology,2019 04 01,"This study disentangled factors contributing to impaired memory for foreign-accented words - misperception and disruption of encoding. When native English and Cantonese-accented words were presented auditorily for serial recall (Experiment 1), intrusion errors for accented words were higher across all serial positions (SPs). Participants made more intrusion errors during auditory presentation than visual and auditory presentation, and more errors for accented words than native words. Lengthening the interstimulus intervals in Experiment 2 reduced intrusion, repetition, order, and omission errors in the middle and late SPs during accented word recall, suggesting that extra time is required for identification and encoding of accented words into memory. Analyses of the intrusions showed that a majority of them were misperceptions and sounded similar to the stimulus words. These findings suggest that effortful perceptual processing of accented speech can induce perceptual difficulty and interfere with downstream memory processes by exhausting the shared pool of working memory.",Posture normalisation of 3D body scans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777506,Ergonomics,2019 05 28,"For product developers that design near-body products, virtual mannequins that represent realistic body shapes, are valuable tools. With statistical shape modelling, the variability of such body shapes can be described. Shape variation captured by statistical shape models (SSMs) is often polluted by posture variations, leading to less compact models. In this paper, we propose a framework that has low computational complexity to build a posture invariant SSM, by capturing and correcting the posture of an instance. The posture-normalised SSM is shown to be substantially more compact than the non-posture-normalised SSM. Practitioner summary: Statistical shape modelling is a technique to map out the variability of (body) shapes. This variability is often polluted by variations in posture. In this paper, we propose a framework to build a posture invariant statistical shape model.

Sarma.,HuR controls apoptosis and activation response without effects on cytokine 3' UTRs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777501,RNA biology,2019 06 16,"RNA binding proteins regulate gene expression through several post-transcriptional mechanisms. The broadly expressed HuR/ELAVL1 is important for proper function of multiple immune cell types, and has been proposed to regulate cytokine and other mRNA 3' UTRs upon activation. However, this mechanism has not been previously dissected in stable cellular settings. In this study, HuR demonstrated strong anti-apoptotic and activation roles in Jurkat T cells. Detailed transcriptomic analysis of HuR knockout cells revealed a substantial negative impact on the activation program, coordinately preventing the expression of immune response gene categories, including all cytokines. Knockout cells showed a significant defect in IL-2 production, which was rescued upon reintroduction of HuR. Interestingly, the mechanism of HuR regulation did not involve control of the cytokine 3' UTRs: HuR knockout did not affect the activity of 3' UTR reporters in 293 cells, and had no effect on IL-2 and TNF 3' UTRs in resting or activated Jurkats. Instead, impaired cytokine production corresponded with defective induction of the IL-2 promoter upon activation. Accordingly, upregulation of NFATC1 was also impaired, without 3' UTR effects. Together, these results indicate that HuR controls cytokine production through coordinated upstream pathways, and that additional mechanisms must be considered in investigating its function.",Celebratory firing leads to serious injuries - a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777500,The Medico-legal journal,2019 03 25,"Firearms are extensively used in shooting incidents, functions or for recreational purposes around the world. However, illegal modifications to a firearm can pose a major challenge to the forensic community, as their examination and subsequent individualisation are not always easy when compared to standard firearms due to the non-availability of standard comparison material and the damage caused to the firearm during test firing. We present a case report of unusual firing by an improvised firearm adapted to produce a loud noise during a marriage party. This led to high pressure inside the barrel, damaging the extractor assembly of the rifle and caused serious injuries to bystanders. An expert must be aware of all usual and unusual results of firings. In this case, an unusual method of firing two bullets shows the generation of high pressure inside the barrel causing the barrel and extractor assembly to break and act as secondary projectile. These cases need thorough investigation and careful observation to achieve positive outcomes.",Psychiatric hospitalization following antipsychotic medication cessation in first episode psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777499,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)",2019 03 21,"There are questions about the risk-benefit balance of longer-term antipsychotic medication treatment following first episode psychosis, especially in relation to relapse because of dopamine supersensitivity following treatment cessation.",Spatial heterogeneity of prion gene polymorphisms in an area recently infected by chronic wasting disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777498,Prion,2019 04 08,"Genetic variability in the prion protein (Prnp) gene influences host susceptibility to many pathogenic prion diseases. Understanding the distribution of susceptible Prnp variants and determining factors influencing spatial genetic patterns are important components of many chronic wasting disease mitigation strategies. Here, we describe Prnp variability in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States of America, an area with a recent history of infection and low disease incidence. This population is characterized by lower rates of polymorphism and significantly higher frequencies of the more susceptible 96GG genotype compared to previously surveyed populations. The prevalence of the most susceptible genotypes at disease-associated loci did vary among subregions, indicating that populations have innate differences in genotype-dictated susceptibility.",Regional deep hyperthermia: quantitative evaluation of predicted and direct measured temperature distributions in patients with high-risk extremity soft-tissue sarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777497,"International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",2019 03 13,Temperature distributions resulting from hyperthermia treatment of patients with high-risk soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) were quantitatively evaluated and globally compared with thermal simulations performed by a treatment planning system.

A multi-regional population-based study from Germany.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777496,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",2019 05 24,"Background: With improving prognosis, the ability to return to work after cancer has become a realistic goal but only little is known regarding details such as sustainability, financial consequences, and potential determinants of return to work in long-term survivors in Germany. Methods: We studied return to work in a population-based sample of 1558 long-term cancer survivors, diagnosed in 1994-2004 with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer before age 60 (mean 50.1). Information regarding employment status and financial difficulties was obtained via mailed questionnaires from patients who were identified by six population-based cancer registries in Germany. Cumulative incidence of return to work was determined by time-to-event analysis with consideration of competing events. Chi2 tests and multiple logistic regression modeling were employed to identify potential sociodemographic and clinical determinants of return to work. Results: Within a mean period since diagnosis of 8.3 years, 63% of all working-age cancer survivors initially returned to their old job and another 7% took up a new job. Seventeen percent were granted a disability pension, 6% were early retired (not cancer-related), 4% became unemployed, and 1% left the job market for other reasons. Resumption of work occurred within the first 2 years after diagnosis in 90% of all returnees. Cancer-related reduction of working hours was reported by 17% among all returnees and 6% quit their job due to cancer within 5 years past return to work. The probability of return to work was strongly related with age at diagnosis, tumor stage, education, and occupational class but did not differ with respect to the tumor site, gender nor marital status. Conclusions: Most long-term survivors after breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer of working-age are able to return to work. However, financial problems might arise due to a reduction in working hours. An additional provision of targeted interventions for high-risk groups should be discussed."

We retrospectively identified 229 consecutive patients (mean age‚Äâ=‚Äâ58.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ12.5 years; 160 women) with CTEPH and categorized them according to whether they had a PD (PD group; n‚Äâ=‚Äâ22, 9.7%) or not (non-PD group; n‚Äâ=‚Äâ207, 90.3%). We compared the clinical characteristics, respiratory function, hemodynamics, and clinical courses in the two groups.

The analyses comprise a subsample of n = 1817 adolescents and adults from 14 to 60 years within a representative German population-based study. Results indicate that 14 % of this sample uses avatars in online games, with significantly more males (22.6 %) than females (7.7 %) doing so. Persons with multiple ACEs (‚â• 4) have a higher OR of 2.05 (95 % CI: 1.418-2.956) to use avatars in online games. Regarding avatar preference, females are more likely to play supporters than males, and males are more likely to choose damagers and mixed-type avatars than females. Participants with an experience of parental divorce during their childhood reported higher preference of playing supporter or mixed-type avatars in comparison with damager avatars. Moreover, participants with mental illness or suicide in the family show a higher preference of mixed-type avatars compared to damager, but not to supporter avatars. Knowledge about the use of avatars can be an interesting source of information for supporting psychotherapeutic treatment in a young age group.",Computed tomography perfusion as a predictor of delayed cerebral ischemia and functional outcome in spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage: A single center experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777482,The neuroradiology journal,2019 06 10,Computed tomography (CT) perfusion has been studied as a tool to predict delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and clinical outcome in spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

La protects the 3' end of pol III transcribed RNA precursors, such as pre-tRNAs, through the use of a well-characterized UUU-3'OH binding mode. La proteins are also RNA chaperones, and La-dependent RNA chaperone activity is hypothesized to promote pre-tRNA maturation and translation at cellular and viral internal ribosome entry sites via binding sites distinct from those used for UUU-3'OH recognition. Since the publication of La-UUU-3'OH co-crystal structures, biochemical and genetic experiments have expanded our understanding of how La proteins use UUU-3'OH-independent binding modes to make sequence-independent contacts that can increase affinity for ligands and promote RNA remodeling. Other recent work has also expanded our understanding of how La binds mRNAs through contacts to the poly(A) tail. In this review, we focus on advances in the study of La protein-RNA complex surfaces beyond the description of the La-UUU-3'OH binding mode. We highlight recent advances in the functions of expected canonical nucleic acid interaction surfaces, a heightened appreciation of disordered C-terminal regions, and the nature of sequence-independent RNA determinants in La-RNA target binding. We further discuss how these RNA binding modes may have relevance to the function of the La-related proteins.",Optimization of laccase-alginate-chitosan-based matrix toward 17 Œ±-ethinylestradiol removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777480,Preparative biochemistry & biotechnology,2019 04 22,"Laccase extract (LE) from Pycnoporus sanguineus was immobilized on calcium and copper alginate-chitosan beads and applied for the removal of 17Œ±-ethinylestradiol (EE2). Effects of immobilization conditions such as: sodium alginate (SA) concentration; LE/SA ratio and chitosan/ion (Ca+2 or Cu+2) ratio on the immobilization yield were investigated. Immobilized LE on Ca-beads and Cu-beads was then used to degrade an EE2 solution. The optimal conditions for LE immobilization on Ca-beads were: 1.5% (w/v) SA, 1:5 (v/v) LE/SA and 3:7 (v/v) chitosan/ion (Ca+2). The optimal conditions for immobilization on Cu-beads were 2.0% (w/v) SA, 0.5:5 (v/v) LE/SA and 3:7 (v/v) chitosan/ion (Cu+2). The best result was obtained for immobilized LE on Ca-beads in buffer-absent medium. Furthermore, the immobilized enzyme was reused in five cycles for EE2 removal. The formation of EE2 dimers by LE treatment has been demonstrated by electrospray ionization coupled to time of flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF-MS). The results evidenced that immobilized LE in alginate-chitosan-divalent cation bead is an effective alternative for EE2 removal.",Cytokine-induced killer cells co-cultured with non-cell derived targeting peptide-loaded dendritic cells induce a specific antitumor response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777479,Cancer biology & therapy,2019 04 19,"Cancer is a severe lethal disease. Currently, immunotherapy has become an effective alternative therapeutic approach for cancers. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have a higher proliferation rate, increased efficacy with few side-effects, and non-MHC-restricted killing after co-culturing with dendritic cells (DCs). Therefore, it has been widely studied and applied in the treatment of cancers. In our study, we explored the antitumor effects of CIK cells co-culturing with DCs pulsed with non-cell derived targeting peptides, which could specifically bind to certain tumor cells. Our results indicated that targeting peptide-loaded DCs could enhance the differentiation and cytotoxicity of CIK cells. Moreover, CIK cells, which were treated with specific targeting peptide-loaded DCs, could effectively and specifically kill tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, as long as tumor cells were pre-coated with the specific binding peptides. In conclusion, targeting peptides could guide DC-CIK to effectively and specifically kill tumor cells which were pre-coated with these targeting peptides and non-cell derived targeting peptide-loaded-DC-CIK may work as a novel means for cancer therapy.",Osteoporosis and prostate cancer; a 24-month prospective observational study during androgen deprivation therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777478,Scandinavian journal of urology,2019 06 03,"Objective: To analyze the prevalence of osteoporosis during androgen deprivation therapy (A.D.T.). Background: Treatment and prognosis of prostate cancer necessitate management of long-term consequences of A.D.T., including accelerated bone loss resulting in osteoporosis; osteoporotic fractures are associated with excess morbidity and mortality. Patients and methods: Patients with prostate cancer awaiting initiation of A.D.T. were consecutively included from the daily clinic. They were followed every 6 months for 2 years. The study consisted of questionnaires, blood and urine samples and a D.X.A. scan every 6 months and yearly bone scintigraphy. A.D.T. was given as L.H.R.H. agonists, L.H.R.H. antagonists or orchiectomy. None of the patients had received prior A.D.T. or osteoporosis treatment. Results: A total of 105 individuals were included. The mean age was 70 years, median PSA level was 30.5 ¬µg/L and median Gleason score was 7. During the study, the prevalence of osteoporosis rose from 10% at inclusion to 22% after the 2 years of follow-up and the prevalence of normal bone mineral density (B.M.D.) decreased from 32% to 8%. Osteoporotic fractures were prevalent; six patients had a clinical vertebral fracture and two patients had a hip fracture. One patient died after his hip fracture. Conclusion: After 2 years of A.D.T. the vast majority of prostate cancer patients will have osteoporosis or osteopenia. A rigorous observation strategy did not appear to prevent osteoporotic fractures. A new strategy to reduce A.D.T. induced osteoporotic fractures is mandatory.",Abnormal expression of estrogen receptor is associated with thin endometrium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777477,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 05 13,"This study was conducted to investigate the association of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expressions with thin endometrium.

The expressions of ER and PR were detected with semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, and the differences were compared between the two groups. The expression of ER was significantly decreased (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ.05) in the stromal cells of thin endometrium during both proliferative and secretory phases as compared to those of normal endometrium. Likewise, ER expression was found to be lower in the glandular cells of thin endometrium than those of normal endometrium during proliferative phase. However, no significant differences were observed for the expression of PR in both glandular and stromal cells between the two groups. Thin endometrium was associated with reduced expression of ER in stromal cells both during proliferative and secretory phase, but in glandular epithelial cells only during proliferative phase.",Consensus-Building efforts to identify best tools for screening and assessment for supportive services in oncology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777476,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 02 19,To build consensus around an optimal patient-reported outcome measure of cancer symptoms and patient needs to facilitate patient-provider communication and trigger referrals to supportive services.,Aberrant regulation favours matriptase proteolysis in neoplastic B-cells that co-express HAI-2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777474,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,2019 03 01,"Matriptase is ectopically expressed in neoplastic B-cells, in which matriptase activity is enhanced by negligible expression of its endogenous inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor (HAI)-1. HAI-1, however, is also involved in matriptase synthesis and intracellular trafficking. The lack of HAI-1 indicates that other related inhibitor, such as HAI-2, might be expressed. Here, we show that HAI-2 is commonly co-expressed in matriptase-expressing neoplastic B-cells. The level of active matriptase shed after induction of matriptase zymogen activation in 7 different neoplastic B-cells was next determined and characterised. Our data reveal that active matriptase can only be generated and shed by those cells able to activate matriptase and in a rough correlation with the levels of matriptase protein. While HAI-2 can potently inhibit matriptase, the levels of active matriptase are not proportionally suppressed in those cells with high HAI-2. Our survey suggests that matriptase proteolysis might aberrantly remain high in neoplastic B-cells regardless of the levels of HAI-2."

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of applying a novel method, using either 400 or 500¬†g fat/kg (treatments FL40 and FL50, respectively), which was enriched in PA and SA at different ratios (100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100), on physical and chemical characteristics, ruminal degradability, solubility and in vitro intestinal protein digestibility (IVIPD) of the obtained products. Encapsulation of SBM in fat resulted in greater mean particle size and lower bulk density and protein solubility than unprotected SBM (USBM). Treatment FL50 resulted in increased (p <¬†0.01) rumen-undegraded protein (RUP) compared to USBM. There were no differences in RUP of SBM when different PA: SA ratios were used. The mean RUP content of treatments FL40 and FL50 (306 and 349¬†g/kg, respectively) was greater compared to USBM (262¬†g/kg, p <¬†0.05), but lower than that for a standard heat-treated SBM (431¬†g/kg). Values of IVIPD did not differ among SBM, heat-treated SBM and FL40 and FL50 samples, all being greater than 97.8%. In conclusion, encapsulation of SBM with fats enriched in PA and SA proved to be effective in reducing protein solubility and increasing RUP without depressing protein digestibility in the intestine. For validation of the method, in vivo research to investigate the effects of these products on the production of dairy cows is warranted.",Development of a three-dimensional body shape model of young children for child restraint design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777460,Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,2019 03 18,"The design of child restraints is guided in part by anthropometric data describing the distributions of body dimensions of children.

Results: The results showed that DNA methylation of SCD1 was inversely correlated with menopausal age (r‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.370, P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). In the rat study, the mRNA levels of SCD1 decreased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and those of DNMT3A (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) and DNMT3B increased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001) after ERT. Conclusion: Methylation levels of SCD1 were significantly associated with menopausal age. DNMT3A and DNMT3B may be involved in the methylation of SCD1.","Trichosordarin A, a norditerpene glycoside from the marine-derived fungus Trichoderma harzianum R5.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777455,Natural product research,2019 02 19,"A new sordarin derivative, trichosordarin A (1), with a unique norditerpene aglycone was isolated from the culture of a marine-sediment-derived fungal strain, Trichoderma harzianum R5.

Evidence suggests that over the course of development, brain regions supporting cognitive-control functions become more integrated within their networks (i.e., have increased within-network connectivity), more separated from other networks, and, due to increased maturation along development, are more functionally connected between the networks. The focus of this study was to characterize the developmental trajectory of the CO and FP networks from early infancy (17 months) to 9 years of age in typically developing children while listening to stories, using functional connectivity analyses. Seventy-four children underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging session while listening to stories inside the scanner. Within- and between-network functional connectivity and graph theory measures were compared during development. Developmental increase in functional connectivity within the CO network and between the CO and FP networks, as well as global efficiency of the CO network from 17 months to 9 years of age, was observed. These findings highlight the involvement of the CO and FP networks in story listening from early infancy, which increases along development. Future studies examining failures in language acquisition to further explore the role of these networks in story listening are warranted.",Clinical EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) Improves Multiple Physiological Markers of Health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777453,Journal of evidence-based integrative medicine,2019 04 08,"Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is an evidence-based self-help therapeutic method and over 100 studies demonstrate its efficacy. However, information about the physiological effects of EFT is limited. The current study sought to elucidate EFTs mechanisms of action across the central nervous system (CNS) by measuring heart rate variability (HRV) and heart coherence (HC); the circulatory system using resting heart rate (RHR) and blood pressure (BP); the endocrine system using cortisol, and the immune system using salivary immunoglobulin A (SigA). The second aim was to measure psychological symptoms. Participants (N = 203) were enrolled in a 4-day training workshop held in different locations. At one workshop (n = 31), participants also received comprehensive physiological testing. Posttest, significant declines were found in anxiety (-40%), depression (-35%), posttraumatic stress disorder (-32%), pain (-57%), and cravings (-74%), all P < .000. Happiness increased (+31%, P = .000) as did SigA (+113%, P = .017). Significant improvements were found in RHR (-8%, P = .001), cortisol (-37%, P < .000), systolic BP (-6%, P = .001), and diastolic BP (-8%, P < .000). Positive trends were observed for HRV and HC and gains were maintained on follow-up, indicating EFT results in positive health effects as well as increased mental well-being.",Host specificity of avian metapneumoviruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777452,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,2019 03 22,"To date, four subgroups of avian metapneumoviruses have been defined (AMPV-A, B, C and D) based on genetic and antigenic differences. The extent of infection in the three principal species (turkeys, chickens and ducks) by these subgroups is, however, not well defined. Here, a series of controlled and ethically approved experimental infections were performed in specific pathogen-free turkeys, chickens and ducks with each of the four AMPV subgroups. For subgroup C, one strain isolated from turkeys in the USA (turkey AMPV-C) and one isolated from ducks in France (duck AMPV-C) were compared. Globally, these extensive experimental trials demonstrated that AMPV-A, B, turkey C and D were well adapted to Galliformes, especially turkeys; however, chickens showed limited clinical signs and differences in seroconversion and transmission. Notably, chickens did not transmit AMPV-A to contacts and were shown for the first time to be susceptible to AMPV-D. The duck AMPV-C was well adapted to ducks; however, chickens and turkeys seroconverted and were positive by virus isolation. In addition, seroconversion of contact turkeys to duck AMPV-C demonstrated horizontal transmission of this virus in a non-palmiped species under our experimental conditions. Interestingly, in chickens and turkeys, duck AMPV-C isolation was possible despite a lack of detection of viral RNA. Likewise, the turkey AMPV-C virus was well adapted to turkeys yet was also isolated from chickens despite a lack of detection of viral RNA. These results would suggest a selection for viral genetic sequences that differ from the original strain upon adaptation to a 'non-conventional host'.","Syringic acid (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid) inhibits adipogenesis and promotes lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777451,Natural product research,2019 02 19,"Increase in adiposity is associated with obesity and obesity-related complications. Syringic acid (SA), a phenolic acid facilitates oxidation, polymerization, and condensation reactions, may function as an effective anti-adipogenic agent. This study examined whether SA inhibits adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by inhibiting differentiation and controlling lipid accumulation. Ten days of SA treatment suppressed differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte to mature adipocytes in a concentration-dependent manner as determined by Oil Red O staining. Suppression of adipogenic differentiation by SA was primarily from inhibition of mitotic clonal expansion during the early stages of differentiation. Treatment of adipocytes with SA reduced triglyceride production (lipogenesis) and increased glycerol release (lipolysis). The addition of SA to the adipocytes attenuated in vitro ROS production. These results indicate that SA inhibits the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, reduces lipid accumulation, and attenuates ROS accumulation, suggesting for the first time that SA has an anti-obesity effect in vitro.",Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopic (LIBS) Analysis of Trace Heavy Metals Enriched by Al2O3 Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777450,Applied spectroscopy,2019 04 12,"We demonstrated a unique method for the detection of heavy metals, such as Ni, Cr, and Cd, at trace level in aqueous solutions by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) enriched by aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanoparticles (NP) adsorption.

Resident microbiota are capable of influencing AHR-dependent signaling pathways via production of an array of bioactive molecules that act as AHR agonists, such as indole or indole-3-aldehyde. Bacteria produce a number of quinoline derivatives, of which some function as quorum-sensing molecules. Thus, we screened relevant hydroxyquinoline derivatives for AHR activity using AHR responsive reporter cell lines. 2,8-Dihydroxyquinoline (2,8-DHQ) was identified as a species-specific AHR agonist that exhibits full AHR agonist activity in human cell lines, but only induces modest AHR activity in mouse cells. Additional dihydroxylated quinolines tested failed to activate the human AHR. Nanomolar concentrations of 2,8-DHQ significantly induced CYP1A1 expression and, upon cotreatment with cytokines, synergistically induced IL6 expression. Ligand binding competition studies subsequently confirmed 2,8-DHQ to be a human AHR ligand. Several dihydroxyquinolines were detected in human fecal samples, with concentrations of 2,8-DHQ ranging between 0 and 3.4 pmol/mg feces. Additionally, in mice the microbiota was necessary for the presence of DHQ in cecal contents. These results suggest that microbiota-derived 2,8-DHQ would contribute to AHR activation in the human gut, and thus participate in the protective and homeostatic effects observed with gastrointestinal AHR activation.",Too Short-Lived or Not Existing Species: N-Azidoamines Reinvestigated.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777438,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,"Treatment of N-chlorodimethylamine with sodium azide in dichloromethane does not lead to N-azidodimethylamine, as thought for more than 50 years.

The reaction of lithium dibenzylhydrazide with tosyl azide does not result in the creation of an N-azidoamine, which can be detected by IR spectroscopy at ambient temperature, as it was claimed previously. Additional experiments with diazo group transfer to lithium hydrazides show that intermediate N-azidoamines are very short-lived or their formation is bypassed by direct generation of 1,1-diazenes via synchronous cleavage of two N-N bonds.",A Tautomeric Œª3/Œª5-Phosphane Pair and Its Ambiphilic Reactivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777436,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"The central phosphorus atom of a novel hydroxyl-functionalized triarylphosphane was shown to reversibly insert into one of the molecule's O-H bonds, which forms the basis for a tautomeric Œª3/Œª5-phosphane equilibrium.

On the basis of reactivity studies, a nucleophilic character was assigned to the minor species present in solution, the Œª3-phosphane. Upon methylation, for example, the Œª3-form was selectively removed from the equilibrium and converted to the corresponding phosphonium salt. However, upon generation of an alkoxide via proton abstraction, the electrophilic character of the Œª5-phosphane in the equilibrium became evident since the alkoxide was found to attack the molecule's phosphorus atom.

This work aimed at expanding the knowledge on the Cognac WD aroma by a sensory-guided approach, involving a fractional-distillation technique and gas chromatography coupled to olfactometry and mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS). In doing so, a fruity-odor zone was highlighted in WD extracts that was attributed to the diethyl acetal family. Ten additional diethyl acetals were detected by GC-MS. Next, an assay method was developed and validated for seven of these diethyl acetals. Their detection thresholds were evaluated in a model solution of water/ethanol (60:40, v/v). 1,1-Diethoxy-3-methylbutane was shown to present a significant organoleptic impact because its olfactory-detection threshold (323 Œºg/L) is lower than its range of concentrations in WD (461 to 3337 Œºg/L).

This approach is then applied in 2D using the Canny algorithm to experimental images of two model substrates and a biological sample. This approach circumvents the need for aligning the imaged region between separate microscopy techniques, reveals hidden details embedded in SECM images, and allows individual features to be separated from their background more effectively.",An Aptamer-Based Near-Infrared Fluorescence Nanoprobe for Detecting and Imaging of Phospholamban Micropeptide in Cardiomyocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777430,ACS sensors,2019 03 22,"A growing body of evidence indicates that micropeptides encoded by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) act independently or as regulators of larger proteins in fundamental biological processes, especially in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. However, due to their small size and low intracellular expression, visual monitoring of micropeptides in living cells is still a challenge. In this work, we have designed and synthesized an aptamer-based near-infrared fluorescence nanoprobe for fluorescence imaging of phospholamban (PLN), which is an intracellular micropeptide that affects calcium homeostasis, and is closely associated with human heart failure in the clinic. The nanoprobe could respond specifically to PLN with excellent selectivity, high sensitivity, good nuclease stability, and biocompatibility, and it was successfully applied for imaging of changes in PLN levels in cardiomyocytes and in frozen sections of heart tissues. Further combined with clinical myocardial biopsy, we believe that the developed nanoprobe should be of great significance in later molecular pathology study of heart failure, which may help with diagnosis of early heart failure in the future. More importantly, for the first time nanoprobes were applied to visually monitor the changes of micropeptides in living cells and in frozen tissue sections, and the design concept of the aptamer-based nanoprobe can be extended to fluorescence detection of other micropeptides.",Cyano-Substituted Head-to-Head Polythiophenes: Enabling High-Performance n-Type Organic Thin-Film Transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777429,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 18,"Polythiophenes, built on the electron-rich thiophene unit, typically possess high-lying energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) and show hole-transporting properties. In this study, we develop a series of n-type polythiophenes, P1-P3, based on head-to-head-linked 3,3'-dialkoxy-4,4'-dicyano-2,2'-bithiophene (BTCNOR) with distinct side chains. The BTCNOR unit shows not only highly planar backbone conformation enabled by the intramolecular noncovalent sulfur-oxygen interaction but also significantly suppressed LUMO level attributed to the cyano-substitution. Hence, all BTCNOR-based polymer semiconductors exhibit low-lying LUMO levels, which are ‚àº1.0 eV lower than that of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT), a benchmark p-type polymer semiconductor. Consequently, all of the three polymers can enable unipolar n-type transport characteristics in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) with low off-currents ( Ioffs) of 10-10-10-11 A and large current on/off ratios ( Ion/ Ioffs) at the level of 106. Among them, polymer P2 with a 2-ethylhexyl side chain offers the highest film ordering, leading to the best device performance with an excellent electron mobility (Œºe) of 0.31 cm2 V-1 s-1 in off-center spin-cast OTFTs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of n-type polythiophenes with electron mobility comparable to the hole mobility of the benchmark p-type rr-P3HT and approaching the electron mobility of the most-studied n-type polymer, poly(naphthalene diimide- alt-bithiophene) (i.e., N2200). The change of charge carrier polarity from p-type (rr-P3HT) to n-type (P2) with comparable mobility demonstrates the obvious effectiveness of our structural modification. Adoption of n-hexadecyl (P1) and 2-butyloctyl (P3) side chains leads to reduced film ordering and results in 1-2 orders of magnitude lower Œºes, showing the critical role of side chains in optimizing device performance. This study demonstrates the unique structural features of head-to-head linkage containing BTCNOR for constructing high-performance n-type polymers, i.e., the alkoxy chain for backbone conformation locking and providing polymer solubility as well as the strong electron-withdrawing cyano group for lowering LUMO levels and enabling n-type performance.

Women experience frequent fluctuations of pro-thrombotic activity during their lifetime, related to menstrual cycles, the use of oral contraceptives, pregnancy, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy, all with potential impact on the clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. On the other hand, compared with men, women feature an increased risk of bleeding during hospitalization in the setting of acute coronary syndromes or percutaneous coronary interventions. At the same time, benefits of antithrombotic therapy may differ in women compared with men in several clinical settings and according to the type of antithrombotic agent used for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention, for the prevention of thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. Data from observational and interventional studies do not exclude gender-specific differences in either the thrombotic and hemorrhagic burden, and the effects of antithrombotic drugs on clinical outcomes might also differ between men and women. Pathophysiological mechanisms causing these disparities are not entirely clear. Multiple factors in platelet function and coagulation mechanisms in different vascular beds, partly related to the hormonal status, might contribute to such gender differences.",Therapeutic potential of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and combined post- and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777406,International journal of cardiology,2019 03 20,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is frequently associated with pulmonary hypertension (PH), which substantially impacts survival.

This study provides a framework to evaluate the relative importance of these effects on contaminant persistence, with emphasis on the importance of thin aquitards. We developed one-dimensional (1D) analytical solutions for forward and back diffusion in a finite domain with a no flux boundary using the method of images and demonstrated their applicability to measured data from three well-controlled laboratory diffusion experiments with exponentially depleting sources. We used both in situ aquitard solute concentrations and aquifer breakthrough curves for sorbing and non-sorbing solutes. The finite-domain no flux boundary solutions showed better agreement with measured data than was available with semi-infinite approaches, with increasing discrepancy for dimensionless relative diffusion length scale beyond a critical threshold value (Zd‚ÄØ>‚ÄØ0.7). We also used a mass balance to demonstrate that the temporal pattern of contaminant source depletion controls the duration of solute mass accumulation in the aquitard, as well as the total solute mass release back into the aquifer. Lower rates of source depletion result in a longer period of mass accumulation in the aquitard and later back diffusion initiation time. The amount of solute mass stored in the aquitard increases with longer loading duration, thereby contributing to overall longer contaminant persistence in aquifers.

Focal micro-hemorrhages were found in the brain at intracranial and subpial levels. The hemogasanalysis and spectrophotometric test on blood for Methemoglobin (MetHb), Carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) and Sulfhemoglobin (SHb) showed pCO2, SHb and MetHb above the physiological levels. On biological specimens, toxicological analyses performed by GC/MS revealed high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and of thiosulfate (TS), its main metabolite. The monitoring of toxic gases on the death scene showed an unsafe environment, into the pothole, able to cause the sudden loss of consciousness of the victims with subsequent asphyxiation (knockdown effect). In particular, at the bottom of the hole, the maximum levels of H2S and carbon dioxide (CO2) were 2200‚Äâppm and 98% respectively. For the family members, the cause of the death was assessed as acute poisoning by H2S and CO2. The fatalities, happened in quick succession as for a domino effect, were pretty similar to the asphyxial deaths by confined spaces, frequently observed in occupational setting. Fatalities secondary to accidental volcanic gases inhalation, such as H2S and CO2 in geothermal areas, have been already described but often without a forensic approach.

Here, we demonstrate that autoreactive polyfunctional CD8+ T cells recognizing self-antigens (i.e., vimentin, actin cytoplasmic 1, or non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9 epitopes) with high avidity, counter-regulate Tregs by killing them, in a consistent percentage of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Indeed, these CD8+ T cells express a phenotype and gene profile of effector (eff) cells and, upon antigen-specific activation, kill Tregs indirectly in an NKG2D-dependent bystander fashion in vitro. This data provides a mechanistic basis for the finding showing that AE-specific (CD107a+) CD8+ T killer cells correlate, directly with the disease activity score, and inversely with the percentage of activated Tregs, in both steady state and follow-up studies in vivo. In addition, multiplex immunofluorescence imaging analyses of inflamed synovial tissues in vivo show that a remarkable number of CD8+ T cells express granzyme-B and selectively contact FOXP3+ Tregs, some of which are in an apoptotic state, validating hence the possibility that CD8+ Teff cells can counteract neighboring Tregs within inflamed tissues, by killing them. Alternatively, the disease activity score of a different subset of patients is correlated with the expansion of a peculiar subpopulation of autoreactive low avidity, partially-activated (pa)CD8+ T cells that, despite they conserve the conventional na√Øve (N) phenotype, produce high levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ± and exhibit a gene expression signature of a progressive activation state. Tregs directly correlate with the expansion of this autoreactive (low avidity) paCD8+ TN cell subset in vivo, and efficiently control their differentiation rather their proliferation in vitro. Interestingly, autoreactive high avidity CD8+ Teff cells or low avidity paCD8+ TN cells are significantly expanded in RA patients who would become non-responders or patients who would become responders to TNF-Œ± inhibitor therapy, respectively.

Comparative descriptions of the outer enamel surface (OES) and the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) are provided. Overall, the data presented here support the taxonomic validity of Homo antecessor, since this species presents a unique mosaic of traits. Homo¬†antecessor displays several primitive features for the genus Homo as well as some traits exclusively shared with Early and Middle Pleistocene Eurasian hominins. Some of these Eurasian traits were retained by the Middle Pleistocene hominins of Europe, and subsequently became the typical condition of the Neanderthal lineage. Although other skeletal parts present resemblances with Homo sapiens, TD6.2 teeth do not show any synapomorphy with modern humans. In addition, TD6.2 teeth can be well differentiated from those of Asian Homo erectus. The dental evidence is compatible with previous hypothesis about H.¬†antecessor belonging to the basal population from which H.¬†sapiens, Homo neanderthalensis, and Denisovans emerged.

A key question is how these traits evolved from the polygynandrously mating multimale multifemale society that likely characterized the Pan-Homo ancestor. In all three species of savanna baboons, lactating females form strong ties (sometimes called ""friendships"") with one or more adult males. For yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus) and chacma baboons (Papio ursinus), several lines of evidence suggest that these relationships are a form of male parenting effort. In olive baboons (Papio anubis), females are thought to preferentially mate with their ""friends"", and male-female bonds may thus function as a form of mating effort. Here, we draw on behavioral and genetic data to evaluate the factors that shape male-female relationships in a well-studied population of olive baboons. We find support for the parenting effort hypothesis in that sires have stronger bonds with their infants' mothers than do other males. These bonds sometimes persist past weaning age and, in many cases, the sire of the previous infant is still a close partner of the female when she nurses her subsequent offspring. We find that males who have the strongest bonds with females that have resumed cycling, but are not currently sexually receptive, are more likely to sire the female's next offspring but the estimate is associated with large statistical uncertainty. We also find that in over one third of the cases, a female's successive infants were sired by the same male. Thus, in olive baboons, the development of stable breeding bonds and paternal investment seem to be grounded in the formation of close ties between males and anestrous females. However, other factors such as male dominance rank also influence paternity success and may preclude stability of these bonds to the extent found in human societies.","The bony labyrinth of StW 573 (""Little Foot""): Implications for early hominin evolution and paleobiology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777359,Journal of human evolution,2019 02 19,"Because of its exceptional degree of preservation and its geological age of ‚àº3.67¬†Ma, StW 573 makes an invaluable contribution to our understanding of early hominin evolution and paleobiology. The morphology of the bony labyrinth has the potential to provide information about extinct primate taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic relationships and locomotor behaviour. In this context, we virtually reconstruct and comparatively assess the bony labyrinth morphology in StW 573. As comparative material, we investigate 17 southern African hominin specimens from Sterkfontein, Swartkrans and Makapansgat (plus published data from two specimens from Kromdraai B), attributed to Australopithecus, early Homo or Paranthropus, as well as 10 extant human and 10 extant chimpanzee specimens. We apply a landmark-based geometric morphometric method for quantitatively assessing labyrinthine morphology. Morphology of the inner ear in StW 573 most closely resembles that of another Australopithecus individual from Sterkfontein, StW 578, recovered from the Jacovec Cavern. Within the limits of our sample, we observe a certain degree of morphological variation in the Australopithecus assemblage of Sterkfontein Member 4. Cochlear morphology in StW 573 is similar to that of other Australopithecus as well as to Paranthropus specimens included in this study, but it is substantially different from early Homo. Interestingly, the configuration of semicircular canals in Paranthropus specimens from Swartkrans differs from other fossil hominins, including StW 573. Given the role of the cochlea in the sensory-driven interactions with the surrounding environment, our results offer new perspectives for interpreting early hominin behaviour and ecology. Finally, our study provides additional evidence for discussing the phylogenetic polarity of labyrinthine traits in southern African hominins.","The meta-group social network of early humans: A temporal-spatial assessment of group size at FLK Zinj (Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777358,Journal of human evolution,2019 02 19,"Humans are the only primates that maintain regular inter-group relationships and meta-group social networks that enable the inter-group flow of individuals. This is the basis of the band/tribe concept in the anthropology of modern foragers. The present work is a theoretical approach to the development of analytical tools to understand group size and the temporal scale of site occupation in the archaeological record. We selected FLK Zinj as one of the oldest examples of a taphonomically-supported anthropogenic site in which both variables (group size and time) could be modelled using a combination of modern forager regression estimates from their camp sizes and estimates derived from the combined use of modern African foragers' meat consumption rates per day per capita during the dry season and minimum estimates of flesh yields provided by the carcass parts preserved at FLK Zinj. This approach provides the basis for a testable hypothesis which should be further tested in other Oldowan sites. An estimate of 18-28 individuals occupying FLK Zinj was made, which is similar to the estimated 16 individuals of one of the 1.5¬†Ma Ileret Homo erectus footprint trails. It also shows a similar proportional distribution to Dunbar's equations (group size to neocortex ratio) as documented in modern foragers, which suggest that most of the social network of H.¬†erectus was in the meta-group level as is the case of modern foragers. Irrespective of the range of variation discussed for both variables (group size and length of time represented), it is argued that neither small estimates of time nor small group sizes can account for the formation of FLK Zinj.",New data for the Early Upper Paleolithic of Kostenki (Russia).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777356,Journal of human evolution,2019 02 19,"Several questions remain regarding the timing and nature of the Neanderthal-anatomically modern human (AMH) transition in Europe. The situation in Eastern Europe is generally less clear due to the relatively few sites and a dearth of reliable radiocarbon dates. Claims have been made for both notably early AMH and notably late Neanderthal presence, as well as for early AMH (Aurignacian) dispersal into the region from Central/Western Europe. The Kostenki-Borshchevo complex (European Russia) of Early Upper Paleolithic (EUP) sites offers high-quality data to address these questions. Here we revise the chronology and cultural status of the key sites of Kostenki 17 and Kostenki 14. The Kostenki 17/II lithic assemblage shares important features with Proto-Aurignacian material, strengthening an association with AMHs. New radiocarbon dates for Kostenki 17/II of ‚àº41-40 ka cal BP agree with new dates for the recently excavated Kostenki 14/IVw, which shows some similarities to Kostenki 17/II. Dates of ‚â•41 ka cal BP from other Kostenki sites cannot be linked to diagnostic archaeological material, and therefore cannot be argued to date AMH occupation. Kostenki 14's Layer in Volcanic Ash assemblage, on the other hand, compares to Early Aurignacian material. New radiocarbon dates targeting diagnostic lithics date to 39-37 ka cal BP. Overall, Kostenki's early EUP is in good agreement with the archaeological record further west. Our results are therefore consistent with models predicting interregional penecontemporaneity of diagnostic EUP assemblages. Most importantly, our work highlights ongoing challenges for reliably radiocarbon dating the period. Dates for Kostenki 14 agreed with the samples' chronostratigraphic positions, but standard pre-treatment methods consistently produced incorrect ages for Kostenki 17/II. Extraction of hydroxyproline from bone collagen using preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, however, yielded results consistent with the samples' chronostratigraphic position and with the layer's archaeological contents. This suggests that for some sites compound-specific techniques are required to build reliable radiocarbon chronologies.","Lithic raw material acquisition and use by early Homo sapiens at¬†Skhul,¬†Israel.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777355,Journal of human evolution,2019 02 19,"The site of Skhul in Israel has featured prominently in discussions about the early presence of Homo sapiens outside of Africa since its excavation in the 1930s. Until now, attention has been primarily focused on the site's fossil hominins and evidence for symbolic behavior in the form of burials and rare artifacts such as pierced shells and pigment objects. We present here the results of renewed analysis of the lithic artifacts from Skhul drawn from archival collections in the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel. Although lithic artifacts form the majority of the archaeological record from the site, they have rarely been the subject of comprehensive study. Our analyses of raw material selection, use and transport combined with technological analyses of artifact production methods (1) indicate selective transport to the site of large flakes, retouched pieces, and particularly Levallois points from non-local sources, and (2) demonstrate substantial variability in raw material procurement that fails to indicate clear differences in landscape use between H.¬†sapiens and Neanderthals.","Femur associated with the Deep Skull from the West Mouth of the Niah Caves (Sarawak, Malaysia).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777354,Journal of human evolution,2019 02 19,"The skeletal remains of Pleistocene anatomically modern humans are rare in island Southeast Asia. Moreover, continuing doubts over the dating of most of these finds has left the arrival time for the region's earliest inhabitants an open question. The unique biogeography of island Southeast Asia also raises questions about the physical and cultural adaptations of early anatomically modern humans, especially within the setting of rainforest inhabitation. Within this context the Deep Skull from the West Mouth of the Niah Caves continues to figure prominently owing to its relative completeness and the greater certainty surrounding its geological age. Recovered along with this partial cranium in 1958 were several postcranial bones including a partial femur which until now has received little attention. Here we provide a description and undertake a comparison of the Deep Skull femur finding it to be very small in all of its cross-sectional dimensions. We note a number of size and shape similarities to the femora of Indigenous Southeast Asians, especially Aeta people from the Philippines. We estimate its stature to have been roughly 145-146¬†cm and body mass around 35¬†kg, confirming similarities to Aeta females. Its extreme gracility indicated by low values for a range of biomechanical parameters taken midshaft meets expectations for a very small (female) Paleolithic East Asian. Interestingly, the second moment of area about the mediolateral axis is enlarged relative to the second moment of area about the anteroposterior axis, which could potentially signal a difference in activity levels or lifestyle compared with other Paleolithic femora. However, it might also be the result of sexual dimorphism in these parameters as well as possibly reflecting changes associated with aging.",One size does not fit all: Group size and the late middle Pleistocene prehistoric archive.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777353,Journal of human evolution,2019 02 19,"The role of demography is often suggested to be a key factor in both biological and cultural evolution. Recent research has shown that the linkage between population size and cultural evolution is not straightforward and emerges from the interplay of many demographic, economic, social and ecological variables. Formal modelling has yielded interesting insights into the complex relationship between population structure, intergroup connectedness, and magnitude and extent of population extinctions. Such studies have highlighted the importance of effective (as opposed to census) population size in transmission processes. At the same time, it remained unclear how such insights can be applied to material culture phenomena in the prehistoric record, especially for deeper prehistory. In this paper we approach the issue of population sizes during the time of the Lower to Middle Paleolithic transition through the proxy of regional trajectories of lithic technological change, identified in the archaeological records from Africa, the Levant, Southwestern and Northwestern Europe. Our discussion of the results takes into consideration the constraints inherent to the archaeological record of deep time - e.g., preservation bias, time-averaging and the incomplete nature of the archaeological record - and of extrapolation from discrete archaeological case studies to an evolutionary time scale. We suggest that technological trajectories of change over this transitional period reflect the robustness of transmission networks. Our results show differences in the pattern and rate of cultural transmission in these regions, from which we infer that information networks, and their underlying effective population sizes, also differed.",Subsistence strategies throughout the African Middle Pleistocene: Faunal evidence for behavioral change and continuity across the Earlier to Middle Stone Age transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777352,Journal of human evolution,2019 02 19,"The African Middle Pleistocene (781-126 ka) is a key period for human evolution, witnessing both the origin of the modern human lineage and the lithic turnover from Earlier Stone Age (ESA) Acheulean bifacial tools to Middle Stone Age (MSA) prepared core and point technologies. This ESA/MSA transition is interpreted as representing changing landscape use with greater foraging distances and more active hunting strategies. So far, these behavioral inferences are mainly based on the extensive stone tool record, with only a minor role for site-based and regional faunal studies. To provide additional insights into these behavioral changes, this paper details a pan-African metastudy of 63 Middle Pleistocene faunal assemblages from 40 sites. A hierarchical classification system identified 26 well-contextualized assemblages with quantitative paleontological and/or zooarcheological data available for detailed comparative analyses and generalized linear mixed modeling. Modeling of ungulate body size classes structured around three dimensions (context, antiquity and technology) illustrates no one-to-one correlation between changes in lithic technology (Acheulean vs. MSA) and changes in prey representation. All assessed faunal assemblages are dominated by medium-sized bovids, and variations between smaller and larger body size classes are linked to site context (cave vs. open-air), with an increase in cave sites during the Middle Pleistocene. Current data do not signal a broadening of the hominin dietary niche during the Middle Pleistocene; no meaningful variation was visible in the exploitation of smaller-sized bovids or dangerous game, with coastal resources exploited when available. Proportions of anthropogenic bone surface modifications, and hence carcass processing intensity, do increase over time although more zooarcheological data is crucial before making behavioral inferences. Overall, this paper illustrates the potential of broad scale comparative faunal analyses to provide additional insights into processes of human behavioral evolution and the mechanisms underlying patterns of technological, chronological and contextual change.",Plasmon-assisted demolition of antibiotic using sono-photoreduction decoration of Ag on 2D C3N4 nanophotocatalyst enhanced with acid-treated clinoptilolite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777351,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,2019 05 31,"In this study, the plasmon silver/bulk graphitic carbon nitride-clinoptilolite (denoted as: Ag/BCN-CLT) nanophotocatalysts synthesized using sono-photoreduction dispersion of Ag over C3N4 nanophotocatalyst with various contents of acid-treated clinoptilolite (10, 20, 40‚ÄØwt%) that was employed in the tetracycline degradation, as the model antibiotic pollutant, using simulated solar-light radiation. X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-Dot mapping, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, particle size distribution, and Ultraviolet-Visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analyses results showed a high quality of synthesis of nanophotocatalysts and good dispersion of particles on the surface of nanophotocatalyst. Using photodegradation results, the Ag/BCN-CLT(10) sample with 10‚ÄØwt% of clinoptilolite showed a better tetracycline degradation efficiency (87.23%), which is a result of a high surface area of nanophotocatalyst due to the exerting sonication in synthesis procedure. Also, using Ag nanoparticles as a noble metal and creation of surface plasmon resonance effect, the edge of light absorption was shifted to the visible light region, which was proven by UV-Vis DRS results. Furthermore, the using of both Ag and acid-treated clinoptilolite had an efficient influence on decreasing band gap energy position. At last, the effect of different operational parameters and the reusable property of the photocatalyst have experimented. Finally, the suggested mechanisms of the tetracycline degradation reactions were drawn and were analyzed accurately."

Ability to purposefully affect trunk biomechanics has not been investigated for this type of footwear. Fifteen healthy young male subjects underwent gait and electromyography analysis using a biomechanical device that shifts COP via moveable convex elements attached to the shoe sole. Analyses were performed in three COP configurations for pairwise comparison: (1) neutral (control) (2) laterally deviated, and (3) medially deviated. Sagittal and frontal-plane pelvis and spine kinematics, external oblique activity, and frontal and transverse-plane lumbar moments were affected by medio-lateral COP shift. Transverse-plane trunk kinematics, activity of the lumbar longissimus, latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus, and quadratus lumborum, and sagittal-plane lumbar moment, were not significantly impacted. Two linear mixed effects models assessed predictive impact of (I) COP location, and (II) trunk kinematics and neuromuscular activity, on the significant lumbar moment parameters. The COP was a significant predictor of all modeled frontal and transverse-plane lumbar moment parameters, while pelvic and spine rotation, and lumbar longissimus activity were significant predictors of one frontal-plane lumbar moment parameter.

ARH patients respond relatively well to statins or the combination of statins and Ezetimibe, but scarce and variable data on treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors is available. We aimed to identify and characterize the defect in a hypercholesterolemic patient with premature cardiovascular disease and determine the response to lipid-lowering treatment.",Toward more efficient diagnostic criteria sets and rules: The use of optimization approaches in addiction science.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777336,Addictive behaviors,2019 06 10,"Psychiatric diagnostic systems, such as The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), use expert consensus to determine diagnostic criteria sets and rules (DCSRs), rather than exploiting empirical techniques to arrive at optimal solutions (OS). Our project utilizes complete enumeration (i.e., generating all possible subsets of item combinations A and B with all possible thresholds, T) to evaluate all possible DCSRs given a set of relevant diagnostic data. This method yields the entire population distribution of diagnostic classifications (i.e., diagnosis of the disorder versus no diagnosis) produced by a set of dichotomous predictors (i.e., diagnostic criteria). Once unique sets are enumerated, optimization on some predefined correlate or predictor will maximally separate diagnostic groups on one or more, disorder-specific ""outcome"" criteria. We used this approach to illustrate how to create a common Substance Use Disorder (SUD) DCSR that is applicable to multiple substances. We demonstrate the utility of this approach with respect to alcohol use disorder and Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) using DSM-5 criteria as input variables. The optimal SUD solution with a moderate or above severity grading included four criteria (i.e. 1) having a strong urge or craving for the substance (CR), 2) failure to fulfill major role obligations at work school or home (FF), 3) continued use of the substance despite social or interpersonal problems caused by the substance use (SI) and 4) physically hazardous use (HU)) with a diagnostic threshold of two. The derived DCSR was validated with known correlates of SUD and performed as well as DSM-5. Our findings illustrate the value of using an empirical approach to what is typically a subjective process of choosing criteria and algorithms that is prone to bias. The optimization of diagnostic criteria can reduce criteria set sizes, resulting in decreased research, clinician, and patient burden.",Preparation of gadolinium doped carbon dots for enhanced MR imaging and cell fluorescence labeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777335,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 06,"Gadolinium doped carbon dots (Gd-CDs) were prepared as a dual-modal imaging agent for enhanced MR imaging and cell fluorescence imaging. The Gd-CDs were synthesized via one-step solvent free technique with Gd-DTPA and l-arginine as the Gd and carbon sources with a quantum yield of 57.78%. The Gd-CDs exhibited good crystal structure, excellent aqueous dispersity, high colloidal stability, intense fluorescence and low cytotoxicity. The bio-TEM images revealed that the Gd-CDs could be easily internalized by cancer cells and escape from the endosomes. Furthermore, the Gd-CDs demonstrated wonderful multi-color fluoresence cell labeling ability at various excitation wavelength and much better MR contrast effect compared with commercial Gd-DTPA with a high r1 relaxivity value 6.27‚ÄØmM-1s-1. In addition, Gd-CDs exhibited brighter MR signal than Gd-DTPA in the animal MR imaging test. Finally, the Gd-CDs also indicated low long-term toxicity by the serum biochemistry analysis. Thus, these results indicated that Gd-CDs would be an excellent dual-modal imaging probe for enhanced MR imaging and fluorescence imaging.",DNA methyltransferase expression and DNA hypomethylation status in human hepatocytes following trichloroacetic acid exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777334,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 06,"Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is one of the major metabolites of trichloroethylene (TCE) as the significant factor of environmental and occupational pollution. TCA has been shown to induce a series of epigenetic mutation in mouse liver. However, the epigenetic cytotoxicity of TCA is still in infancy. In this study, we explored the cellular biological characteristics, the genome DNA methylation status and the expression profile of DNA methyltransferases in human hepatic L-02¬†cells treated with TCA with certain time and dose effects. The cell cycle measured by flow cytometry revealed an increasing S¬†+¬†G2 (M) phase of TCA (0.9¬†mM 24¬†h, 48¬†h and 72¬†h) treated cells after a recovery day, and sub-G1 phase was not appeared. The levels of 5¬†-mC were decreased in TCA (0.9¬†mM 24¬†h and 72¬†h) treated cells by 5-mC immunolocalization process and HPCE (decreased from 27.2% to 50.1% respectively).

It also revealed that treatment of L-02‚ÄØcells with TCA induced decreased in DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA and protein levels with a time-dependent manner and a dose-response relationship, while DNMT3b had no obvious change. These results establish a link between DNA methyltransferases and Genome DNA hypomethylation, which is associated with TCA exposure.",Anti-adhesive effects of human soluble thrombomodulin and its domains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777333,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 06,"We reported previously that leukocyte Œ≤2 integrins (LFA-1 and Mac-1) bind to the serine/threonine-rich domain of thrombomodulin (TM) expressed on vascular endothelial cells (VECs). Recombinant human soluble TM (rhsTM, TMD123) has been approved as a therapeutic drug for septic disseminated intravascular coagulation. However, the roles of TMD123 on the adhesion of leukocyte integrins to VECs remain unclear. In the current study, we have revealed that an integrin-dependent binding between human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and VECs was inhibited by TMD123. Next, using mutant proteins composed of isolated TM extracellular domains, we examined the structural characteristics responsible for the anti-adhesion properties of TMD123. Namely, we investigated whether the effects of the binding of TM and leukocytes was inhibited by the administration of TMD123. In fact, we confirmed that TMD123, TMD1, and TMD3 inhibited the binding of PBMCs to the immobilized recombinant proteins TMD123 and TMD3. These results indicate that TMD123 inhibited the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells via Œ≤2 integrins and endothelial TM. Moreover, since TMD1 might bind to leukocytes via other adhesion receptors than integrins, TMD1 and TMD3 appear to inhibit leukocyte binding to TM on VECs via different mechanisms. In summary, TMD123 (rhsTM), TMD1 or TMD3 is a promising treatment option for sepsis that attenuates integrin-dependent binding of leukocytes to VECs, and may inhibit the undesirable adhesion and migration of leukocytes to VECs in sepsis.",Prognostic significance of high metabolic activity in breast cancer: PET signature in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777332,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 29,"High metabolic activity, reflected in increased glucose uptake, is one of the hallmarks of many cancers including breast cancer. However, not all cancers avidly take up glucose, suggesting heterogeneity in their metabolic demand. Thus, we aim to generate a genomic signature of glucose hypermetabolism in breast cancer and examine its clinical relevance. To identify genes significantly associated with glucose uptake, gene expression data were analyzed together with the standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose on positron emission tomography (PET) for 11 breast cancers. The resulting PET signature was evaluated for prognostic significance in four large independent patient cohorts (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ5417). Potential upstream regulators accountable for the high glucose uptake were identified by gene network analysis. A PET signature of 242 genes was significantly correlated with SUVmax in breast cancer. In all four cohorts, high PET signature was significantly associated with poorer prognosis. The prognostic value of this PET signature was further supported by Cox regression analyses (hazard ratio 1.7, confidential interval 1.48-2.02; P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001). The PET signature was also strongly correlated with previously established prognostic genomic signatures such as PAM50, Oncotype DX, and NKI. Gene network analyses suggested that MYC and TBX2 were the most significant upstream transcription factors in the breast cancers with high glucose uptake. A PET signature reflecting high glucose uptake is a novel independent prognostic factor in breast cancer. MYC and TBX2 are potential regulators of glucose uptake.",Sphigosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 promotes neointimal hyperplasia in a mouse model of carotid artery injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777331,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 02 27,"Vascular remodeling, resulting from proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), is a major cause of atherosclerosis and restenosis. The lysophospholipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) regulates proliferation and migration of VSMCs via S1P-specific G protein-coupled receptors, including S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) to S1PR3. However, the role of S1PR1 in vascular remodeling is not well understood. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of S1PR1 on neointimal hyperplasia in a carotid artery ligation mouse model using transgenic C57Bl/6 mice that overexpressed S1PR1 (Tg-S1PR1) under the control of Œ±-smooth muscle actin promoter. We found that S1PR1 expression in carotid artery was upregulated after carotid artery ligation in non-transgenic (nTg) mice. Tg-S1PR1 mice showed enhanced ligation-induced neointimal hyperplasia with increased neointimal cell proliferation, compared with control nTg mice. VSMCs isolated from Tg-S1PR1 mice showed enhanced proliferation and migration in response to S1P stimulation. VSMCs from Tg-S1PR1 mice showed greater expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) compared with nTg mouse-derived VSMCs, and administration of IL-6-neutralizing antibody into Tg-S1PR1 mice suppressed neointimal hyperplasia. These results suggest that S1P-S1PR1 signaling plays an important role in neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury via IL-6 production.",Self-assembled nanovehicle-mediated co-encapsulation of inactivated EV71 virus and CpG oligonucleotides elicits potent anti-EV71 humoral and cellular immune protective responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777330,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 06,"Inactivated vaccines are widely used for prevention of viral disease. Both humoral and cellular immune responses have been shown to play important roles in the control and clearance of virus infections. CpG motif containing oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) have recently gained considerable interest and been used as vaccine adjuvant due to their potent abilities to modulate host immune response. In this study, CpG-ODN adjuvant and inactivated viral particles of enterovirus 71 (EV71) were co-encapsulated into nanoparticles (NP) generated by using protamine sulfate (PS) and carboxymethyl Œ≤-glucan (CMG) through a self-assembly approach. The administration of EV71 nanovaccine elicited not only specific anti-EV71 neutralizing antibody response, but also cellular immune response characterized by strong productions of IFN-Œ± and IFN-Œ≥. The results suggest that CMG/PS-based nanovehicles hold a great potential to be a novel platform for nanovaccine development against viral disease."

Remarkably, both the high order powers and the saturated input are involved in the system under consideration, that renders the existing output feedback control methods are inapplicable. Based on the finite-time stability theorem, and by skillfully using the homogeneous domination approach and the nested saturation technique, a reduced order observer-based saturated finite-time output feedback control scheme is successfully developed. With choosing appropriate design parameters, the proposed controller ensures that the states of the closed-loop system are regulated to zero in a finite time without violation of the input constraint. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Sampled-data observer-based anti-windup control for singularly perturbed systems with actuator saturation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777315,ISA transactions,2019 02 19,"In this paper, the problem of sampled-data observer-based anti-windup (AW) control for singularly perturbed systems with actuator saturation is considered.

Based on an Œµ-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and linear matrix inequalities, the three components of sampled-data observer-based AW controller are designed simultaneously, which can reduce the conservatism. Furthermore, a convex optimization algorithm is formulated to obtain a desired stability bound and enlarge the basin of attraction at the same time.

To achieve fast convergence and desirable tracking precision, a second-order fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode (SOFNTSM) controller is designed to guarantee system performance and robust stability. Chattering is eliminated using continuous control law due to high-frequency switching terms contained in the first derivative of actual control signals. Meanwhile, uncertainties are compensated by introducing the adaptive technique, whose prior knowledge about upper bound is not required. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",In Vivo Measurements of Cortical Thickness and Porosity at the Proximal Third of the Tibia Using Guided Waves: Comparison with Site-Matched Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography and Distal High-Resolution Peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777311,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 05 13,"The aim of this study was to estimate cortical porosity (Ct.Po) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) using 500-kHz bi-directional axial transmission (AT). Ct.ThAT and Ct.PoAT were obtained at the tibia in 15 patients from a 2-D transverse isotropic free plate model fitted to measured guided wave dispersion curves. The velocities of the first arriving signal (œÖFAS) and A0 mode (œÖA0) were also determined. Site-matched peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) provided volumetric cortical bone mineral density (Ct.vBMDpQCT) and Ct.ThpQCT. Good agreement was found between Ct.ThAT and Ct.ThpQCT (R2‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.62, root mean square error [RMSE]‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.39 mm).

Here, we probe the nature of the low-pH structural form of the homodimeric CcdB (controller of cell death B) protein. Characterization of CcdB protein at pH 4 and 300 K using circular dichroism spectroscopy, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonate binding, and Trp solvation studies suggests that it forms a partially unfolded state with a dry core at equilibrium under these conditions. CcdB remains dimeric at pH 4 as shown by multiple techniques, such as size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, and electron paramagnetic resonance. Comparative analysis using two-dimensional 15N-1H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence NMR spectra of CcdB at pH 4 and 7 suggests that the pH 4 and native state have similar but nonidentical structures. Hydrogen-exchange-mass-spectrometry studies demonstrate that the pH 4 state has substantial but anisotropic changes in local stability with core regions close to the dimer interface showing lower protection but some other regions showing higher protection relative to pH 7.",Methanol Accelerates DMPC Flip-Flop and¬†Transfer:¬†A SANS Study on Lipid Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777306,Biophysical journal,2019 03 29,"Methanol is a common solubilizing agent used to study transmembrane proteins/peptides in biological and synthetic membranes. Using small angle neutron scattering and a strategic contrast-matching scheme, we show that methanol has a major impact on lipid dynamics. Under increasing methanol concentrations, isotopically distinct 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine large unilamellar vesicle populations exhibit increased mixing. Specifically, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine transfer and flip-flop kinetics display linear and exponential rate enhancements, respectively. Ultimately, methanol is capable of influencing the structure-function relationship associated with bilayer composition (e.g., lipid asymmetry). The use of¬†methanol as a carrier solvent, despite better simulating some biological conditions (e.g., antimicrobial attack), can help misconstrue lipid scrambling as the action of proteins or peptides, when in actuality it is a combination of solvent and biological agent. As bilayer compositional stability is crucial to cell survival and protein reconstitution, these results highlight the importance of methanol, and solvents in general, in biomembrane and proteolipid studies.",A Cholesterol Analog Induces an Oligomeric Reorganization of VDAC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777305,Biophysical journal,2019 03 29,"The oligomeric organization of the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) and its interactions with hexokinase play integral roles in mitochondrially mediated apoptotic signaling. Various small to large assemblies of VDAC are observed in mitochondrial outer membranes, but they do not predominate in detergent-solubilized VDAC samples. In this study, a cholesterol analog, cholesteryl-hemisuccinate (CHS), was shown to induce the formation of detergent-soluble VDAC multimers. The various oligomeric states of VDAC induced by the addition of CHS were deciphered through an integrated biophysics approach using microscale thermophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, and size-exclusion chromatography small angle x-ray scattering. Furthermore, CHS stabilizes the interaction between VDAC and hexokinase (Kd of 27 ¬± 6 ŒºM), confirming the biological relevance of oligomers generated. Thus, sterols such as cholesterol in higher eukaryotes or ergosterol in fungi may regulate the VDAC oligomeric state and may provide a potential target for the modulation of apoptotic signaling by effecting VDAC-VDAC and VDAC-hexokinase interactions. In addition, the integrated biophysical approach described provides a powerful platform for the study of membrane protein complexes in solution.",Lipid Unsaturation Properties Govern the Sensitivity of Membranes to Photoinduced Oxidative Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777304,Biophysical journal,2019 03 29,"Unsaturated lipid oxidation is a fundamental process involved in different aspects of cellular bioenergetics; dysregulation of lipid oxidation is often associated with cell aging and death. To study how lipid oxidation affects membrane biophysics, we used a chlorin photosensitizer to oxidize vesicles of various lipid compositions and degrees of unsaturation in a controlled manner. We observed different shape transitions that can be interpreted as an increase in the area of the targeted membrane followed by a decrease. These area modifications induced by the chemical modification of the membrane upon oxidation were followed in¬†situ by Raman tweezers microspectroscopy. We found that the membrane area increase corresponds¬†to the lipids' peroxidation and is initiated by the delocalization of the targeted double bonds in the tails of the lipids. The subsequent decrease of membrane area can be explained by the formation of cleaved secondary products. As a result of these area changes, we observe vesicle permeabilization after a time lag that is characterized in relation with the level of unsaturation. The evolution of photosensitized vesicle radius was measured and yields an estimation of the mechanical changes of the membrane over oxidation time. The membrane is both weakened and permeabilized by the oxidation. Interestingly, the effect of unsaturation level on the dynamics of vesicles undergoing photooxidation is not trivial and thus carefully discussed. Our findings shed light on the fundamental dynamic mechanisms underlying the oxidation of lipid membranes and highlight the role of unsaturations on their physical and chemical properties."

Both children and adults participated in a masked priming lexical decision study comparing transparent compound (farmhouse-farm), opaque compound (butterfly-butter), and noncompound (sandwich-sand) word priming effects measured relative to an unrelated control. The results showed significant and equal priming effects in the two compound conditions but not in the noncompound priming condition. This robust pattern was clearly and unequivocally observed across all groups of participants.

Because Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activation degranulates Paneth cells and necrotic tubular epithelial cells release several damage associated molecular patterns that target TLR9, we tested the hypothesis that intestinal TLR9 deficiency would protect against ischemic AKI and associated remote intestinal and hepatic dysfunction by decreasing Paneth cell degranulation. We generated mice lacking TLR9 in intestinal epithelia (TLR9fl/fl Villin Cre mice) and compared them to wild type (TLR9fl/fl) mice following right nephrectomy and left ischemia/reperfusion. To our surprise, mice lacking intestinal TLR9 had exacerbated kidney, liver, and small intestine injury after ischemia/reperfusion compared to wild type mice, characterized by increased kidney and intestinal inflammation, apoptosis, and necrosis as well as increased hepatic inflammation and apoptosis. Mice lacking intestinal TLR9 had larger Paneth cell granule size, pronounced intestinal macrophage infiltration, and higher intestinal crypt IL-17A expression. Administration of IL-17A neutralizing antibody prevented the exacerbation of ischemic AKI in mice lacking intestinal TLR9. These studies suggest that intestinal TLR9 activation protects against ischemic AKI and associated remote multi-organ dysfunction syndrome by regulating Paneth cell IL-17A synthesis.","Common Community-acquired Bacterial Skin and Soft-tissue Infections in Children: an Intersociety Consensus on Impetigo, Abscess, and Cellulitis Treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777258,Clinical therapeutics,2019 04 01,"The main objective of this article was to offer practical suggestions, given the existing evidence, for identifying and managing bacterial impetigo, abscess, and cellulitis in ambulatory and hospital settings.",Current situation of soft tissue sarcomas: Registry of a Latin American cancer institute.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777256,Cirugia espanola,2019 03 27,"Soft tissue sarcomas (SFT) are a group of rare and heterogeneous neoplasms (representing less than 1% of cancer in adults and 15% in pediatric patients), for which there is no updated records in the Latin American population.

Sea urchins are typically collected from the sea and kept in research facilities all over the world for such purposes. Cryopreservation can be a very powerful tool to enhance the use of sea urchins as a model species for research. The development of cryopreservation protocols for different sea urchin gametes, embryos, and larvae allows year round access to high quality material outside the natural reproductive season. It also reduces the uncertainty and variability that may be caused by changing oceanic, meteorological, and environmental conditions. Access to cryopreserved gametes and embryos will allow using these model organisms in laboratories all around the world, regardless of their facilities or their proximity to a natural population of sea urchins. Cryopreservation is a very useful tool for aquaculture production, fisheries conservation, and wild stock enhancement allowing spat supply all year round without the need of conditioning broodstock for out of season reproduction-which is expensive, time consuming, and often unfruitful. It will also provide flexibility for selective breeding programs by allowing crossings of individuals with different reproductive seasons. Although cryopreservation protocols have been successfully developed for many valuable fisheries species such as sturgeons, salmonid fishes, and other marine invertebrates (e.g., oysters), only a small amount of research has been carried out regarding sea urchin cryopreservation. In this chapter, we outline protocols for the cryopreservation of sea urchin cells."

Endothelial laminin-Œ±5 is dispensable for BBB maintenance under homeostatic conditions but inhibits inflammatory cell extravasation in pathological conditions. Whether mural cell-derived laminin-Œ±5 is involved in vascular integrity regulation, however, remains unknown. To answer this question, we generated transgenic mice with laminin-Œ±5 deficiency in mural cells (Œ±5-PKO). Under homeostatic conditions, no defects in BBB integrity and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were observed in Œ±5-PKO mice, suggesting that mural cell-derived laminin-Œ±5 is dispensable for BBB maintenance and CBF regulation under homeostatic conditions. After ischemia-reperfusion (MCAO) injury, however, Œ±5-PKO mice displayed less severe neuronal injury, including reduced infarct volume, decreased neuronal death, and improved neurological function. In addition, Œ±5-PKO mice also showed attenuated vascular damage (milder BBB disruption, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased brain edema, and diminished hemorrhagic transformation). Mechanistic studies revealed less severe tight junction protein (TJP) loss and pericyte coverage reduction in Œ±5-PKO mice after ischemia-reperfusion injury, indicating that the attenuated ischemic injury in Œ±5-PKO mice is possibly due to less severe vascular damage. These findings suggest that mural cell-derived laminin-Œ±5 plays a detrimental role in ischemic stroke and that inhibiting its signaling may have a neuroprotective effect.","Correction to: Epidemiology of taeniosis/cysticercosis in Europe, a systematic review: eastern Europe.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777134,Parasites & vectors,2019 03 21,"In the original article [1], the authors Dr Jasmin OMERAGIƒÜ and Dr Davor ALAGIƒÜ were erroneously omitted from the co-authors list.",Two subgroups in systemic lupus erythematosus with features of antiphospholipid or Sj√∂gren's syndrome differ in molecular signatures and treatment perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777133,Arthritis research & therapy,2019 03 01,Previous studies and own clinical observations of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suggest that SLE harbors distinct immunophenotypes.

Three PRV subtypes are currently reported as causative agents of or in association with diseases in different salmonid species. PRV-1 causes heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and is associated with jaundice syndrome in farmed chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). PRV-2 causes erythrocytic inclusion body syndrome (EIBS) in coho salmon in Japan. PRV-3 has recently been associated with a disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) characterized by anaemia, heart and red muscle pathology; to jaundice syndrome in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In this study, we conducted a 10-week long experimental infection trial in rainbow trout with purified PRV-3 particles to assess the causal relationship between the virus and development of heart inflammation. The monitoring the PRV-3 load in heart and spleen by RT-qPCR shows a progressive increase of viral RNA to a peak, followed by clearance without a measurable change in haematocrit. The development of characteristic cardiac histopathological findings occurred in the late phase of the trial and was associated with increased expression of CD8+, indicating cytotoxic T cell proliferation. The findings indicate that, under these experimental conditions, PRV-3 infection in rainbow trout act similarly to PRV-1 infection in Atlantic salmon with regards to immunological responses and development of heart pathology, but not in the ability to establish a persistent infection.",Thermostability and excision activity of polymorphic forms of hOGG1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30777129,BMC research notes,2019 06 07,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidize guanine residues in DNA to form 7,8-dihydro-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8oxoG) lesions in the genome.

To date, little is known about the precise pathogenesis of EHV5. Here, we evaluated the dynamics of EHV5 infection in representative ex vivo and in vitro equine models, using immunofluorescence staining and virus titration. EHV5 was unable to infect epithelial cells lining the mucosa of nasal and tracheal explants. Similarly, primary equine respiratory epithelial cells (EREC) were not susceptible to EHV5 following inoculation at the apical or basolateral surfaces. Upon direct delivery of EHV5 particles to lung explants, few EHV5-positive cell clusters were observed at 72¬†hours post-inoculation (hpi). These EHV5-positive cells were identified as cytokeratin-positive alveolar cells. Next, we examined the potential of EHV5 to infect three distinct equine PBMC populations (CD172a+ monocytes, CD3+ T lymphocytes and Ig light chain+ B lymphocytes). Monocytes did not support EHV5 replication. In contrast, up to 10% of inoculated equine T and B lymphocytes synthetized intracellular viral antigens 24¬†hpi and 72¬†hpi, respectively. Still, the production of mature virus particles was hampered, as we did not observe an increase in extracellular virus titer. After reaching a peak, the percentage of infected T and B lymphocytes decayed, which was partly due to the onset of apoptosis, but not necrosis. Based on these findings, we propose a model for EHV5 pathogenesis in the horse. Uncovering EHV5 pathogenesis is the corner step to finally contain or even eradicate the virus."

In a recent trial, modafinil was shown to be an effective agent in reducing poststroke fatigue; however, not all patients reported a significant decrease in fatigue with therapy. We sought to investigate clinical and radiological predictors of fatigue reduction with modafinil therapy in a stroke survivor cohort. Methods- Twenty-six participants with severe fatigue (multidimensional fatigue inventory-20 ‚â•60) underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and during the last week of a 6-week treatment period of 200 mg modafinil taken daily. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution structural imaging data were obtained, and functional connectivity and regional brain volumes within the fronto-striato-thalamic network were obtained. Linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors of modafinil-induced fatigue reduction. Results- Multiple regression analysis showed that baseline multidimensional fatigue inventory-20 score (Œ≤=0.576, P=0.006) and functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus (Œ≤=-0.424, P=0.008) were significant predictors of modafinil-associated decreases in poststroke fatigue (adjusted r2=0.52, area under the receiver operator characteristic curve=0.939). Conclusions- Fronto-striato-thalamic functional connectivity predicted modafinil response for poststroke fatigue. Fatigue in other neurological disease has been attributed to altered function of the fronto-striato-thalamic network and may indicate that poststroke fatigue has a similar mechanism to other neurological injury related fatigue. Self-reported fatigue in patients with normal fronto-striato-thalamic functional connectivity may have a different mechanism and require alternate therapeutic approaches.

In a pooled-data meta-analysis, we analyzed whether serum glucose is a treatment modifier of the efficacy of EVT in acute stroke. Methods- Seven randomized trials compared EVT with standard care between 2010 and 2017 (HERMES Collaboration [highly effective reperfusion using multiple endovascular devices]). One thousand seven hundred and sixty-four patients with large-vessel stroke were allocated to EVT (n=871) or standard care (n=893). Measurements included blood glucose on admission and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale range, 0-6; lower scores indicating less disability) at 3 months. The primary analysis evaluated whether glucose modified the effect of EVT over standard care on functional outcome, using ordinal logistic regression to test the interaction between treatment and glucose level. Results- Median (interquartile range) serum glucose on admission was 120 (104-140) mg/dL (6.6 mmol/L [5.7-7.7] mmol/L). EVT was better than standard care in the overall pooled-data analysis adjusted common odds ratio (acOR), 2.00 (95% CI, 1.69-2.38); however, lower glucose levels were associated with greater effects of EVT over standard care. The interaction was nonlinear such that significant interactions were found in subgroups of patients split at glucose < or >90 mg/dL (5.0 mmol/L; P=0.019 for interaction; acOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.73-8.41 for patients < 90 mg/dL versus 1.83; 95% CI, 1.53-2.19 for patients >90 mg/dL), and glucose < or >100 mg/dL (5.5 mmol/L; P=0.004 for interaction; acOR, 3.17; 95% CI, 2.04-4.93 versus acOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.42-2.08) but not between subgroups above these levels of glucose. Conclusions- EVT improved stroke outcomes compared with standard treatment regardless of glucose levels, but the treatment effects were larger at lower glucose levels, with significant interaction effects persisting up to 90 to 100 mg/dL (5.0-5.5 mmol/L). Whether tight control of glucose improves the efficacy of EVT after large-vessel stroke warrants appropriate testing.",Prediction of Outcomes for Ruptured Aneurysm Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776998,Stroke,2019 02 25,"Background and Purpose- Predicting long-term functional outcomes after intracranial aneurysmal rupture can be challenging. We developed and validated a scoring system-the Southwestern Aneurysm Severity Index-that would predict functional outcomes at 1 year after clipping of ruptured aneurysms. Methods- Ruptured aneurysms treated microsurgically between 2000 and 2014 were included. Outcome was defined as Glasgow Outcome Score (ranging from 1, death, to 5, good recovery) at 1 year. The Southwestern Aneurysm Severity Index is composed of multiple prospectively recorded patient demographic, clinical, radiographic, and aneurysm-specific variables. Multivariable analyses were used to construct the best predictive models for patient outcomes in a random 50% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 50%. A scoring system was created using the best model. Results- We identified 527 eligible patients. The Glasgow Outcome Score at 1 year was 4 to 5 in 375 patients (71.2%). In the multivariable logistic regression, the best predictive model for unfavorable outcome included intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio [OR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.55-4.13), aneurysmal size ‚â•20 mm (OR, 6.07; 95% CI, 1.92-19.2), intraventricular hemorrhage (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.15-5.67), age >64 (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.70-7.35), location (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.10-3.03), and hydrocephalus (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.07-5.35). The Southwestern Aneurysm Severity Index predicts Glasgow Outcome Score at 1 year with good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, derivation: 0.816, 95% CI, 0.759-0.873; validation: 0.803, 95% CI, 0.746-0.861) and accurate calibration ( R2=0.939). Conclusions- The Southwestern Aneurysm Severity Index has been internally validated to predict 1 year Glasgow Outcome Scores at initial presentation, thus optimizing patient or family counseling and possibly guiding therapeutic efforts.",Systematic Review on Kinematic Assessments of Upper Limb Movements After Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776997,Stroke,2019 02 25,"Background and Purpose- Assessing upper limb movements poststroke is crucial to monitor and understand sensorimotor recovery. Kinematic assessments are expected to enable a sensitive quantification of movement quality and distinguish between restitution and compensation. The nature and practice of these assessments are highly variable and used without knowledge of their clinimetric properties. This presents a challenge when interpreting and comparing results. The purpose of this review was to summarize the state of the art regarding kinematic upper limb assessments poststroke with respect to the assessment task, measurement system, and performance metrics with their clinimetric properties. Subsequently, we aimed to provide evidence-based recommendations for future applications of upper limb kinematics in stroke recovery research. Methods- A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and IEEE Xplore. Studies investigating clinimetric properties of applied metrics were assessed for risk of bias using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist. The quality of evidence for metrics was determined according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results- A total of 225 studies (N=6197) using 151 different kinematic metrics were identified and allocated to 5 task and 3 measurement system groups. Thirty studies investigated clinimetrics of 62 metrics: reliability (n=8), measurement error (n=5), convergent validity (n=22), and responsiveness (n=2). The metrics task/movement time, number of movement onsets, number of movement ends, path length ratio, peak velocity, number of velocity peaks, trunk displacement, and shoulder flexion/extension received a sufficient evaluation for one clinimetric property. Conclusions- Studies on kinematic assessments of upper limb sensorimotor function are poorly standardized and rarely investigate clinimetrics in an unbiased manner. Based on the available evidence, recommendations on the assessment task, measurement system, and performance metrics were made with the goal to increase standardization. Further high-quality studies evaluating clinimetric properties are needed to validate kinematic assessments, with the long-term goal to elucidate upper limb sensorimotor recovery poststroke.

Effects of antiplatelet agents may vary by time to loading dose (TLD). We explored the risk of recurrent events and safety and efficacy of ticagrelor versus aspirin in relation to TLD. Methods- We randomized 13‚Äâ199 patients with noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke, or high-risk transient ischemic attack to 90-day ticagrelor or aspirin treatment within 24 hours of symptom onset. For this analysis, 13‚Äâ126 patients were categorized by TLD as <12 hours or ‚â•12 hours from start of index event. The primary end point was the composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days. Major bleeding was the primary safety end point. Results- TLD was <12 hours in 4403 (33.5%) and ‚â•12 hours in 8723 (66.5%). The Kaplan-Meier% for the primary end point for all patients with TLD<12 hours was 7.5% versus 6.9% in TLD‚â•12 hours. Among patients with TLD<12 hours, the primary end point occurred in 147/2196 (6.8%) randomized to ticagrelor and in 184/2207 (8.3%) randomized to aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.98; P=0.036). Among patients with TLD‚â•12 hours, the primary end point occurred in 6.7% patients randomized to ticagrelor versus 7.0% to aspirin (hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.12; P=0.55). There was no significant treatment-by-TLD interaction. Major bleeding rates were comparable on ticagrelor and aspirin, regardless of TLD. Conclusions- The event rate for the primary end point was higher in patients treated early (<12 hours) versus later (‚â•12 hours). In this exploratory analysis, a larger numerical difference in the primary end point was observed among patients on ticagrelor than on aspirin when TLD was <12 hours compared with ‚â•12 hours, although the interaction terms for treatment-by-TLD were not significant. For major bleeding, no relation to TLD was observed. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT01994720.",Effect of Workflow Improvements in Endovascular Stroke Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776995,Stroke,2019 02 25,"Background and Purpose- Rapid initiation of endovascular stroke treatment is associated with better clinical outcome. The effect of specific improvements is not well known. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of specific workflow improvements on time to treatment and outcome. Methods- A random-effects meta-analysis was used to evaluate the difference in mean time to treatment between intervention group and control group. Secondary outcomes included good functional outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). Results- Fifty-one studies (3 randomized controlled trials, 13 prepost intervention studies, and 35 observational studies) with in total 8467 patients were included. Most frequently reported workflow intervention types concerned anesthetic management (n=26), in-hospital patient transfer management (n=14), and prehospital management (n=11). Patients in the intervention group had shorter time to treatment intervals (weighted mean difference, 26 minutes; 95% CI, 19-33; P<0.001) compared with controls. Subgroup meta-analysis of intervention types also showed a shorter time to treatment in the intervention group: a mean difference of 12 minutes (95% CI, 6-17; P<0.001) for anesthetic management, 37 minutes (95% CI, 22-52; P<0.001) for prehospital management, 41 minutes (95% CI, 27-54; P<0.001) for in-hospital patient transfer management, 47 minutes (95% CI, 28-67; P<0.001) for teamwork, and 64 minutes (95% CI, 24-104; P=0.002) for feedback. The mean difference in time to treatment of studies with multiple interventions implemented simultaneously was 50 minutes (95% CI, 31-69; P<0.001) in favor of the intervention group. Patients in the intervention group had increased likelihood of favorable outcome (risk ratio [RR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15-1.66; P<0.001). Conclusions- Interventions in the workflow of endovascular stroke treatment lead to a significant reduction in time to treatment and results in an increased likelihood of favorable outcome. Acute stroke care should be reorganized by making use of the examples of workflow interventions described in this review to ensure the best medical care for stroke patients.",Impact of Balloon Guide Catheter Use on Clinical and Angiographic Outcomes in the STRATIS Stroke Thrombectomy Registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776994,Stroke,2019 02 25,"Background and Purpose- Mechanical thrombectomy has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, the impact of balloon guide catheter (BGC) use is not well established. Methods- STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter study of patients with large vessel occlusion treated with the Solitaire stent retriever as first-line therapy. In this study, an independent core laboratory, blinded to the clinical outcomes, reviewed all procedures and angiographic data to classify procedural technique, target clot location, recanalization after each pass, and determine the number of stent retriever passes. The primary clinical end point was functional independence (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2) at 3 months as determined on-site, and the angiographic end point was first-pass effect (FPE) success rate from a single device attempt (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, ‚â•2c) as determined by a core laboratory. Achieving modified FPE (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction, ‚â•2b) was also assessed. Comparisons of clinical outcomes were made between groups and adjusted for baseline and procedural characteristics. All participating centers received institutional review board approval from their respective institutions. Results- Adjunctive technique groups included BGC (n=445), distal access catheter (n=238), and conventional guide catheter (n=62). The BGC group had a higher rate of FPE following first pass (212/443 [48%]) versus conventional guide catheter (16/62 [26%]; P=0.001) and distal access catheter (83/235 [35%]; P=0.002). Similarly, the BGC group had a higher rate of modified FPE (294/443 [66%]) versus conventional guide catheter (26/62 [42%]; P<0.001) and distal access catheter (129/234 [55%]; P=0.003). The BGC group achieved the highest rate of functional independence (253/415 [61%]) versus conventional guide catheter (23/55 [42%]; P=0.007) and distal access catheter (113/218 [52%]; P=0.027). Final revascularization and mortality rates did not differ across the groups. Conclusions- BGC use was an independent predictor of FPE, modified FPE, and functional independence, suggesting that its routine use may improve the rates of early revascularization success and good clinical outcomes.

Polymer edition,2019 03 25,"High density polyethylene (HDPE) is a synthetic biomaterial used as a three-dimensional scaffold for bone defect reconstruction. Reports differ with regard to its biological response, particularly its osteoconductive capacity. The aim of the present work was to histologically and histomorphometrically evaluate tissue response to porous HDPE. An in vivo study was conducted in rat tibia to evaluate osteogenic capacity, angiogenesis, inflammatory response, and the presence of multinucleated giant cells 14 and 60‚Äâdays post-biomaterial implantation. Histological examination 14‚Äâdays post-implantation showed fibrovascular tissue inside pores and on the surface of porous HDPE, acute inflammatory response, scant multinucleated giant cells (MNGCs), and lamellar bone in contact with the biomaterial. An increase in the proportion of lamellar bone tissue, no inflammatory response, and a decrease in the number of MNGCs were observed at 60‚Äâdays. The histomorphometric study showed a significant time-dependent increase both in the area of bone tissue formed in contact with the porous HDPE (14d: 24.450‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ11.623 ¬µm2 vs. 60d: 77.104‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ26.217 ¬µm2, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) and in the percentage of bone tissue in contact with the porous HDPE (osseointegration). A significant decrease in the number of MNGCs was also observed at 60‚Äâdays post-implantation. Porous HDPE showed adequate osteoconductive properties, and only caused an initial inflammatory response. Although this biomaterial has traditionally been used juxtaosseoulsy, its adequate osteoconductive properties broaden the scope of its application to include intraosseous placement.",Evaluation of a human glycated hemoglobin test in canine diabetes mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776981,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",2019 05 22,"Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is widely used for monitoring and diagnosing human diabetes mellitus, but is rarely used in veterinary clinics. The goal of our study was to validate the commercial HbA1c testing system SD A1cCare analyzer (Bionote, Gyeoggi-do, South Korea) for use in dogs. Dogs were recruited with owner's consent. Diabetic status was determined based on clinical signs, fasting hyperglycemia, and glycosuria. Intra-assay precision and linearity were evaluated with EDTA, heparin, or citrate as anticoagulants, and had excellent precision with mean coefficients of variation (CVs) of 2.47%, 2.26%, and 1.92%, respectively. Diluted anticoagulated blood samples showed excellent linear relationships with R2 of 0.991, 0.996, and 0.994, respectively. Inter-assay precision revealed that the mean CV of the normal control was 2.18% and that of the high control was 2.01% (30 repeats). Observed total error of a normal control was 7.81%, and 6.12% for the high control. HbA1c level measured before and after removal of plasma and replacement by saline showed minimal interference by lipid contents ( p = 0.929). The HbA1c concentrations of diabetic dogs were significantly higher than those of non-diabetic dogs ( p < 0.001). HbA1c value >6.2% indicated canine diabetes through a classification and regression tree model. In most cases, fructosamine and HbA1c were highly correlated ( r = 0.674, p < 0.001). The HbA1c testing system could be a valuable testing system to evaluate canine diabetes mellitus, providing an alternative in-house option for use by veterinary clinicians.",Handedness of structural units depends on their mutual arrangement in protein structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776980,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 03 04,Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.,Social work intervention for women experiencing early pregnancy loss in the emergency department.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776979,Social work in health care,2019 03 15,"Often referred to as miscarriage, Early Pregnancy Loss (EPL) is the spontaneous death of a fetus experienced within the first 20 weeks of gestation and is the most common complication in pregnancy. Symptoms of an impending EPL are routinely managed in the Emergency Department (ED). EPL can have a substantial impact on women, potentially leading to psychological and emotional health issues and risks to future pregnancies. Despite the high prevalence of EPL, many women suffer in silence due to the common societal belief that EPL are insignificant. Many women experience EPL as an ambiguous loss and are at risk for disenfranchised grief. Compassionate, patient-centred care has been identified by women as an essential and often missing aspect of ED care and can have a profound impact on the overall well-being of women after EPL. Social workers play a critical role in the ED given that they prioritize the psychosocial well-being of patients in a system that is structured to primarily address trauma care. In an effort to reduce the psychological impact and complicated grief reactions of women experiencing EPL, specific recommendations for social work intervention to address the individual needs of women experiencing EPL in the ED are presented. These include acknowledging the loss, providing psychoeducation, honouring the loss, assessing resources, referral and additional information, and building capacity in the ED.",Nut Consumption in Relation to Cardiovascular Disease Incidence and Mortality Among Patients With Diabetes Mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776978,Circulation research,2019 03 29,The evidence regarding the potential health benefits of nut consumption among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus is limited.,"Clinical Characteristics, Complications, and Reasons for Readmission following Lingual Tonsillectomy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776976,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,2019 04 01,"This brief communication regards the indications and complications for and rates of readmission following lingual tonsillectomy. The National Readmissions Database (NRD) 2013-2014 was queried for all cases of lingual tonsillectomy occurring from 2013 to 2014. Among 602 lingual tonsillectomies (mean age 36.5 years, 58.2% male), the common indications for surgery were obstructive sleep apnea (58.7%), lingual tonsil hypertrophy/infection (18.8%), and neoplasia (15.9%). Overall, 49 (8.2%) of the cases were readmitted (95% confidence interval, 4.8%-13.5%), with an average readmission duration of 3.0 days and average readmission cost of $25.4K. The most common diagnoses at readmission were bleeding (1.9% of all lingual tonsillectomy cases); dysphagia (1.7%); fever, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea (1.6%); acute pain (1.6%); and airway obstruction (1.4%). There were no mortalities during primary or subsequent admissions. Lingual tonsillectomy across age groups is relatively free of adverse events, with overall readmission and complication rates similar to those of palatine tonsillectomy.","Aging, Arterial Stiffness, and Blood Pressure Association in Chinese Adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776974,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 03 13,"Arterial stiffness and blood pressure (BP) both increase with aging synchronously. Whether elevated BP results from thickening of arterial wall or vice versa is controversial in previous studies. This study included 17‚Äâ862 participants without history of myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation or flutter, or cancer and with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and BP measurements during 2010 to 2016. Age was calculated from the self-reported birthdate to the first date of baPWV examination. Mediation analyses were applied to assess the mediation effect by baPWV in the association between age and BP. Temporal relation between baPWV and BP was assessed by cross-lagged analyses among 1508 participants with repeated assessment of baPWV. We found that systolic BP increased 0.47 (95% CI, 0.45-0.49) mm‚ÄâHg per 1 year older by the mediation effect of baPWV and that the direct effect of aging on systolic BP was -0.07 (95% CI, -0.09 to -0.05) mm‚ÄâHg per 1 year older. The standard regression coefficient from baseline baPWV to follow-up systolic BP was 0.09 (95% CI, 0.04-0.15), which was greater than the standard regression coefficient from baseline systolic BP to follow-up baPWV (0.01; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.06). Arterial stiffness mediated the positive association between aging and BP, and arterial stiffness might precede elevated BP. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn .

Associations between higher prior cognitive function and less hypertension persist even when accounting for socioeconomic status, but socioeconomic status-hypertension gradients are more pronounced in women. We predicted that differences in hypertension development between sexes might be associated with cognitive function and its interaction with sex, such that higher early-life cognitive function would be associated with lower hypertension risk more in women than in men. We used accelerated failure time modeling with the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979. Cognitive function was assessed in youth, when participants were aged between 14 and 21 years. Of 2572 men and 2679 women who completed all assessments, 977 men and 940 women reported hypertension diagnoses by 2015. Socioeconomic status in youth and adulthood were investigated as covariates, as were components of adult socioeconomic status: education, occupational status, and family income. An SD of higher cognitive function in youth was associated with reduced hypertension risk (acceleration factor: ƒâ=0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; P=0.001). The overall effect was stronger in women (sex√ócognitive function: ƒâ=0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99; P=0.010); especially, higher functioning women were less at risk than their male counterparts. This interaction was itself attenuated by a sex by family income interaction. People with better cognitive function in youth, especially women, are less likely to develop hypertension later in life. Income differences accounted for these associations. Possible causal explanations are discussed.",Inflammation and Apparent Treatment-Resistant Hypertension in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776971,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 04 24,"Apparent treatment-resistant hypertension (ATRH) is highly prevalent and associated with cardiovascular disease risk in patients with chronic kidney disease. We analyzed the association of inflammatory biomarkers with ATRH and its complications in patients with chronic kidney disease. ATRH was defined as blood pressure ‚â•140/90 mm‚ÄâHg while taking ‚â•3 antihypertensive medications or blood pressure <140/90 mm‚ÄâHg while taking ‚â•4 medications. Analyses included 1359 CRIC study (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) participants with ATRH and 2008 hypertensive participants without. Logistic regression was used to examine cross-sectional associations of inflammatory biomarkers and ATRH adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors and treatments. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of inflammatory biomarkers on associations of ATRH with composite cardiovascular disease and mortality beyond conventional risk factors. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) of ATRH for the highest tertile versus the lowest tertile of inflammatory biomarker levels was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.05-1.59) for IL (interleukin)-6, 1.49 (95% CI, 1.20-1.85) for TNF-Œ± (tumor necrosis factor-Œ±), and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.95) for TGF-Œ≤ (transforming growth factor-Œ≤). High-sensitivity CRP (C-reactive protein), fibrinogen, IL-1Œ≤, and IL-1 receptor antagonist were not significantly associated with ATRH. Adding inflammatory biomarkers to Cox models did not attenuate the significant association of ATRH with cardiovascular disease and mortality. Our findings show higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-Œ± and lower levels of TGF-Œ≤ were independently associated with odds of ATRH.

HET domain genes are commonly found in Pezizomycotina genomes and are functionally characterized in only a few species. Here, we compared 44 HET domain genes between an incompatible strain pair of Aspergillus oryzae RIB40 and RIB128 and performed inter-strain expression of 37 sequence-diverse genes for mimicking HI. Four HET domain genes were identified to cause severe growth inhibition in a strain- or sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, SNPs responsible for the inhibition of cell growth were identified. This study provides an important insight into the physiological significance of sequence diversity of HET domain genes and their potential functions in HI of A. oryzae."

Thirty-nine men were purposively sampled for the in-depth individual semistructured interviews from June to October 2017 to investigate their perceptions of the HPV vaccine and the barriers for them to receive the vaccination. Limited knowledge and awareness of HPV-related issues, low perceived risk of HPV infection, perceived association between HPV vaccine and promiscuity, and lack of accessible official information on HPV-related topics were identified as the key barriers. These barriers intermingled with the sociocultural environment, cultural values of sexuality, and patriarchal gender values. HPV vaccine is shown to be socially constructed as a vaccine for women exclusively and for promiscuity. The participants were discouraged from receiving HPV vaccination because of its signaling of socially deviant promiscuity. Cultural taboo on sex served as a social oppression of open discussion about HPV vaccine and affected the participants' perceived need of vaccination. Perceived insignificance of reproductive organs also influenced the participants' perceived need of vaccination.",Descriptive epidemiology and test characteristics of cats diagnosed with Microsporum canis dermatophytosis in a Northwestern US animal shelter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776947,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2019 02 19,"The aims of this descriptive study were to identify risk factors for feline Microsporum canis infection at shelter intake, to describe screening test accuracy, and to refine confirmatory testing time frames.",Paternal Postnatal Depression Among Fathers of Newborn in Saudi Arabia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776946,American journal of men's health,2019 02 19,"Paternal postnatal depression (PPND) is not a commonly recognized phenomenon. The aim of the study was to identify the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) cutoff for Saudi fathers, to estimate PPND prevalence and to determine the risk factors of PPND among fathers of newborn in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study of fathers with babies born up to 6 months prior to the survey was conducted. Fathers were screened using EPDS and demographic questionnaire. The fathers were selected using systematic random sampling from visitors to the birth registration office. A subsample of participants from the postnatal wards in a tertiary care was invited for additional evaluation by a psychologist using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for major depressive disorders. Receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized to identify fathers with depression; a cutoff of 8/9 was optimal to achieve sensitivity 77.8% and specificity 81.3%. Adjusted prevalence of PPND was reported with corresponding Wilson 95% confidence interval. Two hundred and ninety fathers completed the EPDS and demographic questionnaire. Of 72 invited participants, 57 (79.16%) attended the diagnostic interview. The average age of fathers was 34.97 ¬± 8.56 years, the average maternal age was 29.18 ¬± 7.41 years, average age of the newborn was 43.13 ¬± 35.88 days. PPND adjusted prevalence was 16.6% (95% CI [8.5, 25.6]). Paternal mental health needs equal attention during and postdelivery of newborn. Fathers should receive perinatal and postnatal mental health assessment to prevent behavioral problems in their children and disruption of relationship with their spouse."

T2D has been shown to suppress the immune response. However, it remains unclear if immune activation occurs before the onset of T2D during the progression of the pre-diabetic state. This study sought to characterize the changes in general immunity occurring during the progression from pre-diabetes to T2D. Male rats were fed a high-fat high-carbohydrate diet for 20‚Äâweeks (pre-diabetes induction period) and kept on the same diet being monitored for a further 12‚Äâweeks (experimental period). Blood was collected for haemocytometer analysis on week 0, 4, 8, and 12 of the experimental period after which the animals were sacrificed. Plasma was collected from centrifuged blood for ELISA (TNF-Œ±, CRP, P-selectin, CD40‚ÄâL, fibrinogen, and IL-6). Blood neutrophils percentage significantly decreased at week 12 possibly due to recruited neutrophils migrating to an inflamed area such as visceral adipose tissue as further observed. Due to hyperglycaemia, there was significant increase in blood lymphocytes percentage at week 12. Blood monocytes percentage significantly increased at week 12. Monocytes recruited and circulated in blood due to hyperglycaemia for glucose uptake to decrease it from circulation. Blood eosinophils percentage significantly decreased at week 12. Eosinophils migrated to inflamed areas such as visceral adipose tissue as further observed. Blood basophils percentage significantly increased due to their recruitment and activation. TNF-Œ±, CRP, and IL-6 increased significantly after 12‚Äâweeks. There was also upregulation of fibrinogen, P-selectin, and CD40L. The results of this study show that there are changes in immune cells concentration and that immune cells such as neutrophils and eosinophils migrate to inflamed areas such as adipose tissue. There is also upregulation of various inflammatory cytokines. Based on these findings, immune activation begins during the pre-diabetic state as there is upregulation of inflammatory markers.",A patent update on therapeutic applications of urease inhibitors (2012-2018).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776929,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,2019 04 03,"Urease is a nickel-containing metalloenzyme that is commonly found in different bacteria, plants, algae, and fungi and mediates the growth of many pathogenic bacteria in the acidic environment of the stomach. Despite the large number of molecules known to have excellent urease inhibitory activity, there is an alarming lack of urease inhibitor drugs on the market. Area covered: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the different types of molecules patented as potent urease inhibitors from the year 2012 to 2018. Expert opinion: Urease is an important target to treat urease-related bacterial infections manifesting as gastric ulcers, urinary tract infections, and kidney stones. Although many different molecules as inhibitors of urease have been reported, only a few have advanced to clinical trials. The development of new effective urease inhibitors demands new suitable lead molecules.

Assistive technology,2019 02 19,"Assistive Technology (AT) product use occurs within a socio-cultural setting. The growth internationally in the AT product market suggests that designers need to be aware of the influences that diverse cultures may have on the societal perception of an AT product through its semantic attributes. The study aimed to evaluate the visual interaction with an AT product by young adults from Pakistan, a collectivist society, and the United Kingdom (UK), an individualist society. A paper-based questionnaire survey was carried out with 281 first-year undergraduate students from the UK and Pakistan to evaluate their perception towards the visual representation of a generic conventional wheelchair image. A semantics differential (SD) scale method was used involving a seven-point bipolar SD scale incorporating sixteen pairs of adjectives defining functional, meaning, and usability attributes of the product. The mean (M) and standard deviation (sd) values were obtained for each pair of adjectives and compared between both groups by employing appropriate parametric tests. The results show that having a diverse cultural background did not appear to have overtly influenced the meanings ascribed to the generic manual wheelchair, which was unexpected. The University 'Internationalist' environment may have influenced the results. Some minor but critical differences were found for some pairs of adjectives (bulky-compact, heavy-light), having p-value less than .05 (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ.05) that related to previous experience of wheelchairs and/or their use. Further studies are planned to investigate and validate outcomes with other student and non-student groups. Implications for Rehabilitation The semantic attributes of assistive technologies highlight a number of aspects that have implications for those involved in Assistive Technology (AT) product development, manufacturing and marketing. ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉFor online sales, the AT products rely on the web page image to communicate the purpose and attributes of the product. There are limited explorations related to the semantic/communicative attributes of AT product presented in images, as perceived by individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉThe knowledge towards semantic meaning ascribed to the AT product is important to investigate to provide a perspective that goes beyond practical functions of the AT product towards the communicative function. ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉInformation of comprehending semantics and significance of the AT product from a social (non-users) viewpoint may benefits manufacturers in the development of AT products that best meet the societal needs, preferences and expectations. ‚Ä¢‚ÄÉA model of best practice, with a focus on semantic manipulation will offer Industrial Designers (ID) internationally with the suitable process and tools to reframe perceptions of disability and enhance acceptance of AT products not only for users, but also for the society around them.",Derotation of the Talus and Arthrodesis Treatment of Stages II-V M√ºller-Weiss Disease: Midterm Results of 36 Cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776926,Foot & ankle international,2019 04 30,Various operative procedures have been reported for the treatment of M√ºller-Weiss disease (MWD).

However, when tenders are managed in European countries, the Public Procurement Directive states that the tender score for price should be kept separate from that of clinical benefits. As a result, the traditional mathematical approach of NMB must be rearranged to comply with this administrative requirement.","Iron Dyshomeostasis Induces Binding of APP to BACE1 for Amyloid Pathology, and Impairs APP/Fpn1 Complex in Microglia: Implication in Pathogenesis of Cerebral Microbleeds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776900,Cell transplantation,2019 02 19,"As a putative marker of cerebral small vessel disease, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) have been associated with vascular cognitive impairment. Both iron accumulation and amyloid protein precursor (APP) dysregulation are recognized as pathological hallmarks underlying the progression of CMBs, but their cross-talk is not yet understood. In this study, we found a profound increase of amyloid formation with increasing FeCl3 treatment, and a distinct change in APP metabolism and expression of iron homeostasis proteins (ferritin, Fpn1, iron regulatory protein) was observed at the 300 uM concentration of FeCl3. Further results revealed that extracellular iron accumulation might potentially induce binding of APP to BACE1 for amyloid formation and decrease the capability of APP/Fpn1 in mediating iron export. Our findings in this study, reflecting a probable relationship between iron dyshomeostasis and amyloid pathology, may help shed light on the underlying pathogenesis of CMBs in vascular cognitive impairment.",Prebiotic supplementation over a cold season and during antibiotic treatment specifically modulates the gut microbiota composition of 3-6 year-old children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776899,Beneficial microbes,2019 04 22,"Supplementing kindergarten children during a cold season with a prebiotic inulin-type fructans product with shorter and longer fructan chains has been shown to reduce febrile episodes requiring medical attention and to lower the incidence of sinusitis. These beneficial effects may be connected to the specific modulation of children's gut microbiota. By applying quantitative and qualitative microbiota analysis this study aimed at characterising the gut microbiota composition and at exploring effects of prebiotic intervention on the gut microbiota during a 24-weeks intervention and during antibiotic treatment in healthy children. The study was a randomised, placebo-controlled trial with 258 healthy children aged 3 to 6 years consuming 6 g/day prebiotic inulin-type fructans or maltodextrin. During the course of the study, faecal samples were collected and subject to targeted qPCR analysis and phylogenetic profiling by multiplexed high throughput sequencing of the prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicons. The microbiota composition of the cohort could be clustered into three distinct constellations (enterotypes). Prebiotic intake resulted in a selective modulation of the gut microbiota composition. Relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was significantly higher in the prebiotic group (n=104) compared to control group (n=105) and this effect was found for all three enterotypes. Antibiotic administration decreased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in both groups. Nonetheless, children of the prebiotic group receiving antibiotic treatment displayed significantly higher levels of Bifidobacterium than children receiving the placebo control. Prebiotic supplementation induced specific changes in the gut microbiota composition of children aged 3 to 6 years. Moreover, it attenuated antibiotic-induced disturbances in the gut microbiota composition as shown by higher relative abundance of bifidobacteria at the end of the antibiotic treatment in the prebiotic group. With the previously reported benefits on immune function, the study contributes to the evidence on the immune-modulating effects of prebiotics through gut microbiota modifications.

Herein, we designed a poly(d,l-lactic- co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based theranostic nanoplatform using the double emulsion solvent evaporation method (W/O/W), which is associated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) modifications, to codeliver indocyanine green (ICG), a widely used near-infrared (NIR) dye, and doxorubicin (Dox), a chemotherapeutic drug, for dual-modality imaging-guided chemo-photothermal combination cancer therapy. The resultant ICG/Dox co-loaded hybrid PLGA nanoparticles (denoted as IDPNs) had a diameter of around 200 nm and exhibited excellent monodispersity, fluorescence/size stability, and biocompatibility. It was confirmed that IDPNs displayed a photothermal effect and that the heat induced faster release of Dox, which led to enhanced drug accumulation in cells and was followed by their efficient escape from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm and drug diffusion into the nucleus, resulting in a chemo-photothermal combinatorial therapeutic effect in vitro. Moreover, the IDPNs exhibited a high ability to accumulate in tumor tissue, owing to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, and could realize real-time fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging of solid tumors with a high spatial resolution. In addition, the exposure of tumor regions to NIR irradiation could enhance the tumor penetration ability of IDPNs, almost eradicating subcutaneous tumors. In addition, the inhibition rate of IDPNs used in combination with laser irradiation against EMT-6 tumors in tumor-bearing nude mice (chemo-photothermal therapy) was approximately 95.6%, which was much higher than that for chemo- or photothermal treatment alone. Our study validated the fact that the use of well-defined IDPNs with NIR laser treatment could be a promising strategy for the early diagnosis and passive tumor-targeted chemo-photothermal therapy for cancer.",Facile Preparation of a Hierarchical C/rGO/FeO x Composite with Superior Microwave Absorption Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776895,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 12,"A hierarchical carbon/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/FeO x (CGF) composite has been successfully prepared utilizing a sequential process of immersion and carbonization.

Therefore, the hierarchical structure is constructed in one step. The CGF composite exhibits a maximum reflection loss of as much as -51.2 dB and an ultrawide effective absorption bandwidth of 8.2 GHz. Detailed investigation suggests that the hierarchical structure contributes to the superb microwave absorption performance significantly through enhancing the interfacial polarization and inducing multireflection of microwave.

These short vibrational lifetimes, which are actually reproduced by current first-principles nonadiabatic calculations, are attributed to the rapid vibrational energy loss that is caused by the facile excitation of electron-hole pairs in metals. However, this explanation was recently questioned by the huge discrepancy that exists for CO on Au(111) between the experimental vibrational lifetime that is larger than 100 ps and the previous theoretical predictions of 4.8 and 1.6 ps. Here, we show that the state-of-the-art nonadiabatic theory does reproduce the long CO lifetime measured in Au(111) provided the molecule-surface interaction is properly described. Importantly, our new results confirm that the current understanding of the adsorbates' vibrational relaxation at metal surfaces is indeed valid."

Dialysis staff should be familiar with the action plan for natural disaster events that disrupt hemodialysis, such as outages and water treatment system failures caused by earthquakes. Patients on hemodialysis also need to be educated about disaster preparedness. In the event of a disaster situation that results in dialysis failure, patients need to know what to do. At the local and national government level, long-term preparations should be made to handle renal disaster and patient safety logistics.

Pain is experienced by 55% of patients undergoing anti-cancer treatment and by 66% of patients who have advanced, metastatic, or terminal disease. This can be relieved in most cases through medicines and other treatments. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed Guidelines for the pharmacologic and radiotherapeutic management of cancer pain in adults and adolescents to provide evidence-based guidance to initiating and managing cancer pain. The aims of these guidelines are to provide guidance to health-care providers (i.e. the end-users of these guidelines: physicians, nurses, pharmacists and caregivers) on the adequate relief of pain associated with cancer. They also assist policy-makers, programme managers and public health personnel to create and facilitate appropriately balanced policies on opioids and prescribing regulations for effective and safe cancer pain management. Proper and effective stewardship of opioid analgesics in the cancer treatment setting is essential to ensure the safety of patients and to reduce the risk of diversion of medicine into society. The goal of cancer pain management is to relieve pain to a level that allows for an acceptable quality of life. The last set of WHO guidelines focused on cancer pain management were issued in 1996. The clinical guidelines and recommendations in this document are organized into three focal areas: ‚Ä¢ Analgesia of cancer pain: This addresses the choice of analgesic medicine when initiating pain relief and the choice of opioid for maintenance of pain relief, including optimization of rescue medication, route of administration, and opioid rotation and cessation. ‚Ä¢ Adjuvant medicines for cancer pain: This includes the use of steroids, antidepressants and anticonvulsants as adjuvant medicines. ‚Ä¢ Management of pain related to bone metastases: This incorporates the use of bisphosphonates and radiotherapy to manage bone metastases.",[Discussion about the safety of outpatient thyroid surgery].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776873,Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,2019 04 03,"Thyroid tumors are one of the most common diseases, and the thyroidectomy surgery increases.

People with auditory neuropathy may have normal hearing threshold, or hearing loss ranging from mild to severe; they always have poor speech-perception abilities. It is a heterogeneous disorder which can have either congenital or acquired causes. AN may result from specific loss of cochlear inner hair cells, disordered release of neurotransmitters by inner hair cell ribbon synapses, deafferentation accompanying loss of auditory nerve fibers, neural dys-synchrony or conduction block as a result of demyelination of nerve fibers and auditory nerve hypoplasia. Although the definition of AN includes the central part, its incidence is low, and the etiology and pathology are not clear.

These effects can be useful to probe the stereochemistry (axial or equatorial) of the C‚îÄH and C‚îÄF bonds, respectively. The origin of these effects has been debatable in the literature as being due to hyperconjugative interactions, dipolar effects, and induced current density. Accordingly, a variety of model compounds has been used to probe such effects since the cyclohexanone carbonyl group and the endocyclic heteroatom lone pairs play different roles on the above-mentioned effects. Thus, the 1 JC‚îÄF SSCC in fluorinated lactams and lactones were theoretically studied to gain further insight on the nature of the fluorine Perlin-like effect. In addition, because the intramolecular Œ±-effect has recently gained attention for its importance in the reactivity and stereoelectronic interactions in peroxide compounds, some fluorinated 1,2-dioxanes and 1,2-dithianes were studied to evaluate the role of the Œ±-effect on the behavior of 1 JC‚îÄF SSCCs. Differently from fluorinated ketones and ethers, the fluorine Perlin-like effect in the amides and esters cannot be explained by hyperconjugative or dipolar interactions alone, because the resonance in these groups affect the 1 JC‚îÄF values. The O‚îÄO and S‚îÄS-containing systems exhibit a strong fluorine Perlin-like effect, but unlike the Œ±-effect, this behavior cannot be explained neither by hyperconjugation nor by dipolar interactions alone; the spatial proximity of the C‚îÄF and O‚îÄO/S‚îÄS bonds is proposed to affect the magnitude of the 1 JC‚îÄF SSCC.",The prevalence and diagnosis of 'stereoblindness' in adults less than 60¬†years of age: a best evidence synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776852,Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists),2019 03 13,"Stereoscopic vision (or stereopsis) is the ability to perceive depth from binocular disparity - the difference of viewpoints between the two eyes.

In this work, we present a new algorithm to reconstruct high quality CBCT images by simultaneously reconstructing images and generating an associated respiratory motion model. This is done by updating model parameters to compensate for motion during the iterative image reconstruction process. CBCT image acquisition was simulated using the digital eXternal CArdiac Torso (XCAT) phantom, simulating breathing motion using four patient breathing traces. 4DCBCT images were reconstructed using the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), and compared to the proposed motion-compensated SART (McSART) algorithm. McSART used a motion model that describes tissue position as a function of diaphragm amplitude and velocity. The McSART algorithm alternately updated the motion model and image reconstruction, increasing the number of projections used for image reconstruction with every iteration. The model was able to interpolate and extrapolate deformations according to the magnitude of the surrogate signal. Without noise, the final iteration McSART images had HU errors at 31%, 34%, and 44% of their SART-reconstructed counterparts compared to ground truth XCAT images, with corresponding root-mean-square (RMS) motion model errors of 0.75‚Äâmm, 1.08‚Äâmm, and 1.17‚Äâmm respectively. With added image noise, McSART's HU error was 31% of the SART-reconstructed 4DCBCT error, with a 1.43‚Äâmm RMS motion model error. Qualitatively, blurring and streaking artifacts were reduced in all the reconstructed images compared to 3D or SART-reconstructed 4DCBCT. The output of the algorithm was a high quality reference image and a corresponding motion model, that could be used to deform the reference image to any other point in a breathing cycle.","Recent progress in 2D group IV-IV monochalcogenides: synthesis, properties and applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776787,Nanotechnology,2019 04 09,"Coordination-related, 2D structural phase transitions are a fascinating facet of 2D materials with structural degeneracy.

It is important to consider the environmental behavior of farmers when exploring the causes of NPS pollution as well as when establishing scientific controls and management measures. However, the poor understanding of factors influencing the environmental behavior of farmers and the lack of a suitable environmental socio-psychological model limit the application of the environmental behavior of farmers in NPS pollution management. In this study, we therefore integrated the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the protection motivation theory (PMT) to identify the main determinants of the NPS pollution-related environmental behavior and intention of farmers in the Water Source Area of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China. Results indicated that the integrated model provided a better understanding of the environmental behavior and intention of farmers than that provided by each component when used individually, and revealed that farmers perceived that the susceptibility and severity of threats caused by water deterioration influenced environmental intention through the mediating effects of subjective norm and attitude toward adopting pro-environmental behavior. At the same time, the perceived vulnerability of farmers was relatively high and their perceived severity was relatively low. Furthermore, the subjective norm, attitude, self-efficacy (i.e., the perceived behavioral control), and response efficacy positively and significantly influenced intention. However, response cost had a significantly negative effect on intention. Among them, subjective norm had the largest effect on intention. Intention was the key determinant for the actual environmental behavior of farmers, while self-efficacy also had a significantly positive effect on behavior. Managing and controlling agricultural NPS pollution requires a multi-disciplinary and comprehensive approach. Therefore, an integrated theoretical framework was developed in this study by integrating TPB and PMT to gain insight into the environmental behaviors and intention of farmers. The results provided a theoretical basis for NPS pollution control.",Ecotourism affects breeding in sergeant major damselfish (Abudefduf saxatilis).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776769,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"We studied the effect of tourist activity on the reproductive success of sergeant major damselfish (Abudefduf saxatilis).

The NEDD4L gene encodes a member of the Nedd4 family of HECT domain E3 ubiquitin ligases. The target CNV located in the intron has been found to be significantly associated with height variation in Chinese. However, it remains unknown whether such an association exists in other populations, including Japanese. Analysis of the correlations between copy number and body height using ANOVA revealed no statistically significant correlations in Japanese.",Fate of a perfluoroalkyl acid mixture in an agricultural soil studied in lysimeters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776763,Chemosphere,2019 05 09,"Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are environmental contaminants of concern in both food and drinking water. PFAA fate in agricultural soil is an important determinant of PFAA contamination of groundwater and crops. The fate of C4-C14 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and two perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) in an agricultural soil was studied in a field lysimeter experiment. Soil was spiked with PFAAs at four different levels and crops were planted. PFAA concentrations in soil were measured at the beginning and end of the growing season. Lysimeter drainage water was collected and analysed. The concentrations of all PFAAs decreased in the surface soil during the growing season, with the decrease being negatively correlated with the number of fluorinated carbons in the PFAA molecule. PFAA transfer to the drainage water was also negatively correlated with the number of fluorinated carbons. For the C11-C14 PFCAs most of the decrease in soil concentration was attributed to the formation of non-extractable residues. For the remaining PFAAs leaching was the dominant removal process. Leaching was concentration dependent, with more rapid removal from the soils spiked with higher PFAA levels. Model simulations based on measured Kd values under-predicted removal by leaching. This was attributed to mixture effects that reduced PFAA sorption to soil.",Naturally occurring radioactive material and risk assessment of tailings of polymetallic and Ra/U mines from legacy sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776762,Chemosphere,2019 04 26,"Old mine tailings from Northern and Central Portugal were studied in order to perform a radiological and chemical characterization. The evaluation of massic activity of natural radionuclides and concentrations in tailings of polymetallic and Ra/U mines was performed by gamma spectrometry and neutron activation analysis. Iron speciation was carried out by M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy. In polymetallic tailings with physical ore processing (Cumieira and Verdes - exploited for Sn, Nb-Ta) higher contents of Th, 228Ra and 226Ra in the coarser materials occur, probably due to their presence in host rock and ore fragments. In finer tailings, washing may explain the lower 226Ra and 210Pb massic activity. In tailings with physical/chemical ore processing (Covas - exploited for W and Sn) high U contents and a tendency for higher 226Ra and 210Pb massic activity in the fine materials is observed, probably due to their incorporation in nano-sized particles of iron oxides. A high variation of the 210Pb/226Ra ratio occurs in polymetallic tailings; a deficit of 210Pb can be observed particularly in deposits of settling tanks drained from dumps of chemically treated ore. In Ervideira-Mestras tailings (Ra/U exploitation) where no ore process in situ was performed, a near equilibrium between 210Pb and 226Ra occurs. Dose risk assessment was carried out by calculating external outdoor Annual Effective Dose Rate; the dose rates in air due to terrestrial gamma radiation are low for the polymetallic tailings (<47‚ÄØnGy/h), and higher for tailings of Ra/U (up to 4130‚ÄØnGy/h), in the worst scenario.",Polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides can induce ROS and genotoxicity via the AhR-CYP1A1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776761,Chemosphere,2019 04 26,"Polychlorinated diphenyl sulfides (PCDPSs) are a group of chemicals that can interact and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Previous studies have shown that PCDPSs can cause oxidative stress in livers. However, information on genotoxicity of PCDPSs is limited. In this study, it is hypothesized that PCDPSs can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating the AhR and inducing expression of CYP1A1, which subsequently causes genotoxicity. HepG2 cells (transfected with AhR and CYP1A1 siRNA or not) were exposed to six PCDPSs. ROS and expression of five genes were measured to confirm relationships between genotoxicity and signaling along AhR pathway. After 24‚ÄØh, a significant concentration-dependent ROS was observed. Production of ROS varied with the number of Cl atoms. And the formation of ROS decreases with the increase of the number of Cl atoms, which was consistent with results observed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Most of the tested PCDPSs up-regulated expression of CYP1A1 enzyme via signaling AhR pathways. The exposure to 2,3',4,5-tetra-CDPS at 10‚ÄØŒºM up-regulated the CYP1A1 mRNA in HepG2 cells to 29-fold. Expression of CYP1A1 mRNA was related to the number of substituted Cl, probably due to the stronger ability of more chlorinated PCDPSs to bind to and activate the AhR. However, there was no significant quantitative relationship between expression of CYP1A1 and concentrations of ROS, probably due to other oxidases' influence. Furthermore, PCDPSs also caused induction of OGG1 and XRS2 more than 2 times, indicates oxidation of bases and breaks of strands. The transfection of cells with siRNA to silence expression of the CYP1A1 gene results in ROS at background levels, further supporting the proposed mechanism PCDPSs inducing ROS and DNA damage via the AhR-mediated pathway."

In this research, we applied the quasi-equilibrium partition model to analyze the relations for nonionic organic contaminants between plant/crop roots and external soil/water media. The model relates the in-situ root concentration factors of chemicals from external water into plant/crop roots (RCF(water)) with the system physicochemical parameters and the chemical quasi-equilibrium states with plant/crop roots (Œ±pt, ‚â§1). With known RCF(water) values, root lipid contents (flip), and octanol-water Kow's, the chemical-plant Œ±pt values and their ranges of variation at given flipKow could be calculated. Because of the inherent relation between Œ±pt and flipKow, a highly distinct correlation emerges between log RCF(water) and log flipKow (R2‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.825; n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ368), with the supporting data drawn from 19 disparate soil-plant studies covering some 6 orders of magnitude in flipKow and 4 orders of magnitude in RCF(water).

In the last few years, research has focused on a common discrepancy between low working memory and processing speed on the one hand, and high verbal and visuoperceptual intelligence on the other. SLD profiles featuring a specific discrepancy between verbal and visuoperceptual abilities have been only marginally considered, however, and their systematic comparison vis-√†-vis typically-developing (TD) populations has yet to be conducted. The present study examined a dataset of 1624 WISC-IV profiles of children with a diagnosis of SLD. It emerged that the proportion of children with a Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) at least 1.5 SD (22 standardized points) lower than their scores on the Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) was larger than the proportion of SLD children with the opposite discrepant profile; it was also larger than the same proportion found among TD children. Comparing the two discrepant profiles revealed that the children also differed by type of learning difficulty, gender, and performance in the WISC-IV Symbol search task. Further examination suggested that children who were discrepant and also distinctly poor in visuoperceptual intelligence were particularly slow in general processing."

We have previously demonstrated that CX3CR1 levels are decreased during culture and when Mo are differentiated into dendritic cells, but enhanced when differentiated into macrophages. Regarding soluble factors, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) accelerated the loss of CX3CR1, while interleukin (IL)-10 and Interferon-gamma (IFN-Œ≥) prevented it. However, the comprehensive knowledge about the intracellular pathways that underlay the level of CX3CR1 expression in Mo is still incomplete. In the current work, we studied the effect of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, IL-10), alone or together with IFN- Œ≥ on CX3CR1 expression. We found that only IL-10 and IFN-Œ≥ separately were able to prevent CX3CR1 down-modulation during culture of human Mo. Besides, Mo incubated with IL-10 plus IFN-Œ≥ showed the highest CX3CR1 expression by cell, suggesting cooperation between two different mechanism used by both cytokines. By studying intracellular mechanisms triggered by IL-10 and IFN-Œ≥, we demonstrated that they specifically induced PI3K-dependent serine-phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 or STAT1, respectively. Moreover, chemical inhibitors of STAT1 or STAT3 abrogated IFN-Œ≥ or IL-10 effects on CX3CR1 expression. Strikingly, only IL-10 increased CX3CR1 mRNA level, as consequence of augmenting mRNA stability. CX3CR1 mRNA increase was PI3K-dependent, supporting the causal link between the action of IL-10 at the CX3CR1 transcript and CX3CR1 protein level on Mo. Thus, both cytokines up-regulate CX3CR1 expression on human Mo by different intracellular mechanisms.",Test-retest reliability of elbow flexor contraction characteristics with tensiomyography for different elbow joint angles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776725,Journal of electromyography and kinesiology : official journal of the International Society of Electrophysiological Kinesiology,2019 05 07,"Tensiomyography (TMG) has gained popularity as a tool to quantify muscle contractile properties. However, it is unclear whether joint angle and inter-stimulus interval influence the test-retest reliability of TMG. Fifteen participants (13M/2F; 29.5‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ7.4‚ÄØy) underwent TMG recording of the biceps brachii (BB) at 10¬∞, 45¬∞ and 90¬∞ of elbow flexion with 10 and 20‚ÄØs inter-stimulus rest intervals in a randomised order on two separate days. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC2,1) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated for delay time (Td), contraction time (Tc), sustain time (Ts), relaxation time (Tr) and maximal displacement (Dm). Additionally, the standard error of measurement (SEM), coefficient of variation (CV) and minimal detectable change (MDC) were obtained. Across conditions the ICC2,1 varied for each parameter (Td:0.465-0.947, Tc:0.452-0.831, Ts:0.717-0.918, Tr:0.841-0.935, Dm:0.646-0.900).

We use a cohort of 24,201 participants in 2016 Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey (6.2 repeated measures on average). We estimate the likelihood of onset of household employment insecurity, housing affordability stress and change in housing costs using longitudinal regression analyses for socio-demographic groups. We assess mediation by estimating how much exposure variable coefficients attenuate with inclusion of a mediator in fixed effects regression models. We also apply causal mediation methods to fixed-effects regression models to better account for exposure-mediator interaction and meet strict model assumptions. If people's households become insecurely employed, there are five times greater odds of them also experiencing housing affordability stress (OR 4.99 95%CI 4.21-5.90). Key cohorts within the population are shown to be especially vulnerable to double precarity - notably single parents (OR 2.91, 95%CI 1.94-4.35) and people who live alone (OR 4.42, 95% CI 3.03-6.45) (compared to couples), and people who are recently separated or divorced (OR 2.59, 95%CI 1.81-3.70). Mediation analysis confirms that household employment insecurity has a small, negative effect on mental health (Beta -0.24, 95%CI -0.38-0.11 on a 1 to 100-point scale with 10-point standard deviation). Estimates from casual mediation analyses suggest housing affordability accounts for 20% of the total effect; likely concentrated in the lowest and highest strata of income. Employment and housing insecurity represent a form of double precarity for people in households with a single income. When we consider the impact on mental health, we find evidence of a causal relationship between insecure employment onset and mental health, around one fifth of which is mediated by changing housing cost and onset of affordability stress.",Reports of rationing from the neglected realm of capital investment: Responses to resource constraint in the English National Health Service.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776723,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 03 08,"Health systems around the world face financial pressures that can affect sustainability and patient outcomes, and there is a vast literature devoted to the allocation of scarce health care resources. Capital spending - for example on estates, equipment and information technology - is an important but often neglected area of this literature. This study explores the constraints on the allocation of capital budgets in health care, before addressing the question: what is the role of priority setting and rationing in responses to these constraints? The paper presents findings from interviews conducted with senior finance professionals in 30 National Health Service local provider organisations across England. Findings suggest a pervasive sense of impending crisis, with capital restrictions limiting investment in buildings, infrastructure and equipment. The paper applies a conceptual classification scheme from the classic rationing literature (the forms of rationing framework) and identifies widespread practices of 'selection', 'dilution' and 'delay', with 'denial' and 'termination' comparatively rare. Practices of 'deflection' and 'deterrence' are ascribed to national actors as a means of restricting the flow of capital resources to the system. The study suggests that there is little by way of tailored support for priority setting in capital spending, and a perception that decisions are often reactive and short term. It also suggests that wider system features and dynamics can preclude or constrain priority setting at the organisational level. The authors use these findings to suggest future conceptual development of the forms of rationing framework and make recommendations for research and practice in this area.",Graphene oxide as selective transporter of flavonols for physiological target DNA: A two-color fluorescence approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776721,"Spectrochimica acta.

The polyhydroxy phenolic compounds, flavonoids, have a broad spectrum of therapeutic activities with high potency and low systemic toxicity. Despite the vast medicinal importance, their bioavailability is low. In this exploratory study, GO has been used as the transporter of three flavonols fisetin (3, 7, 3', 4'-OH flavone), quercetin (3, 5, 7, 3', 4'-OH flavone), and morin (3, 5, 7, 2', 4'-OH flavone) for the physiological target DNA. Calf thymus DNA is chosen as the model physiological target. Characterization of GO is performed using FTIR, Raman and dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectroscopy. The strong absorption peak at 1730‚ÄØcm-1 indicated the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) at the edges of GO. The presence of sp3 carbons due to oxidation of sp2 carbons in GO is further proved by Raman spectroscopy. DLS provided the average size of the GO particles to be ~9‚ÄØŒºm. The dual luminescence behavior of the flavonols has been used in this study for the noninvasive sensing of the GO-flavonol and GO-flavonol-DNA interactions; as well as for the selectivity of GO for one flavonol over other in transferring the ligand to DNA. Furthermore, circular dichroism (CD) indicated that the optical activity of GO undergoes drastic change when conjugated with flavonols. Molecular modeling corroborated the findings from the binding studies.

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 18,"Despite considerable effort has been directed to ozone-initiated heterogeneous oxidation of unsaturated organic species in atmospheric environment, current knowledge about how chemical structure of unsaturated carboxylic acids affects their reaction kinetics remains very limited. Here, kinetics of heterogeneous reaction of ozone with six unsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid, vaccenic acid, eladic acid, myristoleic acid, palmitoleic acid and 2-hexadecenoic acid) were studied via a flow system combined with attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Pseudo-first-order rate constants (kapp) and overall reactive uptake coefficients (Œ≥) values were derived according to the changes in absorbance from infrared spectra. Results have shown reaction rates are highly dependent on structures of unsaturated fatty acids. Cis-isomer has faster reaction kinetics than trans-isomer, and conjugated system between CC and CO bonds can greatly inhibit reactivity. Also, it is found that a longer carbon chain length between CC bond and COOH group or a shorter chain length between CC bond and last carbon seemingly enhances reaction kinetics. In addition, changes in redox activity and hydrophilicity of oleic acid samples before and after exposure ozone have been reported for the first time. Results have revealed that ozone-initiated heterogeneous reaction can markedly increase redox activity and hydrophilicity of unsaturated carboxylic acids.",Coumarin based hydrazone as an ICT-based fluorescence chemosensor for the detection of Cu2+ ions and the application in HeLa cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776718,"Spectrochimica acta.

The turn off sensor of BENZPYR is related to chelation enhanced quenching (CHEQ) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) processes were serve as excellent fluorescent detection of Cu2+ ions in DMF medium. Fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that probe BENZPYR may have application as a fluorophore to detect the Cu2+ in living cells.

This feature allowed for monitoring HSA conformational alterations by measuring the distance between donor (Trp) and acceptor (MaCo) through F√∂rster energy transfer mechanism. Displacement experiments confirmed that MaCo binds to subdomain IIA of HSA with independence of temperature. It was observed that, in the temperature range 35-45‚ÄØ¬∞C, the fluorescence emission maximum of HSA-MaCo complex decreased, whereas in the range 45‚ÄØ¬∞C-65‚ÄØ¬∞C, an increment was detected. The concomitant change in the polarity of environment surrounding Trp was confirmed by red edge excitation shift experiments. Thermal denaturation of HSA was followed by time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Average lifetime of Trp residue decreased with temperature due to the increment of solvent collisions and changes in the solvent exposure of Trp. To discriminate the importance of each effect, lifetime of N-Acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA) at different temperatures was measured.

Six hundred and forty adolescents (253 Males, Mage‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ15.60, SD‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.65) self-reported measures of school bullying and NSSI and provided sociometric ratings of peer rejection. The results showed that being involved in bullying (as bullies, victims, or bully-victims) increases the likelihood to engage in NSSI; being rejected by peers amplifies the probability, for victims and bully-victims, of using NSSI at least once. The findings support the hypothesis that peer relationships play a key-role in determining NSSI and the importance to implement programs aimed to improve the school climate in order to avoid maladjusted behaviors in adolescence.","Psychometric liability to psychosis and childhood adversities are associated with shorter telomere length: A study on schizophrenia patients, unaffected siblings, and non-clinical controls.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776705,Journal of psychiatric research,2019 04 16,"Compared to the general population, individuals diagnosed with Schizophrenia (SCZ) experience a higher frequency and an earlier onset of chronic medical disorders, resulting in a reduction in life expectancy by an average of 15-25 years. Recently, it has been hypothesized that SCZ is a syndrome of accelerated aging. Childhood adversity was also associated with the pathogenesis and course of SCZ. Our hypothesis was that both SCZ patients and their unaffected siblings would have shorter telomere length (TL) compared to of non-clinical controls. Our additional goals were to determine (1) whether shorter TL correlates with intermediate phenotypes of SCZ (i.e. Psychosis-like symptoms and schizotypal traits); and (2) whether childhood adversities have a moderating role in TL shortening among SCZ and their unaffected siblings. To this end, SCZ patients (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ100), their unaffected siblings (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ100) and non-clinical controls (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ100) were enrolled. The main variables were TL, measured by aTL-qPCR; psychotic-like and schizotypal symptoms, assessed by The Community Assessment of Psychic Experience (CAPE) and the Structured Interview for Schizotypy-Revised (SIS-R), respectively; and childhood adversities evaluated by the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA)-Interview. Potentially relevant variables also included in the analyses were: Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, cognitive performance, and socio-demographic features. In contrast to our hypothesis patients had similar TL when compared to the non-clinical controls. Interestingly, unaffected siblings had longer TL compared to both patients and controls (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001). Independent from group status a negative correlation was observed between TL and psychotic-like symptoms as rated by the CAPE (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.01). Childhood adversities, especially loneliness between ages 0 and 11 were also negatively associated with TL (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05). Our findings suggest that psychometric liability to psychosis and childhood adversities may be associated with shorter TL. Unaffected siblings had longer TL, suggesting the potential role of resilience on both the TL and the clinical presentation. These findings must be considered preliminary, calling for larger-scale replication efforts.",Genetic diversity of Streptococcus mutans serotype c isolated from white spot and cavitated caries lesions from schoolchildren.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776704,Archives of oral biology,2019 03 22,To determine the genetic diversity of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) serotype c isolated from white spot and cavitated caries lesions of schoolchildren.,Very high high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with increased all-cause mortality in South Koreans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776703,Atherosclerosis,2019 03 23,Our study aimed to investigate the association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Korean adults.,"Integrating radon and thoron flux data with gamma radiation mapping in radon-prone areas. The case of volcanic outcrops in a highly-urbanized city (Roma, Italy).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776702,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 03 07,"An integration of laboratory radon and thoron exhalation data with gamma radiation mapping is applied to assess the geogenic radon and the exposure of people to natural radiation in a highly-urbanized city (Roma, Italy). The study area is a protected territory where ignimbrites from Colli Albani volcano and alluvial sediments largely crop out. A map of total gamma radiation, a gamma transect across Caffarella valley and 9 vertical gamma profiles have been carried out, showing that the main control of gamma levels is, of course, the lithological nature, without neglecting the simultaneous effect of other parameters such as slope morphology, erosion/weathering processes, occurrence of sinkholes or underground tunnels. The surveys allowed to distinguish the medians of ignimbrites (from 816‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ16 cps to 936‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ19 cps) from that of alluvial materials (611‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ14) cps), but showed also that alluvial sediments with anomalously high radioactivity (769‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ14 cps) can be locally recognized, providing valuable information on the interaction between sedimentation and erosion in fluvial valleys. Total gamma activity was converted into absorbed gamma dose rate ranging from 0.33 to 0.38 ŒºSv/hr. Outdoor Annual Effective Dose Equivalents were also estimated between 0.58 and 0.67‚ÄØmSv y-1. Laboratory radon and thoron exhalation rates of collected material are positively correlated with gamma radiation. Volcanic and alluvial sediments are well-discriminated. The correlation between the two variables is evident, but not robust because of the variable concentration of 40‚ÄØK, which is not contributing to radon and thoron exhalation rates. Anomalous data of soil samples located at the foot of a slope can be interpreted as due to reworking and accumulation processes. Similar gamma radiation data documents analogous concentration of radon and thoron parent-nuclides, but coexisting different radon and thoron exhalation rates provides an additional information on different grain size distributions which can be considered as a proxy for soil gas permeability. The integration of gamma mapping and radon and thoron exhalation measurements is a very useful tool to assess people exposure to natural radiation, in terms of dose rates and potential indoor radon. Gamma mapping, which provides data on the radiation source (the bedrock) is fast and not expensive. It allows to obtain very detailed pictures of a study area, but it needs to be combined with laboratory determination of radon and thoron release in order to definitely and correctly interpret variations of gamma signal. Furthermore, laboratory determination of soil radon exhalation gives information on the release of radon and is a good proxy for soil gas permeability. It has the great advantage over in-situ measurements of gas flow not to be influenced by seasonal pedoclimatic parameters and is affected by lower analytical uncertainties. These data are thus reproducible and precise and can be used to estimate potential radon hazard, which is the main source of exposure and thus the most important parameter for human protection from environmental radioactivity.",A through year behavior of 137Cs in a Japanese flowering cherry tree in relation to that of potassium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776701,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 03 07,"To understand the transfer of radiocesium (137Cs) in inside of deciduous trees, changes in 137Cs activity concentrations, primarily derived from the Fukushima accident in March 2011, were observed in the upper parts of a Japanese flowering cherry tree (Prunus x yedoensis cv. Somei-Yoshino) between 2015 and 2018. The sampling of the foliar parts occurred over the entire leaf life span from winter bud to litterfall and those of the branches were distinguished based on emergence years (2017, 2016, 2015, 2014-2011, and 2010/before). First, every tissue demonstrated a clear seasonal variation in 137Cs activity concentration. Second, a synchrony of seasonal variations in 137Cs activity concentration with those in the biological analogue of K concentration was observed in foliar parts during their growth season, but not in branches nor during the other seasons. With respect to the timing of changes in each tissue with tree phenology, it is possible that K and 137Cs alternate between leaves and branches via the same translocation mechanisms. The resorption efficiencies (i.e., 1‚ÄØ-‚ÄØ[the concentrations in the last litterfall]/[the maximum concentrations in green leaves]) of K and 137Cs were 76% and 46% in average, respectively. In addition, both leaf buds and branches played an important role as reservoirs during dormancy. The buds storage ratio before and after bud burst (i.e., [the inventories in buds at the end of defoliation]/[those before and after bud burst]) for K were 0.57 and 0.10 in median, respectively, and those for and 137Cs were 1.14 and 0.14 in median, respectively. Consequently, the transfer of 137Cs in inside of trees was still visible seven years after deposition, even though the annual reduction in 137Cs activity concentration was apparent in each tissue.",Evaluation of body size and temperature on 137Cs uptake in marine animals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776700,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 03 07,"137Cs bioaccumulation and retention in seven different marine animal species, including crustaceans, mollusc larvae, and fish larvae were compared under different temperature conditions (10‚ÄØ¬∞C, 18‚ÄØ¬∞C and 25‚ÄØ¬∞C).

Among the seven species, 137Cs bioconcentration factors ranged from 14 to 239 at the end of the exposure periods. Following uptake, the137Cs loss rate constants from the animals ranged from 5 to 50% d-1 and were unaffected by temperature or animal size. The 137Cs bioconcentration factors were directly related to animal size and hence their surface: volume ratios, consistent with the conclusion that Cs sorption from the aqueous phase is the principal uptake mechanism in these animals. With the exception of gastropods, temperature had no major influence on Cs uptake and efflux in the experimental species.",Cerebrovascular disease burden in late-onset non-lesional focal epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776698,Seizure,2019 04 17,"Late-onset non-lesional focal epilepsy, defined as new-onset seizures in patients older than 60 years, is diagnosed increasingly more often in relation to aging of the population.

On the other hand, the SASP can mediate chronic inflammation and stimulate the growth and survival of tumor cells.

Contemporary imaging techniques for simultaneously characterizing topography and ion transport through porous substrates are limited in range and resolution. In this paper, we demonstrate 'surface-tracked scanning ion conductance microscopy' as a technique to image topography of a porous substrate and simultaneously measure voltage-driven transmembrane ion transport. This technique uses the principles of 'shear-force tracking' to image the surface of a polycarbonate track-etch membrane, and chronoamperometry to reconstruct topography-correlated transmembrane ion transport through the membrane at different transmembrane potentials. Spatial transmembrane transport through individual pores is modeled using Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) theory to examine the effects of shear-force modulation on magnitude of transmembrane currents recorded with a nanopipette. The modeled transmembrane current through the porous membrane is compared with experimental behavior, and discrepancies between predicted values and measured data are outlined. The proposed surface-tracked imaging mode allows for rapid assessment (approximately 7‚Äâs/Œºm2) of interfacial processes at the nanoscale and addresses a bottleneck for stable, large-area characterization of porous substrates using scanning ion conductance microscopy.",Employing pain and mindfulness to understand consciousness: a symbiotic relationship.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776682,Current opinion in psychology,2019 05 23,"Consciousness, defined here as the quality of awareness of self and the corresponding sensory environment, is considered to be one of most enigmatic and contentious areas of scholarly dissection and investigation. The subjective experience of pain is constructed and modulated by a myriad of sensory, cognitive and affective dimensions. Thus, the study of pain can provide many inroads to a concept like consciousness that the traditional sense modalities do not. Mindfulness defined here as non-reactive awareness of the present moment, can uniquely control and/or modulate particular substrates of conscious experience. Thus, in combination with brain imaging methodologies, we propose that the interactions between pain and mindfulness could serve as a more comprehensive platform to disentangle the biological and psychological substrates of conscious experience. The present review provides a brief synopsis on how combining the study of pain and mindfulness can inform the study of consciousness, delineates the multiple, unique brain mechanisms supporting mindfulness-based pain relief, and describes how mindfulness uniquely improves the affective dimension of pain, an important consideration for the treatment of chronic pain.","Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of (E)-5-styryl-1,2,4-oxadiazoles as anti-tubercular agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776681,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 04 14,"Cinnamic acid and its derivatives are known for anti-tubercular activity.

A method was developed to functionalize the surface of the apatite using lauroyl chloride to improve the dispersion of the mineral phase in a poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) polymeric matrix. Infrared spectra and thermal gravimetric analysis confirmed the presence of laurate on the surface of calcium phosphate (CaP) particles. Neat HA particles were also functionalized with lauryl chloride for comparative purposes. PLLA/OCP/HA-laurate (PLLA/OCP/HA-L) and PLLA/HA-laurate (PLLA/HA-L) composites were fabricated by electrospinning method. The presence of the functional groups resulted in significant improvement of the dispersion of OCP/HA and HA particles into the polymeric matrix, allowing inclusion of up to 40% of mineral phase. Electrospun fibrous biocomposites of PLLA/CaP containing up to 40% in mineral phase were obtained without compromising their mechanical properties. Measurements of mass loss and calcium release in vitro showed that OCP/HA is more soluble than HA. The bioactivity of the composites was investigated by simulated body fluid test (SBF). Although both PLLA/OCP/HA-L and PLLA/HA-L fibers can form CaP crystals on their surface after exposition in SBF, the results demonstrate a significant enhancement in mineralization when OCP/HA is the mineral phase in the composite instead neat HA. Furthermore, the obtained PLLA/OCP/HA-L electrospun fibers favored the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth and mouse calvaria-derived preosteoblastic cells into mineralized osteoblasts.

Both trabecular and cortical bone types are studied. In particular, we examined the elasticity of cortical bone and individual trabeculae in the longitudinal and transverse directions of the samples. For cortical bone, the elastic modulus in the longitudinal direction was found to be 10-15% higher than that in the transverse direction; for trabecular bone, this difference was 42%. For the trabeculae, this value was found to be in a lower range (0.92‚ÄØ¬±‚Äâ0.22‚ÄâGPa). As per the transverse elastic modulus, an average of 1.58‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.36‚ÄâGPa was measured for cortical bone, and 0.55‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.21‚ÄâGPa for trabecular bone. The anisotropy ratio was within the range of 1.2-1.5 for cortical bone and 1.7-2 for trabecular bone. While the elastic modulus of cortical bone varied along the length of the femur with up to 30% variation, no significant differences were observed within each transverse section. The effect of indentation frequency (1-500‚ÄâHz) on the longitudinal elastic moduli was also investigated for cortical and trabecular bone, with results showing a correlation between indentation frequency and elastic modulus. Statement of significance: This study examines the adult mouse femur with a twofold aim: to investigate the anisotropy and inhomogeneity of cortical and trabecular bone tissues and to elucidate their elastic behavior at the nanometer length scale. The elastic moduli of cortical bone and individual trabecula are measured in the longitudinal and transverse cross-sections via AFM indentation at selected locations and in specific directions of the adult mouse femur. The results provide insights into the relationship between mechanical properties and structural morphology of cortical and trabecular bone tissue.",Activation of ATP-sensitive K-channel promotes the anticonvulsant properties of cannabinoid receptor agonist through mitochondrial ATP level reduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776677,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 04 29,"Cannabinoid receptor (CBR) agonist could act as a protective agent against seizure susceptibility in animal models of epilepsy. Studies have shown that potassium channels could play a key role in ameliorating neuronal excitability. In this study, we attempted to evaluate how CBRs and Adenosine Tri-Phosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels collaborate to affect seizure susceptibility by changing the clonic seizure threshold (CST). We used male Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice and treated them with the following drugs: cromakalim (a potassium channel opener, 10‚ÄØŒºg/kg), glibenclamide (a potassium channel blocker, 0.03 and 1‚ÄØmg/kg), 0.5‚ÄØmg/kg of AM-251 (a selective CB1 antagonist), AM-630 (a selective CB2 antagonist), and 0.5, 3, and 10‚ÄØmg/kg of WIN 55,212-2 (a nonselective agonist of CBRs); and CST was appraised after each type of administration. Also, we evaluated the ATP level of the hippocampus in each treatment to clarify the interaction between the cannabinoid system and potassium channel. Our results showed that administration of WIN 55,212-2 at 10‚ÄØmg/kg significantly increased CST (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001). This change could be reversed by using AM-251(P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001) but not AM-630. Also, either cromakalim (10‚ÄØŒºg/kg) or glibenclamide (0.03 and 1‚ÄØmg/kg) could not significantly affect the CST. In addition, glibenclamide (1‚ÄØmg/kg) could reverse the anticonvulsant effect of WIN 55,212-2 (10‚ÄØmg/kg) on CST (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001). However, the anticonvulsant effect was observed when cromakalim (10‚ÄØŒºg/kg) was added to WIN 55,212-2 at its subeffective dose (3‚ÄØmg/kg) in comparison to single-treated animals. Interestingly, we observed that CB1 agonist could significantly decrease ATP level. In conclusion, CB1 agonist accomplishes at least a part of its anticonvulsant actions through ATP-sensitive potassium channels, probably by decreasing the mitochondrial ATP level to open the potassium channel to induce its anticonvulsant effect.",Permeability analyses and three dimensional imaging of interferon gamma-induced barrier disintegration in intestinal organoids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776676,Stem cell research,2019 05 05,"The aberrant regulation of the epithelial barrier integrity is involved in many diseases of the digestive tract, including inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.

In the same sampling region, there is a strong positive linear correlation between the depositional fluxes of two nuclides and their monthly variations are synchronous. Correlation coefficients between atmospheric depositional fluxes and different factors suggest that rainfall is the most important influencing factor, but in Hengyang sampling region, the source has great effect on the depositional fluxes of 210Pb.",Ion chamber response to kilovoltage x-rays in the presence of a contrast agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776660,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,"Contrast enhanced radiotherapy is a relatively new treatment modality in which a radiological contrast agent is uploaded into a tumor that is subsequently irradiated with kilovoltage x-ray beams thus maximizing absorption of radiation through the photoelectric effect. As with other treatment modalities, experimental verification of absorbed dose distributions is a necessary step as part of the quality assurance process. In this paper, we address the question of how the response to kilovoltage x-rays exhibited by an ion chamber is modified when a radiological contrast agent is incorporated into the irradiated medium. Using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and experimental validation of the different models used in such simulations, we determined the correction factors that allow for the use of an ion chamber with a ND,W calibration factor at a given kilovoltage x-ray beam quality Q to be used when said beam irradiates a medium into which a radiological contrast agent is incorporated. The correction factors were derived as a function of the contrast agent concentration and for five different beam qualities. For a given concentration, the correction factor varies linearly with the beam quality as defined by the half-value layer, and for a given beam quality it varies linearly with the contrast agent concentration.",KiSS1 in regulation of metastasis and response to antitumor drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776659,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,2019 04 17,"Metastatic dissemination of tumor cells represents a major obstacle towards cancer cure. Tumor cells with metastatic capacity are often resistant to chemotherapy. Experimental efforts revealed that the metastatic cascade is a complex process that involves multiple positive and negative regulators. In this respect, several metastasis suppressor genes have been described. Here, we review the role of the metastasis suppressor KiSS1 in regulation of metastasis and in response to antitumor agents. Physiologically, KiSS1 plays a key role in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulating puberty and reproductive functions. KiSS1-derived peptides i.e., kisspeptins, signal through the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54. In cancer, KiSS1 signaling suppresses metastases and maintains dormancy of disseminated malignant cells, by interfering with cell migratory and invasive abilities. Besides, KiSS1 modulates glucose and lipid metabolism, by reprogramming energy production towards oxidative phosphorylation and Œ≤-oxidation. Loss or reduced expression of KiSS1, in part through promoter hypermethylation, is related to the development of metastases in various cancer types, with some conflicting reports. The poorly understood role of KiSS1 in response to chemotherapeutic agents appears to be linked to stimulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and inhibition of cell defense factors (e.g., glutathione S-transferase-œÄ) as well as autophagy modulation. Deciphering the molecular basis underlying regulation of the metastatic potential is crucial for the establishment of novel treatment strategies.",A meta-analysis and systematic review of Memory Specificity Training (MeST) in the treatment of emotional disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776658,Behaviour research and therapy,2019 03 31,"The tendency to recall events from one's past in a non-specific and overgeneral way has been found to predict the onset and severity of a range of emotional disorders. Memory Specificity Training (MeST) was devised a decade ago in order to target and modify this tendency so as to reduce the symptoms of emotional disorder or to reduce the risk that such disorders might emerge over time. We present a meta-analytical review of research into the effects of MeST on autobiographical memory specificity in the context of emotional disorders (k‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ13). MeST was associated with substantial improvement in memory specificity (d‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ-1.21) and depressive symptoms (d‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.47) and MeST groups outperformed control groups at post-intervention in terms of specificity (d‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.08) and depressive symptoms (d‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ-0.29). However, these effects were transitory and the benefit of MeST over control groups was mostly lost by follow-up assessment. There was mixed evidence in terms of MeST's effects on other processes associated with reduced specificity but MeST showed evidence of improving problem solving abilities and hopelessness. MeST holds promise as a novel intervention targeting reduced specificity but future studies are warranted with control groups that enable the investigation of MeST's mechanism of action and in studies with larger and more varied samples.",Effect of hydrothermal pretreatment severity on lignin inhibition in enzymatic hydrolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776657,Bioresource technology,2019 03 16,"Hydrothermal pretreatment is commonly used for enhancing enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosics. Spruce and wheat straw were pretreated with increasing severity and lignin characteristics were analysed. The effect of enzymatically isolated lignin on the hydrolysis of Avicel and the adsorption of a cellobiohydrolase onto lignin was measured. Non-pretreated lignins had only a minor effect on Avicel hydrolysis. The structural changes in lignin accompanying hydrothermal pretreatment were associated with increased binding and inactivation of the cellulase on the lignin surface. The inhibitory effect was more pronounced in spruce than in wheat straw lignin. However, similar pretreatment severities caused similar levels of inhibition in Avicel hydrolysis for both biomass sources. The combined severity factor of the pretreatment correlated well with the inhibitory effect of lignin.",Seasonal variations of performance and operation in field-scale storing multipond constructed wetlands for nonpoint source pollution mitigation in a plateau lake basin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776656,Bioresource technology,2019 03 16,"Storing multipond constructed wetlands, dispersed in the areas of rural lake or river basins, are unique and alternative conventional treatment systems for non-point source pollution. However, the sustainable operation and successful application of these systems remain a challenge. This study aimed to assess the seasonal variations of performance, identify operational factors of nutrients removal and fill the knowledge gap of field-scale storing multipond constructed wetlands application in a plateau lake watershed. Preferable performances for pollutant purification and operation parameters were achieved in different water seasons. Highly related to the performance of wastewater treatment, operational parameters including temperature, mass loading rate, hydraulic loading rate, hydraulic retention time and water depth were analyzed through first-order kinetics model, Spearman's rank correlation and redundancy analysis. Optimized parameters obtained through different analyzing methods revealed that appropriate hydraulic loading rate and mass loading rate would give better purification performances in wet season.",Salt inhibition on partial nitritation performance of ammonium-rich saline wastewater in the zeolite biological aerated filter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776655,Bioresource technology,2019 03 16,"Influences of various concentrations of salinity (NaCl 0-25.0‚ÄØg/L) on partial nitritation performance in a zeolite biological aerated filter (ZBAF) were investigated. The highest nitrite production rate (NPR) of 1.357‚ÄØkg/(m3¬∑d) and nitrite accumulation rate (NAR) of 99.0% was achieved with salt free wastewater. While after adding extra salt, NPR and ammonium removal efficiency (ARE) presented an obvious decline trend. The lowest NPR (0.599‚ÄØkg/(m3¬∑d)) and ARE (34.2%) were obtained with salinity of 25.0‚ÄØg/L NaCl. It has been confirmed that addition of salt resulted in the increase of free ammonia (FA), and then further inhibited ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB). High-throughput sequencing analysis results further revealed that the relative abundance of AOB decreased in ZBAF. All results demonstrated that AOB was inhibited not only by high osmotic pressure caused by salt, but also by high FA.","Aqueous two-phase extraction of R-Phycoerythrin from marine macro-algae, Gelidium pusillum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776654,Bioresource technology,2019 03 16,"Aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) of R-Phycoerythrin (R-PE), a fluorescent and commercially valuable protein, was carried out in two parallel schemes. In scheme-1, ATPE alone was employed, and in scheme-2, process-integration was attempted, where primary extract was subjected to precipitation before standardization of process parameters of ATPE. Scheme-1 with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-3350/potassium phosphate system has resulted in very low R-PE yield (26% w/w) without much enrichment in purity (0.3). In scheme-2, PEG-1450/potassium phosphate system (pH 6, tie-line length 12.26% and lower volume-ratio) has resulted in higher R-PE purity (0.74) with 72% yield.

With the specificity to target receptors which are uniquely or overexpressed on cancer cells as well as accurately targeting dysregulated signaling pathways, peptides demonstrate a high potential for the treatment of even the most aggressive cancers. By binding to these targets, peptides can be used to deliver drugs, serve as antagonists to various ligands, or, given some inherent anticancer activity, provide additional treatment options alone or in combination therapy. The highly specific targeting capacity of peptides is critical to achieve effective cancer treatment with limited side effects, and in preclinical studies peptides have shown to have both cell and blood brain barrier penetrating capacity. As tumor targeting peptides move beyond the preclinical setting, identification of additional glioblastoma-specific peptide ligands becomes imperative to expand the potential of this encouraging treatment strategy.",Spatial variation of human influences on grassland biomass on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776640,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"An improved understanding of increased human influence on ecosystems is needed for predicting ecosystem processes and sustainable ecosystem management. We studied spatial variation of human influence on grassland ecosystems at two scales across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), where increased human activities may have led to ecosystem degradation. At the 10‚ÄØkm scale, we mapped human-influenced spatial patterns based on a hypothesis that spatial patterns of biomass that could not be attributed to environmental variables were likely correlated to human activities. In part this hypothesis could be supported via a positive correlation between biomass unexplained by environmental variables and livestock density. At the 500‚ÄØm scale, using distance to settlements within a radius of 8‚ÄØkm as a proxy of human-influence intensity, we found both negatively human-influenced areas where biomass decreased closer to settlements (regions with higher livestock density) and positively human-influenced areas where biomass increased closer to settlements (regions with lower livestock density). These results suggest complex relationships between livestock grazing and biomass, varying between spatial scales and regions. Grazing may boost biomass production across the whole QTP at the 10‚ÄØkm scale. However, overgrazing may reduce it near settlements at the 500‚ÄØm scale. Our approach of mapping and understanding human influence on ecosystems at different scales could guide pasture management to protect grassland in vulnerable regions on the QTP and beyond.",Butterfly cluster like lamellar BiOBr/TiO2 nanocomposite for enhanced sunlight photocatalytic mineralization of aqueous ciprofloxacin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776639,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"The present study for the first time reports facile in-situ room temperature synthesis of butterfly cluster like lamellar BiOBr deposited over TiO2 nanoparticles for photocatalytic breakdown of ciprofloxacin (CIP). The butterfly cluster arrangement of BiOBr resulted in an increase in surface area from 124.6 to 160.797‚ÄØm2¬∑g-1 and subsequently increased incident light absorption by the composite photocatalyst. The XRD indicated the existence of TiO2 as spherical ‚âà10-15‚ÄØnm diameter particles with [101] preferential growth planes of anatase phase while the lamellar BiOBr showing growth along [110] and [102] preferential planes that were also confirmed by the HR-TEM images. DRS data implicated 2.76‚ÄØeV as the energy band gap of the synthesized nanocomposite while PL spectroscopic analysis predicted it to be 2.81‚ÄØeV. XPS measurements examined the chemical oxidation states of the constituents among the nanocomposite samples. The lameller structure of BiOBr in 15%BiOBr/TiO2 acts as a manifold promoting both visible light (Œª‚ÄØ>‚ÄØ420‚ÄØnm) and direct sunlight catalytic degradation of 25‚ÄØmg¬∑L-1 aqueous CIP up to 92.5% and 100%, respectively within 150‚ÄØmin. The rate constant values suggested that the visible light photocatalysis of CIP with 15%BiOBr/TiO2 was 5.2 and 9.4 times faster compared to pristine TiO2 and BiOBr, respectively. The free radical scavenging study demonstrated that although photogenerated superoxide ions and holes contribute to the overall photocatalytic activity, yet, hydroxyl radicals predominantly control the CIP oxidation. The synthesized nanocomposite was re-used up to five cycles and retained 82.98% efficiency even after 5th use cycle showing a decline of only 12%. The catalyst stability and easy recovery adds to its reusability and value of the photocatalytic process.",Is plastic ingestion in birds as toxic as we think? Insights from a plastic feeding experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776638,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"Plastic pollution is a modern tragedy of the commons, with hundreds of species affected by society's waste. Birds in particular mistake plastic for prey, and millions of wild birds carry small plastic loads in their stomach and are exposed to potential toxicological effects. It is currently unknown how severely the toxicological and endocrine disrupting chemicals in plastic affect avian development, reproduction and endocrine function. To address this question, we conducted multi-generational plastic feeding experiments to test the toxicological consequences of plastic ingestion at environmentally relevant loads in Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, investigating parental and two filial generations. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of lasting toxicological effects on mortality, adult body weight, organ histology, hormone levels, fertility, hatch rates and eggshell strength in birds experimentally fed plastic. However, we found plastic ingestion causes higher frequencies of male reproductive cysts and minor delays in chick growth and sexual maturity, though without affecting ultimate survival or reproductive output. We report that although plastic ingestion causes detectable endocrine effects in our model species, our lack of finding mortality, morbidity and adverse reproductive outcomes may challenge the common hypothesis of severe toxicological harm and population-level effects when environmentally relevant loads of plastic are ingested.",Influence of edaphic conditions and nitrogen fertilizers on cadmium and zinc phytoextraction efficiency of Noccaea caerulescens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776637,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"The success of cadmium phytoextraction operations with Noccaea caerulescens varies by a factor of 70 between sites of trials. However, soil factors driving the efficiency of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) phytoextraction are still poorly understood, as are the effects of nitrogen fertilizers. We studied biomass production and Cd and Zn uptake by two contrasting populations of N. caerulescens, Ganges (metallicolous) and Wilwerwiltz (non-metallicolous) grown in pots on a range of 24 field contaminated soils for 20‚ÄØweeks. The addition of KNO3 and NH4NO3 fertilizers was also tested. Using model averaging of multiple regression models, we show that the major drivers of N. caerulescens growth are physical soil factors such as organic matter and soil bulk density while trace metal accumulation mainly relies on soil Cd and Zn exchangeable concentrations. We confirm the negative effect of soil copper (Cu) on growth, even at exchangeable concentrations below 30‚ÄØmg‚ÄØkg-1, and therefore on uptake efficiency, while increasing soil lead (Pb) content was related to increased biomass probably due to a protective effect against soil pathogens. Finally, there is a small positive effect of nitrogen fertilization on biomass production only in soils with low initial nitrogen content (under 25‚ÄØŒºg‚ÄØg-1 NO3-), while above this value, the positive impact of initial nitrogen content is offset by lower shoot Cd and Zn concentrations. Our data bring substantial information regarding the physico-chemical properties to ensure N. caerulescens growth: a soil bulk density under 1.05‚ÄØkg/dm3, organic matter above 7% and pH under 7.5. We show that phytoextraction efficiency is maximal for moderate soil contamination in Cd (2-10‚ÄØmg‚ÄØkg-1) and Zn (300-1000‚ÄØmg‚ÄØkg-1).",Development of microbial community within the cathodic biofilm of single-chamber air-cathode microbial fuel cell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776636,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"The aim of this study was to investigate the development of microbial community within the cathodic biofilm of single-chamber air-cathode microbial fuel cell (MFC).

After four starting cycles (0-188‚ÄØh), the maximum power densities of the MFC fed with 1‚ÄØg/L acetate decreased from 1056‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ110 to 410‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ50‚ÄØmW/m2 within 15‚ÄØcycles (~30 d) of operation. The relative abundance of Pseudomonas gradually increased from 18.9% in the 1st cycle to 50.2% in the 4th cycle. After 15‚ÄØcycles, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas became 53.8%, 16.4%, and 8.90% in the middle, anolyte-side, and cathode-side layers, respectively. The aerobic bacteria within the cathodic biofilm increased from 24% in the anodyte-side layer to 43% in the cathode-side layer. The relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter was 42.1% and 37.2% after 3 and 15‚ÄØcycles, respectively. The bacterial community structures were similar among cycles 2, 3, and 4, but significantly different in the 15th cycle. The results from this study should be useful to understand the mechanism of the cathodic biofilm formation and to develop strategies to enhance performance of the MFC.",Incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility fingerprints of Plesiomonas shigelliodes isolates in water samples collected from some freshwater resources in Southwest Nigeria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776635,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"Plesiomonas shigelloides, is an emerging and significant enteric pathogen in water having implication in both localised and gastrointestinal infections with characteristic of displaying high resistance against commonly used antibiotics. This study evaluated the prevalence of Plesiomonas shigelloides and their antibiogram fingerprints in water sample collected from four rivers in South-western Nigeria. In all, 148 presumptive Plesiomonas shigelloides isolates was recovered from the rivers out of which 66 (44.6%) were confirmed positive for the organism using polymerase chain reaction techniques. Confirmed isolates were evaluated for their antibiogram profiles against a panel of 20 antimicrobials using the disc diffusion method and further screened for relevant antibiotic resistance genes. Resistance of the isolates against the antimicrobials followed the order: sulphamethoxazole (100%), erythromycin (93%), ampicillin (90%), cephalotin (82%), streptomycin (64%), and chloramphenicol (58%), amoxicillin (53%), cefotaxime (50%), tetracycline (49%), neomycin (38%) and trimethoprim‚ÄØ+‚ÄØsulphamethoxazole (38%). Conversely, all the isolates were susceptible against netilmicin, and susceptibility against the other antibiotics follows the order: meropenem (94%), gentamicin (88%), imipenem (79%), amikacin (70%), ciprofloxacin (70%), norfloxacin (59%), trimethoprim (56%) and ceftazidine (56%). The multiple antibiotic resistance indices of the organism were higher than the accepted threshold of 0.2. The incidence of 11 antimicrobial resistance determinants were obtained as follows: [sulphonamides; (sulI (18%), sulII (20%), dfr1 (70%), dfr(18) (5%)), [beta-lactams; (ampC 37%)], [tetracyclines; (tetA (78%), tetE (57%)], [phenicols; (catII (16%), cmlA1 (11%)] and [aminoglycosides; (aphA2 (36%) and strA (67%)]. Pearson chi-square exact test revealed positive associations among tetA, tetE, sullI and catII and tetA genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the incidence and antibiogram fingerprint of P. shigelloides in these freshwater resources and we conclude that these rivers are important reservoirs of multiple antimicrobial resistant biotypes of this organism, and consequently a threat to public health.",Contrasting wheat phenological responses to climate change in global scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776634,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"Comprehensive analysis of how wheat phenology responds to environmental factors in global scale is helpful for tackling the possible adverse effects of ongoing climate change on wheat production. In this study, six phenological parameters of global wheat, i.e., the growing season start (SGS), peak (PGS), end (EGS), length (LGS), as well as the vegetative period length (LVP) and reproductive period length (LRP), were retrieved from remote sensing data (1981-2014) by threshold-, logistic-, and shape-based methods. And then, we analyzed the effects of temperature, precipitation, short-wave (SW) radiation, and frost on spatiotemporal patterns of wheat phenology. In addition, haze impacts on wheat phenology were investigated in China and India where haze weather appears frequently in winter-spring seasons. Results showed that the occurrence time of SGS/PGS/EGS is gradually advanced from the pole to the equator and annual mean air temperature can explain >70% of their spatial variations. A dominant advanced SGS/PGS/EGS and a shortened LGS/LVP/LRP were detected in the study region due to the significant increase in temperature and SW radiation, as well as the decrease in frost days. Interannual fluctuations of SGS/PGS/EGS are primarily controlled by air temperature, while precipitation and frost only exerted some obvious impacts in some locations. Higher preseason temperature would induce an earlier wheat phenology and a shorter growing season, while adequate precipitation and frequent frost in preseason could delay the occurrence timing of wheat phenology and lead to a longer growing season. Besides, the decreased temperature resulted from severe haze weather may have partly counteracted the global-warming-induced advancing trend of wheat phenology in China, but further advanced the occurrence timing of wheat phenology through prompting vernalization in India. Overall, though wheat growth is largely constrained by human management, we still highlight the strong impacts of global climate change on wheat phenology.",Discussion: Illegal kills of protected wolves call for public reasoning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776633,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"Illegal wolf kills happens around in Europe despite the European wolf is protected under the EU Habitats Directive.

This caused a heated debate and calls for better communication and management of the Danish and entire European wolf population. Here we discuss the challenges of illegal wolf kills and call for European governments to take action. We specifically encourage European governments to create facilitated spaces for public deliberation on wildlife management by integrating facts and values, not separating them.","Addition-omission of zinc, copper, and boron nano and bulk oxide particles demonstrate element and size -specific response of soybean to micronutrients exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776632,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"Plant response to microelements exposure can be modulated based on particle size. However, studies are lacking on the roles of particle size and specific microelements in mixed exposure systems designed for plant nutrition, rather than toxicology. Here, an addition-omission strategy was used to address particle-size and element-specific effects in soybean exposed to a mixture of nano and bulk scale oxide particles of Zn (2‚ÄØmg Zn/kg), Cu (1‚ÄØmg Cu/kg) and B (1‚ÄØmg B/kg) in soil. Compared to the control, mixtures of oxide particles of both sizes significantly (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05) promoted grain yield and overall (shoot and grain) Zn accumulation, but suppressed overall P accumulation. However, the mixed nano-oxides, but not the mixed bulk-oxides, specifically stimulated shoot growth (47%), flower formation (63%), shoot biomass (34%), and shoot N (53%) and K (42%) accumulation. Compared by particle size, omission of individual elements from the mixtures evoked significant responses that were nano or bulk-specific, including shoot growth promotion (29%) by bulk-B; inhibition (51%) of flower formation by nano-Cu; stimulation (57%) of flower formation by bulk-B; grain yield suppression (40%) by nano-Zn; B uptake enhancement (34%) by bulk-Cu; P uptake stimulation by nano-Zn (14%) or bulk-B (21%); residual soil N (80%) and Zn (42%) enhancement by nano-Cu; and residual soil Cu enhancement by nano-Zn (72%) and nano-B (62%). Zn was responsible for driving the agronomic (biomass and grain yield) responses in this soil, with concurrent ramifications for environmental management (N and P) and human health (Zn nutrition).

Here we combined elemental and isotopic (Pb, Zn, Cu) analyses with X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements (Zn) to trace the fate, in undisturbed soil profiles, of historical metal contamination emitted by a 167-year-old Pb-Ag smelter decommissioned 100‚ÄØyears ago located in the Calanques National Park (Marseilles, France). Lead isotopic measurements show that entire soil profiles were affected by 74‚ÄØyears of Pb emissions up to ~7‚ÄØkm from the smelter under the main NNW wind, and indicate particulate transfer down to 0.8‚ÄØm at depth. This vertical mobility of anthropogenic Pb contrasts with previous studies where Pb was immobilized in surface horizons. The contribution of anthropogenic Pb to the total Pb concentration in soil was estimated at 95% in surface horizons, and 78% in the deepest horizons. Zinc isotopic signatures of past emissions that are enriched in light isotopes compared to the natural geological background (-0.70‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.04‚Ä∞ and -0.15‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.02‚Ä∞, respectively), were detected only in the surface horizons of the studied soils. Using XAS analyses, we showed that anthropogenic Zn was transformed and immobilized in surface horizons as Zn-Layered Double Hydroxide, thus favoring the enrichment in heavy isotopes in these surface horizons. No clear evidence of copper contamination by the smelter was found and Cu isotopes point to a bedrock origin and a natural distribution of Cu concentrations.",Impacts of four ionic liquids exposure on a marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum at physiological and biochemical levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776620,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"With the increasing applications in various industrial areas, toxicity of ionic liquids (ILs) has gained much attention in recent years. In this work, 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ([C8mim]NO3), 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C8mim]Cl), N-octyl-3-metylpyridinium chloride ([C8mpy]Cl) and N-octyl-3-metylpyridinium bromide ([C8mpy]Br) were used to investigate the impacts of different types of cations and anions on their toxicity to a marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Results showed that the four ILs had poor degradability under the culture conditions used in this study, and significantly inhibited the growth of this diatom with 96-h EC50 values of 24.0, 33.6, 16.1 and 14.4mgL-1 for [C8mim]NO3, [C8mim]Cl, [C8mpy]Cl and [C8mpy]Br, respectively. The data indicated that types of cations and anions would affect the toxicity of ILs to this diatom. Additionally, photosynthesis of this diatom was inhibited because significant decrease of chlorophyll a content and damage of PSII reaction centers were observed when it was exposed to the four ILs. Remarkable physiological and biochemical responses occurred in the cells of this diatom to alleviate the damaging effects of the four ILs. For example, content of soluble protein and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the cells of this diatom increased significantly to form a protective mechanism against the toxicity of ILs, although they decreased in the cultures with high concentrations of ILs (‚â•20mgL-1). Thus, these results would not only provide strong evidences for evaluating the ecological risks and toxicity of ILs to marine ecosystem, but also help for understanding their toxic mechanisms to marine diatoms.","The occurrence and distribution of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), focusing on tissue-specific bioaccumulation in crucian carp in South Korea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776619,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 08,"The occurrence and distribution of 41 congeners of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) were investigated in major tissues of crucian carp (muscle, gonad, liver, and blood) and in river sediment to assess the bioaccumulation potential of PCNs. The total PCN concentrations in sediment ranged from 4.37 to 19.5‚ÄØpg/g dry weight (dw), mainly comprising CN-13, CN-33/34/37, and CN-38/40. Among fish tissues, higher PCN concentrations were observed in the gonads (29.6‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ10.3‚ÄØpg/g wet weight, ww) and liver (25.7‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ4.35‚ÄØpg/g ww) of crucian carp than in the muscle (2.17‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ0.68‚ÄØpg/g ww).

We investigated the association between the PCN concentration in each tissue (muscle, liver, and gonad) and the size of the fish (total length and weight) and found positive correlations between the PCN concentration in the gonads and the total length and weight (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05, Spearman correlation).",Systematic evaluation of a dynamic sewer process model for prediction of odor formation and mitigation in large-scale pressurized sewers in Hong Kong.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776618,Water research,2019 05 12,"To evaluate and mitigate odor formation and emission in sewers, several sewer models have been developed. Although these models can predict the immediate effects of chemical dosing on odor emission control, the long-term effects due to the variation of biofilm dynamics were generally underestimated. Therefore, in this study, we developed a dynamic model to simulate sewer processes initiated by sewer. The dynamic sewer process model was calibrated and validated with experimental data collected from two pressurized mains in actual operation in Hong Kong (TCS and MH17). The results show that the dynamic model can satisfactorily predict the dynamic concentrations of sulfide and ammonium (with measured and simulated values differing by less than 6%). The model was employed to systematically assess the long-term effects of three commonly used control strategies, i.e. addition of nitrate salts, addition of biocides, and hydraulic flushing, on sulfide formation and to predict sewer biofilm compositions. The modeling results reveal that the effect of odor mitigation measures on sulfide control varied with time due to the re-establishment of sulfate-reducing bacteria community in sewer biofilm. The long-term effect of nitrate addition would be diminishing because of the growth of heterotrophic denitrifies in sewer biofilms (increased from 7% to 21% after 55 days of nitrate addition) to consumed more nitrate. After dosing biocide or hydraulic flushing in sewers, sulfide production would rebound in the following several days due to the regrowth of sewer biofilms, indicating that the optimization of odor mitigation strategies is necessary. This study highlights that the biofilm dynamics shall be involved in the simulation of odor formation and emission, to evaluate and optimize the long-term effects of mitigation measures.",A novel electrochemical mast cell-based paper biosensor for the rapid detection of milk allergen casein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776617,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 06 06,"Developing low-cost, portable and simple analysis tools is of vital importance for food safety point-of-care testing. Therefore, herein, a new low-cost, simple to fabricate, disposable, electrochemical mast cell-based paper sensor is proposed and developed to sensitively determine the major milk allergen casein. Then, a graphene (GN)/carbon nanofiber (CN)/ Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) composite material with high conductivity and good biocompatibility was modified on the cell-based paper sensor to improve the electrical conductivity and provide a sensing recognition interface for the immobilization of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells. The cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry measurement of the mast cells in the paper sensor revealed an irreversible anodic peak, whose peak current is proportional to the number of cells in the range from 1‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ102 to 1‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ108 cells/mL. For the milk allergen detection tests, mast cells exposed to the casein caused a significant reduction in the current signal, displaying an inverse dose-dependent relationship. The developed cell sensor exhibited a range of linearity between 1‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10-7 and 1‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10-6 g/mL of casein with a detection limit of 3.2‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ10-8 g/mL and a great reproducibility and selectivity. The electrochemical responses obtained using the cell-based paper sensor were well consistent with the conventional detection assay, with good stability and reproducibility. Therefore, a simple and novel electrochemical method for food allergens detection was developed, demonstrating its potential application in the food safety determination and evaluation.","Enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) signals based on immobilization of core-shell nanoparticles incorporated boron nitride nanosheets: Development of molecularly imprinted SPR nanosensor for anticancer drug, etoposide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776616,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 06 06,"An effective SPR nanosensor based on core-shell nanoparticles (Ag@AuNPs) incorporated hexagonal boron nitride (HBN) nanosheets and molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was presented for etoposide (ETO) detection.

B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 03 18,"Cyanide (CN) is the biomarker of exposure to the components of tobacco smoke, although its presence in biological samples is also due to the consumption of products containing cyanogenic glycosides. In this work, we determine the concentration of the free cyanide in urine, saliva and breast milk matrices, using ion chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (IC-PAD). IC-PAD is an emerging method, with only few documented applications in urine and saliva, and the presented determination in breast milk is its first published report for any method. The biological samples, which were obtained from women staying in a maternity ward, showed cyanide concentrations spanning 1.82-98.47‚ÄØŒºg‚ÄØL-1.

However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, WAS was treated with 0.2‚ÄâgNO2--N/gVSS for 7 days and its performance was compared to that of aerobic and anaerobic treatments. The addition of nitrite had a distinct effect on the reduction of VSS/SS and the accumulation of soluble organics compared to the control reactors. As evident by the variations of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), nitrite addition had a positive effect on decreasing protein. In particular, the decrease of protein mainly occurred in tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS), which caused sludge disintegration and enhanced sludge reduction. Additionally, the decrease of microbial diversity with nitrite addition was significant compared to the control reactors, accompany with a decrease of live/dead cells ratio and an increase of supernatant DNA concentration. This suggests that nitrite could cause cell death and lysis, resulting in sludge degradation. Thus, nitrite addition enhanced sludge treatment through the combined effect of TB-EPS disintegration and cell lysis. These findings will be useful for the optimization of sludge treatment process based on nitrite addition.","Overexploitation hazards and salinization risks in crucial declining aquifers, chemo-isotopic approaches.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776598,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"Bastam region is overusing its groundwater resources stocks. The groundwater levels, and hydrogeochemical data during a 14-year period (2002-2016) and isotopic composition (2016) of the 22 groundwater samples were investigated to determine the hydrogeological regime of Bastam Plain and identify the geochemical processes that control the groundwater quality. This plain is situated in a semi-arid region of northern Iran, mainly recharging from the carbonate Mountains in the north and southwest. In general, overexploitation of the groundwater due to low precipitation and changing precipitation regime has destructive effects on the hydrogeological setting and flow regime of Bastam crucial aquifer, including the decline of the groundwater level with rate of 0.9‚Äâm/year, water storage deficit of 17.32 Mm3/year and consequently, the intrusion of saline water towards the aquifer from the western and eastern salty plains. Based on the EC values, the groundwater samples divided into three groups of fresh waters with EC‚Äâ<‚Äâ1000 ŒºS/cm and Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type which are located in the recharge zones, semi-saline waters (1000‚Äâ<‚ÄâEC‚Äâ<‚Äâ2500 ŒºS/cm) with Na-Mg-Cl-SO4 type at the center and saline waters with EC values more than 2500 ŒºS/cm and Na-Cl type in the eastern and western parts of the plain. A few groundwater samples (group 2) fall on the mixing line between fresh and saline water in Piper diagram during the saline water intrusion, but most of the samples depart from this mixing line, indicating water-rock interactions in this area, resulting in deÔ¨Åcit of Na+ and surplus of Ca2+ concentration. The fresh water samples cluster along the local meteoric water line in Œ¥18O and Œ¥2H relationships, suggesting an integrative and rapid recharge with meteoric water. Hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics indicate that invasion of the saline water resulted from halite dissolution with minor evaporation in the surrounding salty playas is the main origin for the increasing salinity in the Bastam aquifer. The salinization risks limit the groundwater withdrawals from Bastam aquifer in some areas, threatening the future sustainable development of the region.",Comparing pollution patterns and human exposure to atmospheric PBDEs and PCBs emitted from different e-waste dismantling processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776597,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"Waste electrical and electronic equipment (E-waste) recycling provides post-consumption economic opportunities, can also exert stress on environment and human health.

BDE-47, -99, and -209 were the most abundant PBDEs during e-waste recycling activities (expect in RIHD workshop). Penta-CBs were present at high levels in TV workshops, as were tetra-CBs in RIHD workshop. Low brominated BDEs contributed a large portion during working and non-working time. The percentages of octa-BDEs and nona-BDEs were higher during non-working than working time.

However, factors that drive its formation and dispersion remain poorly understood. The cellular-level responses to nutrient drivers of eutrophication were investigated. The results showed that growth rate of M. aeruginosa was significantly enhanced with the increasing bisphenol A (BPA) and nitrogen (N) level. Stress of BPA significantly inhibited cellular density, chlorophyll-a content across all the nutrient conditions, while Fv/Fm and rETRmax value were promoted by BPA. Responses of reactive oxygen species (ROS) value, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malodialdehyde (MDA) content indicated that nitrogen deficiency and BPA caused oxidative stress to M. aeruginosa. Besides, nitrogen and BPA regulated the production and release of microcystins (MCs). M. aeruginosa exposed to BPA caused 95 up-regulated proteins, which was primarily associated with photosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, glycolysis/glyconeogenesis and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. The 91 down-regulated proteins were related to quorum sensing, longevity regulating and cell cycle-caulobacter, confirming that the driving force of regulating the change of cellular density and genes expression weakened. These findings provide important clues to elucidate the combined regulatory mechanisms of cyanobacterial blooms triggered by endocrine-disrupting compounds and environmental factors and help to effectively prevent and reduce cyanobacterial blooms.",Degradation process regulation of waste LCD panel to ensure the remain of indium in solid phase by hydrothermal reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776595,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 03 17,"The environmental risks and recycling potential of organic materials and indium of waste LCD panel has produced commercial value.

To quantify the burning rate and flame height of multiple pool fires from the view of physical mechanism, this paper presents an experimental study on two identical square pool fires. Heptane was used as fuel. The pool size and spacing were varied. Results showed that both the burning rate and flame height change non-monotonically with spacing. From the view of air entrainment, a correlation for the flame height of two pool fires is developed involving pool size, spacing and the flame height of zero spacing. The comparison with experimental results shows that the developed correlation is suitable for two heptane or propane fires. A theoretical study based on energy balance at one of the pool surfaces is performed to evaluate the burning rate of two fires, which is finally expressed as a function of pool size, spacing, burning rate and the flame height of single fire.

Cytotoxicity to murine fibroblasts was highest in extracts of leaf tissue and was associated with a single, a small modified peptide with high similarity to N-acetyl-L-Œ±-aspartyl-L-alanyl-L-Œ±-aspartyl-L-Œ±-glutamyl-O-(carboxymethyl)-L-tyrosyl-L-leucinamide, a synthetic phosphotyrosyl mimic involved in cell signaling processes. One possible mode of action leading to acute renal failure in grazing livestock by a modified peptide such as this is proposed.","Chemometrics coupled with UPLC-MS/MS for simultaneous analysis of markers in the raw and processed Fructus Xanthii, and application to optimization of processing method by BBD design.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776590,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2019 04 21,"As a widely used toxic traditional herbal medicine, the quality of the Fructus Xanthii must be well controlled to ensure the clinical therapeutic efficacy and safety.","Development of curcumin-loaded gemini surfactant nanoparticles: Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of¬†anticancer¬†activity against human breast cancer cell lines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776589,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2019 04 21,"Curcumin, the polyphenolic constituent of turmeric, has been recognized as an effective anticancer agent in the treatment of breast cancer.

The toxicity (30-min EC50) of studied ILs to Vibrio fischeri ranged from 7.82‚ÄØ¬µM (4.2‚ÄØmg/L) (PyC12Phe) to 3096‚ÄØ¬µM (1227‚ÄØmg/L) (ImidC2Phe), i.e. from ""toxic"" (EC50 1-10‚ÄØmg/L) to ""not harmful"" (EC50 >‚ÄØ100‚ÄØmg/L). Inhibition of the bacterial luminescence upon 30-min exposure to ILs correlated well with bacterial viability (exposure for 4‚ÄØh). The toxicity of studied ILs was largely driven by the length of the alkyl chain (hydrophobicity) and not the type of cationic part of the IL: starting from C10 all the ILs irrespective of the cationic part proved ""toxic"". The toxicity of the studied ILs was increasing in parallel to their hydrophobicity up to log Kow =‚ÄØ1 (C8-C10) and then levelling up, being consistent with the previously obtained analogous data sets. The ""cut-off"" effect reported in this study for longer chain length members of the ILs series leads to the ""limit"" toxicity level for this type of ILs to be ca. 8‚ÄØmM. Two open-access online tools (www.molinspiration.com and www.vcclab.org) have been applied for the calculation of the Kow values for the 24 ILs reported in this study and 21 ILs reported in the literature. This lead to plotting two nonlinear monotonic correlations between the values of experimental log (1/EC50) and calculated log Kow. The limitation of the online tools and an effect of the ILs structure on the ""cut-off"" effect have been discussed. The challenge of developing low microbial toxicity surface active ILs remains a significant task to overcome. Our results shed light on the new approaches for designing environmentally benign ILs and functional surfactants. As the hydrophobicity of the ILs significantly correlated with the toxicity, the Vibrio fischeri assay could be considered a powerful tool in providing toxicity data for building and evaluating the QSAR toxicity models for ILs.","Brief report: Longitudinal associations between physical activity, sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms in adolescent girls.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776577,Journal of adolescence,2019 04 01,"Physical activity (PA) and sleep disturbances (SD) are related with depressive symptoms in adults.

Maternal high-fat (HF) diet promotes obesity and hypothalamic leptin resistance in male rat offspring at weaning and adulthood. Leptin resistance is associated with over activation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS mainly consists of endocannabinoids derived from n-6 fatty acids and cannabinoid receptors (CB1 coded by Cnr1 and CB2 coded by Cnr2). The CB1 activation in hypothalamus stimulates feeding and appetite for fat while CB2 activation seems to play an immunomodulatory role. We demonstrated that maternal HF diet increases hypothalamic CB1 in male offspring while increases CB2 in female offspring at birth, prior to obesity development. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these changes remain unexplored. We hypothesized that maternal HF diet would down-regulate leptin signaling and up-regulate Cnr1 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus of the offspring at birth, associated with sex-specific changes in epigenetic markers and sex steroid signaling. To test our hypothesis, we used progenitor female rats that received control diet (C, 9% fat) or isocaloric high-fat diet (HF, 28% fat) from 8 weeks before mating until delivery. Blood, hypothalamus and carcass from C and HF male and female offspring were collected for biochemical and molecular analyses at birth. Maternal HF diet down-regulated the transcriptional factor STAT3 in the hypothalamus of male and female offspring, but induced hypoleptinemia only in males and decreased phosphorylated STAT3 only in female offspring. Because leptin acts through STAT3 pathway to inhibit central ECS, our results suggest that leptin pathway impairment might contribute to increased levels of Crn1 mRNA in hypothalamus of both sex offspring. Besides, maternal HF diet increased the histone acetylation percentage of Cnr1 promoter in male offspring and increased the androgen receptor binding to the Cnr1 promoter, which can contribute to higher expression of Cnr1 in newborn HF offspring. Maternal HF diet increased plasma n6 to n3 fatty acid ratio in male offspring, which is an important risk factor to metabolic diseases and might indicate an over activation of endocannabinoid signaling. Thus, although maternal HF diet programs a similar phenotype in adult offspring of both sexes (obesity, hyperphagia and higher preference for fat), here we showed that molecular mechanisms involving leptin signaling, ECS, epigenetic markers and sex hormone signaling were modified prior to obesity development and can differ between newborn male and female offspring. These observations may provide molecular insights into sex-specific targets for anti-obesity therapies.",Stress-related genetic polymorphisms in association with peripartum depression symptoms and stress hormones: A longitudinal population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776573,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 04 05,"Individual differences in the response of the stress system to hormonal changes during pregnancy and the postpartum period render some women susceptible to developing depression.

Genotypes of ninety-four haplotype-tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in sixteen genes of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis pathway were analyzed and data on psychosocial and demographic factors was collected. In sub-studies, salivary cortisol awakening response in gestational week 35-39, salivary evening cortisol levels in gestational week 36 and postpartum week 6, and blood cortisol and cortisone levels in gestational week 35-39 were analyzed. SNP-set kernel association tests were performed at the gene-level, considering psychosocial and demographic factors, followed by post-hoc analyses of SNPs of significant genes. Statistically significant findings at the 0.05 p-level included SNPs in the hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11B1) gene in relation to self-rated depression scores in postpartum week six among all participants, and serpin family A member 6 (SERPINA6) gene at the same time-point among women with de novo onset of postpartum depression.

The interaction of the complexes (1-4) with DNA was evaluated by circular dichroism, gel electrophoresis, and fluorescence, and the complexes presented interactions by the minor grooves DNA. The phosphinic series of complexes exhibited a remarkably broad spectrum of anticancer activity with approximately 34-fold higher than cisplatin and 5-fold higher than doxorubicin, inhibiting the growth of 3D tumor spheroids and the ability to retain the colony survival of DU-145 cells. Also, the complex (4) inhibits DU-145 cell adhesion and migration potential indicating antimetastatic properties. The mechanism of its anticancer activity was found to be related to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, increased the BAX/BCL-2 ratio and subsequent apoptosis induction.

In this research, oxidation with nitric acid, heating under an inert atmosphere, and ammonia treatment were applied to modify the activated carbon surface. The modified adsorbents were used for the removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) from aqueous solutions at different concentrations (10-500‚ÄØmg‚ÄØL-1), pH 6, and 25‚ÄØ¬∞C. Adsorption mechanisms of Cr(VI) on the activated carbon were proposed based on the surface chemistry, adsorption/reduction, and desorption experiments. Findings demonstrate that acid functional groups of the activated carbon had an important effect on the hexavalent chromium removal. For instance, a high reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (50%) was obtained by the oxidized adsorbents, whereas the heat treated adsorbents achieved a low reduction (35%), but the ammonia-treated activated carbon achieved the lowest reduction (20%). The heat-treated adsorbent showed the best Cr(VI) adsorption capacity (48‚ÄØmg‚ÄØg-1), especially at equilibrium Cr(VI) concentration lower than 200‚ÄØmg‚ÄØL-1, and the fastest adsorption kinetics among the studied adsorbents. Furthermore, the highest Cr(VI) desorption (90%) was achieved with 0.1‚ÄØN NaOH-NaCl solutions. In summary, an anionic/reduction coupled adsorption mechanism of Cr(VI) seems to be feasible, and the heat-treated activated carbon is an interesting option for sequestering Cr(VI) species from aqueous effluents.",Environmental sustainability of anaerobic digestion of household food waste.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776553,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 26,"Consumers are the leading producers of food waste (FW) in developed countries and the majority of household FW is still embedded in general waste where it is incinerated or landfilled. There is increasing awareness in the value of collecting FW as a separate waste stream for production of compost or recovery of energy through anaerobic digestion (AD). This study focuses on AD to evaluate the life cycle environmental sustainability of recovering energy and fertilisers from household FW in the UK. The analysis is carried out for two different functional units: i) treatment of 1 tonne of FW, which is compared to incineration and landfilling; and ii) generation of 1‚ÄØMWh of electricity, which is compared to other electricity generation options. The former results in net negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (-39‚ÄØkg CO2-eq./t) and primary energy demand (-2‚ÄØGJ/t) due to the displacement of grid electricity and mineral fertilisers. AD has lower impacts than both incineration and landfilling across 15 of the 19 impacts. However, the application of digestate to land and the release of ammonia and nitrates lead to higher marine eutrophication (ME), terrestrial acidification (TA) and particulate matter formation (PMF). For the second functional unit, AD electricity emits 203‚ÄØkg CO2-eq./MWh, compared to 357‚ÄØkg CO2-eq./MWh for the UK grid mix. Compared to renewables, such as wind and solar, AD electricity has lower energy demand, toxicity potentials and metal depletion. However, it has higher global warming potential, ME, TA and PMF. At the UK level, treating 4.9‚ÄØMt of kerbside FW collected annually could provide 0.37% of the national electricity demand and save 190,000‚ÄØt CO2-eq./yr compared to the grid electricity. The digestate produced could displace 1% of industrial nitrogen fertilisers. Although small fractions of the national demands, they represent a valuable return from a largely unutilised waste stream and help towards implementation of a circular economy.",Comparison of organic compounds in char and soot from the combustion of biomass in boilers of various emission classes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776551,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 26,"The combustion of biomass in boilers of emission classes 2 and 3 produces deposits in the form of char and soot inside the combustion chamber. Char and soot differ in content of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) as well as in the content of organic compounds. Deposits from boilers of emission class 2 contain higher amounts of OC and EC than those from boilers of emission class 3. The only exception is deposits formed by the combustion of briquettes from hardwood in boilers of emission class 3 that contained approximately by up to 60 percent higher amount of OC and by approx. 100% more EC than deposits from combustion in boilers of emission class 2. Deposits identified as char are characterized by dominant organic compounds derived from thermic degradation of cellulose, lignin, phytosterols, terpenes, their alteration products, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Deposits identified as soot have dominant PAHs, compounds containing oxygen (furans, benzofurans, phenols) and compounds containing aliphatic nitrogen (benzonitrile). Char from boilers of emission class 2 contains approx. by 80% more alkanes and cycloalkanes, by 80% more nitriles, by 50% more carboxyl acids, by 230% more anhydrosaccharides, phytosterols and by 180% more PAHs.

Extreme droughts, which are more often prolonged, can increase the risk of forest fires, not only in southern Europe but also, in Central Europe. Nonetheless, catastrophic fire events are not well recognized in the Central European Lowlands (CEL), where large forest complexes are located. Knowledge of past fire activity in this part of Europe is scarce, although several fires have occurred in this area during the previous millennia. Large coniferous forest monocultures located in the CEL are highly susceptible to fires and other disturbances. Here, we present a case study from the Tuchola Pinewoods (TP; northern Poland), where large pine monocultures are present. The main aim of this study is to document the potential effects past land management has on modern day disturbance regimes using state-of-the-art paleoecological data, historical documents and cartographic materials. We then present a protocol that will help forest managers utilize long-term paleoecological records. Based on paleoecological investigations, historical documents, and cartographic materials, our results show that, in the past 300 years, the TP witnessed not only disastrous fires and but also windfalls by tornados and insect outbreaks. A change in management from Polish to Prussian/German in the 18th century led to the transformation of mixed forests into Scots pine monocultures with the purpose to allow better economic use of the forest. Those administrative decisions led to an ecosystem highly susceptible to disturbances. This article provides a critical review of past forest management as well as future research directions related to the impacts of fire risk on land management and ecosystem services: (a) habitat composition and structure (biodiversity); (b) natural water management; and (c) mitigation of climate changes. Designated forest conditions, management, and future fire risk are a controversial and highly debated topic of forest management by Forestry Units. More research will allow the gathering of reliable information pertinent to management practices with regard to the current fire risks.

Similar results were found in the comparison of spontaneous vaginal births only vs. cesarean sections (Group 1: OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ7.76; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ4.43, 13.60; Group 2: OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.08; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.50, 2.89). There was no significant difference in POP between assisted vaginal delivery (including vacuum and forceps) and spontaneous vaginal births. Compared with cesarean sections, vaginal delivery (including women delivering only by spontaneous vaginal births and women with both vaginal and cesarean deliveries) is associated with an increased risk of long-term POP.","Access to second-line drug susceptibility testing results among patients with Rifampicin resistant tuberculosis after introduction of the Hain

However, data on the reliability of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes during LUT task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) across separate measurements are lacking. Proof of the latter is crucial to evaluate whether fMRI can be used to assess supraspinal responses to LUT treatments. Therefore, we prospectively assessed task-specific supraspinal responses from 20 healthy participants undergoing two fMRI measurements (test-retest) within 5-8 weeks. The fMRI measurements, conducted in a 3T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner, comprised a block design of repetitive bladder filling and drainage using an automated MR-compatible and MR-synchronized infusion-drainage device. Following transurethral catheterization and bladder pre-filling with body warm saline until participants perceived a persistent desire to void (START condition), fMRI was recorded during repetitive blocks (each 15‚ÄØs) of INFUSION and WITHDRAWAL of 100‚ÄØmL body warm saline into respectively from the bladder. BOLD signal changes were calculated for INFUSION minus START. In addition to whole brain analysis, we assessed BOLD signal changes within multiple 'a priori' region of interest (ROI), i.e. brain areas known to be involved in the LUT control from previous literature. To evaluate reliability of the fMRI results between visits, we applied different types of analyses: coefficient of variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), S√∏rensen-Dice index, Bland-Altman method, and block-wise BOLD signal comparison. All participants completed the study without adverse events. The desire to void was rated significantly higher for INFUSION compared to START or WITHDRAWAL at both measurements without any effect of visit. At whole brain level, significant (p‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05, cluster corrected, k‚ÄØ‚â•‚ÄØ41 voxels) BOLD signal changes were found for the contrast INFUSION compared to START in several brain areas. Overlap of activation maps from both measurements were observed in the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and inferior parietal lobe. The two highest ICCs, based on a ROI's mean beta weight, were 0.55 (right insular cortex) and 0.47 (VLPFC). Spatial congruency (S√∏rensen-Dice index) of all voxels within each ROI between measurements was highest in the insular cortex (left 0.55, right 0.44). In addition, the mean beta weight of the right insula and right VLPFC demonstrated the lowest CV and narrowest Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement. In conclusion, the right insula and right VLPFC were revealed as the two most reliable task-specific ROIs using our automated, MR-synchronized protocol. Achieving high reliability using a viscero-sensory/interoceptive task such as repetitive bladder filling remains challenging and further endeavour is highly warranted to better understand which factors influence fMRI outcomes and finally to assess LUT treatment effects on the supraspinal level.",Distinct visuo-motor brain dynamics for real-world objects versus planar images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776529,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Ultimately, we aim to generalize and translate scientific knowledge to the real world, yet current understanding of human visual perception is based predominantly on studies of two-dimensional (2-D) images. Recent cognitive-behavioral evidence shows that real objects are processed differently to images, although the neural processes that underlie these differences are unknown. Because real objects (unlike images) afford actions, they may trigger stronger or more prolonged activation in neural populations for visuo-motor action planning. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) when human observers viewed real-world three-dimensional (3-D) objects or closely matched 2-D images of the same items. Although responses to real objects and images were similar overall, there were critical differences. Compared to images, viewing real objects triggered stronger and more sustained event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the Œº frequency band (8-13‚ÄØHz) - a neural signature of automatic motor preparation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed a transient, early occipital negativity for real objects (versus images), likely reflecting 3-D stereoscopic differences, and a late sustained parietal amplitude modulation consistent with an 'old-new' memory advantage for real objects over images. Together, these findings demonstrate that real-world objects trigger stronger and more sustained action-related brain responses than images do. The results highlight important similarities and differences between brain responses to images and richer, more ecologically relevant, real-world objects.",I feel what I do: Relating interoceptive processes and reward-related behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776528,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Interoceptive signalling has been shown to contribute to action regulation and action experience. Here, we assess whether motor behaviour can be influenced by anticipated homeostatic feeling states induced through different predictable contexts. Participants performed a reward incentive paradigm in which accurate responses increased (gain) or avoided the depletion (averted loss) of a credit score. Across two types of blocks, we varied the predictability of the outcome state. In predictable blocks, a cue signaled a gain, loss or control trial (motor response did not affect the credit score). This allowed participants to anticipate the interoceptive feeling state associated with the outcome. In unpredictable blocks, the cue had no relation to the type of outcome. Thus, participants were unable to anticipate the feeling state it produced. Via EEG, we measured the Heartbeat Evoked Potential (HEP) and the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) as indices of interoceptive and motor processing respectively. In addition, we measured feedback P3 amplitude following outcome presentation and accuracy and reaction times of the required motor response. We observed higher HEP and CNV amplitudes as well as faster and more accurate motor responses in predictable compared to unpredictable outcome blocks. Similarly, feedback-related P3 amplitudes were significantly lower for predictable relative to unpredictable outcomes. Crucially, HEP amplitudes measured prior to feedback predicted feedback-related P3 amplitudes for anticipated outcome events. Results suggest that accurate anticipation of homeostatic feeling states associated with gain, loss or control outcomes facilitates motor execution and outcome evaluation. Findings are hereby the first to empirically assess the link between interoceptive and motor domains and provide primary evidence for a joint processing structure.",The European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) Registry Working Definitions for the Clinical¬†Diagnosis of Inborn Errors of Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776527,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

They help to achieve a sufficient sample size for epidemiological and clinical research and to assess the feasibility of clinical trials. The European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) registry currently comprises information on more than 25,000 patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). The prerequisite of a patient to be included into the ESID registry is an IEI either defined by a defect in a gene included in the disease classification of the international union of immunological societies, or verified by applying clinical criteria. Because a relevant number of patients, including those with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), representing the largest group of patients in the registry, remain without a genetic diagnosis, consensus on classification of these patients is mandatory. Here, we present clinical criteria for a large number of IEI that were designed in expert panels with an external review. They were implemented for novel entries and verification of existing data sets from 2014, yielding a substantial refinement. For instance, 8% of adults and 27% of children with CVID (176 of 1704 patients) were reclassified to 22 different immunodeficiencies, illustrating progress in genetics, but also the previous lack of standardized disease definitions. Importantly, apart from registry purposes, the clinical criteria are also helpful to support treatment decisions in the absence of a genetic diagnosis or in patients with variants of unknown significance.","AAAAI/ACAAI Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Surveillance Study (2013-2017): Fatalities, Infections, Delayed Reactions, and Use of Epinephrine Autoinjectors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776526,The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

Wild birds have long been thought to serve as the natural reservoir of influenza virus, and thus it is expected that wild birds harbor higher viral diversity than poultry. Yet, this hypothesis has not been formally tested. Here, we assemble a data set of AIV from 75 regions worldwide over 11 years and compare the genetic diversity of wild bird AIV with that of poultry AIV. We find the genetic diversity of the internal genes of AIV in wild birds is not significantly higher than that in poultry. We propose that the unexpected diversity pattern of AIV internal genes could be explained by the synchronized global sweep of AIV internal genes occurring in the late 1800s and frequent AIV transmission between wild birds and poultry. Our findings might have important implications in understanding the evolution of influenza virus.",Adaptive genetic diversifications among tick-borne encephalitis virus subtypes: A genome-wide perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776508,Virology,2019 03 30,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a severe neurological illness in humans. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), the causative agent, can be grouped into Far Eastern, Siberian, and (Western) European subtypes. These subtypes are characterized by diverse vector specificity, host range and clinical manifestations. To provide hints for the decisive genetic factors underlying their epidemic and pathogenic diversities, we performed a genome-wide evolutionary study to evaluate the genetic diversity accompanied with the segregations of TBEV subtypes. The results show that adaptive selection has driven the diversification among these subtypes. Furthermore, the adaptive divergence-related changes have taken place on the proteins C, NS1, and/or NS2A. These results highlight candidate genes for the epidemic and pathogenic diversities, and will be useful in understanding the epidemic and pathogenic features of TBE.",Effects of silver diamine fluoride/potassium iodide on artificial root caries lesions with adjunctive application of proanthocyanidin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776507,Acta biomaterialia,2019 03 29,"Treatment of carious root surfaces remains challenging due to the complex pathological processes and difficulty in restoring the original structure of root dentine. Current treatments targeting the de-/re-mineralisation processes are not entirely satisfactory in terms of the protection of the dentinal organic matrix and the highly organised structure of dentine. In this in vitro study, a cross-linking agent - proanthocyanidin (PA) was used in conjunction with a fluoride-based treatment - silver diamine fluoride/potassium iodide (SDF/KI) to putatively stabilise the organic dentinal framework as well as strengthen the collagen-mineral phase interaction. The effectiveness of this strategy was evaluated 24 h after application in terms of the distribution of ion uptake and microstructure of dentine after treatment as well as analysis of the nano-mechanical properties using a dynamic behaviour model. Results showed that individual use of SDF/KI significantly improved the surface microhardness and integrated mineral density (Z) up to 60‚ÄØ¬µm depth and the recovery of creep behaviour of demineralised dentine in the surface area compared to that treated with deionised distilled water (DDW). The combined treatment of PA and SDF/KI achieved a more homogenous mineral distribution throughout the lesions than SDF/KI alone; a more significant incremental increase in surface microhardness and Z was observed. Specifically, a superior effect on the subsurface area occurred with PA‚ÄØ+‚ÄØSDF/KI, with significant improvements in microhardness, elastic modulus and recovery of creep behaviour of the demineralised dentine. Application of SDF/KI induced small discrete crystal formation distributed over the dentine surface and PA contributed to the formation of slit-shaped orifices of the dentinal tubules that were partially occluded. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Demographic transitions and improved oral health behaviour have resulted in increased tooth retention in elderly people. As a consequence, the risk of root dentine caries is increasing due to the age-associated gingival recession and the related frequent exposure of cervical root dentine. Root caries is difficult to repair because of the complex aetiology and dentine structure. The recovery of dentine quality depends not only on reincorporation of minerals but also an intact dentinal organic matrix and the organic-inorganic interfacial structure, which contribute to the biomechanics of dentine. With the capability of dentine modification, cross-linking agents were applied with a fluoride regimen, which improved its treatment efficacy of root caries regarding the distribution of ion uptake and recovery of dentine biomechanics.",Laser-based 3D bioprinting for spatial and size control of tumor spheroids and embryoid bodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776506,Acta biomaterialia,2019 03 19,"3D multicellular aggregates, and more advanced organotypic systems, have become central tools in recent years to study a wide variety of complex biological processes. Most notably, these model systems have become mainstream within oncology (multicellular tumor spheroids) and regenerative medicine (embryoid bodies) research. However, the biological behavior of these in vitro tissue surrogates is extremely sensitive to their aggregate size and geometry. Indeed, both of these geometrical parameters are key in producing pathophysiological gradients responsible for cellular and structural heterogeneity, replicating in vivo observations. Moreover, the fabrication techniques most widely used for producing these models lack the ability to accurately control cellular spatial location, an essential component for regulating homotypic and heterotypic cell signaling. Herein, we report on a 3D bioprinting technique, laser direct-write (LDW), that enables precise control of both spatial patterning and size of cell-encapsulating microbeads. The generated cell-laden beads are further processed into core-shelled structures, allowing for the growth and formation of self-contained, self-aggregating cells (e.g., breast cancer cells, embryonic stem cells). Within these structures we demonstrate our ability to produce multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs) and embryoid bodies (EBs) with well-controlled overall size and shape, that can be designed on demand. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of aggregate size on the uptake of a commonly employed ligand for receptor-mediated drug delivery, Transferrin, indicating that larger tumor spheroids exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity in ligand uptake. Taken together, these findings establish LDW as a versatile biomanufacturing platform for bioprinting and patterning core-shelled structures to generate size-controlled 3D multicellular aggregates. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Multicellular 3D aggregates are powerful in vitro models used to study a wide variety of complex biological processes, particularly within oncology and regenerative medicine. These tissue surrogates are fabricated using environments that encourage cellular self-assembly. However, specific applications require control of aggregate size and position to recapitulate key in vivo parameters (e.g., pathophysiological gradients and homotypic/heterotypic cell signaling). Herein, we demonstrate the ability to create and spatially pattern size-controlled embryoid bodies and tumor spheroids, using laser-based 3D bioprinting. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of tumor spheroid size on internalization of Transferrin, a common ligand for targeted therapy, finding greater spatial heterogeneity in our large aggregates. Overall, this technique offers incredible promise and flexibility for fabricating idealized 3D in vitro models.",Angiogenesis involvement by octacalcium phosphate-gelatin composite-driven bone regeneration in rat calvaria critical-sized defect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776505,Acta biomaterialia,2019 03 29,"Effect of octacalcium phosphate/gelatin composite (OCP/Gel) on angiogenesis was studied by its implantation in rat calvaria critical-sized defect in relation to bone regeneration for 2 and 4‚ÄØweeks. The implantation of OCP/Gel disks was analyzed by radiomorphometry using a radiopaque material perfusion (Microfil¬Æ) method and histomorphometry by hematoxylin and eosin-staining before and after the decalcification. Effect of the OCP dose in the range up to 4‚ÄØmg per well on the capillary-like tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was also examined in a transwell cell culture. The results showed that the blood vessels formation by OCP/Gel group was significantly higher at 2‚ÄØweeks than other groups but decreased at 4‚ÄØweeks during the advancement of new bone formation. The capillary-like tube formation was highest in an OCP dose of 1‚ÄØmg per well while other OCP doses above or below 1‚ÄØmg did not show such a stimulatory effect. The results established both in vivo and in vitro confirmed that OCP has a positive effect on angiogenesis during bone regeneration in a suitable dose ranges, suggesting that the angiogenesis stimulated by OCP could be involved in the OCP/Gel-enhanced bone regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We have reported that octacalcium phosphate (OCP) materials display stimulatory capacities on the bone tissue-related cells. However, the effect of OCP on the angiogenesis and its relation to the OCP-enhanced bone regeneration is unknown. This study confirmed the capacity of OCP on angiogenesis before increasing the new bone mass after the implantation of a composite of OCP and gelatin (OCP/Gel). The blood vessels formation took place associated with the area beginning of the new bone formation, which finally decreased together with development of bone formation. Because OCP was ascertained stimulating the capillary-like tube formation in HUVEC culture with a certain OCP dose, the present study is the first report showing the capacity of OCP on angiogenesis during the OCP/Gel-enhanced bone regeneration.","WIN55,212-2 induces caspase-independent apoptosis on human glioblastoma cells by regulating HSP70, p53 and Cathepsin D.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776504,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 05 23,"Despite the standard approaches to treat the highly aggressive and invasive glioblastoma (GBM), it remains incurable. In this sense, cannabinoids highlight as a promising tool, because this tumor overexpresses CB1 and/or CB2 receptors and being, therefore, can be susceptible to cannabinoids treatment. Thus, this work investigated the action of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55-212-2 on GBM cell lines and non-malignant cell lines, in vitro and in vivo. WIN was selectively cytotoxic to GBM cells. These presented blebbing and nuclear alterations in addition to cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation. WIN also significantly inhibited the migration of GAMG and U251 cells. Finally, the data also showed that the antitumor effects of WIN are exerted, at least to some extent, by the expression of p53 and increased cathepsin D in addition to the decreased expression of HSP70.This data can indicate caspase-independent cell death mechanism. In addition, WIN decreased tumoral perimeter as well as caused a reduction the blood vessels in this area, without causing lysis, hemorrhage or blood clotting. So, the findings herein presented reinforce the usefulness of cannabinoids as a candidate for further evaluation in treatment in glioblastoma treatment.",Proteome changes in methylmercury-exposed mouse primary cerebellar granule neurons and astrocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776503,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 05 23,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a neurotoxicant, with the cerebellum as the main target of toxicity; however, the toxic effects of MeHg on specific cell types remain unclear.

Intracellular mercury and ROS levels showed dose-dependent increases. Mercury accumulation was greater in CGNs than astrocytes. The proteomic analysis identified a total of 1966 and 3214 proteins in CGNs and astrocytes, among which 183 and 262 proteins were differentially expressed after mercury exposure, respectively. Enrichment analysis revealed mitochondrial-associated organelles as the main targets of MeHg in both cell types. Whereas multiple functions/pathways were affected in CGNs, the oxidation-reduction process was the most significantly changed function/pathway in astrocytes. CGNs were more sensitive to MeHg-mediated neurotoxicity than astrocytes. The two cell types showed distinct mechanistic responses to MeHg. In astrocytes, the mitochondrion was the primary target of toxicity, resulting in increases in oxidation-reduction process responses. In CGNs, the neurotrophin signaling pathway, cytoskeleton, cAMP signaling pathway, and thyroid hormone signaling pathway were affected.",Distinct gene expression changes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with different tobacco product preparations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776502,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 05 23,"Cigarette smoking exerts diverse physiological effects including immune suppression. To better characterize the biological effects of different categories of tobacco products, a genome-wide gene expression study was performed. Transcriptomic profiling was performed in PBMCs treated with different equi-nicotine units of aqueous extracts of cigarette smoke (termed Whole Smoke-Conditioned Medium, or WS-CM), or a single dose smokeless tobacco extract (STE) prepared from reference tobacco products. WS-CM induced dose-dependent changes in the expression of several genes. No significant expression differences between low WS-CM and media control were detected. However, transcripts were significantly affected by medium WS-CM (479), high WS-CM (2, 703), and STE (2, 156). The overlap between medium WS-CM and STE, and high WS-CM and STE, was minimal (34 and 65 transcripts, respectively). Hierarchical clustering revealed that gene expression profiles for STE and medium WS-CM co-clustered, while those affected by the high dose of WS-CM clustered distinctly. Functional analysis revealed that WS-CM, but not STE, uniquely affected genes involved in immune cell development and inflammatory response. Cascades of upstream regulators (e.g., TNF, IL1Œ≤, NF∆ôB) were identified for the observed gene expression changes and generally suppressed by WS-CM, but not by STE. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that combustible and non-combustible tobacco products elicit distinct biological effects, which could explain the observed chronic immune suppression in smokers.",Using mouse genetics to understand human skeletal disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776501,Bone,2019 03 05,"Technological advances have enabled the study of the human genome in incredible detail with relative ease.

Underpinned by marked genetic correspondence, skeletal biology shows inter-species similarities which provide important opportunities to use data from mouse models to direct research into the genetic basis of skeletal pathophysiology. In this article we outline critical resources that may be used to establish genotype/phenotype relationships in skeletal tissue, identify genes with established skeletal effects and define the transcriptome of critical skeletal cell types. Finally, we outline how these mouse resources might be utilized to progress from a list of human sequence variants toward plausible gene candidates that contribute to skeletal disease."

B, Biology",2019 03 29,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) possesses a number of exceptional pharmaceutical properties and applications as compared with other types of metallic nanoparticles. Currently, AgNPs was biosynthesized using an aqueous extract of Zea mays L. (corn flour) powder. Further, the effect of concentration of reagents, extract, temperature and time of synthesis was also studied along with the cytotoxicity and radical scavenging potential. UV-vis spectra of AgNPs gave a surface plasmon resonance at ~420‚ÄØnm. The absorption peak became sharp with the increase in time. AgNPs with monodispersed and aggregated spherical shape was observed by SEM image followed by its confirmation via strong signal in silver region of EDX spectrum. The XRD spectra confirmed its crystallinity and face-centered cubic structure. FT-IR spectra reveal the presence of phytocompounds in the synthesis of AgNPs. Further, the AgNPs exhibited strong cytotoxicity potential against HepG2 cells and its viability declined with an increase in the concentration of AgNP with respect to the control cells. It also demonstrated reasonable radical scavenging potential in terms of DPPH and ABTS scavenging, and reducing power tests. Taken together, these results of the current investigation stated that AgNPs could be beneficial in biomedical applications particularly for treatment of cancer disease along with its applications in pharmaceutical industries for the formulation of new drugs.",The underlying factors that explain why nucleophilic reagents rarely co-elute with test chemicals in the ADRA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776483,Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods,2019 03 22,"The Amino acid Derivative Reactivity Assay (ADRA) is an in chemico alternative to animal testing for skin sensitization potential that uses two different nucleophilic reagents and it is known that ADRA hardly exhibts co-elution compared with the Direct Peptide Reactivity Assay (DPRA) based on the same scientific principles. In this study, we have analyzed the factors underlying why co-elution, which is sometimes an issue during DPRA testing, virtually never occurs during ADRA testing. Chloramine T and dimethyl isophthalate both exhibited co-elution during DPRA testing, but when quantified at both DPRA's 220‚ÄØnm and ADRA's 281‚ÄØnm, we found that when the later detection wavelength was used, these test chemicals produced extremely small peaks that did not interfere with quantification of the peptides. And although both salicylic acid and penicillin G exhibited co-elution during DPRA testing, when tested at a concentration just 1% of that used in DPRA, the very broad peak produced at the higher concentration was reduced significantly. However, both these test chemicals exhibited very sharp peaks when the pH of the injection sample was adjusted to be acidic. Based on these results, we were able to clarify that the reasons why nucleophlic reagents hardly co-elute with test chemicals during ADRA testing are depend on the following three major reasons: (1)differences in the detection wavelength, (2)differences in test chemical concentrations in the injection sample, (3)differences in composition of the injection solvent.",Emerging role of histone deacetylase inhibitors as anti-breast-cancer agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776482,Drug discovery today,2019 03 28,"Breast cancer (BC) remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. A balance in the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) is necessary for epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Impairment in the balance between the actions of HATs and HDACs has been reported in the development of BC. By targeting histone and several non-histone proteins, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can maintain the cellular acetylation profile and reverse the function of several proteins responsible for BC development. Preclinical and clinical data show that HDACi can evoke different anticancer mechanisms in distinct BC types.",PD-L1 promotes colorectal cancer stem cell expansion by activating HMGA1-dependent signaling pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776481,Cancer letters,2019 03 27,"PD-L1 is critical for tumor cell escape from immune surveillance by inhibiting T cell function via the PD-1 receptor. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies might potently enhance antitumor effects in various tumors, but the effect of PD-L1 on colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) remains unclear. We observed high PD-L1 expression in CD133+CD44+ colorectal CSCs and CSC-enriched tumorspheres. Altering PD-L1 expression promoted colorectal CSC self-renewal by increasing the expression of stemness genes, the CD133+CD44+ cell population sizes and the ability to form tumorspheres. Additionally, PD-L1 expression was markedly increased in chemoresistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, PD-L1 enhanced CRC cell tumorigenicity in nude mice; the inoculation of 1‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ104‚ÄØcells resulted in high tumor formation efficiency. Mechanistically, PD-L1 directly interacted with HMGA1, and HMGA1 upregulation by PD-L1 activated HMGA1-dependent pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, and promoted CSC expansion. HMGA1 downregulation rescued the PD-L1-induced phenotypes, highlighting the role of HMGA1 in PD-L1-mediated colorectal CSC self-renewal. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was correlated with the expression of CSC markers and HMGA1 in clinical CRC specimens. Thus, PD-L1 could crucially contribute to the maintenance of CSC self-renewal by activating HMGA1-dependent signaling pathways.",Ligand-dependent EphB4 activation serves as an anchoring signal in glioma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776480,Cancer letters,2019 03 11,"Of the erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular receptors (Ephs), EphB4 has recently emerged as a potential target in several cancers due to its roles in modified cell migration and invasion. As little is known about the roles of EphB4 in glioma, we sought to investigate its function in glioma by in vitro cell migration and invasion assays, immunoblotting and immunostaining. EphB4 was expressed in glioma cell lines and stem-like cell lines. The stimulation of glioma cells with ephrin-B2, the sole ligand of EphB4, conducted EphB4 phosphorylation and suppressed migration and invasion that downregulation of EphB4 using small interfering RNA abrogated. The stimulation also suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt. We confirmed by immunostaining that EphB4-positive cells existing only in the tumor core, whereas ephrin-B2-positive cells widespread in both the tumor core and the invasive area signifying that EphB4-ephrin-B2 reaction occurred only at the tumor core. Taken together, our data suggest that ephrin-B2-dependent EphB4 phosphorylation acts as an anchoring signal to reduce the malignancy by inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in the glioma core, whereas the scarcity of signaling in the tumor periphery promotes invasion into the surrounding brain.",Endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis control and gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776479,Cancer letters,2019 03 11,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary organelle responsible for the synthesis, modification, folding and secretion of proteins, especially in specialized secretory cells. It also contributes to the maintenance of cellular functions, such as Ca2+ storage, lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and organelle biogenesis. Cellular stress conditions, such as glucose deprivation, hypoxia and disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis, may increase the risk of protein misfolding and perturb proteostasis. This activates ER stress and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to either the restoration of homeostasis or cell death. ER stress and UPR have been shown to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis, progression and treatment response of various cancers. In gastric cancer (GC), one of the most aggressive cancer types, critical functions of ER stress signaling have also started to emerge. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge linking ER stress and UPR to GC; we also discuss the possible nodes of therapeutic intervention and propose directions of future research.",NFX1-123 is highly expressed in cervical cancer and increases growth and telomerase activity in HPV 16E6 expressing cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776478,Cancer letters,2019 03 29,"A significant contributor to women's cancer mortality worldwide is cervical cancer, which is caused by high-risk human papillomavirus (HR HPV). The two viral oncoproteins of HR HPV, E6 and E7, partner with host cell proteins to target oncogenic proteins and pathways. Previously, we have shown HR HPV type 16 E6 (16E6) interacts with the host protein NFX1-123 to target telomerase and cellular immortalization, requiring NFX1-123 to fully upregulate telomerase activity. We now report that NFX1-123 is highly expressed in primary cervical cancers. In vitro, cells expressing 16E6 and overexpressing NFX1-123 have extended active growth, decreased senescence marker staining, and more rapid cell cycling compared to 16E6 expressing cells with endogenous amounts of NFX1-123. These findings were associated with increased telomerase activity and augmented expression of its catalytic subunit, hTERT. In complement, HPV 16 positive cervical cancer cell lines with knocked down NFX1-123 had slowed growth and reduced hTERT over time. In cells that express HR HPV E6, greater expression of NFX1-123 can modify active cellular growth and augment hTERT expression and telomerase activity over time, potentially supporting the initiation and progression of HPV-associated cancers.",Blood and dietary magnesium levels are not linked with lower prostate cancer risk in black or white men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776477,Cancer letters,2019 06 10,"Recent studies suggest a diet low in dietary magnesium intake or lower blood magnesium levels is linked with increased prostate cancer risk. This study investigates the race-specific link between blood magnesium and calcium levels, or dietary magnesium intake, and the diagnosis of low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer. The study included 637 prostate cancer cases and 715 biopsy-negative controls (50% black) recruited from Nashville, TN or Durham, NC. Blood was collected at the time of recruitment, and dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Percent genetic African ancestry was determined as a compliment to self-reported race. Blood magnesium levels and dietary magnesium intake were significantly lower in black compared to white men. However, magnesium levels or intake were not associated with risk of total prostate cancer or aggressive prostate cancer. Indeed, a higher calcium-to-magnesium diet intake was significantly protective for high-grade prostate cancer in black (OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.66 (0.45, 0.96), p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.03) but not white (OR‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ1.00 (0.79, 1.26), p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.99) men. In summary, there was a statistically significant difference in magnesium intake between black and white men, but the biological impact was unclear, and we did not confirm a lower prostate cancer risk associated with magnesium levels."

Genetic factors including specific genes and miRNAs may play pivotal roles on EEA. However, it is not well defined what genes and micro RNAs participate the pathophysiological alterations of EEA. In this work, we compared the Transcriptome -Seq and microRNA profiles from three pairs of villi (three EEA patients and three normal pregnancy, NP). We first confirmed the array data by qPCR with ten randomly selected differentially expressed genes and ten differentially expressed miRNAs in villi from 20 EEA and 20 NP controls. We next applied Gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway analysis and found that these differentially expressed genes enriched in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, Jak-STAT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Complement and coagulation cascades, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Interestingly, hsa-miR-6515-5p and its target genes NLRP3, UGP2 may regulate the Immune system and carbohydrate metabolism. Hsa-miRNA 518 and its target gene EGR1 may regulate cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell apoptosis to impact early embryonic development.

In this study, data obtained from Oncomine database, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) analysis and Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was used to assess the expression of mortalin in serous ovarian carcinoma. The prognostic value of mortalin was analyzed using Meier plotter database and Kaplan-Meier. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide) assay, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and colony formation assay were used to detect cell reproductive capacity. SK-OV-3 cell motility and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were measured by wound-healing, migration and western-blot assays. Data from Oncomine showed that mortalin was highly expressed in serous ovarian carcinomas compared with corresponding normal controls. Similar results were found in CCLE analysis and in clinical specimens. High mortalin expression was associated with high histological grade and worse overall survival (OS) rate. The results of MTT analyses, IF staining, and colony formation assay indicated that MKT-077 (1-Ethyl-2-[[3-ethyl-5-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinylidene] methyl]-pyridinium chloride) suppressed the viability of SK-OV-3 cells. Besides, mortalin suppression restrained cell EMT progression by Wnt/Œ≤-Catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, mortalin is over-expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma. High mortalin expression could be a candidate for the prognostic indicator and a biomarker in serous ovarian carcinoma.",Construction of Parkinson's disease marker-based weighted protein-protein interaction network for prioritization of co-expressed genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776463,Gene,2019 04 11,Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative movement disorder that primarily results due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region.

In this study, we cloned a novel gene, BrSKS13, that is differentially expressed in fertile and sterile flower buds of Chinese cabbage. BrSKS13 is most similar to Arabidopsis thaliana AT3G13400 (SKS13) and encodes a predicted 61.87‚ÄØkDa protein with three cupredoxin superfamily conserved domains in the multicopper oxidase family. Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (sqRT-PCR) showed that expression of BrSKS13 is higher in fertile buds than in sterile buds. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization showed that BrSKS13 is highly expressed in fertile anthers, peaking at pollen-maturation stage VI, but is weakly expressed in other tissues and floral organs. Expression patterns of BrSKS13 promoter::GUS reporter fusions in Arabidopsis showed that the BrSKS13 promoter drives expression of the GUS gene only in anthers. The relative expression of Brsks13 in fertile buds was higher than in sterile buds for all other MAMS lines of Chinese cabbage examined. These results suggest that BrSKS13 affects pollen development. In situ hybridization analysis of flower stigmas at different times after pollination showed that BrSKS13 expression was first observed in stigmas and immature seeds at 1‚ÄØh after pollination, and the signal intensity in seeds increased with increasing maturity. Compared to Col-0, A. thaliana sks13 mutant plants have shorter and fewer siliques, shriveled pollen grains, pollen tube abnormalities, and reduced seed number. The phenotype of sks13 mutant was recovered by over-expressing BrSKS13. Our results suggest that BrSKS13 affects pollen development and the pollination/fertilization process, and will enable further study of the genetic mechanisms underlying MAMS in Chinese cabbage.",Identification and characterization of ABC transporters for carbohydrate uptake in Thermus thermophilus HB8.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776461,Gene,2019 04 09,"Organisms use a variety of carbohydrates and metabolic pathways in order to capitalize in their specific environments. Depending upon their habitat, organism employs different types of transporters to maintain the cellular nutritional balance via central metabolism. A major contributor in this process in bacteria is a carbohydrate ABC transporter. The focus of this study is to get an insight into the carbohydrate transport and metabolism of a hot-spring-dwelling bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8. We applied high-throughput data-mining approaches for identification and characterization of carbohydrate ABC transporters in T. thermophilus HB8. This enabled the identification of 11 putative carbohydrate ABC transport systems. To identify the cognate ligands for these transporters, functional annotation was performed. However, scarcity of homologous-protein's function hinders the process of functional annotation. Thus, to overcome this limitation, we integrated the functional annotation of carbohydrate ABC transporters with their metabolic analysis. Our results demonstrate that out of 11 putative carbohydrate ABC transporters, six are involved in the sugar (four for monosaccharides and polysaccharides-degraded products and two for osmotic regulation), four in phospholipid precursor (namely UgpABCE) and the remaining one in purine uptake. Further, analysis suggests the existence of sharing mechanism of transmembrane domains (TMDs) and/or nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) among the 11 carbohydrate ABC transporters.",Genome-wide identification and characterization of HD-ZIP genes in potato.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776460,Gene,2019 04 11,"HD-ZIP (Homeodomain leucine zipper) transcription factors play an important regulatory role in stress resistance in plants. The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the HD-ZIP genes/proteins and to study their expression profiles under high and low temperature conditions in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). A strict homology search was used to find 43 HD-ZIP genes located on potato chromosomes 1-12. Exons/introns, protein features and conserved motifs were analyzed, and six segment duplications were identified from 43 HD-ZIP genes. Then, we analyzed the data from the PGSC (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium) database regarding the expression of 43 HD-ZIP genes that were induced by biotic and abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments and conducted an expression analysis for these genes across all potato life stages. Additionally, the expression levels of 13 HD-ZIP genes were analyzed under high temperature (37‚ÄØ¬∞C) and low temperature (4‚ÄØ¬∞C) conditions. The results showed that the transcript levels of all 13 genes changed, which indicated that these genes respond to heat and cold in plants. Especially for StHOX20, the expression significantly upregulated in roots at 37‚ÄØ¬∞C and 4‚ÄØ¬∞C. Our findings laid the foundation and provided clues for understanding the biological functions of HD-ZIP family genes.",Prenatal caffeine exposure increases the susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in female offspring rats via activation of GR-C/EBPŒ±-SIRT1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776459,Toxicology,2019 03 18,"This study aimed to evaluate female adult offspring induced by prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) are susceptible to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and to explore the underlying programming mechanisms. Pregnant rats were intragastrically administered caffeine (30, 60, and 120‚Äâmg/kg.d) on gestational day (GD) 9-20. The female adult offspring were randomly divided into three groups: offspring without or with chronic stress during postnatal week (PW) 10-12 and PW28 offspring. Results showed that PW28 PCE female offspring had a higher hepatic triglyceride content and Kleiner scores, accompanied by elevated serum corticosterone levels. Moreover, the expression levels of hepatic glucocorticoid receptor (GR), CCAAT enhancer binding protein Œ± (C/EBPŒ±), fatty acid synthetase (FASN) and the transcription factor-sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) were increased, but SIRT1 expression was decreased. The fetal rats and PW12 offspring with chronic stress exhibited similar changes as PW28 offspring, accompanied by increased levels of H3K14ac and H3K27ac in the SREBP1c and FASN gene promoters. These effects were also observed by treating L02 cells with cortisol and were partially reversed by GR or C/EBPŒ± siRNA or treatment with the SIRT1 agonist resveratrol. Taken together, PCE-induced high glucocorticoids levels enhanced histone modifications and expression of SREBP1c and FASN via activation of the GR-C/EBPŒ±-SIRT1 pathway in utero. This enhanced female fetal hepatic triglyceride synthesis and continued throughout postnatal and adult life, increasing the susceptibility to adult NAFLD.","Oleanolic acid 3-glucoside, a synthetic oleanane-type saponin, alleviates methylmercury toxicity in vitro and in vivo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776458,Toxicology,2019 03 18,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is one of the most toxic environmental pollutants, presenting a serious health hazard worldwide. In this study, we examined the potential of derivatives of oleanolic acid (OA), such as OA 3-glucoside, OA 28-glucoside, and OA 3,28-diglucoside, to mitigate MeHg toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We found that OA 3-glucoside suppressed the cellular MeHg uptake by 63.4% compared with that of the control and improved the cell viability from 75.4% to 107.9% upon exposure to cytotoxic MeHg in Caco-2 cells. To verify the anti-MeHg activity of OA 3-glucoside, mice were orally administered MeHg (0, 1.0, or 5.0‚Äâmg‚Äâkg-1¬∑d-1), with or without OA 3-glucoside, and then mercury accumulation was measured in various organs of the mice. The mice co-treated with MeHg and OA 3-glucoside showed significantly lower mercury content in organs such as the cerebrum, cerebellum, liver, kidney, and spleen, with 83.1%, 68.7%, 71.7%, 82.1%, and 18.2% of those in the OA 3-glucoside-untreated group, respectively. This suggested OA 3-glucoside had the potential as an anti-MeHg compound, owing to its ability to suppress the distribution of MeHg into organs. Supporting this hypothesis, the mice treated with MeHg and OA 3-glucoside showed a tendency to survive one day longer than the control mice. Our findings suggest OA 3-glucoside administration alleviates the toxicity of MeHg by suppressing MeHg accumulation in organs.",Using a smartphone application (PocketCPR) to determine CPR quality in a bystander CPR scenario - A manikin trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776457,Resuscitation,2019 03 23,"Feedback devices and dispatcher assistance increase CPR quality in bystander resuscitation.

In this study liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to compare the barley proteome after extraction using seven protocols, with and without defatting and protein precipitation steps that aimed to remove interfering secondary metabolites. Tris-HCl and urea buffers yielded 1405 and 1483 proteins (~79% overlap) from barley (cv Sloop). Inclusion of a pre-extraction defatting step yielded 1336 (Tris-HCl) and 1286 (urea) proteins (~74% overlap). Whilst post-extraction TCA/acetone protein precipitation negatively impacted protein recovery, yielding 673 (Tris-HCl) and 734 (urea) proteins. Alcohol-based extraction yielded a lower number of proteins (645), but notably this extraction method co-extracted and enriched the gluten and Œ±-amylase trypsin inhibitors. Based on these preliminary results, proteins were extracted from two selected cultivars of wheat, rye, barley and oats using three extraction protocols. Bioinformatic analyses of the identified proteins provide evidence that the choice of extraction buffer enriches different protein functional classes. The selection of the protein extraction protocol directly influences the identified cereal grain proteome composition, thus affecting the downstream biological interpretation of data. SIGNIFICANCE: LC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis revealed that both Tris-HCl and urea-based extraction yielded a similar suite of proteins from cereal grains with remarkable (70-80%) overlap. Yet the peptides derived from the proteins differed, rendering these extraction buffers complementary, in particular resulting in improved protein sequence coverage. The inclusion of commonly incorporated practices, such as pre-extraction defatting or post-extraction precipitation steps offered no benefit. The extraction method selected was noted to impact the downstream functional annotation results and biological interpretation."

Chitosan was extracted from the biomass of a fungus from the order Mucorales grown in yam bean broth. Three biosurfactants produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCP 0992 (PB), Bacillus cereus UCP 1615 (BB) and Candida bombicola URM 3718 (CB) were tested. Six mouthwashes were prepared, the active ingredients of which were the biosurfactant, chitosan and POE. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined for the test substances separately, in combinations and in the mouthwash formulas. The toxicity of the mouthwashes was tested using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-il)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) for the L929 (mouse fibroblast) and RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophage) cell lines. All substances tested had a MIC for cariogenic microorganisms. The combinations of the CB and PB biosurfactants with chitosan demonstrated an additive effect on the majority of microorganisms tested. The toxicity of the mouthwashes was significantly lower than that of the commercial mouthwash. The present findings demonstrate that mouthwashes containing natural products constitute a safe, effective, natural alternative to commercially available mouthwashes for the control of oral microorganisms.",Cellulose nanofibril/silver nanoparticle composite as an active food packaging system and its toxicity to human colon cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776442,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 03,"Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are nano-sized fillers widely used for enhancing the active functions of food packaging materials. However, nanomaterials may pose unexpected toxic effects on humans. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop a novel CNF/AgNP composite and investigate its properties and cytotoxicity. The CNF/AgNP composite was prepared via a reduction method using NaBH4. The AgNPs embedded in the composite showed an average size of 10.72‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ4.96‚ÄØnm and a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption peak at 397‚ÄØnm. AgNPs were distributed individually in the composite after synthesis, but aggregated during film preparation. The formation of AgNPs disrupted hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of cellulose, weakening the hydrogen-bond intensity, as shown by FTIR. Silver ions were efficiently released from the composite film in the first 24‚ÄØh. The CNF/AgNP composite exhibited inhibitory effects on Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The composite (50-1000‚ÄØŒºg/mL) did not significantly reduce the viability of Caco-2 and FHC colon cells, although the uptake of AgNPs through an endosomal mechanism was observed. These results suggest that the as-prepared CNF/AgNP composite could potentially be used as an antimicrobial material in active food packaging systems.",Fabrication of dual network self-healing alginate/guar gum hydrogels based on polydopamine-type microcapsules from mesoporous silica nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776441,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 03,"In this manuscript, dual network self-healing alginate/guar gum hydrogels with polydopamine-type microcapsules from mesoporous silica nanoparticles were facilely prepared through one-pot method. Glutaraldehyde (GA) was used as a crosslinking agent to crosslink guar gum and sodium alginate, respectively. Metal-ligand interactions as reversible non-covalent bonds make the dual network hydrogels have a high degree of self-healing ability, which FeCl3¬∑6H2O was coordinated with sodium alginate and polydopamine on the surface of microcapsules, respectively. The dual network structure significantly enhances the strength of the hydrogels (up to 7.3‚ÄØMPa). It has also proved that these hydrogels exhibit excellent self-healing performance at ambient temperatures, which self-healing efficiency can reach to 95.5%. The obtained self-healing hydrogels have a promising application prospect for the design and synthesis of functional self-healing materials.",Microparticles based on natural and synthetic polymers for cosmetic applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776440,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 03,"Most peeling products (exfoliators) available on the market, used in cosmetic and aesthetic dermatology applications, contain synthetic microbeads as abrasive agents. After being released into the natural environment, these non-biodegradable microparticles have an adverse impact on it, especially on aquatic ecosystems. Cosmetics consisting of solid plastic particles will be prohibited in the European Union from 2020. Therefore, there is a great need to develop effective abrasive substances for cosmetic industry. An alternative to synthetic beads may be beads based on biopolymers. Spherical microparticles of sodium alginate and mixture of sodium alginate and starch were obtained using encapsulator B√úCHI B-395 Pro. The obtained microparticles were added to the developed peeling formulation. Subsequently, the evaluation of skin condition after application of peelings with alginate, alginate-starch and synthetic microparticles was made, including topography, skin's barrier quality, hydration, colour, and the level of sebum. The peeling containing sodium alginate and sodium alginate with starch beads does not irritate the skin - redness of skin, itching and dryness did not appear. Microparticles of sodium alginate and sodium alginate with starch act on the skin as effectively as commercial synthetic particles, therefore they may be successfully used as abrasive ingredients in the developed recipe.",Anti-inflammatory effects of Morchella esculenta polysaccharide and its derivatives in fine particulate matter-treated NR8383 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776439,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 03,"Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure could cause many acute and chronic respiratory diseases. In this study the protective effects of polysaccharide from Morchella esculenta (FMP-1) and its derivatives against PM2.5-induced inflammation were evaluated. By flow cytometry and ELISA analysis, sulfated polysaccharide SFMP-1 showed the best protective effect in reducing PM2.5-induced cell death, cell apoptosis and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Œ±) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Œ≤), which was accompanied by a diminished level in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation caused by PM2.5 in rat alveolar macrophage NR8383 cells. Furthermore, the mechanism was studied by immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and western blotting. SFMP-1 could down-regulate the expression of inducible NO synthesis (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at both mRNA and protein levels in PM2.5-treated cells. The PM2.5-induced phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-Œ∫B) was also reduced through suppressing nuclear translation of the NF-Œ∫B and inhibiting the degradation and phosphorylation of IŒ∫BŒ±. These results indicated that SFMP-1 could protect NR8383 cells from PM2.5-induced inflammation by inhibiting NF-Œ∫B activation.",Synthesis and cytotoxicity of selenium nanoparticles stabilized by Œ±-D-glucan from Castanea mollissima Blume.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776437,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 03,"A 1,6-Œ±-D-glucan (CPA) with a high molecular weight of 2.0‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ103‚ÄØkDa was isolated from the fruits of Castanea mollissima Blume. CPA showed good water solubility, low side effects on normal cells, and moderate cytotoxicity on cancer cells. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) possess significant anticancer effects, but poor water solubility and dispersity. Therefore, an effective nanocomposite was designed in order to enhance the stability and anticancer effects of SeNPs decorated with CPA. Water soluble and dispersed selenium nanoparticles (CPA-SeNPs) were fabricated using CPA and Na2SeO3 by redox reaction with ascorbic acid. The average diameter of CPA-SeNPs was 53.7‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ4.0 with a Se content of approximately 171.4‚ÄØmg/g. CPA-SeNPs showed a significant anti-proliferative effect on HeLa cells in vitro. Since these NPs could induce apoptosis and S phase arrest. The apoptotic pathway triggered by CPA-SeNPs on HeLa cells was also characterized as induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial dysfunction and activation of caspase-3. This study suggested that CPA-SeNPs could be developed as a potential candidate in cancer treatment, especially against human cervical cancer.","EsTrx-2, the mitochondrial thioredoxin from Antarctic microcrustacean (Euphausia superba): Cloning and functional characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776436,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 03 29,"Thioredoxin system plays an important role in antioxidative stress, thioredoxin 2 (Trx2) being one of the most important components in the thioredoxin system. The full-length cDNA sequence of thioredoxin 2 from Euphausia superba (EsTrx2) is 1276‚ÄØbp and contain a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 94‚ÄØbp, a 3' UTR of 741‚ÄØbp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 441‚ÄØbp, encoding a putative protein of 146 amino acids. Multiple sequence alignments have indicated that EsTrx2 possesses a conserved (-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-) CGPC redox-active site. EsTrx2 shares 62.3% identity with the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) Trx2. The predicted three-dimensional structure of EsTrx2 consists of a thioredoxin fold. The high similarity and phylogenetic analysis have indicated that EsTrx2 is a member of the mitochondrial Trx2 sub-family. The recombinant EsTrx2 (rEsTrx2) was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The rEsTrx2 protein showed high redox activity and antioxidant capacity at temperature from 4 to 37‚ÄØ¬∞C.

Through a comprehensive phylogeography, we assessed how this model suits the genetic diversification documented for the tree frog Hyla meridionalis sensu lato. Analyses of mtDNA variation and thousands of nuclear loci confirmed the old split (low-Pliocene) between Tunisian and Algerian populations. These lineages meet but barely admix in the eastern Maghreb (Algerian-Tunisian border), a sign of putatively advanced reproductive isolation. In the western Maghreb, we report a Pleistocene divergence between Moroccan and Algerian populations. Tree frogs thus follow both predictions: a double east-west break that gave rise to two suture zones characteristic of North-African phylogeography. Moreover, some intraspecific mtDNA variation is not mirrored by the nuclear data, emphasizing that evolutionary units should always be designated by multilocus approaches. Last but not least, we describe the Tunisian lineage as a new species endemic to Africa.",Hyperglycemia Is Associated with Psoriatic Inflammation in Both Humans and Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776434,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 05 25,"Chronic low-grade inflammation can cause several metabolic syndromes. Patients with psoriasis, a chronic immunological skin inflammation, often develop diabetes. However, it is not clear to date how psoriasis leads to, or is correlated with, glucose intolerance. Here, we investigate whether psoriasis itself is correlated with hyperglycemia in humans and mice. In patients, the severity of psoriasis was correlated with high blood glucose levels, and treatment of psoriasis by phototherapy improved insulin secretion. Imiquimod-induced systemic and cutaneous inflammation in mice, with features of human psoriasis, also resulted in hyperglycemia. Although it should be determined if psoriasis-like cutaneous inflammation alone can induce hyperglycemia, imiquimod-treated mice showed impairment of insulin secretion without significant islet inflammation. Administration of anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody improved hyperglycemia in patients with psoriasis and imiquimod-treated mice with psoriasiform features. These results suggest that hyperglycemia is highly associated with psoriasis, mainly through IL-17.",Nicotinamide Metabolism Modulates the Proliferation/Differentiation Balance and Senescence of Human Primary Keratinocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776433,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 04 27,"Nicotinamide (NAM) is the main precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme essential for DNA repair, glycolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation. NAM has anti-aging activity on human skin, but the¬†underlying mechanisms of action are unclear. Using 3-dimensional organotypic skin models, we show that¬†NAM inhibits differentiation of the upper epidermal layers and maintains proliferation in the basal layer. In¬†2-dimensional culture, NAM reduces the expression of early and late epidermal differentiation markers and¬†increases the proliferative capacity of human primary keratinocytes. This effect is characterized by elevated clonogenicity and an increased proportion of human primary keratinocyte stem cell (holoclones) compared to¬†controls. By contrast, preventing the conversion of NAM to NAD+ using FK866 leads to premature human¬†primary keratinocyte differentiation and senescence, together with a dramatic drop in glycolysis and cellular adenosine triphosphate levels while oxidative phosphorylation is moderately affected. All these effects¬†are rescued by addition of NAM, known to compete with FK866, which suggests that conversion to NAD+ is part of the mechanistic response. These data provide insights into the control of differentiation, proliferation, and senescence by NAM and NAD+ in skin. They may lead to new therapeutic advances for skin conditions characterized by dysregulated epidermal homeostasis and premature skin aging, such as photoaging."

S1P mainly acts through five high-affinity G protein-coupled S1P receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed and mediate a complex network of signaling in a cell type dependent manner. S1P receptors have become an attractive pharmacological target to interfere with S1P-mediated cellular responses, which contribute to various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pioneering in this field was the synthesis of FTY720 (fingolimod, Gilenya¬Æ) from myriocin, one of the metabolites of the fungus Isaria sinclairii known from traditional Chinese medicine for its antibacterial and energy boosting effect. Fingolimod turned out as a very potent immunomodulatory agent that subsequently passed all clinical trials successfully and is now approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Pharmacologically, fingolimod was characterized as a non-selective agonist of all of the S1P receptors (S1PR), with the exception of S1P2, and in addition, as a selective S1P1 functional antagonist by induction of irreversible S1P1 internalization and degradation. Since proper lymphocyte trafficking depends on the expression of S1P1 on lymphocytes, the degradation of S1P1 leads to trapping and accumulation of lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissue, and consequently to a depletion of lymphocytes from the blood. Novel S1PR modulators are now being developed with a more selective receptor activation profile and improved pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this review, we will summarize the state-of-the-art approaches that target directly or indirectly S1P signaling and may be useful as novel strategies to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",A prophylactic role of a secretory PLA2 of Spodoptera exigua against entomopathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776421,Developmental and comparative immunology,2019 03 26,"Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) hydrolyses phospholipids at sn-2 position to release free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Secretory type of PLA2 (sPLA2) has been found in many different animals including insects. Insect sPLA2s have been divided into venomous and nonvenomous PLA2s. A non-venomous sPLA2 (Se-sPLA2) has been identified in beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua. Its high enzyme activity is detected in hemolymph of na√Øve larvae. However, the physiological role of high sPLA2 activity in hemolymph remains unclear. To determine the physiological role of sPLA2 in hemolymph, a recombinant Se-sPLA2 (rSe-sPLA2) was expressed in a bacterial expression system and purified to test antimicrobial activity against various microbes. Purified rSe-sPLA2 exhibited typical enzyme kinetic properties, including becoming saturated at high substrate concentrations, exhibiting optimal activity at pH 7-9, and being inactivated at high temperatures. However, a reducing agent (dithiothreitol) or calcium chelator treatment inhibited the catalytic activity. A specific inhibitor to sPLA2 also inhibited the enzyme activity of rSe-sPLA2 while other type PLA2 inhibitors did not. Furthermore, eight bacterial metabolites of Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus known to be inhibitory against insect PLA2 significantly inhibited the enzyme activity of rSe-sPLA2. High concentrations of rSe-sPLA2 (above 0.5‚ÄØmM) showed significant cytotoxicity to hemocytes of S. exigua. At concentrations without showing cytotoxicity, rSe-sPLA2 possessed significant antimicrobial activities against entomopathogenic bacteria (Serratia marscens and Entercoccus mondtii) and fungi (Beauveria bassiana and Metarhyzium rileyi). Hemolymph obtained from larvae treated with RNA interference specific to Se-sPLA2 significantly lost such antimicrobial activities. However, the addition of rSe-sPLA2 to the hemolymph significantly rescued such antimicrobial activities. These results indicate that Se-sPLA2 possesses antimicrobial activity, suggesting that it might act as a prophylactic agent against microbial pathogens in the hemolymph of S. exigua.",Teleost contributions to the understanding of mycobacterial diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776420,Developmental and comparative immunology,2019 05 09,"Few pathogens have shaped human medicine as the mycobacteria.

Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 06,"The nuclear receptor liver X receptor (LXR) impacts on cholesterol metabolism as well as hepatic lipogenesis via transcriptional regulation. It is proposed that inhibition of the protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (PRMT3) uncouples these two transcriptional pathways in vivo by acting as a specific lipogenic coactivator of LXR. Here we validated the hypothesis that treatment with the allosteric PRMT3 inhibitor SGC707 will diminish the hepatic steatosis extent, while leaving global cholesterol metabolism, important in cholesterol-driven pathologies like atherosclerosis, untouched. For this purpose, 12-week old hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice were fed a Western-type diet for six weeks to induce both hepatic steatosis and atherosclerosis. The mice received 3 intraperitoneal injections with SGC707 or solvent control per week. Mice chronically treated with SGC707 developed less severe hepatic steatosis as exemplified by the 51% reduced (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05) liver triglyceride levels. In contrast, the extent of in vivo macrophage foam cell formation and aortic root atherosclerosis was not affected by SGC707 treatment. Interestingly, SGC707-treated mice gained 94% less body weight (P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05), which was paralleled by changes in white adipose tissue morphology, i.e. reduction in adipocyte size and browning. In conclusion, we have shown that through PRMT3 inhibitor treatment specific functions of LXR involved in respectively the development of fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis can be uncoupled, resulting in an overall diminished hepatic steatosis extent without a negative impact on atherosclerosis susceptibility. As such, our studies highlight that PRMT3 inhibition may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to limit the development of fatty liver disease in humans.",The potential contribution of stromal cell-derived factor 2 (SDF2) in endoplasmic reticulum stress response in severe preeclampsia and labor-onset.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776414,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 02 24,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when the protein folding machinery in the cell is unable to cope with newly synthesized proteins, which results in an accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. In response, the cell activates a cellular signaling pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), aiming to restore cellular homeostasis. Activation and exacerbation of the UPR have been described in several human pathologies, including cancer and neurological disorders, and in some gestational diseases such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. This review explores the participation of stromal cell-derived factor 2 (SDF2) in UPR pathways, shows new information and discusses its exacerbation regarding protein expression in severe preeclampsia and labor, both of which are associated with ER stress.",Octa-arginine boosts the penetration of elastin-like polypeptide nanoparticles in 3D cancer models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776413,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2019 06 13,"Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) nanoparticles are a versatile platform for targeted drug delivery. As for any type of nanocarrier system, an important challenge remains the ability of deep (tumor) tissue penetration. In this study, ELP particles with controlled surface density of the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) octa-arginine (R8) were created by temperature-induced co-assembly. ELPs formed micellar nanoparticles with a diameter of around 60‚ÄØnm. Cellular uptake in human skin fibroblasts was directly dependent on the surface density of R8 as confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Remarkably, next to promoting cellular uptake, the presence of the CPP also enhanced penetration into spheroids generated from human glioblastoma U-87 cells. After 24‚ÄØh, uptake into cells was observed in multiple layers towards the spheroid core. ELP particles not carrying any CPP did not penetrate. Clearly, a high CPP density exerted a dual benefit on cellular uptake and tissue penetration. At low nanoparticle concentration, there was evidence of a binding site barrier as observed for the penetration of molecules binding with high affinity to cell surface receptors. In conclusion, R8-functionalized ELP nanoparticles form an excellent delivery vehicle that combines tunability of surface characteristics with small and well-defined size.",Stimulus-responsive nanoscale delivery systems triggered by the enzymes in the tumor microenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776412,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2019 06 13,"The tumor microenvironment is the cellular environment that is also described as the ""soil"" for supporting tumor growth, proliferation, invasion and metastasis, as well as protecting tumor cells from immunological recognition. Notably, tumor cells can grow much faster than other normal organs and invade surrounding tissues more easily, which results in abnormal expression of enzymes in the tumor microenvironment, including matrix metalloproteinases, cathepsins, phospholipases, oxidoreductases, etc. In opposite, due to the high selectivity and catalytic activity, these enzymes can promote nanoparticles to recognize tumor tissues more accurately, and the more accumulation of drugs at primal tumor sites will enhance therapeutic efficacy with lower systemic toxicity. Therefore, one promising antitumor strategy is to design stimulus-responsive nanoscale delivery systems triggered by the enzymes with the support of various nanocarriers, such as liposomes, micelles and inorganic nanoparticles, etc. In this review, numerous facts were cited to summarize and discuss the typical types of enzyme-stimulus responsive nanoscale delivery systems. More importantly, we also focused on their recent advancements in antitumor therapy, and offered the direction for further studies.",House dust mite exposure attenuates influenza A infection in a mouse model of pulmonary allergic inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776411,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 05 28,"Environmental allergens elicit complex immune responses in the lungs that can promote the development of asthma or exacerbate preexisting asthma in susceptible individuals. House dust mites are one of the most common indoor allergens and are a significant driver of allergic disease. Respiratory infections are known factors in acute exacerbations of asthma but the impact of allergen on the pathogen is not well understood. We investigated the pathogenesis of influenza A infection following exposure to house dust mites. Mice exposed to house dust mites lose less weight following infection and had more transcription of interferon-lambda than controls. These data correlated with less transcription of the influenza polymerase acidic gene suggesting diminished viral replication in house dust mite exposed mice. Altogether, these data suggest that exposure to environmental allergens can influence the pathogenesis of influenza infection."

MicroRNAs are short non-coding single-stranded RNAs that affect a vast range of biological processes. Previously, we focused on the regulatory role of miR-181a during cancer development and progression. In this manuscript, 171‚ÄØnm switchable lipid nanoparticles (LNP) co-delivered melphalan and miR-181a with encapsulation efficiencies of 93%. Encapsulation of melphalan in LNP significantly improved its therapeutic efficiency. Gene analysis shows that miR-181a decreases the expression of anti-proliferative gene MAPK1 and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, but significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic gene BAX. Our results suggest that the two agents have a complementary effect in reducing the viability of cultured Rb cells (primary and cell line) and decreasing Rb cell counts in an in-vivo xenograft Rb model in rats. Our results suggest that the proposed co-delivery technique significantly increases the therapeutic impact, allows for lower administration of melphalan, and consequently, could minimize the cytotoxic side-effects of this drug.",Measuring eating motives in older adults with and without functional impairments with The Eating Motivation Survey (TEMS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776395,Appetite,2019 03 31,"Gaining a better understanding which motives play a role in daily eating is crucial in order to develop personalized interventions promoting adequate diet. The Eating Motivation Survey (TEMS) is a comprehensive tool to assess manifold reasons for eating but has not been specifically applied in an older sample including very old persons and persons differing in functional status. Therefore, the first step of the study was to investigate whether the basic motives of TEMS are consistent in an older sample and comparable across older adults with and without functional impairments. Second, the study aimed at describing which motives underlie eating behavior in older age most often as well as to analyze the relationship between eating motives and functional status. 376 community-dwelling older persons aged 70 years and older filled in the brief survey version (15 motives √† 3 items) of TEMS. The sample comprises 149 unimpaired and 227 impaired participants in terms of physical function. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded good model fit with RMSEA 0.036 and SRMR 0.048. Furthermore, multi-group analysis revealed a generally invariant factor structure across participants with and without functional impairments. Liking was rated to underlie eating behavior most often, followed by Health and Natural Concerns. Considering gender, age and BMI, significant associations between functional status and the motive Sociability emerged. Since the results suggest that the fifteen basic eating motives are generalizable in older age and across different functional states, TEMS might be a valuable tool in nutrition-related health promotion to developing individualized approaches considering health aspects as well as hedonistic factors.",High CD8 T cell percentage and HCV replication control are common features in HIV-1 controllers and HTLV-2-co-infected patients with a history of injection drug use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776394,Virus research,2019 06 03,"HTLV-2/HIV-1-coinfected patients and HIV-infected patients with natural HIV-1 control show an immune capacity that allows some control of viral infections. These two groups of patients have showed an immune capacity that allows them to have some control over viral infections, very strong control of HIV-1 replication in the case of HIV-1 controllers. The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to compare viral and immunologic parameters between three cohorts of Caucasian adult HIV-1-infected patients, including HIV-1 controllers (29 patients), HTLV-2/HIV-1 chronic progressors (56 patients), and HIV-1 chronic progressors (101 patients), followed in two different tertiary University Hospitals in Spain. Demographic parameters, nadir CD4 T cell count, CD4 and CD8 T cell counts and percentage, anti-HCV antibodies, HCV RNA load, HCV genotype, HIV-1 RNA loads, and anti-HTLV-2 antibodies were analyzed. HIV-1 controllers and HTLV-2/HIV-1 chronic progressors were younger and with shorter time since HIV-1 diagnosis compared to HIV-1 chronic progressors. HIV-1 controllers and HTLV-2/HIV-1 chronic progressors had significantly higher CD8 T cell percentage (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002 and p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.016, respectively) and lower levels of HCV RNA loads (0.015 and 0.007, respectively) compared to that of HIV-1 chronic progressors. Multivariate analyses showed that gender and HTLV-2 infection were independently associated to HCV RNA load, while only HTLV-2 infection was independently associated to CD8 T cell percentage. The implication of HTLV-2 infection in the control of HIV-1 and HCV infections is worth being further analyze.",An examination of the moderating effects of neurophysiology on treatment outcomes from cognitive training in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776393,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2019 02 25,"Impairments in neurocognition and community functioning are core features of schizophrenia and cognitive training techniques have been developed with the aim of improving these impairments.

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) exhibits a distinct pattern of prefrontal activation in non-veridical cognition, but little is known about the role of underlying neurobiological endophenotypes. A functional polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, causing a valine (Val) to methionine (Met) amino acid substitution at codon 66, has been shown to be associated with structural and functional changes in DLPFC and affect veridical decision making. We hypothesized that the BDNF genotype may be related to non-veridical cognition. We explored whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism affected preferences in a cognitive task devoid of intrinsically correct or false choice, using the Cognitive Bias Task (CBT). We also studied if manipulating the right DLPFC with rTMS stimulation changes non-veridical preferences. Sixteen healthy adults, including 9 Val/Val and 7 Val/Met subjects, participated in the study. Participants with Val/Met genotype expressed a more context-independent, internally driven choice selection preference. Val/Val subjects' selection was more dependent on the context, driven by the properties of external stimuli. rTMS stimulation enhanced a preexisting bias in choice preferences. In Val/Val subjects, TMS stimulation shifted the non-veridical preference bias towards greater dependence on external context, while in Val/Met subjects the CBT score became more context-independent. Our study showed that BDNF genotype is associated with a bias in non-veridical preferences and that Val/Val and Val/Met subjects respond differently to right DLPFC rTMS stimulation, further enhancing their preexisting selection biases.",Combined use of vitamin E and nimodipine ameliorates dibutyl phthalate-induced memory deficit and apoptosis in mice by inhibiting the ERK 1/2 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776390,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 03 08,"Learning disabilities (LDs) in children are a serious global problem. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), a plasticizer widely used in daily life, has been linked to triggering childhood LDs, however the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. Studies have shown that the ERK 1/2 pathway is closely related to apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. On the basis of these links between LDs, DBP and the ERK 1/2 pathway, we explore whether DBP induces hippocampal neuron apoptosis and increases behavioral disorders in mice via the ERK 1/2 pathway. We looked at oxidative stress, examined the calcium signal, detected the ERK 1/2 pathway and evaluated apoptosis as well as using histological observations, and found that DBP significantly increased oxidative damage and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons via the ERK 1/2 pathway in mice. We also found that pretreatment with the dihydropyridine's (DHP's) Ca2+ antagonist, nimodipine (NMDP), combined with the antioxidant Vitamin E (VE), attenuated ERK 1/2 phosphorylation and DBP-mediated disorders, suggesting that a combined use of VE and NMDP can ameliorate DBP-induced memory deficit and apoptosis via inhibiting the ERK 1/2 pathway. These results indicate that DBP predisposes oxidative damage and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons by activation of the ERK 1/2 pathway, and may be proposed as a possible mechanism underlying LDs in children. Moreover, VE and NMDP may play a certain protective role in the targeted treatment of childhood LDs.",PFKFB3 promotes endotoxemia-induced myocardial dysfunction through inflammatory signaling and apoptotic induction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776389,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 03 08,"Cardiac dysfunction is a vital complication during endotoxemia (ETM). Accumulating evidence suggests that enhanced glycolytic metabolism promotes inflammatory and myocardial diseases. In this study, we performed deep mRNA sequencing analysis on the hearts of control and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged mice (40‚ÄØmg/kg, i.p.) and identified that the glycolytic enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) might play an indispensable role in ETM-induced cardiac damage. Quantitative real-time PCR validated the transcriptional upregulation of PFKFB3 in the myocardium of LPS-challenged mice and immunoblotting and immunostaining assays confirmed that LPS stimulation markedly increased the expression of PFKFB3 at the protein level both in vivo and in vitro. The potent antagonist 3-(3pyridinyl)-1-(4-pyridinyl)-2-propen-1-one (3PO) was used to block PFKFB3 activity in vivo (50‚ÄØmg/kg, i.p.) and in vitro (10‚ÄØŒºM). Echocardiographic analysis and TUNEL staining showed that 3PO significantly alleviated LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction and apoptotic injury in vivo. 3PO also suppressed the LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, interleukin (IL)-1Œ≤, IL-6 and lactate in the serum, in addition to lactate in the myocardium. PFKFB3 inhibition also diminished the nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of transcription factor nuclear factor-Œ∫B (NF-Œ∫B) in both adult cardiomyocytes and HL-1 cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting analysis showed that 3PO inhibited LPS-induced apoptotic induction in cardiomyocytes. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PFKFB3 participates in LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction via mediating inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathway.",Maximization of fertility transfers from rangeland to cropland: The¬†contribution of control theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776388,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 03 27,"In traditional mixed farming systems, soil fertility in cropland relies on the transfer of fertility from rangeland through the transfer of manure produced by livestock that grazes in rangeland. In this work, we introduce a simple meta-ecosystem model in which the mixed farming system is represented by a cropland sub-system connected to a rangeland sub-system by nutrient fluxes. The livestock plays the role of nutrient-pump from the rangeland sub-system to the cropland sub-system. We use this model to study how spatial organization and practices of livestock management such as the control of grazing pressure and night corralling can help optimize both nutrient transfers and crop production. We argue that addressing the optimization of crop production requires different methods, depending on whether the agricultural practice in focus is constant or variable over time. We first used classical optimization methods at equilibrium to address optimization when the grazing pressure was assumed to be constant over time. Second, we address optimization for a more realistic configuration of our model, where grazing pressure was assumed to vary over the course of a year. In this case, we used methods developed in the field of the control theory. Classical methods showed the existence of an optimal level of constant grazing pressure that maximizes the transfers from rangeland to cropland, leading to the maximization of crop production. Control methods showed that by varying the grazing pressure adequately an additional gain of production is possible, with higher crop production and lower nutrient transfer from rangeland to cropland. This additional gain arises from the fact that the requirement of nutrient by crops is variable along the year. Consequently, a constant adjustment of the grazing pressure allows a better match between nutrient transfer and nutrient requirement over time, leading to a substantial gain of crop biomass. Our results provide new insights for a ""smarter"" management of fertility transfers leading to higher crop production with less rangeland surface.",Tiempo de Vacunarte (time to get vaccinated): Outcomes of an intervention to improve HPV vaccination rates in a predominantly Hispanic community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776387,Preventive medicine,2019 03 04,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of a culturally tailored evidence-based HPV vaccine educational intervention on psychosocial factors and vaccine completion in a largely low-income Hispanic population. Our study is a prospective community based intervention utilizing a prepost design. We recruited individual's dwelling in a border community aged 18-26‚ÄØyears or parents/guardians of children aged 9-17‚ÄØyears who had not completed the HPV vaccine series. We recruited 2380 participants between June 2015 and February 2018. We included 1796 participants in the final analysis. Mean age of the sample was 22.8‚ÄØyears (SD2.60). Majority of participants 63.99 were female and self-identified as Hispanic (97.4%). A total of 3192 vaccines were administered with an overall vaccine completion rate of 39.8%; 31.6% among adult participants compared to 48.7% among children. The Intervention significantly improved HPV knowledge by 61.66%, HPV awareness by 19.45%, Intention to vaccinate by 13.85%. For both adults and children being born in Mexico significantly improved the odds of vaccine completion (AOR: 2.154 95% CI: 1.439-3.224), while for adults only pre-intervention perceived benefits remained significant (AOR 1.101, CI: 1.002-1.210) and in children the main factor was parental perceived susceptibility of their child (AOR: 1.257 CI: 1.001-1.578). A Community based multicomponent HPV vaccine intervention significantly improved HPV immunization rates in a largely Hispanic population. Factors that affect completion of the HPV series are different among adults and children."

Both substances are methylated derivatives of aminorex, an amphetamine-like anorectic used in the 1960ies and withdrawn from the marked due to severe cardiovascular toxicity. The aim of the present study was to characterize the in vitro pharmacological profiles of 4-MAR, 4,4'-DMAR, and 3,4-dimethylaminorex (3,4-DMAR, direx). We assessed norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) transporter inhibition potencies and monoamine release in transporter-transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. We also assessed monoamine receptor and transporter binding affinities. 4,4'-DMAR potently inhibited all monoamine transporters (IC50<1 ŒºM) with greater potency than 3,4-methlyenedioxymethamphetaime (MDMA) and displayed a higher serotonergic over dopaminergic preference, relatively similar to MDMA (DA transporter / 5-HT transporter inhibition ratio of 0.4 and 0.08 for 4,4'-DMAR and MDMA, respectively). In contrast, 4-MAR preferentially inhibited the NE and DA transporter, exhibiting a pharmacological profile more similar to amphetamine. Both 4-MAR and 4,4'-DMAR were also substrate releasers at the DAT. 3,4-DMAR only weakly inhibited the NE transporter and showed no relevant activity at the DA and 5-HT transporter. Binding affinities of all three aminorex derivatives at various monoamine receptors were negligible (Ki values >2 ŒºM). The in vitro pharmacological profiles indicate that 4,4'-DMAR has comparable psychoactive properties and serotonergic toxicity to MDMA and may be more potent. 4-MAR is a psychostimulant similar to amphetamine or methamphetamine. 3,4-DMAR likely has only weak psychostimulant properties.",Cardiac-specific deletion of GCN5L1 restricts recovery from ischemia-reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776374,Journal of molecular and cellular cardiology,2019 04 30,"GCN5L1 regulates mitochondrial protein acetylation, cellular bioenergetics, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and organelle positioning in a number of diverse cell types. However, the functional role of GCN5L1 in the heart is currently unknown. As many of the factors regulated by GCN5L1 play a major role in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, we sought to determine if GCN5L1 is an important nexus in the response to cardiac ischemic stress. Deletion of GCN5L1 in cardiomyocytes resulted in impaired myocardial post-ischemic function and increased infarct development in isolated work-performing hearts. GCN5L1 knockout hearts displayed hallmarks of ROS damage, and scavenging of ROS restored cardiac function and reduced infarct volume in vivo. GCN5L1 knockdown in cardiac-derived AC16 cells was associated with reduced activation of the pro-survival MAP kinase ERK1/2, which was also reversed by ROS scavenging, leading to restored cell viability. We therefore conclude that GCN5L1 activity provides an important protection against I/R induced, ROS-mediated damage in the ischemic heart.",Signaling characteristics and functional regulation of delta opioid-kappa opioid receptor (DOP-KOP) heteromers in peripheral sensory neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776373,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"Receptor heteromers often display distinct pharmacological and functional properties compared to the individual receptor constituents. In this study, we compared the properties of the DOP-KOP heteromer agonist, 6'-guanidinonaltrindole (6'-GNTI), with agonists for DOP ([D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin [DPDPE]) and KOP (U50488) in peripheral sensory neurons in culture and in vivo. In primary cultures, all three agonists inhibited PGE2-stimulated cAMP accumulation as well as activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) with similar efficacy. ERK activation by U50488 was Gi-protein mediated but that by DPDPE or 6'-GNTI was Gi-protein independent (i.e., pertussis toxin insensitive). Brief pretreatment with DPDPE or U50488 resulted in loss of cAMP signaling, however, no desensitization occurred with 6'-GNTI pretreatment. In vivo, following intraplantar injection, all three agonists reduced thermal nociception. The dose-response curves for DPDPE and 6'-GNTI were monotonic whereas the curve for U50488 was an inverted U-shape. Inhibition of ERK blocked the downward phase and shifted the curve for U50488 to the right. Following intraplantar injection of carrageenan, antinociceptive responses to either DPDPE or U50488 were transient but could be prolonged with inhibitors of 12/15-lipoxgenases (LOX). By contrast, responsiveness to 6'-GNTI remained for a prolonged time in the absence of LOX inhibitors. Further, pretreatment with the 12/15-LOX metabolites, 12- and 15- hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, abolished responses to U50488 and DPDPE but had no effect on 6'-GNTI-mediated responses either in cultures or in vivo. Overall, these results suggest that DOP-KOP heteromers exhibit unique signaling and functional regulation in peripheral sensory neurons and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pain.",Neither Diplectanum nor specific: a dramatic twist to the taxonomic framework of Diplectanum (Monogenea: Diplectanidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776372,International journal for parasitology,2019 04 09,"The taxonomy of the genus Diplectanum has been exclusively based on morphological features, with 28 nominal species parasitic on perciform fishes recognised. We used molecular data, to our knowledge for the first time, to evaluate the taxonomic framework of Diplectanum, infer the relationships amongst species attributed to this genus, re-assess the degree of host specificity and explore the population genetic structure of Diplectanum spp. parasitising Mediterranean sciaenids, which are potential target fish species for aquaculture diversification in the region. A minimum of 10 specimens of Diplectanum spp. were sequenced per host species (Argyrosomus regius, Sciaena umbra, Umbrina canariensis and Umbrina cirrosa) and locality (Burriana, Sant Carles de la R√†pita and Santa Pola (Spain)) together with five individuals of the type species Diplectanum aequans. Sequences of partial 28S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region of Diplectanum spp. were analysed together with those from other Diplectanidae spp. in GenBank using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods. Population genetic analyses were performed using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences for a diplectanid species with a wide distribution across host species and localities. Results showed that Diplectanum was not monophyletic, nor were the specimens infecting sciaenids. Instead they formed two separate clades, 26.1-28.6% divergent for the internal transcribed spacer and 13.2-16.9% for the 28S region from D. aequans. Altogether, our results suggest that these specimens represent two distinct new genera from Diplectanum and five putative species with low host specificity. It is likely that morphological variability has led to the description of more species than were detected by molecular methods. In contrast to other monogeneans, Diplectaninae gen. spp. are chiefly generalists. Nonetheless, intraspecific genetic divergence in the internal transcribed spacer region of Diplectaninae gen. spp., and population genetic analyses of one presumed generalist species, Diplectaninae gen. sp. 1.2, showed significant variation between subpopulations living on different hosts. The intraspecific genetic structure by host also suggests different cross-infection potential amongst sciaenid species.",Ameliorating gut microenvironment through staphylococcal nuclease-mediated intestinal NETs degradation for prevention of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776371,Life sciences,2019 04 03,"Recent studies have revealed that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) provide negative feedback in the progression to chronic inflammation and contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). In addition, accumulating evidences suggest that gut immunity play a key role in T1D pathogenesis.

However, the neural mechanisms involved in this phenomena remain largely unexplored. In an event-related potentials (ERPs) study, we examined the consequences of an induced mood over the electrophysiological signals obtained while processing logical and illogical categorical conclusions. Prior to performing a syllogism reading task, we aimed to induce, by using short film clips, high arousal negative and positive moods and neutral affective states to participants in three separate recording sessions. Our mood induction procedure was only successful at inducing a highly arousing negative state. Behaviorally, participants committed more errors overall while judging the invalidity versus the validity of illogical and logical conclusions, respectively, but no influences from mood state emerged at this logical validity task. Electrophysiologically and overall a negative going N400 deflection was larger for illogical relative to logical conclusions in a parietal region between 300 and 420‚ÄØms. However, further analysis revealed that the logical conclusions were only more expected (smaller N400 amplitudes) in the negative relative to the neutral and the positive sessions, providing support to theoretical views that posit that a more analytic reasoning style might be implemented under a negative mood state. These results provide further electrophysiological evidence of the influence of mood on other cognitive processes, particularly on the anticipation and processing of logical conclusions during online reasoning tasks.",Molecular aspects of depression: A review from neurobiology to treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776369,European journal of pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known as unipolar depression, is one of the leading causes of disability and disease worldwide. The signs and symptoms are low self‚Äëesteem, anhedonia, feeling of worthlessness, sense of rejection and guilt, suicidal thoughts, among others. This review focuses on studies with molecular-based approaches involving MDD to obtain an integrated, more detailed and comprehensive view of the brain changes produced by this disorder and its treatment and how the Central Nervous System (CNS) produces neuroplasticity to orchestrate adaptive defensive behaviors. This article integrates affective neuroscience, psychopharmacology, neuroanatomy and molecular biology data. In addition, there are two problems with current MDD treatments, namely: 1) Low rates of responsiveness to antidepressants and too slow onset of therapeutic effect; 2) Increased stress vulnerability and autonomy, which reduces the responses of currently available treatments. In the present review, we encourage the prospection of new bioactive agents for the development of treatments with post-transduction mechanisms, neurogenesis and pharmacogenetics inducers that bring greater benefits, with reduced risks and maximized access to patients, stimulating the field of research on mood disorders in order to use the potential of preclinical studies. For this purpose, improved animal models that incorporate the molecular and anatomical tools currently available can be applied. Besides, we encourage the study of drugs that do not present ""classical application"" as antidepressants, (e.g., the dissociative anesthetic ketamine and dextromethorphan) and drugs that have dual action mechanisms since they represent potential targets for novel drug development more useful for the treatment of MDD.",Exogenous obestatin decreases beta-cell apoptosis and alfa-cell proliferation in high fat diet and streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetic rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776368,European journal of pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by progressive decrease of islet cell function. Delaying the process of islet failure remains a challenging goal in diabetes care. Previous studies have confirmed the role of obestatin, a gut peptide that belongs to ghrelin family, in the mediation of glucose metabolism. This study aimed to observe the long term effects of exogenous obestatin on glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes rat model. Type 2 diabetic rat model was set up by high-fat diet (60%) followed by a low dose of streptozotocin intra-peritoneal injection. Exogenous obestatin was administered at a dose of 20‚ÄØnmol/kg for 12 weeks by intraperitoneal injection. Compared to placebo group (saline intraperitoneal injection), obestatin treatment decreased the glucagon levels and increased the c-peptide levels. Furthermore, obestatin treatment led to a significant restoration of islet morphology, increasing insulin and reducing glucagon expressions. Apoptosis assay showed a reduction in the number of TUNEL positive-cells. The up-regulation of Akt and GSK3Œ≤ in pancreas was confirmed by Real-Time PCR. These results demonstrated that obestatin might have a potential therapeutic relevance in improving islet cell function, including increasing insulin secretion through inhibiting beta cell apoptosis and decreasing glucagon secretion by inhibiting alfa cell proliferation in type 2 diabetes.

Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in I/R-caused spinal cord injury (SCI), the mechanism that underlies miR-30c interacted with SCI remains elusive. In this study, I/R surgery or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) were performed to establish SCI model in vivo or in vitro, respectively. Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) score, spinal cord infarct, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were used to investigate SCI. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to examine the abundances of miR-30c and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) either in spinal cord or PC12 cells. Luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) were performed to probe the interaction between miR-30c and SIRT1. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were used to analyze SIRT1 protein expression. Our results showed that I/R increased miR-30c expression and induced SCI, revealed by decreasing BBB score, enhancing apoptosis, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-Œ± (TNF-Œ±) expression. However, miR-30c knockdown attenuated I/R-induced SCI in vivo. Moreover, depletion of miR-30c protected PC12 cells against OGD-caused apoptosis and inflammatory response. In addition, SIRT1 was limited by miR-30c, silencing of which reversed anti-miR-30c-mediated inhibitory effect on apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in PC12 cells after OGD treatment. Collectively, abrogation of miR-30c inhibited spinal cord ischemia reperfusion injury through targeting SIRT1, providing a promising biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic for SCI."

Extraneous Œ±-Syn induces apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons by causing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the mechanism by which Œ±-Syn disrupts the mitochondrial function is still unclear. In the present study, we used a gene microarray and western blotting analysis to show that the expression of mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (MT-CO2, COXII) increased significantly in SH-SY5Y cells stimulated by Œ±-Syn for 24‚ÄØh. Furthermore, the decline in ATP levels, the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and the enhanced reactive oxygen species in cells treated by Œ±-Syn was reversed by inhibiting MT-CO2 gene expression. Subsequently, we observed that upregulation of MT-CO2 contributed to the release of cytochrome c and altered the levels of certain mitochondria-localized proteins, such as BCL2 family proteins. Therefore, we hypothesized that after being transferred into dopaminergic neurons, Œ±-Syn injures mitochondria via activating MT-CO2.

Paphiopedilum insigne (an endangered orchid), is one of the most excessively exploited species of orchids and is mentioned in the IUCN Red List and Appendix I of CITES. The prospect for conservation and commercialization of this species would be strengthened with the development of improved cryopreservation techniques. This study reports on successful cryopreservation of protocorms of P.insigne after cryopreservation using vitrification (Vit) and encapsulation-vitrification (E-Vit) techniques. The study compared the addition of four antioxidants to the pretreatment and recovery stages, three growth media, and agitated vs. semisolid culture medium for initial recovery. Recovery after cryopreservation for the control was 27% for Vit and 37% for E-Vit. In both cases agitated culture produced improved recovery by about 10%, but with significantly better recovery with E-Vit.

Although most patients develop mild pancreatitis, 20% develop severe and/or necrotizing pancreatitis, requiring advanced medical and interventional care. Morbidity resulting from local and systemic complications as well as invasive interventions result in mortality rates historically as high as 30%. There has been substantial evolution of strategies for interventions in recent years, from open surgery to minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic step-up approaches. In contrast to the advances in invasive procedures for complications, early management still lacks curative options and consists of adequate fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and monitoring. Many challenges remain, including comprehensive management of the entire spectrum of the disease, which requires close involvement of multiple disciplines at specialized centers.",Early Intra-Acinar Events in Pathogenesis of Pancreatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776339,Gastroenterology,2019 05 28,"Premature activation of digestive enzymes in the pancreas has been linked to development of pancreatitis for more than a century. Recent development of novel models to study the role of pathologic enzyme activation has led to advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of pancreatic injury. Colocalization of zymogen and lysosomal fraction occurs early after pancreatitis-causing stimulus. Cathepsin B activates trypsinogen in these colocalized organelles. Active trypsin increases permeability of these organelles resulting in leakage of cathepsin B into the cytosol leading to acinar cell death. Although trypsin-mediated cell death leads to pancreatic injury in early stages of pancreatitis, multiple parallel mechanisms, including activation of inflammatory cascades, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the acinar cells are now recognized to be important in driving the profound systemic inflammatory response and extensive pancreatic injury seen in acute pancreatitis. Chymotrypsin, another acinar protease, has recently been shown be play critical role in clearance of pathologically activated trypsin protecting against pancreatic injury. Mutations in trypsin and other genes thought to be associated with pathologic enzyme activation (such as serine protease inhibitor 1) have been found in familial forms of pancreatitis. Sustained intra-acinar activation of nuclear factor Œ∫B pathway seems to be key pathogenic mechanism in chronic pancreatitis. Better understanding of these mechanisms will hopefully allow us to improve treatment strategies in acute and chronic pancreatitis.","Self-propagating, non-synaptic epileptiform activity recruits neurons by endogenous electric fields.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776338,Experimental neurology,2019 05 31,"It is well documented that synapses play a significant role in the transmission of information between neurons. However, in the absence of synaptic transmission, neural activity has been observed to continue to propagate. Previous studies have shown that propagation of epileptiform activity takes place in the absence of synaptic transmission and gap junctions and is outside the range of ionic diffusion and axonal conduction. Computer simulations indicate that electric field coupling could be responsible for the propagation of neural activity under pathological conditions such as epilepsy. Electric fields can modulate neuronal membrane voltage, but there is no experimental evidence suggesting that electric field coupling can mediate self-regenerating propagation of neural activity. Here we examine the role of electric field coupling by eliminating all forms of neural communications except electric field coupling with a cut through the neural tissue. We show that 4-AP induced activity generates an electric field capable of recruiting neurons on the distal side of the cut. Experiments also show that applied electric fields with amplitudes similar to endogenous values can induce propagating waves. Finally, we show that canceling the electrical field at a given point can block spontaneous propagation. The results from these in vitro electrophysiology experiments suggest that electric field coupling is a critical mechanism for non-synaptic neural propagation and therefore could contribute to the propagation of epileptic activity in the brain.",Endogenous multidien rhythm of epilepsy in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776337,Experimental neurology,2019 03 12,"Recent trials of chronic EEG in humans showed that epilepsy is a cyclical disorder of the brain with rhythms at multiple time-scales: circadian, multi-day (multidien) or even seasonal.

Importantly, seizures were not uniformly distributed over time, but rather clustered at preferential phases of these underlying rhythms, delineating critical circadian times and multidien phase of heightened seizure risk. Multidien rhythms were not synchronous across animals or with human intervention suggesting an endogenous generator.

Because the tendon healing process results in the formation of a fibrotic scar, injured tendons never regain the mechanical strength of the uninjured tendon, leading to frequent reinjury. Many tendons are also prone to the development of peritendinous adhesions and excess scar formation, which further reduce tendon function and lead to chronic complications. Despite this, there are currently no treatments that adequately improve the tendon healing process due in part to a lack of information regarding the contributions of various cell types to tendon healing and how their activity may be modulated for therapeutic value. In this review, we summarize recent efforts to identify and characterize the distinct cell populations involved at each stage of tendon healing. In addition, we examine the mechanisms through which different cell populations contribute to the fibrotic response to tendon injury, and how these responses can be affected by systemic factors and comorbidities. We then discuss gaps in our current understanding of tendon fibrosis and highlight how new technologies and research areas are shedding light on this clinically important and intractable challenge. A better understanding of the complex cellular environment during tendon healing is crucial to the development of new therapies to prevent fibrosis and promote tissue regeneration.",Rsp5-dependent endocytosis and degradation of the arsenite transporter Acr3 requires its N-terminal acidic tail as an endocytic sorting signal and arrestin-related ubiquitin-ligase adaptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776335,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Biomembranes,2019 03 27,"The yeast plasma membrane transporter Acr3 mediates efflux of toxic arsenite and antimonite. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of Acr3 turnover. We found that after arrival and residence at the plasma membrane, Acr3 is subjected to internalization followed by proteolysis in the vacuole. Endocytic degradation of Acr3 is promoted by the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and requires polyubiquitination of Acr3 at multiple lysine residues via lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chains. The turnover of Acr3 also depends on two arrestin-related proteins, Art3/Aly2 and Art4/Rod1, that enable recruitment of Rsp5 to its targets. Finally, we found that a short acidic patch located in the N-terminal tail of Acr3 is needed for its ubiquitination and internalization. We propose that this motif serves as an endocytic signal that facilitates binding of the arrestin-Rsp5 complexes to the Acr3 cargo."

For the study, 72 samples of swine sera characterized by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), were evaluated by indirect ELISA. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values obtained from the analysis were 96.8%, 100%, and 99%, respectively, thereby suggesting that rErpY-like ELISA being a sensitive and specific method for antibodies detection in swine populations could be used as an alternative for diagnosis of swine leptospirosis.",Ceria nanoparticles enhance endochondral ossification-based critical-sized bone defect regeneration by promoting the hypertrophic differentiation of BMSCs via DHX15 activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776318,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2019 04 29,"Central ischemic necrosis is one of the biggest obstacles in the clinical application of traditional tissue-engineered bone (TEB) in critical-sized bone defect regeneration.

In light of recent studies suggesting that ceria nanoparticles (CNPs) improve the blood vessel distribution within TEB, we modified TEB scaffold surfaces with CNPs and investigated the effect and mechanism of CNPs on endochondral ossification-based bone regeneration. The CNPs used in this study were synthesized by the microemulsion method and modified with alendronate-anchored polyethylene glycol 600. We showed that CNPs accelerated new bone formation and enhanced endochondral ossification-based bone regeneration in both a subcutaneous ectopic osteogenesis model and a mouse model of critical-sized bone defects. Mechanistically, CNPs significantly promoted endochondral ossification-based bone regeneration by ensuring sufficient hypertrophic differentiation via the activation of the RNA helicase, DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box helicase 15, and its downstream target, p38 MAPK.

ATP is essential for the release of nonclassically secreted cytokines such as IL-1Œ≤ but, paradoxically, has been reported to inhibit the release of classically secreted cytokines such as TNF. Here, we reveal that ATP does switch off soluble TNF (17 kDa) release from LPS-treated macrophages, but rather than inhibiting the entire TNF secretion, ATP packages membrane TNF (26 kDa) within microvesicles (MVs). Secretion of membrane TNF within MVs bypasses the conventional endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi transport-dependent pathway and is mediated by acid sphingomyelinase. These membrane TNF-carrying MVs are biologically more potent than soluble TNF in vivo, producing significant lung inflammation in mice. Thus, ATP critically alters TNF trafficking and secretion from macrophages, inducing novel unconventional membrane TNF signaling via MVs without direct cell-to-cell contact.

In the unconfined state, the core-shell drops appear with paraffin oil at the core and silicone oil at the shell.

Because irreversibility of the system dynamics results from thermal activation and dissipation caused by the environment, in dynamical studies, it is necessary to include heat bath degrees of freedom in the total system. When the system dynamics involves high-energy electronic transitions, the environment is regarded to be in a low-temperature regime and we must treat it quantum mechanically. In this Article, we present rigorous and versatile approaches for investigating the dynamics of open systems with coupled electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom within a fully quantum mechanical framework. These approaches are based on a quantum Fokker-Planck equation and a quantum Smoluchowski equation employing a heat bath with an Ohmic spectral density, with non-Markovian low-temperature correction terms, and extensions of these equations to the case of multistate systems. The accuracy of these equations was numerically examined for a single-state Brownian system, while their applicability was examined for multistate double-well systems by comparing their results with those of the fewest-switch surface hopping and Ehrenfest methods with a classical Markovian Langevin force. Comparison of the transient absorption spectra obtained using these methods clearly reveals the importance of the quantum low-temperature correction terms. These equations allow us to treat nonadiabatic dynamics in an efficient way, while maintaining numerical accuracy.

The genus includes 100 valid species that are popularly known in Brazil as jacund√°s or joaninhas and are widely distributed in rivers east of the Andes. Cytogenetic analyses were carried out on seven species in this genus. All species showed a diploid number of 48 with interspecific differences in karyotype formulas and AgNORs located in interstitial position on the short arm of the largest metacentric pair, except for the two populations from C. britskii. Population A showed terminal markings on the long arm of the fifth pair of the complement, and population B showed up to two marked chromosome pairs. FISH with an 18S rDNA probe was coincident with AgNORs and CMA3, except for pair 6 from population B of C. britskii that did not presented positive CMA3 sites. This work presents first cytogenetic data for C. haroldoi, C. maculata, and C. punctata, and the results show karyotypic patterns similar to those in the literature. However, the diversity found in populations of C. britskii represents new information about the evolution of the karyotype of the Cichlidae family, which has been conservative.

Here, we used medium-density SNP chips to provide estimates of LD in native Tunisian cattle. The two measures of LD that were used, mean r2 and D', decreased from 0.26 to 0.05 and from 0.73 to 0.40, respectively, when the distance between markers increased from less than 20 Kb to 200 Kb. The decay in LD over physical distance occurred at a faster rate than that reported for European and other indigenous breeds, and reached background levels at less than 500 Kb distance. This is consistent with the absence of strong selective pressure within the Tunisian population and suggests that, in order to be effective, any potential genome-wide association mapping studies will need to use chips with higher marker density. An analysis of effective population size (Ne) based on LD data showed a decline in past Ne, with a sudden drop starting about eight generations ago. This finding, combined with the high levels of recent inbreeding revealed by runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis, indicate that this population is endangered and may be in urgent need of a conservation plan that includes a well-designed genetic management program.",Dynamic Fixation Versus Static Fixation for Distal Tibiofibular Syndesmosis Injuries: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776287,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 10,"BACKGROUND Ankle sprains with distal tibiofibular syndesmosis injuries (DTSIs) require anatomic reduction and fixation to restore the normal biomechanics of the ankle joint. In the last decade, dynamic fixation (DF) for DTSIs using a suture-button device has gained popularity because of its advantages over static fixation (SF). MATERIAL AND METHODS The present meta-analysis was conducted to compare clinical outcomes between DF and SF of DTSIs. PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase were systematically searched. Three randomized controlled studies and 7 cohort studies, with a total of 420 patients, were involved in this study. DTSIs patients treated with DF were assigned to the experimental group, and patients treated with SF were assigned to the control group. Outcomes were evaluated and analyzed by using review-manager software. Mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was analyzed and calculated by utilizing the random effects models. RESULTS Analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between DF and SF in American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot score (MD, 1.90; 95% CI, -0.23-4.03; p=0.08; I¬≤=0%), Olerud-Molander score (MD, 1.92; 95% CI, -7.96-11.81; p=0.70; I¬≤=55%), incidence of syndesmotic malreduction (RR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-1.09; p=0.06; I¬≤=0%), and overall postoperative complication rate (RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.09-0.99; p=0.05, I¬≤=75%). The rate of second procedure was significantly lower compared with DF (RR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.07-0.43; p=0.0002, I¬≤=54%).

Our previous studies demonstrated that high glucose concentrations are associated with decreased hepcidin expression, which inhibits insulin synthesis. In this study, we focused on the role of low hepcidin level-induced increased iron deposition in Œ≤-cells and the relationship between abnormal iron metabolism and Œ≤-cell dysfunction. Decreased hepcidin expression increased iron absorption by upregulating transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) expression, resulting in iron accumulation within cells. Prussia blue stain and calcein-AM assays revealed greater iron accumulation in the cytoplasm of pancreatic tissue isolated from db/db mice, cultured islets and Min6 cells in response to high glucose stimulation. Increased cytosolic iron deposition was associated with greater Fe2+ influx into the mitochondria, which depolarized the mitochondria membrane potential, inhibited ATP synthesis, generated excessive ROS and induced oxidative stress. The toxic effect of excessive iron on mitochondrial function eventually resulted in impaired insulin secretion. The restricted iron content in db/db mice via reduced iron intake or accelerated iron clearance improved blood glucose levels with decreased fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin (FIns), HbA1c level, as well as improved intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) results. Thus, our study may reveal the mechanism involved in the role of hepcidin in the glucotoxcity impaired pancreatic Œ≤ cell function pathway."

Abnormal functioning of trophoblast cells may cause failure of uterine spiral artery remodeling, which may be related to pregnancy-related disorders, such as preeclampsia. Here, we reported that an actin-binding protein, Œ±-actinin (ACTN)4, was dysregulated in placentas from early onset preeclampsia. Moreover, knockdown of ACTN4 markedly inhibited trophoblast cell proliferation by reducing AKT membrane translocation. Furthermore, E-cadherin regulated ACTN4 and Œ≤-catenin colocalization on trophoblast cell podosomes, and ACTN4 down-regulation suppressed the E-cadherin-induced cell invasion increase via depolymerizing actin filaments.

However, the precise role that KLF15 and its functional domain played in adventitial inflammation and fibrosis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the role of the transactivation domain (TAD) of KLF15 in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced adventitial pathologic changes. KLF15 expression was decreased in the vascular adventitia of Ang II-infused mice (1000 ng/kg/min, 14 d) and in adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) stimulated by Ang II (10-7 M). Adenovirus-mediated KLF15 overexpression normalized Ang II-induced vascular hypertrophy, increased collagen deposition, macrophage infiltration, and CCL2 and VCAM-1 expression. Interestingly, KLF15-ŒîTAD (KLF15 with deletion of TAD at amino acids 132-152) overexpression showed no effect on the above pathologic changes. Similarly, perivascularly overexpression of KLF15 but not KLF15-ŒîTAD in carotid arteries also attenuated Ang II-induced vascular inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, KLF15 overexpression after Ang II infusion rescued Ang II-induced vascular remodeling. CCL2 or VCAM-1-mediated monocyte and macrophage migration or adhesion to AFs in response to Ang II was negatively regulated by KLF15 through TAD. Ang II-enhanced Smad2/3 activation and adventitial migration, proliferation, and differentiation of AFs were suppressed by KLF15 but not KLF15-ŒîTAD overexpression. Conversely, small interfering RNA knockdown of KLF15 aggravated Ang II-induced Smad2/3 activation and dysfunction of AFs. Luciferase, coimmunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were used to demonstrate that interaction of KLF15 with Smad2/3 suppressed CCL2 expression through TAD. Mechanistically, activation of Ang II type 1 receptor/phospholipase CŒ≥ 1/ERK1/2 signaling resulted in a decrease of KLF15 expression. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that KLF15 negatively regulates activation of AFs through TAD, which plays an important role in Ang II-induced adventitial inflammation and fibrosis.-Lu, Y.-Y., Li, X.-D., Zhou, H.-D., Shao, S., He, S., Hong, M.-N., Liu, J.-C., Xu, Y.-L., Wu, Y.-J., Zhu, D.-L., Wang, J.-G., Gao, P.-J.

The Born-Oppenheimer separation between the quantum and classical nuclei prevents the direct calculation of vibrational frequencies corresponding to modes composed of both types of nuclei. Herein an effective strategy for calculating the vibrational frequencies of the entire molecule within the NEO framework is devised and implemented. This strategy requires diagonalization of an extended NEO Hessian that depends on the expectation values of the quantum nuclei as well as the coordinates of the classical nuclei and is constructed with input from multicomponent time-dependent density functional theory (NEO-TDDFT). Application of this NEO-DFT(V) approach to molecular systems illustrates that it accurately incorporates the most significant anharmonic effects.

In our previous works, we suggested a novel technique called bubbling organic liquid membrane extraction by spreading and covering an organic extractant with extremely small volume on the surface of gas bubbles to form a layer of the gas bubble-supported organic liquid membrane for selective extraction and enrichment of low-concentration targets from dilute aqueous solutions. It was found that for successfully performing the bubbling organic liquid membrane extraction, a prerequisite is knowing how to control the formation of a stable organic liquid membrane covered on the surface of gas bubbles. However, once the organic extractant starts to spread on the surface of gas bubbles, the extraction chemical reaction at the interface between the organic extractant liquid membrane and the rare-earth aqueous solution will occur. In the present work, the spreading behavior of the organic extractant P507 on the surface of rare-earth aqueous solutions was investigated and was compared with the behaviors on the surface of deionized water. It was revealed that the spreading of the organic extractant P507 on the surface of aqueous solutions containing rare-earth ions was accelerated because of the occurrence of the chemical reactions at the gas-water interface. The difference in the spreading rate of organic extractant P507 liquid droplets on the surface of deionized water and on that of Er(III) aqueous solutions with an increase in the P507 concentration, the saponification degrees of the P507 extractant, and the preloading amount of Er(III) in the P507 extractant revealed that the chemical reaction at the interface between the spreading P507 thin liquid membrane and the Er(III) aqueous solution would result in the Marangoni convection along the interface, which is in favor of overcoming the resistance from the viscous force when the surface tension gradient replaces gravity as a dominant driving force for the spreading. The present work provides an experimental foundation toward understanding the effect of the interfacial chemical reaction on the spreading behavior of an organic oil droplet on the gas-water interface. It is beneficial for the development of our suggested new technique of bubbling organic liquid membrane extraction and to achieve a controllable generation of a stable gas bubble-supported organic liquid membrane for performing solvent extraction at large aqueous-to-oil phase ratios.",Hyperbolic Meta-Antennas Enable Full Control of Scattering and Absorption of Light.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776244,Nano letters,2019 03 20,"We introduce a novel concept of hybrid metal-dielectric meta-antenna supporting type II hyperbolic dispersion, which enables full control of absorption and scattering of light in the visible/near-infrared spectral range. This ability lies in the different nature of the localized hyperbolic Bloch-like modes excited within the meta-antenna. The experimental evidence is corroborated by a comprehensive theoretical study. In particular, we demonstrate that two main modes, one radiative and one non-radiative, can be excited by direct coupling with the free-space radiation. We show that the scattering is the dominating electromagnetic decay channel, when an electric dipolar mode is induced in the system, whereas a strong absorption process occurs when a magnetic dipole is excited. Also, by varying the geometry of the system, the relative ratio of scattering and absorption, as well as their relative enhancement and/or quenching, can be tuned at will over a broad spectral range, thus enabling full control of the two channels. Importantly, both radiative and nonradiative modes supported by our architecture can be excited directly with far-field radiation. This is observed to occur even when the radiative channels (scattering) are almost totally suppressed, thereby making the proposed¬†architecture suitable for practical applications. Finally, the hyperbolic meta-antennas possess both angular and polarization independent structural integrity, unlocking promising applications as hybrid meta-surfaces or as solvable nanostructures.",Wetting Criteria of Intrinsic Contact Angle To Distinguish between Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Micro-/Nanotextured Surfaces: Experimental and Theoretical Analysis with Synchrotron X-ray Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776243,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 12,"In this study, the existing knowledge on the wetting criterion, that is, the intrinsic contact angle, for distinguishing between hydrophilic and hydrophobic textured surfaces is verified experimentally.

In particular, X-ray tomography is introduced to measure precise geometric morphologies of nano- and micro-/nanotextured surfaces, and the wetting state of the textured surfaces is clearly visualized using synchrotron X-ray imaging. By comparing previous theoretical models and experimental results, it is verified that the intrinsic contact angle for distinguishing between hydrophilic and hydrophobic textured surfaces should be corrected from 90¬∞ to 43¬∞.

Two-dimensional maps of potential energy surface in a vacuum and in implicit water solution were calculated at the œâB97XD/6-311++G(2df,2pd) level. One-dimensional potential energy profiles were computed for proton transfer reactions.

Being able to predict these changes would have a profound impact on lead optimization of drug candidates. Free-energy perturbation is an ideal tool for predicting relative binding energy differences for small structural modifications, but its performance for ACs is unknown. Here, we show that FEP can on average predict ACs to within 1.39 kcal/mol of experiment (‚àº1 log unit of activity). We performed FEP calculations with two different software methods: Schr√∂dinger-Desmond FEP+ and GROMACS implementations. There was qualitative agreement in the results from the two methods, and quantitatively the error for one data set was identical, 1.43 kcal/mol, but FEP+ performed better in the second, with errors of 1.17 versus 1.90 kcal/mol. The results have far-reaching implications, suggesting well-implemented FEP calculations can have a major impact on computational drug design.",CUB-5: A Contoured Aliphatic Pore Environment in a Cubic Framework with Potential for Benzene Separation Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776225,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 06,"One prominent aspect of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) is the ability to tune the size, shape, and chemical characteristics of their pores. MOF-5, with its open cubic connectivity of Zn4O clusters joined by two-dimensional, terephthalate linkers, is the archetypal example: both functionalized and elongated linkers produce isoreticular frameworks that define pores with new shapes and chemical environments. The recent scalable synthesis of cubane-1,4-dicarboxylic acid (1,4-H2cdc) allows the first opportunity to¬†explore its application in leading reticular architectures. Herein we describe the use of 1,4-H2cdc to construct [Zn4O(1,4-cdc)3], referred to as CUB-5. Isoreticular with MOF-5, CUB-5 adopts a cubic architecture but features aliphatic, rather than aromatic, pore surfaces. Methine units point directly into the pores, delivering new and unconventional adsorption locations. Our results show that CUB-5 is capable of selectively adsorbing high amounts of benzene at low partial pressures, promising for future investigations into the industrial separation of benzene from gasoline using aliphatic MOF materials. These results present an effective design strategy for the generation of new MOF materials with aliphatic pore environments and properties previously unattainable in conventional frameworks.",Pickering Emulsion-Derived Liquid-Solid Hybrid Catalyst for Bridging Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776224,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 03,"We describe a novel method to prepare a liquid-solid hybrid catalyst via interfacial growth of a porous silica crust around Pickering emulsion droplets, which allowed us to overcome the current limitations of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. The inner micron-scaled liquid (for example, ionic liquids) pool of the resultant catalyst can host free homogeneous molecular catalysts or enzymes to create a true homogeneous catalysis environment. The porous silica crust of the hybrid catalyst has excellent stability, which makes it amenable to packing directly in fixed-bed reactors for continuous flow catalysis. As a proof of concept, the enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols, CrIII(salen) complex-catalyzed asymmetric ring opening of epoxides and Pd-catalyzed Tsuji-Trost allylic substitution reactions were used to verify the generality and versatility of our strategy for bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. The hybrid catalyst-based continuous flow system exhibited a 1.6‚àº16-fold enhancement in activity relative to homogeneous counterparts even over¬†1500 h, and the afforded enantioselectivities were completely equal to those obtained in the homogeneous counterpart systems. Interestingly, the catalytic efficiency can be tuned through rational engineering of the porous crust and the dimensions of the liquid pool, resulting in features of an innovatively designed catalyst. This contribution provides a new method to design efficient catalysts that can bridge the conceptual and technical gaps between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.",Construction of Metallosupramolecular Coordination Complexes: From Lanthanide Helicates to Octahedral Cages Showing Single-Molecule Magnet Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776223,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"The construction of metallosupramolecular complexes toward interesting topological structures is a critical challenge for chemists. The fluctuation in the synthetic strategy, by keeping the same metal-ligand combination, has proved a very significant approach to construct metallosupramolecular architectures. Herein, by varying the reaction conditions four new DyIII-supramolecular complexes based on a flexible dihydrazone ligand H2L (H2L = bis(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylidene)adipohydrazide) in cooperation with different anions and solvents having formulas [Dy4L4(Œº2-N3)2](NO3)2¬∑6CH3OH¬∑2H2O (1), [Dy8L8(Œº2-CH3OH)4]Cl8¬∑6CH3OH¬∑14H2O (2), [Dy12L12(Œº2-OH)2(OH)6(CH3O)2](NO3)2¬∑2CH3OH¬∑14H2O (3), and [Dy12L12(Œº2-OH)2(NO3)2(OH)3(CH3O)](NO3)4¬∑22H2O (4), have been successfully synthesized and their crystal structures confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The structural study reveals that 1 and 2 have quadruple-stranded helicate and dual triple-stranded helicate supramolecular structures, respectively, while 3 and 4 display ""octahedron"" cagelike supramolecular structures. The magnetic studies reveal that complexes 1-3 exhibit slow magnetic relaxation behavior, while complex 4 displays a series of typical frequency-dependent relaxation signals at 0 Oe applied dc field which is a rare case in polynuclear 4f single-molecule magnet (SMM) family to date. Interestingly, the distinct magnetic dynamic behavior was noticed for nearly isoskeletal complexes 3 and 4, which can be attributed to the modification of the coordination environment around DyIII ions.","A Nonheme Thiolate-Ligated Cobalt Superoxo Complex: Synthesis and Spectroscopic Characterization, Computational Studies, and Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776222,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 11,"The synthesis and characterization of a Co(II) dithiolato complex Co(Me3TACN)(S2SiMe2) (1) are reported. Reaction of 1 with O2 generates a rare thiolate-ligated cobalt-superoxo species Co(O2)(Me3TACN)(S2SiMe2) (2) that was characterized spectroscopically and structurally by resonance Raman, EPR, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies as well as density functional theory. Metal-superoxo species are proposed to S-oxygenate metal-bound thiolate donors in nonheme thiol dioxygenases, but 2 does not lead to S-oxygenation of the intramolecular thiolate donors and does not react with exogenous sulfur donors. However, complex 2 is capable of oxidizing the O-H bonds of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-ol derivatives via H atom abstraction. Complementary proton-coupled electron-transfer reactivity is seen for 2 with separated proton/reductant pairs. The reactivity studies indicate that 2 can abstract H atoms from weak X-H bonds with bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) ‚â§ 70 kcal mol-1. DFT calculations predict that the putative Co(OOH) product has an O-H BDFE = 67 kcal mol-1, which matches the observed pattern of reactivity seen for 2.

Here, in a year-long, wetland mesocosm experiment, we compared microbial community responses to pulse (single 450 mg dose of silver) and chronic (weekly 8.7 mg doses of silver for 1 year) silver nanoparticle (Ag0 NP) treatments, as well as a chronic treatment of ""aged"" sulfidized silver nanoparticles (Ag2S NPs). While mesocosms exposed to Ag2S NPs never differed significantly from the controls, both Ag0 NP treatments exhibited reduced microbial diversity and altered community composition; however, the effects differed in timing, duration, and magnitude. Microbial community-level impacts in the acute Ag0 NP treatment were apparent only within the first weeks and then converged on the control mesocosm composition, while chronic exposure effects were observed several months after exposures began, likely due to interactive effects of nanoparticle toxicity and winter environmental conditions. Notably, there was a high level of overlap in the taxa which exhibited significant declines (>10√ó) in both treatments, suggesting a conserved toxicity response for both pulse and chronic exposures. Thus, this research suggests that complex, but short-term, acute toxicological studies may provide critical, cost-effective insights into identifying microbial taxa sensitive to long-term chronic exposures to Ag NPs.",Phenology of Phytoplankton Blooms in a Trophic Lake Observed from Long-Term MODIS Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776220,Environmental science & technology,2019 03 05,"Phytoplankton phenology critically affects elements biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem structure, and productivity. However, our understanding about the phenological process and driving mechanism is still very limited due to the shortage of long-term observation data. We used all available daily MODIS-Aqua data from 2003 to 2017 to determine bloom start dates (BSDs) in a typical trophic lake (Lake Taihu) and investigate how phytoplankton BSDs respond to climate change and environmental factors. The results indicate that BSDs have advanced 29.9 days for the entire Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2017. Spatially, an earlier phytoplankton bloom was recorded in the northern bays and the littoral regions than in the center of open water. Air temperature, wind speed, and N/P ratio (N, total nitrogen; P, total phosphorus) were three important factors affecting phytoplankton phenology. Multiple linear correlation showed that air temperature, wind speed, and N/P ratio in Spring could explain 59.9% variability of BSDs for Lake Taihu. This study provides a quantitative assessment of phytoplankton phenological shifts and elucidates the inter-relationship between phenology parameters and environmental factors, thus improving our understanding on the potential impact of climate change and eutrophication on lake ecosystems. The starting earlier and lasting longer of phytoplankton are consistent with the expected effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystem in recent decades, which will bring new challenges for algal bloom management in eutrophic Lake Taihu.",Unique Class of Enantiopure N-Heterocyclic Carbene Half-Sandwich Iridium(III) Complexes with Stable Configurations: Probing Five-Membered versus Six-Membered Iridacycles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776219,Inorganic chemistry,2019 03 08,"A unique class of enantiopure N-heterocyclic carbene half-sandwich iridium complexes is reported.

A protein homodimer, TRIM25cc, was selectively labeled with [Gd.sTPATCN]-SL (70%) and a nitroxide (30%) under mild conditions and measured using the double electron electron resonance (DEER) technique with both commercial Q-band and home-built W-band spectrometers. The label shows great promise for increasing the sensitivity of DEER measurements through both its favorable relaxation parameters and the large DEER modulation depth at both Q- and W-band for the inter-Gd(III) DEER measurement which, at 9%, is the largest recorded under these conditions."

The concentration of EPO was determined by the method of solid-phase enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) using the test system ""Erythropoietin-EIA-BEST"" (ZAO Vector-Best, Russia). The concentration of EPO in the serum of the patients of the main group significantly exceeded its content in the control group, the median and interquartile range were respectively 12.0 (7.4 - 16.1) mIU / ml in the main group and 7.5 (5.65-8 , 1) mIU / ml in the control group (p = 0.000454).

An increase in the content of EPO in the blood is probably due to the reaction of the juxtaglomerular nephron apparatus to the formation of hypoxia due to a violation of the function of external respiration. Thus, the study of the concentration of EPO can be used to assess the severity of COPD, and in interpreting the results of this laboratory test, the possibility of increasing its concentration due to impairment of the function of external respiration should be considered.",[Influence of phosphogliv¬Æ hepatoprotector on phospholipid spectrum of peripheral blood mononuclears in patients with tuberculosis of lungs.],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776202,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,2019 03 23,"The administration of the ""Phosphogliv¬Æ"" hepatoprotector in the comprehensive treatment of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis will allow determining its effect on the lipid composition of membranes of mononuclear cells under conditions of etiotropic chemotherapy according to 1 standard regimen.

Early ornithischian dinosaurs are uniquely characterized by a fourth trochanter with a prominent pendant process. Throughout the evolution of ornithischians, the fourth trochanter repeatedly converged on two major morphological changes: (1) the distal migration of the trochanter down the femoral shaft and (2) the loss of the pendant process. Both changes, as well as the original evolution of the pendant form, relate to a single major functional shift emphasizing caudofemoral leverage. Direct evidence of muscle scarring across the surface of the pendant process affirms that it served to extend the attachment of the primary caudofemoralis brevis tendon distally. A proximally located fourth trochanter is the basal condition in dinosaurs and other archosaurs, and the development of a pendant process lengthened the functional lever arm with regard to the insertion of the caudofemoralis. This adaptation afforded improved mechanical advantage, perhaps beneficial in the context of the newly assumed herbivorous diets of basal ornithischians. As some derived ornithischians increased in body size, a high-leverage system with a more distal caudofemoralis attachment evolved. In some groups, the fourth trochanter as a whole descended down the femur, eventually reaching a point where the pendant process was unnecessary. Sauropodomorphs, the other great lineage of dinosaur herbivores, converged on the same high-leverage distal fourth trochanter arrangement, but without first transitioning through a prominent pendant form.

For the analogue with two terminal triethylene glycol chains, the fluorescence emission at 509‚ÄÖnm responded selectively toward Hg2+ ions, which greatly increased the fluorescence quantum yield from 0.003 to 0.25 as a result of inhibition of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process. By introducing two additional rhodamine moieties at the termini, the resulting conjugate could also detect Hg2+ ions in a highly selective manner. Upon excitation at the BODIPY core, the fluorescence emission of rhodamine at 580‚ÄÖnm was observed and the intensity increased substantially upon addition of Hg2+ ions due to inhibition of the PET process followed by highly efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the BODIPY core to the rhodamine moieties. The Hg2+ -responsive fluorescence change of these two probes could be easily seen with the naked eye. The binding stoichiometry between the probes and Hg2+ ions in CH3 CN was determined to be 1:2 by Job's plot analysis and 1 H‚ÄÖNMR titration, and the binding constants were found to be (1.2¬±0.1)√ó1011 ‚Äâm-2 and (1.3¬±0.3)√ó1010 ‚Äâm-2 , respectively.

The RSV-F core forms a trimer-of-hairpins (TOH) motif in postfusion conformation, which is characterized by a six-helix bundle (6HB) where the three N-terminal HRn helices define a central coiled-coil, while three C-terminal HRc helices pack on the coiled-coil surface in an antiparallel manner. Here, one tightly packed HRn-HRc helix-helix interaction is stripped from the 6HB, which represents the minimum unit of RSV-F TOH motif. The helix-helix interaction sequence can be truncated to derive a core binding region (CBR) that covers intense nonbonded interactions across the interaction interface. Dynamics simulation and energetics analysis reveal that the CBR HRc peptide has a large flexibility and intrinsic disorder in unbound free state, which would incur a considerable entropy penalty upon its binding to CBR NRn peptide. Two strategies are described to constrain the HRc peptide conformation. First, the four non-interfacial residues of HRc peptide are artificially substituted with new amino acid combinations of high helical propensity and, second, the helical conformation of wild-type and mutant HRc peptides is stabilized by adding an all-hydrocarbon bridge across two spatially vicinal, non-interfacial residues 503 (i) and 507 (i¬†+¬†4). Free energy calculation and fluorescence-based assay confirm that the substitution and stapling can effectively improve the binding affinity of CBR HRn-HRc interaction.",Dynamics of the Bulk Hydrated Electron from Many-Body Wave-Function Theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776181,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 13,"The structure of the hydrated electron is a matter of debate as it evades direct experimental observation owing to the short life time and low concentrations of the species. Herein, the first molecular dynamics simulation of the bulk hydrated electron based on correlated wave-function theory provides conclusive evidence in favor of a persistent tetrahedral cavity made up by four water molecules, and against the existence of stable non-cavity structures. Such a cavity is formed within less than a picosecond after the addition of an excess electron to neat liquid water, with less regular cavities appearing as intermediates. The cavities are bound together by weak H-H bonds, the number of which correlates well with the number of coordinated water molecules, each type of cavity leaving a distinct spectroscopic signature.

Certain flavonoids, including naringenin, have cytoprotective properties. Although the antioxidant effect has long been thought to be a crucial factor accounting for the cellular effects of flavonoids, mitochondrial channels have emerged recently as targets for cytoprotective strategies. In the present study, we characterized interactions between naringenin and the mitochondrial potassium (mitoBKCa and mitoKATP ) channels recently described in dermal fibroblasts. With the use of the patch-clamp technique and mitoplasts isolated from primary human dermal fibroblast cells, our study shows that naringenin in micromolar concentrations leads to an increase in mitoBKCa channel activity. The opening probability of the channel decreased from 0.97 in the control conditions (200¬†Œºmol/L Ca2+ ) to 0.06 at a low Ca2+ level (1¬†Œºmol/L) and increased to 0.85 after the application of 10¬†Œºmol/L naringenin. Additionally, the activity of the mitoKATP channel increased following the application of 10¬†Œºmol/L naringenin. To investigate the effects of naringenin on mitochondrial function, the oxygen consumption of dermal fibroblast cells was measured in potassium-containing media. The addition of naringenin significantly and dose-dependently increased the respiratory rate from 5.8¬†¬±¬†0.2 to 14.0¬†¬±¬†0.6¬†nmol O2 ¬†√ó¬†min-1 ¬†√ó¬†mg protein-1 . Additionally, a Raman spectroscopy analysis of skin penetration indicated that the naringenin was distributed in all skin layers, including the epidermis and dermis.

Few studies exist on the distribution and state of nerve fibers in PDAC tissue and their clinicopathological impacts. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic value of intrapancreatic neural alterations in patients with PDAC. We retrospectively analyzed 256 patients with PDAC who underwent macroscopic curative surgery. Nerve fibers, immunolabeled with a specific neural marker GAP-43, were digitally counted and compared among PDAC, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal pancreatic tissues. Interlobular nerve fibers were apparently hypertrophic in both CP and PDAC, although intrapancreatic neural density and nerve number decreased characteristically in PDAC. They tended to decrease toward the center of the tumor. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses revealed a statistically significant correlation between low neural density and shorter overall survival (OS) (P¬†=¬†0.014), and between high neural invasion and shorter OS (P¬†=¬†0.017). Neural density (P¬†=¬†0.04; HR¬†=¬†1.496; 95% CI 1.018-2.199) and neural invasion ratio (P¬†=¬†0.064; HR¬†=¬†1.439; 95% CI .980-2.114) were prognostic factors of shorter OS in the multivariate analysis. These findings suggest low intrapancreatic neural density in patients with PDAC as an independent prognosticator, which may represent aggressive tumor behavior. Furthermore, we propose a simple, practical and reproducible method (to measure neural density and the neural invasion ratio during conventional histopathological diagnosis of PDAC), which has been validated using another cohort (n¬†=¬†81).","High level extracellular production of recombinant human interferon alpha 2b in glycoengineered Pichia pastoris: culture medium optimization, high cell density cultivation and biological characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776176,Journal of applied microbiology,2019 05 28,The present study was aimed at design of experiments (DoE)- and artificial intelligence-based culture medium optimization for high level extracellular production of a novel recombinant human interferon alpha 2b (huIFNŒ±2b) in glycoengineered Pichia pastoris and its characterization.,"Somatic alterations of TP53, ERBB2, PIK3CA and CCND1 are associated with chemosensitivity for breast cancers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776175,Cancer science,2019 04 16,"The correlation of genetic alterations with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has not been fully revealed. In this study, we enrolled 247 breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-taxane-based NAC treatment.

As antibiotics become increasingly ineffective, targeting the host and specific bacterial evasion mechanisms are becoming novel therapeutic approaches. The technology used to understand host-pathogen interactions has dramatically advanced over the last century. We have moved away from using simple in vitro assays focused on single-cell events to technologies that allow us to observe complex multicellular interactions in real time in live animals. Specifically, intravital microscopy (IVM) has improved our understanding of infection, from viral to bacterial to parasitic, and how the host immune system responds to these infections. Yet, at the same time it has allowed us to appreciate just how complex these interactions are and that current experimental models still have a number of limitations.

HIV patients have increased necroinflammation and more rapid fibrosis progression in chronic liver injury compared to non-HIV-infected patients. As the resident liver macrophage is critical to the IL-1Œ≤ response to microbial translocation in chronic liver disease, we aim to examine the impact of HIV-1 and LPS stimulation on the IL-1Œ≤ response of the resident hepatic macrophages. We isolated primary human liver macrophages from liver resection specimens, treated them with HIV-1BaL and/or LPS ex vivo, examined the IL-1Œ≤ response, and then studied underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we examined IL-1Œ≤ expression in liver tissues derived from HIV-1 patients compared to those with no underlying liver disease. HIV-1 up-regulated TLR4 and CD14 expression on isolated primary CD68+ human liver macrophages and contributed to the IL-1Œ≤ response to LPS stimulation as evidenced by TLR4 blocking. Nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) was shown to be involved in the IL-1Œ≤ response of liver macrophages to HIV-1 infection and NLRP3 blocking experiments in primary CD68+ liver macrophages confirmed the contribution of the NLRP3-caspase 1 inflammatory signaling pathway in the IL-1Œ≤ response. High in situ IL-1Œ≤ expression was found in CD68+ cells in human liver tissues from HIV-1-infected patients, suggesting a critical role of IL-1Œ≤ responses in patients infected by HIV. HIV infection sensitizes the IL-1Œ≤ response of liver macrophages to LPS through up-regulation of CD14 and TLR4 expression and downstream activation of the NLRP3-caspase 1 pathway. These findings have implications for enhanced immune activation in HIV+ patients and mechanisms for rapid fibrosis progression in patients with chronic liver injury.",A proposal for sectorial organizing and quality standards in therapeutic apheresis: The therapeutic apheresis unit (TAU) standards.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776149,Journal of clinical apheresis,2019 02 18,"Therapeutic apheresis (TA) includes a wide range of therapeutic procedures based on the separation of blood components and the collection of cells with therapeutic activity or the removal of unwanted plasma or cellular components involved in the etiology of various hematologic, renal, neurological, and medical diseases.

Simulation and power calculations were used to determine error rates based on observed control coefficients of variation (CV) for 8 laboratories over a range of effect levels. Average C. dubia control reproduction among laboratories was 20 to 40 offspring per female, and the 75th percentile CV was 0.10 to 0.31, reflecting a range in laboratory performance. The 2 approaches behave similarly for CVs of 0.2 to 0.3. At effects <10%, as CV decreases, TST is less likely to declare toxicity and NOEC is more likely to do so. Laboratory performance affects whether a sample is declared toxic and influences the probability of false-positive (and -negative) error rates using either approach. At the 75th percentile control CV observed for each laboratory, 4 laboratories would achieve approximately a 5% false-positive rate using 13 or fewer replicates for this test method. For the remaining 4 laboratories, more replicates would be needed to achieve a 5% false-positive rate.

Anthracyclines tend to be administered first as they were established before taxanes for treatment of early breast cancer.,Hemodynamic and electrocortical reactivity to specific scene contents in emotional perception.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776100,Psychophysiology,2019 05 09,"Emotional scene perception is characterized by enhanced neural activity across broad regions of visual cortex, the frontoparietal network, and anterior corticolimbic structures. In human fMRI and electrocortical experiments, activation enhancement is strongly related to self-reported emotional arousal evoked by scene stimuli. However, an additional bias in reaction to pleasant scenes has been reported in a subset of emotion-enhanced brain regions. Human fMRI and primate electrophysiological studies show biased frontoparietal network activity in response to rewarding cues. In addition, activation in lateral occipital regions may show a bias in pleasant scene perception, as shown in fMRI and in the early posterior negativity (EPN) ERP component. To define this potential pleasure bias, we presented a balanced set of naturalistic scenes to participants during separate fMRI and ERP recording sessions. Consistent with past work, the amplitude of the slow-wave late positive potential (LPP), as well as hemodynamic activity in fusiform gyrus and amygdala, showed equivalent enhancement across highly arousing pleasant and unpleasant, relative to neutral scenes. In addition to this emotional enhancement, the EPN component, as well as hemodynamic activity in lateral occipital cortex and frontoparietal network, showed greater reactivity during highly arousing pleasant relative to unpleasant scenes, consistent with a pleasure bias. The interpretation of this pattern of reactivity is discussed with respect to selective and evolved attention mechanisms.",SCUBA Medicine for otolaryngologists: Part I.

Early PGS treatment involves glottic dilation to reduce airway constriction associated with chronic PGS. Round laryngeal dilation may not optimize posterior glottic dilation due to the teardrop shape of the glottis and may injure vocal fold tissue. We compared pressure applied to the glottis during traditional single balloon dilation and a novel, anatomically appropriate dilation technique (teardrop-shaped glottic dilation [TSGD]).",GM1 promotes TrkA-mediated neuroblastoma cell differentiation by occupying a plasma membrane domain different from TrkA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776097,Journal of neurochemistry,2019 04 15,"Recently, we highlighted that the ganglioside GM1 promotes neuroblastoma cells differentiation by activating the TrkA receptor through the formation of a TrkA-GM1 oligosaccharide complex at the cell surface. To study the TrkA-GM1 interaction, we synthesized two radioactive GM1 derivatives presenting a photoactivable nitrophenylazide group at the end of lipid moiety, 1 or at position 6 of external galactose, 2; and a radioactive oligosaccharide portion of GM1 carrying the nitrophenylazide group at position 1 of glucose, 3. The three compounds were singly administered to cultured neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells under established conditions that allow cell surface interactions. After UV activation of photoactivable compounds, the proteins were analyzed by PAGE separation. The formation of cross-linked TrkA-GM1 derivatives complexes was identified by both radioimaging and immunoblotting. Results indicated that the administration of compounds 2 and 3, carrying the photoactivable group on the oligosaccharide, led to the formation of a radioactive TrkA complex, while the administration of compound 1 did not. This underlines that the TrkA-GM1 interaction directly involves the GM1 oligosaccharide, but not the ceramide. To better understand how GM1 relates to the TrkA, we isolated plasma membrane lipid rafts. As expected, GM1 was found in the rigid detergent-resistant fractions, while TrkA was found as a detergent soluble fraction component. These results suggest that TrkA and GM1 belong to separate membrane domains: probably TrkA interacts by 'flopping' down its extracellular portion onto the membrane, approaching its interplay site to the oligosaccharide portion of GM1.","Adolescent psychopathy, heart rate, and skin conductance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776096,Psychophysiology,2019 05 09,"Researchers have advocated for a greater focus on measuring neurobiological underpinnings of serious psychological conditions such as psychopathy. This has become particularly important to investigate early in the life span, when intervention efforts for psychopathy-related behavior like conduct disorder (CD) are more successful. Given that psychopathy is a complex syndrome, it is also important to investigate physiological processes at a dimensional level. Using a sample of 56 adolescent male offenders (Mage = 15.92; SD = 1.31), this study explored the relationship between the Psychopathy Checklist-Youth Version (Forth, Kosson, & Hare, 2003), heart rate (HR), and skin conductance (SC). A white noise countdown task was used to measure autonomic activity across a baseline, anticipatory (prenoise), and reactivity (postnoise) period. Findings revealed no significant associations between psychopathy and HR activity across the time intervals. However, results revealed a positive association between grandiose-manipulative traits and SC activity and a negative association between callous-unemotional traits and SC activity. The results indicate that autonomic processes may contribute to distinct psychopathic traits in different ways, implicating slightly differential brain functioning. The findings suggest that, in order to better understand and treat youth with CD, future research should continue to examine the biological correlates of psychopathy at the broader construct level but perhaps especially at the component level.","SCUBA Medicine for Otolaryngologists: Part II.

To solve this problem, many methods have been developed to date, but all require additional time-consuming and costly procedures. Meanwhile, the MinION sequencer developed by Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) is considered a powerful tool for tackling this problem, as it allows selective sequencing of target DNA. The main technology employed involves rejection of an undesirable read from a specific pore by inverting the voltage of that pore, which is referred to as 'Read Until'. Despite its usefulness, several issues remain to be solved in real situations. First, limited computational resources are available in field research and epidemiological applications. In addition, a high-speed online classification algorithm is required to make a prompt decision.

Among these mechanisms, microRNAs promote regulation of targets by cleavage or degradation of the mRNA. Fungi of the Paracoccidioides complex are the etiological agents of the main systemic mycosis of Latin America. These fungi present a plasticity to adapt and survive in different conditions, and the presence of microRNAs-like molecules could be part of the mechanisms that provide such plasticity. MicroRNAs produced by the host influence the progression of this mycosis in the lungs besides regulating targets involved in apoptosis in macrophage, activation of T and B cells and the production of cytokines. Therefore, this work analyzed the presence of regions in the genome of this fungus with a potential to encode microRNAs-like molecules.

This was done in a retrospective study of the medical records of 30 patients with MPS I (n=13), MPS II (n=9) and MPS VI (n=8) who were being treated with enzyme replacement therapy. As part of routine nutritional monitoring, Se levels were measured, revealing that 28 patients (93.3%) had values below the normal range. Therefore, they received supplementation for 12 months, and Se was measured after 6 and 12 months. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, total glutathione (GSHt), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured at baseline and 6 months after Se supplementation. The mean GSHt at baseline was 7.90 ¬± 2.36 Œºmol/g Hb, and after Se supplementation it was 5.76 ¬± 1.13 Œºmol/g Hb; GSH/GSSG was 2.3 ¬± 1.16 at baseline and 0.58 ¬± 0.38 after supplementation.

First, we present a plate equation system with the growth functions incorporated, which is derived from the 3D governing system through a series expansion and truncation approach. By proposing a novel analytical method, the plate equation system is solved explicitly. The obtained solutions can reveal the dependence of the current configurations of the hyperelastic plates on the differential growth fields. By solving an inverse problem, some analytical formulas are obtained, which can be used to identify the growth functions for generating arbitrary 2D geometrical shapes of the hyperelastic plates. To demonstrate the efficiency of these formulas, some representative examples are studied, which show good consistency with the numerical simulations.

The water soluble fluorinated Mn-porphyrin derivative Mn-3 satisfies both requirements. In aqueous solutions, it can reversibly switch between MnIII/MnII oxidation states. In the presence of ascorbic acid or Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, the MnIII form undergoes reduction, which is slowly but fully reversed in the presence of air oxygen. A UV-Vis kinetic study of MnIII/MnII reduction under oxygen-free conditions yielded second-order rate constants, k2, of 46.1 M-1 s-1 and 13.8 M-1 s-1 for the reaction with ascorbic acid and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, respectively. This could correspond, in the absence of oxygen, to a half-life of a few minutes in blood plasma and a few seconds in circulating immune cells where ascorbic acid reaches 20-40 ŒºM and a few mM concentrations, respectively. In contrast to expectations based on the redox potential, reduction with glutathione or cysteine does not occur. It is prevented by the coordination of the glutathione carboxylate group(s) to MnIII in the axial position, as was evidenced by NMR data. Therefore, MnIII-3 acts as an ascorbate specific turn-on MRI probe, which in turn can be re-oxidized by oxygen. The relaxivity increase from the oxidized to the reduced form is considerably improved at medium frequencies (up to 80 MHz) with respect to the previously studied Mn-TPPS4 analogues; at 20 MHz, it amounts to 150%. No in vitro cytotoxicity is detectable for Mn-3 in the typical MRI concentration range. Finally, 19F NMR resonances of MnIII-3 are relatively sharp which could open further opportunities to exploit such complexes as paramagnetic 19F NMR probes.",New Pt‚ÜíM (M = Ag or Tl) complexes based on anionic cyclometalated Pt(ii) complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776043,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 06,"Anionic cyclometalated complexes (NBu4)[Pt(CNC)X] (X = Cl (1), CN (2), or S-2py (pyridine-2-thiolate) (3); -CNC- = 2,6-di(phen-2-ide)-pyridine) have been used as precursors in the synthesis of heteropolynuclear Pt-Ag or Pt-Tl complexes containing donor-acceptor metal-metal bonds. Their reaction with AgClO4 or [Ag(OClO3)(PPh3)] produces complexes in which the nuclearity and structure seem to be determined by the ability of the ligand X to form bridges between the metals. Thus, the characteristic linear bridging of the cyano ligand leads to the formation of an octanuclear [{Pt(CNC)(Œº-CN)}4Ag4] (4) or tetranuclear [{Pt(CNC)(Œº-CN)}2{Ag(PPh3)}2] (6) complex, with CN bridges between different ""Pt-Ag"" units. However, the S-2py ligand can act as a bridge between Pt and Ag of the same ""Pt-Ag"" unit, giving rise to the complex [{Pt(CNC)(S-2py)}2Ag2]¬∑CH2Cl2 (5).

Kinetically trapping the drug as a nanoparticle in an amorphous state enhances solubility. However, enhanced solubility can be compromised by subsequent recrystallization from the amorphous state during drying processes. We combine Flash NanoPrecipitation (FNP) to generate nanoparticles with spray-drying to produce stable solid powders. We demonstrate that the continuous nanofabrication platform for nanoparticle synthesis and recovery does not compromise the dissolution kinetics of the drug. Lumefantrine, an anti-malaria drug, is highly hydrophobic with low bioavailability. Increasing the bioavailability of lumefantrine has the potential to reduce the dose and number of required administrations per treatment, thus reducing cost and increasing patient compliance. The low melting temperature of lumefantrine (Tm = 130 ¬∞C) makes the drying of amorphous nanoparticles at elevated temperatures potentially problematic. Via FNP, we produced 200-400 nm nanoparticles using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), lecithin phospholipid, and zein protein stabilizers. Zein nanoparticles were spray-dried at 100 ¬∞C and 120 ¬∞C to study the effect of the drying temperature. For zein powders, at two hours the dissolution kinetics under fasted conditions reached 85% release for the 100 ¬∞C sample, but only 60% release for the 120 ¬∞C sample. Powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance indicate that the lumefantrine in the nanoparticle core is amorphous for samples spray-dried at 100 ¬∞C. Dissolution under fed state conditions showed similar release kinetics for both temperatures, with 90-95% release at two hours. Zein and HPMCAS nanoparticles spray-dried at 100 ¬∞C showed release profiles in fasted and fed state media that are identical to those of lyophilized samples, i.e. those dried at cryogenic conditions where no transformation to the crystalline state can occur. Thus, spray drying 30 ¬∞C below the melting transition of lumefantrine is sufficient to maintain the amorphous state. These inexpensive formulations have potential to be developed into future therapies for malaria, and the results also highlight the potential of combining FNP and spray-drying as a versatile platform to assemble and rapidly recover amorphous nanoparticles in a solid dosage form.",Emergence of complex chiral coordination clusters {CuNa12} by using multiple ligands under oxidizing conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776039,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 06,"Two chiral coordination clusters {CuNa12}, which can only be revealed by synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, were assembled unexpectedly from a system resembling the long-studied Fehling's solution.

This method exploits advances in micro-nano fabrication and capillarity for self-assembly and self-alignment of tissues on the stage. It allows simultaneous investigation of the microstructure of the tissue in situ while its mechanical response is quantified, thus linking tissue biophysics with physiology and revealing structural-functional properties of 3D tissues. We demonstrate the functionality of the stage by studying the mechanical behavior of different cell-collagen mixtures under mechanical, chemical and electrical stimulation.

In numerous progressive glomerular disease models, treatment with valproic acid (a class I HDAC inhibitor) or SAHA (a pan-HDAC inhibitor) mitigated the degree of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, leading to a striking increase in survival. Podocyte HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities were increased in mice podocytopathy models, and podocyte-associated Hdac1 and Hdac2 genetic ablation improved proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Podocyte early growth response 1 (EGR1) was increased in proteinuric patients and mice in an HDAC1- and HDAC2-dependent manner. Loss of EGR1 in mice reduced proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Longitudinal analysis of the multicenter Veterans Aging Cohort Study demonstrated a 30% reduction in mean annual loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate, and this effect was more pronounced in proteinuric patients receiving valproic acid. These results strongly suggest that inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 activities may suppress the progression of human proteinuric kidney diseases through the regulation of EGR1.",A promising approach to targeting type 1 IFN in systemic lupus erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776023,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 03 10,"Despite advances in understanding systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis, most clinical trials of new targeted therapies have been met with disappointment. The type I IFN pathway is believed to play an important role in SLE, and the proposed involvement of this pathway helps explain the frustration behind the failure at targeting either IFN-Œ± or the type 1 IFN receptor itself. In this issue of the JCI, Furie et al. report on an intriguing phase 1b study that demonstrates an approach for inhibiting this pathway in the skin using an mAB (BIIB059) that targets the blood DC antigen 2 (BDCA-2) receptor on plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). BIIB059 decreased IFN expression and improved cutaneous lupus disease activity, with a favorable safety profile. Whether or not this strategy will be effective in managing SLE in other organs remains unanswered. However, these results suggest that closing the door on targeting the type 1 IFN pathway in SLE may be premature and highlight the emerging question of whether an organ-specific approach toward lupus trials and treatment should be the wave of the future.",Recruiting CD33 on mast cells to inhibit IgE-mediated mast cell-dependent anaphylaxis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776022,The Journal of clinical investigation,2019 03 10,"IgE-mediated activation of mast cells is a hallmark of an anaphylactic reaction to allergen. In this issue of the JCI, Duan et al. describe an approach for suppressing IgE-dependent mast cell activation, thereby suppressing anaphylaxis. Specifically, the authors show that delivery of liposomes containing both the specific antigen recognized by the mast cell-bound IgE and a high-affinity glycan ligand of the inhibitory receptor CD33 (CD33L) to targeted mast cells inhibits antigen-induced, FcŒµRI-dependent spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) phosphorylation and downstream protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) phosphorylation, Ca++ flux, and Œ≤-hexosaminidase release (i.e., degranulation). However, this strategy only worked if both the antigen (reactive with the mast cell-bound IgE) and CD33L were on the same liposome.

For participants considered to have AD pathology, trazodone non-users declined at a rate 2.4 times greater than those taking trazodone for sleep over a 4-year period. In the analysis of sleep complaints, the relationship between trazodone, a widely used medication for sleep problems in the elderly, and cognition was associated with subjective improvement of sleep disruption. Due to the design of the study, it was not possible to prove that the benefit of slowing cognitive decline was due specifically to the improvement in sleep. However, trazodone uniquely improves the deeper phases of slow-wave sleep. Other sedative medications are generally associated with worse cognitive function over time, and they do not improve sleep characteristics as does trazodone. Trazodone has a variety of effects on several monoaminergic mechanisms: a potent serotonin 5-HT2A and Œ±1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and a weak antihistamine or histamine H1 receptor inverse agonist. Because of the potential importance of this finding, further discussion is provided on the roles that trazodone may play in the modulation of monoamines, cognition, and the development of AD. If trazodone really does provide such a dramatic slowing in the development of dementia associated with AD, a great deal more research on trazodone is needed, including environmental and behavioral factors related to improvement of sleep, energy management, and neuroplasticity.","Effect of Navigation Problems, Assessment Location, and a Practice Test on Driving Assessment Performance for People with Alzheimer's Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776013,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 02 18,People with Alzheimer's disease may be required to undertake clinical and on-road assessments to determine fitness to drive.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can strongly impact expression and function of lncRNA in AD, and previous genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) have discovered substantial amount of risk SNPs associated with AD. However, current studies omit the important information about SNPs when identifying potential AD-related lncRNAs. In addition to single discovery approach and small-scale samples in these studies, the number of lncRNAs discovered as keys in AD is limited. Here, multiple computational methods were integrated to discover novel and key lncRNA of the pathology of AD. First, large-scale GWAS data involved in three ethnicities were collected from two authoritative sources, and meta-analyses were conducted to find SNPs significantly associated with AD (tag SNPs). Second, these tag SNPs together with their linkage disequilibrium information were used to discover potential lncRNAs related to AD. Third, after validation by microarray probe re-annotation of 1,282 samples and RNA-seq data analysis of 117 samples, respectively, a total of five key lncRNAs of AD were identified. Finally, possible function of these lncRNAs was predicted by genome mapping, expression quantitative trait loci, differential co-expression, and gene set enrichment analysis. Based on function prediction, four of the five key lncRNAs were identified to affect the risk of AD by regulating corresponding pathogenic genes and pathways, which are involved in regulation of amyloid-Œ≤ peptide and the immune system. In summary, these findings can facilitate the discovery of potential disease-related lncRNAs and enhance understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.",Therapeutic Potential of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase in Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776001,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 04 06,"Currently there is no cure or effective disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia that is becoming a global threat to public health. It is important to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting AD pathophysiology particularly synaptic failure and cognitive impairments. Recent studies revealed several molecular signaling pathways potentially linked to brain pathology and synaptic failure in AD, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master kinase that plays a central role in the maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis. Particularly, hyperactive AMPK via phosphorylation has been linked to AD-associated synaptic plasticity impairments, indicating suppression of AMPK activity might be beneficial for cognitive deficiency in AD. In this review, we will discuss how targeting dysregulation of AMPK signaling could be a feasible therapeutic approach for AD.",Head-to-Head Comparison among Semi-Quantification Tools of Brain FDG-PET to Aid the Diagnosis of Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30776000,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 03 18,Several automatic tools have been implemented for semi-quantitative assessment of brain [18]F-FDG-PET.,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Tauopathies: Contrasting Human Brain Pathology with Cellular and Animal Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775999,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 04 01,"The accumulation and spreading of protein tau in the human brain are major features of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. In addition to several subcellular abnormalities, tau aggregation within neurons seems capable of triggering endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the consequent unfolded protein response (UPR). In metazoans, full activation of a complex ER-UPR network may restore proteostasis and ER function or, if stress cannot be solved, commit cells to apoptosis. Due to these alternative outcomes (survival or death), the pharmacological manipulation of ER-UPR has become the focus of potential therapies in many human diseases, including tauopathies. Here we update and analyze the experimental data from human brain, cellular, and animal models linking tau accumulation and ER-UPR.

We used Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis (PCA) to determine changes in the quantity and quality of the cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients at three different stages of the disease (ADI, ADII, and ADIII), as well as from patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Moreover, based on the FTIR spectra, we calculated the ratio of Œ±-helix and Œ≤-sheet secondary protein structures as well as the lipid-protein balance as potential AD markers. The FTIR spectra of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from MCI, ADI, ADII, and ADIII patients showed that peaks corresponding to protein and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and phospholipid and lipid vibrations were shifted in comparison with those of control subjects. Furthermore, the levels of these chemical compounds were lower in the patients than in the control subjects. The Œ≤-sheet secondary protein structure levels were increased in the MCI and AD patients compared with the control subjects. In addition, significant changes in the lipid-protein balance were observed. Interestingly, as the disease progressed, the lipid-protein balance became further disrupted, that is, the lipid amount decreased with disease progression.

We examined differences in neuropathological diagnoses of 423 deceased participants with dementia from three ethnoracial groups (35 Black, 28 Hispanic, and 360 non-Hispanic White) evaluated at the University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center. We used novel applications of bootstrap resampling and logistic regression standardization to project neuropathological diagnostic rates for non-Hispanic Whites to minority sample characteristics to improve inference of findings. Alzheimer's disease (AD) without significant cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or other dementia-related pathologies (AD (non-mixed)) was present in 15 Black (43%), 4 Hispanic (14%), and 156 (43%) non-Hispanic Whites. CVD sufficient to contribute to dementia was confirmed in 14 Black (40%), 15 Hispanic (54%), and 101 (28%) non-Hispanic White decedents. The observed CVD prevalence of 40% in Blacks exceeded the predicted 29% [95% CI: 22%-36%]. Despite being outside the 95% confidence interval, the difference between observed and predicted was not statistically significant after bootstrap testing. Conversely, for Hispanics, the observed proportion at 54% exceeded significantly the predicted prevalence of 24% from non-Hispanic Whites [95% CI: 16%-34%], avg. p = 0.008). An identical analysis using AD (non-mixed) as the outcome predicted AD (non-mixed) in Blacks averaging 41% [95% CI: 34%-48%], nearly equal to observed prevalence. For Hispanics, however, the observed proportion at 14%, was well below predictions (mean = 42%, 95% CI: 32%-53%], avg. p = 0.008). We conclude mixed diagnoses and CVD are more common in Hispanic and Black decedents than Non-Hispanic Whites with dementia in our cohort. The increased prevalence of vascular co-morbidity may be a potential opportunity to intervene more effectively in dementia treatment of those individuals.",White Matter Hyperintensities in Alzheimer's Disease: A Lesion Probability Mapping Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775995,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 04 01,Higher white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load has been reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in different brain regions when compared to controls.

Visual dysfunction is prevalent in AD patients and correlates with the severity of cognitive defects. Importantly, alterations in eyes can be non-invasively detected. To search for early biomarkers in eyes from high risk factors of AD, we injected homocysteine (Hcy) into the rats via vena caudalis for 3, 7, and 14 days, respectively, and characterized the chronological order of the AD-like pathologies appearing in retina and the hippocampus during the progression of hyperhomocysteinemia, and their correlations with cognitive impairment. We found that administration of Hcy for 14 days, but not 3 or 7 days, induced hyperhomocysteinemia, although a gradually increased blood Hcy level was detected. In retina and/or the hippocampus, significant loss of retinal ganglion cells and stenosis of retinal arteries with the AD-like tau and amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) pathologies and memory deficit were shown only in the 14-day Hcy group. Interestingly, accumulation of Ser262 hyperphosphorylated tau (pS262-tau) but not AŒ≤ with decreased methylation of protein phosphatase-2A catalytic subunit (M-PP2Ac) and increased de-methylated PP2Ac (DM-PP2Ac) was detected in retina of the 3-day Hcy group, in which the retinal pathologies were preceded by those of the hippocampus. These findings suggest that elevated pS262-tau and DM-PP2Ac and reduced M-PP2Ac in retina may serve as surveillance biomarkers for diagnosis of the hyperhomocysteinemia-induced AD in the early stage.",Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase-B3 Risk Allele Implicated in Alzheimer's Disease Associates with Increased Odds for Brain Infarcts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775993,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 06 10,"Genome-wide association studies identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MSRB3 gene encoding Methionine Sulfoxide Reductase-B3 (MsrB3) to be associated with the risk for low hippocampal volume and late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Further, in the APP/PS1 mouse model, this is observed prior to the appearance of AD-related neuropathology (e.g., amyloid-Œ≤ plaques; AŒ≤) or cognitive impairment. In the current study, we examined whether impaired glucose tolerance also preceded AD-like changes in the triple transgenic model of AD (3xTg-AD). Glucose tolerance testing (GTT), insulin ELISAs, and insulin tolerance testing (ITT) were performed at ages prior to (1-3 months and 6-8 months old) and post-pathology (16-18 months old). Additionally, we examined for altered insulin signaling in the hippocampus. Western blots were used to evaluate the two-primary insulin signaling pathways: PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK. Since the PI3K/AKT pathway affects several downstream targets associated with metabolism (e.g., GSK3, glucose transporters), western blots were used to examine possible alterations in the expression, translocation, or activation of these targets. We found that 3xTg-AD mice display impaired glucose tolerance as early as 1 month of age, concomitant with a decrease in plasma insulin levels well prior to the detection of plaques (‚àº14 months old), aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau (‚àº18 months old), and cognitive decline (‚â•18 months old). These alterations in peripheral metabolism were seen at all time points examined. In comparison, PI3K/AKT, but not MAPK/ERK, signaling was altered in the hippocampus only in 18-20-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, a time point at which there was a reduction in GLUT3 translocation to the plasma membrane. Taken together, our results provide further evidence that disruptions in energy metabolism may represent a foundational step in the development of AD.",Smart Home Technology: A New Approach for Performance Measurements of Activities of Daily Living and Prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775978,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2019 03 18,"Functional assessment is of paramount importance when mild cognitive impairment is suspected, but common assessment tools such as questionnaires lack sensitivity.

A list of blood biomarkers has been reported but none has been validated for the Alzheimer's clinic. The changes in hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid is currently used as a tool in the clinics and for research purposes, but this method is highly invasive. Recently, we reported a non-invasive and reliable blood biomarker that correlates the increase in the ratio of heavy tau (HMWtau) and the low molecular weight tau (LMWtau) in human platelets and the decrease in the brain volume as measured by structural MRI. This molecular marker has been named Alz-tau¬Æ. Beyond the clinical trials developed with a Latin American population, the present study focuses on an evaluation of this biomarker in a Caucasian population. We examined 36 AD patients and 15 cognitively normal subjects recruited in Barcelona, Spain. Tau levels in platelets were determined by immunoreactivity and the cognitive status by using GDS and MMSE neuropsychological tests. The HMW/LMW tau ratio was statistically different between controls and AD patients. A high correlation was found between the increase in MMSE scores and HMW/LMW tau ratio. This study showed that this ratio is significantly higher in AD patients than controls.

Among the elderly, AD shortens life expectancy, results in disability, decreases quality of life, and ultimately, leads to institutionalization. Despite extensive research in the last few decades, its heterogeneous pathophysiology and etiopathogenesis have made it difficult to develop an effective treatment and prevention strategy. Aging is the biggest risk factor for AD and evidence suggest that the total number of older people in the population is going to increase astronomically in the next decades. Also, there is evidence that air pollution and increasing income inequality may result in higher incidence and prevalence of AD. This makes the need for a comprehensive understanding of the etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease extremely critical. In this paper, a quintuple framework of thyroid dysfunction, vitamin D deficiency, sex hormones, and mitochondria dysfunction and oxidative stress are used to provide a comprehensive description of AD etiopathogenesis and pathophysiology.

Using whole-genome genetic data we identify 64 nuclear loci associated with expression levels of 14 genes encoded in the mitochondrial genome, including missense variants within genes involved in mitochondrial function (TBRG4, MTPAP and LONP1), implicating genetic mechanisms that act in trans across the two genomes. We replicate ~21% of associations with independent tissue-matched datasets and find genetic variants linked to these nuclear loci that are associated with cardio-metabolic phenotypes and Vitiligo, supporting a potential role for variable mitochondrial-encoded gene expression in complex disease.",Mitochondrial biogenesis is transcriptionally repressed in lysosomal lipid storage diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775969,eLife,2019 03 05,"Perturbations in mitochondrial function and homeostasis are pervasive in lysosomal storage diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report a transcriptional program that represses mitochondrial biogenesis and function in lysosomal storage diseases Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASM), in patient cells and mouse tissues. This mechanism is mediated by the transcription factors KLF2 and ETV1, which are both induced in NPC and ASM patient cells. Mitochondrial biogenesis and function defects in these cells are rescued by the silencing of KLF2 or ETV1. Increased ETV1 expression is regulated by KLF2, while the increase of KLF2 protein levels in NPC and ASM stems from impaired signaling downstream sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), which normally represses KLF2. In patient cells, S1PR1 is barely detectable at the plasma membrane and thus unable to repress KLF2. This manuscript provides a mechanistic pathway for the prevalent mitochondrial defects in lysosomal storage diseases."

The effects of the RuIII(edta) concentration, reaction temperature, initial solution pH, oxygen concentration, inlet NO concentration, and liquid-to-gas ratio on denitration performance were examined. The results indicated that RuIII(edta) showed excellent denitration performance at low concentrations and that an increase in the concentration of RuIII(edta) resulted in an increase in NO removal efficiency. In addition, NO removal efficiency increased to its optimum value at first and then declined as both the reaction temperature and initial solution pH rose. The optimal reaction temperature and ideal initial solution pH were determined to be 45¬∞C and 5.0 respectively. The suitable liquid-to-gas ratio was found to be 51.5‚ÄÖL/m3. NO removal efficiency was less affected by the oxygen concentration in the range of 0-12% due to a superior anti-oxidation performance at pH‚Äâ=‚Äâ5.0. Furthermore, the NO removal efficiency decreased significantly as the inlet NO concentration increased. The addition of 5‚ÄÖwt% urea to an aqueous solution of RuIII(edta) enhanced denitration performance, and an RuIII(edta) and urea mixed solution were able to exceed 65.07% NO removal efficiency within 30‚ÄÖmin under optimal experimental conditions.

Safe and reliable operation of a system depends mainly on its key component, 'the human'. Human error is pivotal in an accident sequence and the rate of error is instrumental in the analysis of accidents which focuses on the development of interventions. However, assessing the rate of human error is a big challenge. Human performance and the rate of error are governed by the context of work. This study discusses a fuzzy rule-based causal relational mapping approach to investigate the variability of the human error rate with context. Different contexts are mapped onto the human error rate estimated from the reported accident cases. This mapping develops a causal relational diagram which can be used for predicting the human error rate in any context. Such information is useful to identify problems of areas and to develop safety countermeasures.",When Daddy Stalks Mommy: Experiences of Intimate Partner Stalking and Involvement of Social and Legal Authorities When Stalker and Victim Have Children Together.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775953,Violence against women,2019 02 18,"This study examined intimate partner stalking experienced by 196 mothers stalked by the father of their children. Respondents completed a questionnaire concerning experiences of stalking and level of support by the authorities. Results revealed higher rates of harassing than violent stalking. In many cases, the children were also targeted by the stalking. Encounters with several agencies were common, but respondents were often not recognized as victims of stalking and demoralized by extensive case proceedings. This study calls for a special sensitivity of professionals encountering stalked parents in their work and highlights a need for coordination and cooperation among multiple agencies.",Transient heat transfer in dental implants for thermal necrosis-aided implant removal: A 3D finite element analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775952,The Journal of oral implantology,2019 02 18,"Removal of osseointegrated but otherwise failed (mechanical failure, mispositioning, aesthetics, etc.) dental implants is a traumatic process resulting in loss of healthy bone and complicating the treatment process. The traumatic effects of implant removal can be reduced by weakening the implant-bone attachment. Thermal necrosis-aided implant removal has been proposed as a minimally invasive method towards this end. In this method; an electrocautery tip is contacted to the implant to increase the temperature to 47oC and generate a limited and controlled thermal necrosis at the bone-implant interface. So far, no controlled studies have been performed to investigate the optimal clinical parameters for this method. In this study, we aimed to investigate, using Finite Element Analysis method, the optimal settings to achieve intentional thermal necrosis on three implant systems, at 5W and 40W device power and with different size tips. The temperature increase of the implants at 40W power was very sudden (<0.5 seconds) and as the bone reached 47oC, the implants were at unacceptable temperatures. At 5W power, temperature increase of the implants happened at manageable durations (< 1 second). Moreover, the temperature increase was even slower with larger implants and larger tips sizes. Therefore, low power settings must be used for thermal necrosis-aided implant removal. Also, the size of the implant and the tip must be taken into consideration in deciding the duration of contact with the electrocautery tip and the implant.",Influence of Survivors' Entrapment Factors and Traffickers' Characteristics on Perceptions of Interpersonal Social Power During Exit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775951,Violence against women,2019 02 18,"Typically examined in terms of understanding vulnerabilities to and the scope of human trafficking, not much is understood about interpersonal dynamics in human trafficking experiences. This article explores human trafficking victims' ( n = 31, female, international) perceptions of traffickers' interpersonal social power during the exiting phase of the trafficking experience. Findings from this study revealed that entrapment factors and shared common characteristics between victim and trafficker prior to trafficking influenced perceptions of interpersonal social power. Understanding victims' perceptions of interpersonal social power is critical to developing trauma-informed targeted services for exiting assistance and aftercare services for this population.",Is Exploitation Competition Involved in a Multitrophic Strategy for the Biocontrol of Fusarium Head Blight?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775950,Phytopathology,2019 04 10,"Trichoderma gamsii T6085 was used in combination with a Fusarium oxysporum isolate (7121) in order to evaluate, in a multitrophic approach, their competitive ability against F. graminearum, one of the main causal agents of Fusarium head blight (FHB) on wheat. The two antagonists and the pathogen were coinoculated on two different natural substrates, wheat and rice kernels. Both T6085 and 7121, alone and coinoculated, significantly reduced the substrate colonization and mycotoxin production by the pathogen. The two antagonists did not affect each other. Using a metabolic approach (Biolog), we investigated whether exploitation competition could explain this antagonistic activity. The aim was to define whether the three fungi coexist or if one isolate nutritionally dominates another. Results obtained from Biolog suggest that no exploitative competition occurs between the antagonists and the pathogen during the colonization of the natural substrates. Interference competition was then preliminarily evaluated to justify the reduction in the pathogen's growth and to better explain mechanisms. A significant reduction of F. graminearum growth was observed when the pathogen grew in the cultural filtrates of T. gamsii T6085, both alone and cocultured with F. oxysporum 7121, thus suggesting the involvement of secondary metabolites. As far as we know, this is the first time that an ecological study has been performed to explain how and which kind of competition could be involved in a multitrophic biocontrol of FHB.",Gene and protein expression profiles of JAK-STAT signalling pathway in the developing brain of the Ts1Cje down syndrome mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775947,The International journal of neuroscience,2019 02 22,"The JAK-STAT signalling pathway is one of the key regulators of pro-gliogenesis process during brain development.

New treatments for AML have recently been introduced, including a chemotherapy formulation called CPX-351, which is administered via less time-intensive IV infusion than the standard ""7‚Äâ+‚Äâ3"" continuous infusion regimen of cytarabine plus an anthracycline. The purpose of this study was to estimate utilities that could be used in economic modeling of AML treatment. Materials and methods: In time trade-off interviews, participants from the UK general population valued 12 health states drafted based on literature and clinician interviews. To identify disutility associated with chemotherapy, two types of induction and four types of consolidation were added to an otherwise identical health state describing AML. The decrease in utility when adding these chemotherapy regimens represents the disutility of each regimen. Five additional health states were valued to estimate utilities associated with other AML treatments. Results: Two hundred participants completed interviews. Mean (SD) utilities were 0.55 (0.31) for pre-treatment AML and 0.66 (0.29) for AML in temporary remission. Adding any chemotherapy significantly decreased utility (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001). Induction had a mean disutility of -0.11 with CPX-351 and -0.15 with 7‚Äâ+‚Äâ3. Mean disutility for consolidation ranged from -0.03 with outpatient CPX-351 to -0.11 with inpatient 5‚Äâ+‚Äâ2. Utilities are also reported for other AML treatments (e.g. transplant, low-intensity chemotherapy). Limitations: One limitation is that the differences in adverse event profiles between the treatment regimens were based on clinician opinion. Future use of CPX-351 in clinical trials or clinical settings will provide additional information on its adverse event profile. Conclusions: While all chemotherapy regimens were associated with disutility, regimens with shorter hospitalization and less time-intensive infusion were generally perceived as preferable. These utilities may be useful in cost-utility models comparing the value of AML treatments."

PDMS microchannels were used to investigate the transition from mesenchymal to amoeboid invasion in cancer cells. Migration was faster in narrow 3 Œºm-wide channels than in wider 10 Œºm channels, even in the absence of cell-binding ECM proteins. Cells permeating narrow channels exhibited blebbing and had smooth leading edge profiles, suggesting an ECM-induced transition from mesenchymal invasion to amoeboid invasion. Live cell labeling revealed a mechanosensing period in which the cell attempts mesenchymal-based migration, reorganizes its cytoskeleton, and proceeds using an amoeboid phenotype. Rho/ROCK (amoeboid) and Rac (mesenchymal) pathway inhibition revealed that amoeboid invasion through confined environments relies on both pathways in a time- and ECM-dependent manner. This demonstrates that cancer cells can dynamically modify their invasion programming to navigate physically confining matrix conditions.",Room Temperature Deoxyfluorination of Benzaldehydes and Œ±-Ketoesters with Sulfuryl Fluoride and Tetramethylammonium Fluoride.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30775926,Organic letters,2019 06 03,"A method for the room temperature deoxyfluorination of benzaldehydes and Œ±-ketoesters using sulfuryl fluoride and Me4NF is described.

The new force field has been validated by applying it to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the ionization of different electrolytes in water and comparison of the results with experimental observations and thermodynamics. Radial distribution functions (RDF) determined for most of the atom pairs (cation or anion with oxygen and hydrogen of water) show a good agreement with the RDF values obtained from DFT calculations.
