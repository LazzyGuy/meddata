We evaluated the hemodynamic effects of single intragastric doses of purple carrot (Daucus carota L.) anthocyanin (PCA) and two monomeric anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-O-glycoside (C3G) and delphinidin 3-O-ruthenoside (D3R). PCA, C3G, or D3R was administered orally to rat and blood flow in the cremaster artery was measured for 60 min using a laser Doppler blood flow meter. After measurements, the aorta of the animal was removed and the extent of phosphorylation of aortic epithelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and Akt were determined by western blotting. PCA (10 mg kg-1) or C3G (1 mg kg-1) significantly increased rat cremaster arteriole blood flow and phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt; D3G (1 mg kg-1) only slightly altered cremaster arteriole blood flow and did not affect the phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in the aorta. These results suggest that hemodynamic alterations depend more on the chemical structure of anthocyanins, particularly the aglycon, than on the glycoside. In addition, increase of blood flow by a single oral dose of PCA was practically reduced with treatment of carvedilol (CR), a non-specific adrenaline blocker. Blood concentrations of cyanidin or its glycoside 15, 30, or 60 min after the administration of 10 mg kg-1 PCA were below the limit of detection. These hemodynamic changes may have been associated with an indirect adrenergic action induced following a single dose of PCA.",Glycemic effects following the consumption of mixed soy protein isolate and alginate beverages in healthy adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848259,Food & function,2019 03 20,"This study examined whether the consumption of beverages containing mixed soy protein isolate (SPI) and fiber, alginate (ALG), would affect postprandial glucose and insulin responses or appetite in healthy adults. Following an overnight fast, twelve healthy subjects were asked to consume six standardized breakfast beverages in a randomized order: a 122 kcal sugar beverage (CONT), a 122 kcal sugar beverage with ALG, a 172 kcal sugar beverage with SPI at pH 7 (SPI-7) or 6 (SPI-6), and a 172 kcal sugar beverage with mixed SPI and alginate at pH 7 (SPI + ALG-7) or 6 (SPI + ALG-6). Subjects consumed one of the beverages at time 0. Blood samples were drawn at -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min and questionnaires were completed immediately following the blood drawing at each time point. The results showed that, compared to CONT, the consumption of SPI-7, SPI-6, SPI + ALG-7 and SPI + ALG-6 significantly lowered (P < 0.05) the peak plasma glucose concentration (33.4%, 36.3%, 53.2%, and 58.5%, respectively), 120 min incremental area under the curve (AUC), and peak insulin concentration. SPI + ALG-6 and SPI + ALG-7 exhibited a significant reduction in the peak glucose concentration compared to SPI without alginate (P < 0.05). No significant effect on appetite was found in any conditions. Electrostatic interactions between the protein and alginate during digestion and formation of intragastric gel could play an important role in influencing the postprandial glucose response. This study indicates that the consumption of mixed SPI and ALG beverages was the most effective in attenuating the postprandial glycemic excursion in healthy adult subjects.","Inhouse workflow for single-stage, indirect restorations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848258,International journal of computerized dentistry,2019 04 22,"The digital inhouse workflow consists of the components optical impression, computer-aided design (CAD) and machine manufacturing. In the sense of a time-optimized workflow, coordinated, closed systems prove to be the better solution. The company 3Shape (Copenhagen, Denmark) started with the existing Trios Intraoral Scanner and added both the software component Trios Design Studio and a number of 'trusted connection mills.' In combination with a collection of 'trusted materials,' a fast workflow with high clinical safety can ultimately be guaranteed. In order for a single-stage in-house restoration to be successfully completed, it is advisable to carry out thorough diagnostics and pretreatment; prepare the restoration by machine with a clear representation of the margin lines; organise the manufacturing process in a competent manner; and use an adhesive, target-oriented fastening strategy. Individual sections of the workflow can be delegated to specially and comprehensively trained medical staff. The increasing networking of digital processes creates very useful synergy effects such as the visualization of possible therapy results, follow-up, smile design, and the planning of implant restorations. A clinical case of a single-stage, in-house restoration with three posterior crowns is presented.",A chairside concept for increasing the vertical dimension of occlusion in the maxilla and mandible.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848257,International journal of computerized dentistry,2019 04 22,"An entirely digital concept has previously been proposed for the reconstruction of the occlusal plane in the case of wear-induced loss of the vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO). The concept, however, calls for a face scan. Since this technology is less frequently available than a facebow, the concept discussed in this article proposes a combination of analog and digital techniques. It takes into account the problem of redefining the occlusal plane in the case of occlusal alteration, and tries to avoid a situation where the chairside digital design of the occlusal surfaces is performed without any anatomical references. Such a situation poses a significant risk if the treatment indication for bite elevation exists in both the maxilla and the mandible.",Welcome to Cerec Primescan AC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848256,International journal of computerized dentistry,2019 04 22,"This article introduces and evaluates Dentsply Sirona's new intraoral scanner Cerec Primescan AC and Cerec 5 software.

Such systemic infections are usually severe and frequently life-threatening despite intensive care, in particular during the age of antibiotic resistance. Because of its position at the interface between the blood and the rest of the organism, the endothelium plays a central role during these infections. Using several examples of systemic infections, we explore the diversity of interactions between pathogens and the endothelium. These examples reveal that bacterial pathogens target specific vascular beds and affect most aspects of endothelial cell biology, ranging from cellular junction stability to endothelial cell proliferation and inflammation.",Interaction between Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens and Host Cell Mitochondria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848238,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 12,"Mitochondria are essential and highly dynamic organelles whose morphology is determined by a steady-state balance between fusion and fission. Mitochondrial morphology and function are tightly connected. Because they are involved in many important cellular processes, including energy production, cell-autonomous immunity, and apoptosis, mitochondria present an attractive target for pathogens. Here, we explore the relationship between host cell mitochondria and intracellular bacteria, with a focus on mitochondrial morphology and function, as well as apoptosis. Modulation of apoptosis can allow bacteria to establish their replicative niche or support bacterial dissemination. Furthermore, bacteria can manipulate mitochondrial morphology and function through secreted effector proteins and can also contribute to the establishment of a successful infection, e.g., by favoring access to nutrients and/or evasion of the immune system.",Type I Secretion Systems-One Mechanism for All?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848237,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 12,"Type I secretion systems (T1SS) are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, especially in pathogenic bacteria, and they secrete adhesins, iron-scavenger proteins, lipases, proteases, or pore-forming toxins in the unfolded state in one step across two membranes without any periplasmic intermediate into the extracellular space. The substrates of T1SS are in general characterized by a C-terminal secretion sequence and nonapeptide repeats, so-called GG repeats, located N terminal to the secretion sequence. These GG repeats bind Ca2+ ions in the extracellular space, which triggers folding of the entire protein. Here we summarize our current knowledge of how Gram-negative bacteria secrete these substrates, which can possess a molecular mass of up to 1,500 kDa. We also describe recent findings that demonstrate that the absence of periplasmic intermediates, the ""classic"" mode of action, does not hold true for all T1SS and that we are beginning to realize modifications of a common theme.",Make It a Sweet Home: Responses of Chlamydia trachomatis to the Challenges of an Intravacuolar Lifestyle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848236,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 12,"Intravacuolar development has been adopted by several bacteria that grow inside a host cell. Remaining in a vacuole, as opposed to breaching the cytosol, protects the bacteria from some aspects of the cytosolic innate host defense and allows them to build an environment perfectly adapted to their needs. However, this raises new challenges: the host resources are separated from the bacteria by a lipid bilayer that is nonpermeable to most nutrients. In addition, the area of this lipid bilayer needs to expand to accommodate bacterial multiplication. This requires building material and energy that are not directly invested in bacterial growth. This article describes the strategies acquired by the obligate intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis to circumvent the difficulties raised by an intravacuolar lifestyle. We start with an overview of the origin and composition of the vacuolar membrane. Acquisition of host resources is largely, although not exclusively, mediated by interactions with membranous compartments of the eukaryotic cell, and we describe how the inclusion modifies the architecture of the cell and distribution of the neighboring compartments. The second part of this review describes the four mechanisms characterized so far by which the bacteria acquire resources from the host: (i) transport/diffusion across the vacuole membrane, (ii) fusion of this membrane with host compartments, (iii) direct transfer of lipids at membrane contact sites, and (iv) engulfment by the vacuole membrane of large cytoplasmic entities.",Enterococcal Genetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848235,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 12,"The study of the genetics of enterococci has focused heavily on mobile genetic elements present in these organisms, the complex regulatory circuits used to control their mobility, and the antibiotic resistance genes they frequently carry. Recently, more focus has been placed on the regulation of genes involved in the virulence of the opportunistic pathogenic species Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Little information is available concerning fundamental aspects of DNA replication, partition, and division; this article begins with a brief overview of what little is known about these issues, primarily by comparison with better-studied model organisms. A variety of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms of regulation of gene expression are then discussed, including a section on the genetics and regulation of vancomycin resistance in enterococci. The article then provides extensive coverage of the pheromone-responsive conjugation plasmids, including sections on regulation of the pheromone response, the conjugative apparatus, and replication and stable inheritance. The article then focuses on conjugative transposons, now referred to as integrated, conjugative elements, or ICEs, and concludes with several smaller sections covering emerging areas of interest concerning the enterococcal mobilome, including nonpheromone plasmids of particular interest, toxin-antitoxin systems, pathogenicity islands, bacteriophages, and genome defense.",The Intracellular Life Cycle of Brucella spp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848234,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 12,"Bacteria of the genus Brucella colonize a wide variety of mammalian hosts, in which their infectious cycle and ability to cause disease predominantly rely on an intracellular lifestyle within phagocytes. Upon entry into host cells, Brucella organisms undergo a complex, multistage intracellular cycle in which they sequentially traffic through, and exploit functions of, the endocytic, secretory, and autophagic compartments via type IV secretion system (T4SS)-mediated delivery of bacterial effectors. These effectors modulate an array of host functions and machineries to first promote conversion of the initial endosome-like Brucella-containing vacuole (eBCV) into a replication-permissive organelle derived from the host endoplasmic reticulum (rBCV) and then to an autophagy-related vacuole (aBCV) that mediates bacterial egress. Here we detail and discuss our current knowledge of cellular and molecular events of the Brucella intracellular cycle. We discuss the importance of the endosomal stage in determining T4SS competency, the roles of autophagy in rBCV biogenesis and aBCV formation, and T4SS-driven mechanisms of modulation of host secretory traffic in rBCV biogenesis and bacterial egress.",New Age Strategies To Reconstruct Mucosal Tissue Colonization and Growth in Cell Culture Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848233,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 12,"Over the past few decades, in vitro cell culture systems have greatly expanded our understanding of host-pathogen interactions. However, studies using these models have been limited by the fact that they lack the complexity of the human body. Therefore, recent efforts that allow tissue architecture to be mimicked during in vitro culture have included the development of methods and technology that incorporate tissue structure, cellular composition, and efficient long-term culture. These advances have opened the door for the study of pathogens that previously could not be cultured and for the study of pathophysiological properties of infection that could not be easily elucidated using traditional culture models. Here we discuss the latest studies using organoids and engineering technology that have been developed and applied to the study of host-pathogen interactions in mucosal tissues.",Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Bacterial Fitness within the Host Macrophage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848232,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 13,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis has evolved to become the single greatest cause of death from an infectious agent. The pathogen spends most of its infection cycle in its human host within a phagocyte. The bacterium has evolved to block the normal maturation and acidification of its phagosome and resides in a vacuole contiguous with the early endosomal network. Cytokine-mediated activation of the host cell can overcome this blockage, and an array of antimicrobial responses can limit its survival. The survival of M. tuberculosis in its host cell is fueled predominantly by fatty acids and cholesterol. The ability of M. tuberculosis to degrade sterols is an unusual metabolic characteristic that was likely retained from a saprophytic ancestor. Recent results with fluorescent M. tuberculosis reporter strains demonstrate that bacterial survival differs with the host macrophage population. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages, which are biased towards an alternatively activated, M2-like phenotype, are more permissive to bacterial growth than monocyte-derived, inflammatory, M1-like interstitial macrophages. The differential growth of the bacterium in these different phagocyte populations appears to be linked to host cell metabolism.",Recognition of Intracellular Bacteria by Inflammasomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848231,Microbiology spectrum,2019 04 12,"Inflammasomes are multiprotein signaling complexes that are assembled by cytosolic sensors upon the detection of infectious or noxious stimuli.

In this article, we review how to best assess the safety parameters of new IBD medications, from the earliest stage of development to population-based registries, with a focus on the special populations often excluded from the evaluation process.",Anti-adhesion Molecules in IBD: Does Gut Selectivity Really Make the Difference?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848193,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 06 13,"Inflammatory Bowel Disease is lifetime chronic progressive inflammatory disease. A considerable portion of patients, do not respond or lose response or experience side effect to ""traditional"" biological treatment such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agents. The concept that the blockade of T cell traffic to the gut controls inflammation has stimulated the development of new drugs which selectively targets molecules involved in controlling cell homing to the intestine. The result is the reduction of the chronic inflammatory infiltration in the gut. In this regard, anti-adhesion molecules represent a new class of drugs for patients who don't respond or lose response to traditional therapy. Moreover, some of these molecules such as vedolizumab, offer the advantage to target the delivery of a drug to the gut (gut selectivity) which could increase clinical efficacy and limit potential adverse events. In this article, we will give an overview of the current data on anti-adhesion molecules in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.",Anti-fibrotic Drugs for Crohn's Disease: Ready for Prime Time?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848192,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 06 13,"Intestinal fibrosis, driven by chronic inflammation in Crohn's disease, can be defined as an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the affected gut segment ultimately leading to an impaired wound healing and cumulative tissue damage, possibly resulting in organ dysfunction, formation of stenotic lesions and necessity of surgical intervention. Despite continuous advances in developing novel treatment modalities targeting different pathways to control chronic gut inflammation in CD, no effective anti-fibrotic agents have been released, to date. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying intestinal fibrosis is key to move this area of investigation forward.",Particularities of IBD Trials in Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848191,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 06 13,"Pediatric inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are similar to the adult-onset type in many aspects, including the necessity of high-quality randomized controlled trials. However, recruiting children into clinical trials is conceptually more challenging than in adults. Furthermore, the long delay between adult and pediatric approval of new drugs leads not only to the unbearable extensive use of these drugs as off-label without appropriate dosing and safety data but also to more challenges when eventually the pediatric trial is performed. This review offers possible solutions to age-specific pitfalls in performing trials in pediatric IBD. Many of the challenges could be adequately addressed by accepting full extrapolation of efficacy from adult trials. This is advisable if small pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) studies show similarity to adult data. Then, pediatric trials can focus on dosing and safety while avoiding the controversial use of placebo. Judicious use of non-invasive activity scores and biomarkers, providing immediate and effective treatment in active disease and ensuring equipoise of treatments both within and outside the trial are the mainstay of a feasible trial in children. The recent trend of including adolescents in adult phase-3 trials addresses some obstacles but introduces others. Acknowledging and addressing these age-specific challenges would facilitate pediatric drug development in IBD.",Evaluation of Local Injection of Bevacizumab against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Xenograft Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848190,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 03 08,"Bevacizumab (BVZ) is a recombinant humanized antibody that inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and used for the treatment of various types of cancer.

Therefore, the present study was to evaluate the effect of local delivery of BVZ against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenograft tumors.",Cyclodextrins As Carriers In Targeted Delivery Of Therapeutic Agents: Focused Review On Traditional And Inimitable Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848189,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 03 08,"The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive review on the application of cyclodextrin complexation in the delivery of drugs, bioactive molecules or macromolecules, with more emphasis on targeted drug delivery. Classically the cyclodextrins have been considered only as a means of improving the solubility of drugs; however many attempts have been made to use cyclodextrins as drug delivery carriers. The cyclodextrin surface can be modified with various ligands for active targeting of drugs. Also, it can be passively targeted through various triggering mechanisms like thermal, magnetic, pH dependent, light dependent, ultrasound, etc. A comprehensive literature review has been done in the area of drug delivery using cyclodextrins. Applications of inclusion complexes in the drug delivery through various routes with examples are discussed. This review focuses on receptor mediated active targeting as well as stimuli responsive passive targeting of drugs/genes by using cyclodextrins.

Part C, Methods",2019 04 16,"Despite recent studies on media additives, the low viability and dysplastic features of terminally mature erythroid cells are still major problems in enhancing erythroid cell yields in vitro. Moreover, research on enhancing terminal erythropoiesis has been focused on the immature stage of erythroid cells such as burst forming unit-erythroid and colony forming unit-erythroid. Here, we tested many commercially available serum-free culture media and developed a superior culture media formulation compared with the conventional control for higher expansion-fold, higher viability, and therefore enhanced red cell productivity. The addition of the specific medium to the previously known best media at a specific ratio, whose effects were not dose-dependent, enabled the generation of significantly higher erythrocyte products with over 1.3 million-fold proliferation of erythroid cells after maintenance for 21 days throughout the maturation stages from CD34+ cells. The cells cultured in this condition expressed maturation markers and were significantly superior in differentiation and enucleation. Comparative mRNA profiling revealed that erythroid cells in this medium showed more efficient maturation in mRNA levels. The cultured cells showed comparable erythroblast survival and also restored better red blood cell (RBC) functions of oxygen saturation profile with expression of adult globin up to 99%. However, to develop chemically defined media, the well-known supplements including hormones, cytokines, and serum-replacement reagents were not sufficient to replace the optimized media in producing mature RBCs. Taken together, our optimized medium formulation under serum-free culture conditions produced the best reproducible results on productivity and maturation in erythroid cells with economic benefits. These culture conditions may thus serve as a useful platform for further investigation of in vitro erythropoiesis and to develop defined serum-free media for clinical trials.",Efficacy of Human Cell-seeded Muscle-Stuffed Vein Conduit in Rat Sciatic Nerve Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848172,Tissue engineering. Part A,2019 03 08,"We investigated the efficacy of a muscle-stuffed vein seeded with neural-transdifferentiated human mesenchymal stem cells as an alternative nerve conduit to repair a 15-mm sciatic nerve defect in athymic rats.Other rats received either muscle-stuffed vein conduit alone, commercial polyglycolic acid conduit (Neurotube®), reverse autograft or were left untreated. Motor and sensory functions as well as nerve conductivity were evaluated for 12 weeks, after which the grafts were harvested for histological analyses. All rats in the treatment groups demonstrated a progressive increase in the mean Sciatic Functional Index (motor function) and nerve conduction amplitude (electrophysiological function); and showed positive withdrawal reflex (sensory function) by the 10th week of post-implantation. Autotomy, which is associated with neuropathic pain, was severe in rats treated with conduit without cells; there was mild or no autotomy in the rats of other groups. Histologically, harvested grafts from all except the untreated groups exhibited axonal regeneration with the presence of mature myelinated axons. In conclusion, treatment with muscle-stuffed vein conduit is comparable to that of other treatment groups in supporting functional recovery following sciatic nerve injury; and the addition of cells in the conduit alleviates neuropathic pain.",Short Review: Genomic Alterations in Hürthle Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848171,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,2019 04 09,"Hürthle cell tumors (HCT), including Hürthle cell adenomas (HCA) and Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCCs), arise in the thyroid gland and are defined in part by an accumulation of mitochondria. These neoplasms were long considered a subtype of follicular neoplasm, although HCT is now generally considered a distinct entity. HCTs exhibit overlapping but distinct clinical features compared to follicular tumors, and several studies have demonstrated that HCTs harbor distinct genomic alterations compared to other forms of thyroid cancer. Two studies recently reported the most complete characterization of the HCC genome to date. These studies assessed complementary cohorts of HCC specimens. The study by Ganly et al. consisted of a large panel of primary HCCs, including 32 widely invasive and 24 minimally invasive primary tumors. Exome and RNA sequencing of material isolated from fresh-frozen tumor specimens was performed. The study by Gopal et al. utilized exome and targeted sequencing to characterize the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of 32 primary tumors and 38 resected regional and distant metastases using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.

Macaca fascicularis monkeys from Mauritius have a low genetic diversity and are particularly useful for reproducible drug testing. In particular, they have a genetically homogeneous class I major histocompatibility complex system that probably mitigates the variability of the response to simian immunodeficiency virus infection. However, the transduction of simian cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-derived vectors is inefficient due to capsid-specific restriction factors, such as the tripartite motif-containing protein tripartite motif 5α, which prevent infection with non-host-adapted retroviruses. This study introduced the modified capsid of the macaque-trophic HIV-1 clone MN4/LSQD into the packaging system and compared transduction efficiencies between hematopoietic cells transduced with this construct and cells transduced with HIV-1 NL4-3-derived packaging constructs. Capsid modification increased transduction efficiency in all hematopoietic cells tested (by factors of up to 10), including hematopoietic progenitor cells, repopulating cells, and T cells from Mauritian Macaca fascicularis, regardless of vector structure or purification method. The study also established culture conditions similar to those used in clinical practice for the efficient transduction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor CD34+ cells. These results suggest that the procedure is suitable for use in Mauritian Macaca fascicularis, which can therefore be used as a model in preclinical studies for hematopoietic gene and cell therapy.",Modulated Protein Delivery to Engineer Tissue Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848169,Tissue engineering.

Cationized gelatin nanospheres incorporating MB (cGNSMB) with different degradabilities and a cationized gelatin-MB complex were prepared. The intracellular fluorescence of cGNSMB was observed over 14 days, whereas that of complex disappeared within 5 days. This is because the intracellular decrease of cGNSMB was slower than that of complex. It is concluded that the intracellular controlled release of MB is promising, to achieve long-term and continuous visualization of mRNA."

A significant reduction was noted in sperm concentration, progressive motility, morphology and DNA integrity in both Cd- and Cd-Q10 groups in comparison to control indicating Cd-induced testicular lipid per oxidation (LPO) and decline in indigenous antioxidant defense system as measured by total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (p<0.05). However, simultaneous co-administration of CoQ10 along with Cd (Cd-Q10 group) was able to improve sperm concentration, motility, progressive motility, morphology, DNA integrity, and testicular TAC as well as lower LPO compared to Cd group (p<0.05).

The intestinal tract is covered by a mucus layer mainly comprised by highly glycosylated proteins called mucins. Mucins regulate pathogen adhesion, growth, and virulence, and the glycans are vital for these functions. We analyzed intestinal mucin O-glycans on mucins from control and full-fat extruded soy-bean-fed (known to cause enteritis) Arctic charr using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 56 glycans were identified on Arctic charr intestinal mucins, with a high prevalence of core-5-type and sialylated O-glycans. Disialic-acid-epitope-containing structures including NeuAcα2,8NeuAc, NeuAc(Gc)α2,8NeuGc(Ac), and NeuGcα2,8NeuGc were the hallmark of Arctic charr intestinal mucin glycosylation. Arctic charr fed with soy bean meal diet had lower (i) number of structures detected, (ii) interindividual variation, and (iii) N-glycolylneuraminic-acid-containing glycans compared with control Arctic charr. Furthermore, Aeromonas salmonicida grew less in response to mucins from inflamed Arctic charr than from the control group. The Arctic charr glycan repertoire differed from that of Atlantic salmon. In conclusion, the loss of N-glycolylneuraminic acid may be a biomarker for inflammation in Arctic char, and inflammation-induced glycosylation changes affect host-pathogen interactions.",Diselenide Bonds as an Alternative to Outperform the Efficiency of Disulfides in Self-Healing Materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848131,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,"Self-healing materials are a very promising kind of materials due to their capacity to repair themselves. Among others, dichalcogenide-based materials are widely studied due to their dynamic covalent bond nature. Recently, the reaction mechanism occurring in these materials was characterized both theoretically and experimentally. In this vein, a theoretical protocol was established in order to predict further improvements. Among these improvements, the use of diselenides instead of disulfides appears to be one of the paths to enhance these properties. Nevertheless, the physicochemical aspects of these improvements are not completely clear. In this work, the self-healing properties of several disulfides, diselenides, and mixed S-Se materials have been considered by means of computational simulations. Among all the tested species, diphenyl diselenide based materials appear to be the most promising ones due to the decrease on the reaction barriers, instead of weaker diselenide bonds, as thought up to now. Moreover, the radical formation needed in this process would also be enhanced by the fact that these species are able to absorb visible light. In this manner, at room conditions, selenyl radicals would be formed by both thermal dissociation and photodissociation. This fact, together with the lower energetic barriers needed for the diselenide exchange, makes diphenyl diselenides ideal for self-healing materials.",Sulfur-Mediated Electrophilic Cyclization of Aryl-Substituted Internal Alkynes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848130,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,"A sulfur-mediated electrophilic cyclization reaction of aryl-tethered internal alkynes has been developed.

Consequently, the capture and activation of methane is a challenging and intensively studied topic. A major research goal is to find systems that can activate methane, even at low temperatures. Here, combining ultrahigh vacuum catalytic experiments, X-ray photoemission spectra, and accurate density functional theory (DFT) based calculations, we show that small Ni clusters dispersed on the (001) surface of TiC are able to capture and dissociate methane at room temperature. Our DFT calculations reveal that two-dimensional Ni clusters are responsible for this chemical transformation, confirming that the lability of the supported clusters appears to be a critical aspect in the strong adsorption of methane. A small energy barrier of 0.18 eV is predicted for CH4 dissociation into adsorbed methyl and atomic hydrogen species. In addition, the calculated reaction free energy profile at 300 K and 1 atm of CH4 shows no effective energy barriers in the system. Comparison with other reported systems which activate methane at room temperature, including oxide and zeolite-based materials, indicates that a different chemistry takes place on our metal/carbide system. The discovery of a carbide-based surface able to activate methane at low temperatures paves the road for the design of new types of catalysts which can efficiently convert this hydrocarbon into other added-value chemicals, with implications in climate change mitigation.","Divergent Synthesis of 1,2-Benzo[ e]thiazine and Benzo[ d]thiazole Analogues Containing a S-Trifluoromethyl Sulfoximine Group: Preparation and New Properties of the Adachi Reagent.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848128,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,"We report here the preparation of unprecedented analogues of 1,2-benzothiazine and benzoisothiazole incorporating the S-trifluoromethyl sulfoximine group in their core.

However, their bioavailability and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract remain uncertain. In this study, a model of the human adenocarcinoma stomach cell line (MKN-28) was established to explore the cellular transport of flavanolic monomers and procyanidin dimer A2, which were isolated from the litchi pericarp extract. After the integrity and permeability of the cell monolayer were ensured by measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance and the apparent permeability coefficient for Lucifer yellow, the transportation of procyanidins A2 and B2, (-)-epicatechin (EC), and (+)-catechin (CC) was studied at pH 3.0, 5.0, or 7.0 in the apical side, with compound concentrations of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/mL based on the cytotoxicity test. High-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses indicated that EC, CC, and A2 were transported in the MKN-28 cell line from 30 to 180 min, while B2 showed no transport. The maximal transport efficiencies of EC, CC, and A2 were 23 ± 0.81, 13.16 ± 1.53, and 16.41 ± 1.36%, respectively, existing at 120, 180, and 120 min of transportation. Laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis presented the dynamic transmission of EC, in accordance with the result of concentration determination, suggesting that the A-type procyanidins are possibly absorbed through the stomach barrier, which is pH- and time-dependent.",Selective PQQPFPQQ Gluten Epitope Chemical Sensor with a Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Recognition Unit and an Extended-Gate Field-Effect Transistor Transduction Unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848126,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 02,"A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) recognition system was devised for selective determination of an immunogenic gluten octamer epitope, PQQPFPQQ. For that, a thin MIP film was devised, guided by density functional theory calculations, and then synthesized to become the chemosensor recognition unit. Bis(bithiophene)-based cross-linking and functional monomers were used for this synthesis. An extended-gate field-effect transistor (EG-FET) was used as the transduction unit. The EG-FET gate surface was coated with the PQQPFPQQ-templated MIP film, by electropolymerization, to result in a complete chemosensor. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of the PQQPFPQQ epitope, and its removal from the MIP film. The chemosensor selectively discriminated between the octamer analyte and another peptide of the same number of amino acids but with two of them mismatched (PQQQFPPQ). The chemosensor was validated with respect to both the PQQPFPQQ analyte and a real gluten extract from semolina flour. It was capable to determine PQQPFPQQ in the concentration range of 0.5-45 ppm with the limit of detection (LOD) = 0.11 ppm. Moreover, it was capable of determining gluten in real samples in the concentration range of 4-25 ppm with LOD = 4 ppm, which is a value sufficient for discriminating between gluten-free and non-gluten-free food products. The gluten content in semolina flour determined with the chemosensor well correlated with that determined with a commercial ELISA gluten kit. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Langmuir-Freundlich isotherms were fitted to the epitope sorption data. The sorption parameters determined from these isotherms indicated that the imprinted cavities were quite homogeneous and that the epitope analyte was chemisorbed in them.",Directed Evolution of Split APEX2 Peroxidase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848125,ACS chemical biology,2019 06 10,"APEX is an engineered peroxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of a wide range of substrates, facilitating its use in a variety of applications from subcellular staining for electron microscopy to proximity biotinylation for spatial proteomics and transcriptomics. To further advance the capabilities of APEX, we used directed evolution to engineer a split APEX tool (sAPEX). A total of 20 rounds of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based selections from yeast-displayed fragment libraries, using 3 different surface display configurations, produced a 200-amino-acid N-terminal fragment (with 9 mutations relative to APEX2) called ""AP"" and a 50-amino-acid C-terminal fragment called ""EX"". AP and EX fragments were each inactive on their own but were reconstituted to give peroxidase activity when driven together by a molecular interaction. We demonstrate sAPEX reconstitution in the mammalian cytosol, on engineered RNA motifs within a non-coding RNA scaffold, and at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact sites."

However, maximizing the oocyte yield in advanced maternal age patients with poor or suboptimal response is still a challenge. In fact, no standard treatment has been outlined yet to manage these women. Across the last years, an improved efficiency of the IVF units via blastocyst culture, vitrification and reliable embryo selection approaches paved the way to the investigation of novel unconventional stimulation protocols, like double stimulation in a single ovarian cycle (DuoStim). DuoStim, by conjugating follicular phase stimulation (FPS) and luteal phase stimulation (LPS) in the same ovarian cycle, allows to maximize the number of oocytes obtained in a short timeframe, a precious outcome when we aim at shortening time to pregnancy. In this regard, LPS seems to contribute to conventional stimulation with more oocytes with a comparable competence as FPS, retrieved per ovarian cycle. Although any stimulation protocol which exploits anovulatory waves of follicular growth needs a thorough investigation, no evidence has been produced to question the safety of DuoStim, which to date represents the most intriguing strategy to treat poor prognosis in IVF.",Ghrelin combined with sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate pretreatment reduces apoptosis and fractalkine expression induced by high-dose glucose in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848111,Minerva endocrinologica,2019 03 08,To explore the regulatory role of ghrelin combined with sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) pretreatment in cell apoptosis and fractalkine (FKN) expression of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) induced with high-dose glucose.,Measurement of the refractive index of whole blood and its components for a continuous spectral region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848110,Journal of biomedical optics,2019 05 21,"The refractive index of blood is a key biophysical parameter, which can reflect the physiological state.

The aim of the study was to improve the quality of canine chilled sperm during storage time. We therefore, evaluated the effects of eight treatments with different levels of soybean lecithin concentration (1, 3 and 5%) and egg yolk (20%) in Tris-citric-fructose or Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender on chilled canine sperm quality during 10 days of storage. The sperm motility was analysed by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA), whereas plasma membrane integrity, acrosome membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential parameters were determined using a fluorescent staining combination of propidium iodide (PI), Hoechst 33342 (H342), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Pisum sativum agglutinin (FITC-PSA) and 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) by confocal laser scanning microscope. The results showed that egg yolk was found to be better than soybean lecithin in Tris-citric-fructose or Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender for maintaining the quality of chilled canine sperm within 10 days of storage (P < 0.05). Although egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose extender could maintain the motility better than other extenders, egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender was the highest in intact plasma membrane, intact acrosome membrane and high mitochondrial membrane potential (P < 0.05). In contrast, the sperm quality of soybean lecithin in Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender was lower than that of soybean lecithin in Tris-citric-fructose extender, and soybean lecithin 1% was greater than soybean lecithin 3% and 5% in plasma membrane integrity, acrosome membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane potential (P < 0.05). In conclusion, soybean lecithin cannot replace egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose or Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extenders, and egg yolk in Tris-citric-fructose-mineral salts extender is superior to other extenders in chilling canine sperm.",Modulation of the lung inflammatory response to ozone by the estrous cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848106,Physiological reports,2019 04 16,"Emerging evidence suggests that sex differences exist in the control of lung innate immunity; however, the specific roles of sex hormones in the inflammatory response, and the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here, we investigated whether fluctuations in circulating hormone levels occurring in the mouse estrous cycle could affect the inflammatory response to air pollution exposure. For this, we exposed female mice (C57BL/6J, 8 weeks old) at different phases of the estrous cycle to 2 ppm of ozone or filtered air (FA) for 3 h. Following exposure, we collected lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), and performed lung function measurements to evaluate inflammatory responses and respiratory mechanics. We found a differential inflammatory response to ozone in females exposed in the luteal phase (metestrus, diestrus) versus the follicular phase (proestrus, estrus). Females exposed to ozone in the follicular phase had significantly higher expression of inflammatory genes, including Ccl2, Cxcl2, Ccl20, and Il6, compared to females exposed in the luteal phase (P < 0.05), and displayed differential activation of regulatory pathways. Exposure to ozone in the follicular phase also resulted in higher BAL neutrophilia, lipocalin levels, and airway resistance than exposure in the luteal phase (P < 0.05). Together, these results show that the effects of ozone exposure in the female lung are affected by the estrous cycle phase, and potentially hormonal status. Future studies investigating air pollution effects and inflammation in women should consider the menstrual cycle phase and/or circulating hormone levels.",Inhibition of N-myristoyltransferase1 affects dengue virus replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848105,MicrobiologyOpen,2019 03 08,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever, a self-limiting disease that could be fatal due to serious complications. No specific treatment is currently available and the preventative vaccine is only partially protective. To develop a potential drug target for dengue fever, we need to understand its biology and pathogenesis thoroughly. N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) is an N-terminal protein lipidation enzyme that catalyzes the covalent cotranslational attachment of fatty acids to the amino-terminal glycine residue of a number of proteins, leading to the modulation of various signaling molecules. In this study, we investigated the interaction of dengue viral proteins with host NMT and its subsequent effect on DENV. Our bioinformatics, molecular docking, and far-western blotting analyses demonstrated the interaction of viral envelope protein (E) with NMT. The gene expression of NMT was strongly elevated in a dependent manner during the viral replication phase in dendritic cells. Moreover, NMT gene silencing significantly inhibited DENV replication in dendritic cells. Further studies investigating the target cell types of other host factors are suggested.",A prospective evaluation of rivaroxaban on haemostatic parameters in apparently healthy dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848104,Veterinary medicine and science,2019 03 08,"The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of rivaroxaban (RIV) on haemostatic parameters assessed by prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and kaolin-activated thromboelastography (TEG) in apparently healthy dogs administered 1 mg kg-1 orally once daily for 1 week. Eleven dogs had a baseline complete blood count (CBC), fibrinogen, platelet count, serum chemistry profile, PT, aPTT, and TEG performed. Each dog was then administered approximately 1.0 mg kg-1 of RIV orally once daily for 1 week and the CBC, fibrinogen, platelet count, serum chemistry profile, PT, aPTT, and TEG was re-evaluated. Any side effects attributed to RIV were noted at this time. One dog was excluded due to identification of a macrocytic thrombocytopenia on pre-treatment blood work. The remaining 10 enrolled dogs completed the study. Dogs received a median dose of 1.02 mg kg-1 (range 0.94-1.17 mg kg-1 ) of RIV once daily and was associated with a significant increase in pulse, packed cell volume, total solids, platelet count, fibrinogen and a significant decrease in mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. There was no significant change in PT, aPTT or any TEG parameters. The RIV appeared well tolerated with one dog having one episode of vomiting on day 4 but otherwise no other side effects were identified clinically or on recheck blood work. The results of this study suggests that RIV at a dose of 1 mg kg-1 orally once daily is safe and well tolerated but does not cause a significant prolongation of PT, aPTT or TEG parameters.",Clinical validation of an immunohistochemistry-based CanAssist-Breast test for distant recurrence prediction in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848103,Cancer medicine,2019 06 10,"CanAssist-Breast (CAB) is an immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based prognostic test for early-stage Hormone Receptor (HR+)-positive breast cancer patients. CAB uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained algorithm which utilizes expression levels of five biomarkers (CD44, ABCC4, ABCC11, N-Cadherin, and Pan-Cadherin) and three clinical parameters such as tumor size, grade, and node status as inputs to generate a risk score and categorizes patients as low- or high-risk for distant recurrence within 5 years of diagnosis. In this study, we present clinical validation of CAB. CAB was validated using a retrospective cohort of 857 patients. All patients were treated either with endocrine therapy or chemoendocrine therapy. Risk categorization by CAB was analyzed by calculating Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) and recurrence rates using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Multivariate analysis was performed to calculate Hazard ratios (HR) for CAB high-risk vs low-risk patients. The results showed that Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) was significantly different (P-0.002) between low- (DMFS: 95%) and high-risk (DMFS: 80%) categories in the endocrine therapy treated alone subgroup (n = 195) as well as in the total cohort (n = 857, low-risk DMFS: 95%, high-risk DMFS: 84%, P < 0.0001). In addition, the segregation of the risk categories was significant (P = 0.0005) in node-positive patients, with a difference in DMFS of 12%. In multivariate analysis, CAB risk score was the most significant predictor of distant recurrence with hazard ratio of 3.2048 (P < 0.0001). CAB stratified patients into discrete risk categories with high statistical significance compared to Ki-67 and IHC4 score-based stratification. CAB stratified a higher percentage of the cohort (82%) as low-risk than IHC4 score (41.6%) and could re-stratify >74% of high Ki-67 and IHC4 score intermediate-risk zone patients into low-risk category. Overall the data suggest that CAB can effectively predict risk of distant recurrence with clear dichotomous high- or low-risk categorization."

However, this practice results in read misassignment (usually <1%) across samples sequenced on the same lane. Alarmingly high rates of read misassignment of up to 10% were reported for lllumina sequencing machines with exclusion amplification chemistry. This may make use of these platforms prohibitive, particularly in studies that rely on low-quantity and low-quality samples, such as historical and archaeological specimens. Here, we use barcodes, short sequences that are ligated to both ends of the DNA insert, to directly quantify the rate of index hopping in 100-year old museum-preserved gorilla (Gorilla beringei) samples. Correcting for multiple sources of noise, we identify on average 0.470% of reads containing a hopped index. We show that sample-specific quantity of misassigned reads depends on the number of reads that any given sample contributes to the total sequencing pool, so that samples with few sequenced reads receive the greatest proportion of misassigned reads. This particularly affects ancient DNA samples, as these frequently differ in their DNA quantity and endogenous content. Through simulations we show that even low rates of index hopping, as reported here, can lead to biases in ancient DNA studies when multiplexing samples with vastly different quantities of endogenous material.",Pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase may predict outcome of advanced non small-cell lung cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848091,Cancer medicine,2019 06 10,"The main aim of this study is to investigate whether baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is associated with the clinical outcome of non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We searched Pubmed, the Cochrane Central library and Embase for peripheral blood biomarker of LDH in advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs. We extracted the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and performed meta-analysis of HR. Pooled estimates of treatment outcomes were calculated by stata 15.1. Six studies with 1136 patients were included in this study. The pooled results of univariate analysis suggested that an elevated pretreatment LDH level was correlated with significant shorter PFS (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.27-1.83, P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.43-3.11, P < 0.001).

However, the microbial diversity and community composition of alpine lake sediments from the Hengduan Mountains remain largely unknown. Therefore, based on the Illumina MiSeq platform, high-throughput sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was performed on 15 alpine lake sediments collected at different locations in the Hengduan Mountains. The abundance-based coverage estimate (ACE), Chao1, and Shannon indices indicated that the microbial abundance and diversity of these sediments were high. There are some differences in the composition of microbial communities among sediments. However, in general, Proteobacteria accounted for the largest proportion of all sediments (22.3%-67.6%) and was the dominant phylum. Followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes. In addition, the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) interactions network had modular structures and suggested more cooperation than competition in the microbial community. Besides, we also found that temperature has a significant contribution to the sample-environment relationship. This study revealed the diversity and composition of microbial communities in alpine lake sediments from the Hengduan Mountains, and describe the correlation between microbial community structure and different environmental variables.",Pard3 suppresses glioma invasion by regulating RhoA through atypical protein kinase C/NF-κB signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848088,Cancer medicine,2019 06 10,"Partitioning defective protein 3 (Pard3) has been reported to inhibit the progression of numerous human cancer cell types. However, the role of Pard3 in glioma progression remains unclear. In this study, the expression of Pard3 was measured in human gliomas of different grades by both quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The effect of Pard3 on glioma progression was tested using cell counting kit-8 assays, EdU assays, colony formation assays, cell migration, and invasion assays and tumor xenografts. The effect of Pard3 on Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) protein levels, subcellular localization, and transcriptional activity was measured by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Our results indicate that Pard3 functions as a tumor suppressor in gliomas and that the loss of Pard3 protein is strongly associated with a higher grade and poorer outcome. Pard3 overexpression inhibits glioma progression by upregulating RhoA protein levels. However, the level of GTP-RhoA protein remained unchanged. Further evidence demonstrates that Pard3 regulates RhoA protein levels, subcellular localization and transcriptional activity by activating atypical protein kinase C/NF-κB signaling. Mouse modeling experiments show that Pard3 overexpression inhibits glioma cell growth in vivo. Taken together, these findings identify RhoA as a novel target of Pard3 in gliomas and substantiate a novel regulatory role for Pard3 in glioma progression. This study reveals that Pard3 plays an inhibitory role in gliomas by regulating RhoA, which reveals a potential benefit for Pard3 activators in the prevention and therapy of gliomas.","The internal link of serum steroid hormones levels in insomnia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease rats: Is there an effective way to distinguish among these three diseases based on potential biomarkers?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848087,Journal of separation science,2019 05 17,"Insomnia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease are all neurodegenerative diseases and are associated with the levels of steroid hormones. To investigate the internal connection and difference of steroid hormones among these three diseases and distinguish them from the perspective of biomarkers, an easy, quick, and efficient high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated to determine six steroid hormones simultaneously in rat serum. The separation was accomplished on a SHIM-PACK XR-ODS chromatographic column with 0.1% v/v formic acid and methanol as the mobile phase and the detection was performed with electrospray ionization source in the positive ion mode. Based on the concentrations of steroid hormones, all the groups could be distinguished obviously from each other by using partial least square discriminant analysis. Meanwhile, 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, and cortisol were identified as potential biomarkers and 100% of samples were classified correctly by Bayes' discriminant function. These biomarkers were further screened by one-way analysis of variance and cortisol was significantly different among all these groups. Bayes' discriminant function was also built by cortisol and the classification accuracy was 87.2%.

Little is known about the magnitude of HDP in Africa. We conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize available data on the prevalence of HDP in Africa. We did a comprehensive literature search to identify review paper published from January 1, 1996, to September 30, 2017, and searched the reference list of retrieved review paper. We used a random-effects model to estimate the overall and type-specific prevalence of HDP in Africa. We included 82 studies published between 1997 and 2017 reporting data on a pooled sample of 854 304 women during pregnancy or puerperium. Most studies were hospital-based, conducted in urban settings across 24 countries. In this population, the overall prevalence of HDP was 100.4‰ (95% CI: 81.4-121.2). The prevalence was 49.8‰ (95% CI: 32.3-70.7) for gestational hypertension, 14.7‰ (95% CI: 11.6-18.2) for chronic hypertension, 9.2‰ (95% CI: 4.2-16.0) for superimposed preeclampsia, 44.0‰ (95% CI: 36.7-52.0) for preeclampsia, 22.1‰ (95% CI: 14.8-30.8) for severe preeclampsia, 14.7‰ (95% CI: 8.1-23.2) for eclampsia and 2.2‰ (95% CI: 1.2-3.4) for HELLP syndrome. Prevalence of HDP was significantly higher in Central and Western Africa; there was a consistent tendency of increasing HDP prevalence with income at the country level. In conclusion, the burden of HDP in Africa is high, with about one in 10 pregnancies affected. The higher rate of severe forms of HDP that are associated with significant maternal and perinatal mortality is a major concern in the region.","Effect of acute respiratory illness on short-term frailty status of older adults in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand-June 2015 to June 2016: A prospective matched cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848082,Influenza and other respiratory viruses,2019 03 08,"Frailty is associated with increased risk of mortality and decline in functional status among older adults.

This is due to the synergistic integration of GOx, crystalline copper phosphates and MNPs being in close proximity within the nanoflowers. The preparation of MNP-embedded GOx-copper hybrid nanoflowers (MNPs-GOx NFs) begins with the facile conjugation of amine-functionalized MNPs with GOx molecules via electrostatic attraction, followed by the addition of copper sulfate that leads to full blooming of the hybrid nanoflowers. In the presence of glucose, the catalytic action of GOx entrapped in the nanoflowers generates H2 O2 , which is subsequently used by peroxidase-mimicking MNPs and copper phosphate crystals, located close to GOx molecules, to convert Amplex UltraRed substrate into a highly fluorescent product. Using this strategy, the target glucose is successfully determined with excellent selectivity, stability, and magnetic reusability. This biosensor based on hybrid nanoflowers also exhibits a high degree of precision and reproducibility when applied to real human blood samples.

With the advent of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array-based comparative genomic hybridization, and next-generation DNA sequencing, more detailed molecular diagnoses are possible than in years past, enabling refined characterization of the genotype-phenotype correlation for subjects with 2q37 deletions. In addition, investigations into molecular and gene expression networks are expanding in neurodevelopmental conditions, and we surveyed HDAC4 downstream gene expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, further implicating HDAC4 in its role in the regulation of RAI1. Correlation of clinical data defining the impact on downstream gene expression and the potential clinical associations across neurodevelopment will improve our understanding of these complex conditions and potentially lead to common therapeutic approaches.",Body Donation after Medically Assisted Death: An Emerging Consideration for Donor Programs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848063,Anatomical sciences education,2019 03 28,"Around the world, the recent introduction of assisted death laws has meant that undertaking medical assistance in dying (MAID) is now an option for some persons wishing to end their life. Some of these people donate their bodies to medical science, and by doing so have created a new route from which donor programs can now receive bodies. Such donations have also illuminated a myriad of novel ethical questions. This article considers the emotive and controversial topic of MAID in relation to body donation, describing the experiences of McMaster University, Canada, where several MAID body donors have been received by the anatomical donor program. It provides background on the development and implementation of MAID in Canada, and describes the experience of staff and students at McMaster to MAID donations. It also explores the relevance of MAID to body donation programs, and discusses several of the ethical challenges facing body donation programs who may encounter MAID body donors. These include the appropriateness of accepting MAID donors, issues with informed consent, the effect of personal engagement with MAID donors, information sharing around MAID donations, governance issues, and negative historical parallels between MAID and euthanasia. Suggestions on how to manage MAID body donation focus on how issues affecting institutions, faculty, and students may be approached utilizing appropriate transparency and communication, some of which may facilitate student professional development around the topic of MAID. It is also suggested that the development of ethically appropriate guidelines on MAID body donations may positively guide the anatomical community.",Effective and safe tumor inhibition using vinblastine in medulloblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848061,Pediatric blood & cancer,2019 04 18,"Most medulloblastoma protocols worldwide include vincristine during radiation and chemotherapy. A significant dose-limiting toxicity is peripheral neuropathy; however, there is a paucity of data to support the view that omission of vincristine does not impact survival. Herein we report two adolescent patients with Group 4 and SHH medulloblastoma, where vinblastine successfully replaced vincristine with resolution of their peripheral neuropathy. We furthermore show vinblastine is highly active in vitro and demonstrates equivalent antitumoral activity compared to vincristine. Substitution of vincristine with vinblastine in future studies should be considered for all patients with medulloblastoma, particularly those with hereditary neuropathy, severe vincristine toxicity, and adults.",3D Graphene Networks Encapsulated with Ultrathin SnS Nanosheets@Hollow Mesoporous Carbon Spheres Nanocomposite with Pseudocapacitance-Enhanced Lithium and Sodium Storage Kinetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848060,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 05,"The lithium and sodium storage performances of SnS anode often undergo rapid capacity decay and poor rate capability owing to its huge volume fluctuation and structural instability upon the repeated charge/discharge processes. Herein, a novel and versatile method is described for in situ synthesis of ultrathin SnS nanosheets inside and outside hollow mesoporous carbon spheres crosslinked reduced graphene oxide networks. Thus, 3D honeycomb-like network architecture is formed. Systematic electrochemical studies manifest that this nanocomposite as anode material for lithium-ion batteries delivers a high charge capacity of 1027 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the as-developed nanocomposite still retains a charge capacity of 524 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles for sodium-ion batteries. In addition, the electrochemical kinetics analysis verifies the basic principles of enhanced rate capacity. The appealing electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries can be mainly related to the porous 3D interconnected architecture, in which the nanoscale SnS nanosheets not only offer decreased ion diffusion pathways and fast Li+ /Na+ transport kinetics, but also the 3D interconnected conductive networks constructed from the hollow mesoporous carbon spheres and reduced graphene oxide enhance the conductivity and ensure the structural integrity.",Mouse genetic background impacts susceptibility to hyperoxia-driven perturbations to lung maturation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848059,Pediatric pulmonology,2019 06 01,"The laboratory mouse is widely used in preclinical models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, where lung alveolarization is stunted by exposure of pups to hyperoxia.

Herein, we report an uncommon phosphorescent effect of organic single molecule enhanced by resulting supramolecular assembly of host-guest complexation. The chromophore bromophenyl-methyl-pyridinium (PY) with different counterions as guests display various phosphorescence quantum yields from 0.4 % to 24.1 %. Single crystal X-ray diffraction results indicate that the chromophore with iodide counterion (PYI) exhibits the highest efficiency maybe due to the halogen-bond interactions. Significantly, the nanosupramolecular assembly of PY chloride complexation with the cucurbit[6]uril gives a greatly enhanced phosphorescent quantum yield up to 81.2 % in ambient. Such great enhancement is because of the strict encapsulation of cucurbit[6]uril, which prevents the nonradiative relaxation and promotes intersystem crossing (ISC). This supramolecular assembly concept with counterions effect provides a novel approach for the improvement of RTP.",Phase-amplitude coupling of sleep slow oscillatory and spindle activity correlates with overnight memory consolidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848042,Journal of sleep research,2019 03 08,"Initially independent lines of research suggest that sleep-specific brain activity patterns, observed as electroencephalographic slow oscillatory and sleep spindle activity, promote memory consolidation and underlying synaptic refinements. Here, we further tested the emerging concept that specifically the coordinated interplay of slow oscillations and spindle activity (phase-amplitude coupling) support memory consolidation. Particularly, we associated indices of the interplay between slow oscillatory (0.16-1.25 Hz) and spindle activity (12-16 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep (strength [modulation index] and phase degree of coupling) in 20 healthy adults with parameters of overnight declarative (word-list task) and procedural (mirror-tracing task) memory consolidation. The pattern of results supports the notion that the interplay between oscillations facilitates memory consolidation. The coincidence of the spindle amplitude maximum with the up-state of the slow oscillation (phase degree) was significantly associated with declarative memory consolidation (r = .65, p = .013), whereas the overall strength of coupling (modulation index) correlated with procedural memory consolidation (r = .45, p = .04). Future studies are needed to test for potential causal effects of the observed association between neural oscillations during sleep and memory consolidation, and to elucidate ways of modulating these processes, for instance through non-invasive brain-stimulation techniques.",Differentiating axillary lymph node metastasis in invasive breast cancer patients: A comparison of radiomic signatures from multiparametric breast MR sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848041,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,2019 03 08,The axillary lymph node status is critical for breast cancer staging and individualized treatment planning.,Housing mice in the individually ventilated or open cages-Does it matter for behavioral phenotype?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848040,"Genes, brain, and behavior",2019 03 28,"Individually ventilated caging (IVC) systems for rodents are increasingly common in laboratory animal facilities. However, the impact of such substantial change in housing conditions on animal physiology and behavior is still debated. Most importantly, there arise the questions regarding reproducibility and comparison of previous or new phenotypes between the IVC and open cages. The present study was set up for detailed and systematic comparison of behavioral phenotypes in male and female mice of three widely used inbred strains (C57BL/6JRccHsd, DBA/2JRccHsd, 129S2/SvHSd) after being kept in two housing environments (IVC and open cages) for 6 weeks (since 4 weeks of age) before behavioral testing. The tests addressed exploratory, anxiety-like and stress-related behavior (light-dark box, open field, forced swim test, stress-induced hyperthermia), social approach and species-specific behavior (nest building, marble burying). In all tests, large and expected strain differences were found. Somewhat surprisingly, the most striking effect of environment was found for basal body temperature and weight loss after one night of single housing in respective cages. In addition, the performance in light-dark box and open field was affected by environment. Several parameters in different tests showed significant interaction between housing and genetic background. In summary, the IVC housing did not invalidate the well-known differences between the mouse strains which have been established by previous studies. However, within the strains the results can be influenced by sex and housing system depending on the behavioral tasks applied. The bottom-line is that the environmental conditions should be described explicitly in all publications.",Longitudinal changes in glycated haemoglobin following treatment intensification after inadequate response to two oral antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848039,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2019 06 14,To identify change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) for 1 year after treatment intensification in patients with HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (7.0%) while on two classes of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs).,Opioid use after hip fracture surgery: A Danish nationwide cohort study from 2005 to 2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848038,"European journal of pain (London, England)",2019 03 25,"There is currently a knowledge gap regarding persistent opioid use after hip fracture surgery.

Total choline signal (tCho) measured in vivo using either a qualitative or quantitative approach has been used as a diagnostic test in the workup of malignant breast lesions. In addition to tCho metabolites, other relevant metabolites, including multiple lipids, can be detected and monitored. MRS has been heavily investigated as an adjunct to morphologic and dynamic MRI to improve diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer, obviating unnecessary benign biopsies. Besides its use in the staging of breast cancer, other promising applications have been recently investigated, including the assessment of treatment response and therapy monitoring.

Rabbit meat is one of the most susceptible animal products, thus the main aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of tannins to elongate shelf life of rabbit meat. Ninety hybrid rabbits were fed with three different diets: basal diet (control, C) and basal diet supplemented with 0.3% or 0.6% of tannins mix. Meat samples were refrigerated as raw at 4°C up to 11 days and analysed both as raw and cooked for physical-chemical characteristics, fatty acids profile, lipid oxidation and antioxidant capacity. Results showed that dietary tannins affected meat colour of raw samples (mostly yellowness). Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) of raw samples was lower in tannins group than C group; a further inhibition of peroxidation was showed also in cooked samples only by the highest dose of tannins mix. Moreover, antioxidant capacity (ABTS) of raw samples increased with the percentage of tannins. In conclusion, supplementation with 0.6% of tannins mix seems to positively affect the lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity of meat without modifying the intrinsic characteristics of rabbit meat.","""A limited focus on cancer rehabilitation""-A qualitative study of the experiences from Norwegian Cancer Coordinators in Primary Health Care.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848034,European journal of cancer care,2019 03 08,"The facilitation of complex cancer rehabilitation interventions in primary health care has become of growing importance to meet the bio-psycho-social needs of cancer survivors.

The work presented here suggests that Prevotella copri might be an ideal microbial marker for identifying beef cattle with high feed efficiency early in their life span and in the production cycle. Developing more refined quantification techniques that allow correlation of P. copri to feed efficiency of beef cattle that can be applied by lay people in the field holds great promise to improve the economy of cattle operations while simultaneously reducing their environmental impact by mitigating methane production from enteric fermentation.","Sub-nanometer, Ultrafine α-Fe2 O3 Sheets Realized by Controlled Crystallization Kinetics for Stable, High-Performance Energy Storage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848015,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 03,"The development of energy devices based on iron oxides/hydroxides is largely hindered by their poor conductivity and large volume changes, especially with regard to specific capacitance and cycle stability. Herein, superior capacitance (1575 F g-1 at 1.25 A g-1 ) and high rate performance (955 F g-1 at 25 A g-1 ) were realized by synthesizing sub-nanometer, ultrafine α-Fe2 O3 sheets loaded on graphene (SU-Fe2 O3 -rGO). An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor showed outstanding cycle stability (106 % retention after 30 000 cycles). This excellent performance arises from the unique structural characteristics of the α-Fe2 O3 sheets, which not only enrich electrochemically reactive sites, but also largely eliminate the volume changes after long-term charge/discharge cycling. The synthesis of SU-Fe2 O3 -rGO critically depends on control of the crystallization kinetics during growth. A controlled heterogeneous nucleation mechanism results in the formation of atomically thin α-Fe2 O3 sheets on graphene rather than large particles in solvent, as clarified by theoretical calculations. This strategy paves a new way to synthesizing atomically thin transition metal oxide sheets and low-cost, eco-friendly iron-based energy storage.",Impaired decision making following escalation of cocaine self-administration predicts vulnerability to relapse in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848014,Addiction biology,2019 03 08,"Impairments in cost-benefit decision making represent a cardinal feature of drug addiction. However, whether these alterations predate drug exposure, thereby contributing to facilitating loss of control over drug intake, or alternatively arise as a result of drug use and subsequently confer vulnerability to relapse has yet to be determined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer (SA) cocaine during 19 daily long-access (12-h) sessions; conditions reliably shown to promote escalation. One week after cocaine SA, rats underwent an extinction/relapse test immediately followed by conditioned stimuli-, stress-, and drug-primed reinstatement challenges. The influence of escalated cocaine intake on decision making was measured over time by four test sessions of a rodent analogue of the Iowa Gambling Task (rGT), once prior to cocaine exposure and then 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month after the last SA session. Substantial individual variability was observed in the influence of escalated cocaine SA on decision-making performance. A subset of rats displayed pronounced deficits, while others showed unaffected or even improved performance on the rat Gambling Task (rGT) 24 hours after the last SA session. When challenged with a relapse test after 1 week of forced abstinence, animals that showed impaired decision making following SA displayed an increased propensity to respond for cocaine under extinction. These data suggest that decision-making deficits in individuals with drug addiction are not antecedent to-but arise as a consequence of-drug exposure. Moreover, these data indicate that susceptibility to the deleterious effects of drugs on decision making confers vulnerability toward relapse.",Clinical outcomes and risk factors of thromboprophylaxis with rivaroxaban versus aspirin in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty in low-incidence population: A nationwide study in Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848013,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,2019 04 05,We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in thromboprophylaxis compared with those of aspirin in real-world patients who underwent hip arthroplasty using nationwide claims data.,The meaning of acceptance (Thum-jai) in Thai people: Letting it go…so life goes on.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30848012,International journal of mental health nursing,2019 03 08,"The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the meaning of acceptance (Thum-jai) as a culturally embedded coping strategy in the lives of Thai people who have experienced adversity that caused suffering. Thematic analysis was used to examine the responses of 47 participants to written, open-ended questions or face-to-face interviews. The EQUATOR's COREQ checklist for qualitative research was followed. Participants came from diverse religious' traditions and geographic regions throughout Thailand. Findings revealed seven themes: circumstance and emotion; thought and action; time, experience, and effort; social and moral support; religious and spiritual ethos; acceptance and hope; and survive and thrive. The adverse circumstance is central to the concept of acceptance. Before acceptance, there is often hope; yet Thai people reach an existential point whether to accept the reality of the situation or continue in distress.

A standard neuropsychological assessment revealed only a visuospatial working memory deficit. Clear evidence for problems with novel environments were found on a virtual route learning test. Two real-world tests were used to investigate her ability to recall familiar environments. The first test was based on the area she grew up in (and still visits regularly) and the second test concerned her current place of residence which she never visited prior to the surgery.

For the purpose of learning how elder persons live in community, all the 327 undergraduate nursing students, from freshmen to seniors, provided monthly or bi-monthly visits to home-dwelling elderly persons aged 75 or above in their home over 1 year period, in order to provide support for their independent living and to learn from them. The students' reports submitted at the end of the first academic year were qualitatively analyzed to evaluate what they learned. They acquired multiple perspectives for understanding elder persons, including a variety of individual and environmental aspects of wellness, prevention, and community life. They also acknowledged the importance of team practice through working and collaborating with different grade levels and generations. Overall, the observed learning contents were useful for future nursing education with elder persons and facilitating critical changes in nursing education systems to address the problems of aged society."

The effectiveness of plant diversity as a surrogate for arthropod diversity was assessed in natural areas in the Kogelberg Biosphere Reserve, a floral endemism hotspot in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR), South Africa. Arthropods and plants were sampled across 30 topographically heterogeneous sites in a spatially nested design. The relationship between plants and arthropods were quantified in terms of species richness, assemblage variation, and assemblage turnover. The influence of arthropod trophic groups, habitat association, and spatial scale were also explored. Generalized dissimilarity modelling was used to investigate differential influence of explanatory groups (geology, disturbance, local site characteristics, refuge, mesoclimate, terrain) on arthropod and plant turnover. Congruence in assemblage variation was restricted to local scales, and only present between plants and those arthropods associated with the foliar component of the habitat. Weak congruence in species turnover was due to differences in the relative importance of explanatory groups, with different variables within each explanatory group being important, and similar variables predicting different turnover patterns. For both groups, variables related to geology and fire history were important for assemblage turnover. These variables are already incorporated in conservation planning and management for plant diversity across the CFR. Overall plant diversity was a weak surrogate for the arthropod groups included in this study, suggesting that as an alternative, environmental surrogates for arthropod diversity perform better.",Quantification of intracranial arterial blood flow using noncontrast enhanced 4D dynamic MR angiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847971,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 05 03,Noncontrast enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance angiography delineates the pattern of dynamic blood flow of the cerebral vasculature.

As a proof of concept, benzyl-bromide-modified paclitaxel (PTX) is employed to graft onto the DNA backbone at the PS modification sites. Due to the easy preparation of phosphorothiolated DNA at any desired position during its solid-phase synthesis, diblock DNA strands containing both normal phosphodiester segment (PO DNA) and phosphorothiolate segment (PS DNA) are directly grafted with a multitude of PTXs without using complicated and exogenous linkers. Then, the resulting amphiphilic PO DNA-blocked-(PS DNA-grafted PTX) conjugates (PO DNA-b-(PS DNA-g-PTX)) assemble into PTX-loaded spherical nucleic acid (SNA)-like micellar nanoparticles (PTX-SNAs) with a high drug loading ratio up to ≈53%. Importantly, the PO DNA segment maintains its molecular recognition property and biological functions, which allows the as-prepared PTX-SNAs to be further functionalized with tumor-targeting aptamers, fluorescent probe strands, or antisense sequences. These multifunctional PTX-SNAs demonstrate active tumor-targeting delivery, efficient inhibition of tumor growth, and the reversal of drug resistance both in vitro and in vivo for comprehensive antitumor therapy.",Companion rats (Rattus norvegicus) with cutaneous lesions: a retrospective study of 470 cases at two university veterinary teaching hospitals (1985-2018).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847969,Veterinary dermatology,2019 06 13,"Rats are popular companion animals that are often presented to veterinarians for treatment of skin diseases.

Understanding how much variation exists in muscle activity patterns in homologous muscles across animal clades during similar behaviours is important for evaluating the evolution of muscle functions and neuromuscular control. We compared muscle activity across a range of archosaurian species and appendicular muscles, including how these EMG patterns varied across ontogeny and phylogeny, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of archosaurian muscle activation during locomotion. EMG electrodes were implanted into the muscles of turkeys, pheasants, quail, guineafowl, emus (three age classes), tinamous and juvenile Nile crocodiles across 13 different appendicular muscles. Subjects walked and ran at a range of speeds both overground and on treadmills during EMG recordings. Anatomically similar muscles such as the lateral gastrocnemius exhibited similar EMG patterns at similar relative speeds across all birds. In the crocodiles, the EMG signals closely matched previously published data for alligators. The timing of lateral gastrocnemius activation was relatively later within a stride cycle for crocodiles compared to birds. This difference may relate to the coordinated knee extension and ankle plantarflexion timing across the swing-stance transition in Crocodylia, unlike in birds where there is knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion across swing-stance. No significant effects were found across the species for ontogeny, or between treadmill and overground locomotion. Our findings strengthen the inference that some muscle EMG patterns remained conservative throughout Archosauria: for example, digital flexors retained similar stance phase activity and M. pectoralis remained an 'anti-gravity' muscle. However, some avian hindlimb muscles evolved divergent activations in tandem with functional changes such as bipedalism and more crouched postures, especially M. iliotrochantericus caudalis switching from swing to stance phase activity and M. iliofibularis adding a novel stance phase burst of activity.",Military-style fitness boot camps: contested resources in accounting for fatness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847965,Sociology of health & illness,2019 06 04,"In this article, we examine the social management of fatness via an analysis of 4 years of participant-observation in military-style fitness boot camps and interviews with camp participants, trainers and organisers/owners. We begin by focusing on popular imagery of the 'boot camp'. The boot camp model takes various forms; yet, whether it involves civilian participants, as on reality television shows, or the imagined military ones of films, the boot camp model emphasises the re-fashioning of the individual via the disciplining of bodies and selves. Such constructions of boot camps were employed by our respondents to lay claim to identities which highlight their hard work, strength of character, fundamental 'goodness' and self-discipline, as those qualities are demonstrated through the body - even though participants' actual bodies change little at camp. Such meanings stand in direct contradiction to broader social constructions of fatness and participants' own negative perceptions of fat people. Moreover, even within the camps themselves, such identity claims are contested, both by camp trainers and by slimmer and 'fitter' attendees. These counterclaims are grounded in ideas about the characterological implications of the fat body, beliefs about the purpose of boot camp and notions of the body's capacity for change.","Beyond health: medicines, food supplements, energetics and the commodification of self-performance in Maputo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847964,Sociology of health & illness,2019 03 11,"With an increasing range of products in global and local markets, more options are available for individuals to enhance their image and their (cognitive, social and physical) performance. These 'performance consumptions' relate to ideals of well-being and improvement, and are based on constructed desires, expectations and needs that go beyond the (often blurred) dichotomy of health and illness. Drawing from mixed-methods research in Maputo, Mozambique, this paper discusses individuals' use of medicines and other substances - pharmaceuticals, food supplements, traditional herbs, cosmetics and energy drinks - for managing different aspects of their everyday lives. Through an overview of the main consumption practices, we explore the underlying purposes and strategies of users, and the perceived legitimacy and risks involved when using a variety of products accessible through formal and informal exchange channels. From tiredness to sexual and aesthetic management, we show how the body becomes the locus of experimentation and investment to perform in accordance with socially expected roles, individual aspirations and everyday tasks. With insights from individuals' accounts in Maputo, we aim to add to discussions on pharmaceuticalisation of body management by showing how the emergence of new performance consumptions is articulated with the reconfiguration of more 'traditional' consumption practices."

The biological effect of TNF-α includes slowing down osteogenic differentiation, which can lead to bone dysplasia in long-term inflammatory microenvironments. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-interacting protein 1 (StIP1, also known as elongator complex protein 2, ELP2) play a role in inhibiting TNF-α-induced osteoblast differentiation. In the present study, we investigated whether and how ELP2 activation mediates the effects of TNF-α on osteoblastic differentiation. Using in vitro cell cultures of preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, we found that TNF-α inhibited osteoblastic differentiation accompanied by an increase in ELP2 expression and STAT3 activation. Forced ELP2 expression inhibited osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, with a decrease in the expression of osteoblast marker genes, alkaline phosphatase activity, and matrix mineralization capacity. In contrast, ELP2 silencing ameliorated osteogenic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells, even after TNF-α stimulation. The TNF-α-induced inhibitory effect on osteoblastic differentiation was therefore mediated by ELP2, which was associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT3 activation. These results suggest that ELP2 is upregulated at the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells into osteoblasts and inhibits osteogenic differentiation in response to TNF-α through STAT3 activation.",Inferential language processes across adolescence: A test with novel idioms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847949,Scandinavian journal of psychology,2019 05 08,"Idiom comprehension relies on the ability to draw inferences from different cues in a communication situation.

Four groups of participants (11, 13, 15, and adult students) performed an idiomatic expression comprehension task, in which idiom familiarity was controlled. We manipulated the idioms' transparency (vs. opacity) and presentation (supportive narrative context inducing an idiomatic interpretation of the expression vs. nonsupportive narrative context). Analyses revealed an improvement in idiom comprehension in terms of contextual inferences but they failed to reveal any significant difference in terms of semantic inferences.

We developed a tool to visualise defined genomic sequences in fixed nuclei and chromosomes based on a two-part guide RNA with a recombinant Cas9 endonuclease complex. This method does not require any special construct or transformation method. In contrast to classical fluorescence in situ hybridiaztion, RGEN-ISL (RNA-guided endonuclease - in situ labelling) does not require DNA denaturation, and therefore permits a better structural chromatin preservation. The application of differentially labelled trans-activating crRNAs allows the multiplexing of RGEN-ISL. Moreover, this technique is combinable with immunohistochemistry. Real-time visualisation of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DNA labelling process revealed the kinetics of the reaction. The broad range of adaptability of RGEN-ISL to different temperatures and combinations of methods has the potential to advance the field of chromosome biology.","Signaling roadmap to epithelial-mesenchymal transition in pterygium, TWIST1 centralized.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847945,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 08,"Pterygium as a complex disease shares common features with other malignant cells in its onset recurrence and especially epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transition.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression of and then illustrate the role of signaling pathways on EMT in pterygium. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, the twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) expression was compared in primary pterygium and normal conjunctiva. This study assessed the mRNA expression, as well as the association between the clinicopathological indices and the gene expression level. The expression level of TWIST1 was overexpressed in 36% of our cohort ( n = 76). There was a significant positive correlation between recurrence with grade T, grade V and a significant negative correlation with growth activity. Our vast literature review on different signaling pathways in pterygium showed that EMT has centralization role in recurrence of this disease. Our data confirmed that EMT is important in the recurrence of pterygium samples and different signaling pathways end up activating the EMT markers.

However, the habitat preference was different among the sites (countries). In Indonesia and Vietnam, most A. bicolor bicolor and A. bicolor pacifica were either marine or brackish water residents in this study. Alternatively, most A. bicolor bicolor were freshwater residents in Malaysia; such a typical catadromous migration pattern in these eels has not been found in previous studies. The wide range of otolith Sr:Ca in both subspecies indicates that the habitat use of these tropical eels was opportunistic among fresh, brackish and marine waters during their growth phases following recruitment to coastal areas.

The results showed that as the starch content increased, the viscosity of the starch-surimi mixture decreased facilitating the flow of the surimi out of the printer nozzle. The surimi gel with 8% sweet potato starch concentration showed good gel strength (2,021.70 g mm), WHC (82.39%), microstructural characteristics, and less cooking loss (1.95%). A comparison of the traditional surimi preparation method with 3DP showed that the surimi gel prepared by a 3D printed construct was softer in gel strength (1,398.65 g mm) and lower in hardness (945.17 g) although showing slightly higher cooking loss (6.76%) and lower WHC (72.66 g) than the conventional product.

Metabolic investigations in a patient with infantile afebrile tonic-clonic seizures revealed increased urinary uridine and cytidine excretion. Segregation of this metabolic trait in the family showed the same biochemical phenotype in a healthy older brother of the index. Whole exome sequencing revealed biallelic mutations in SLC28A1 encoding the pyrimidine nucleoside transporter CNT1 in the index and his brother. Both parents and unaffected sibs showed the variant in heterozygous state. The transporter is expressed in the kidneys. Compelling evidence is available for the disrupting effect of the mutation on the transport function thus explaining the increased excretion of the pyrimidine nucleosides. The exome analysis also revealed a pathogenic mutation in PRRT2 in the index, explaining the epilepsy phenotype in infancy. At present, both the index (10 years) and his older brother are asymptomatic. Mutations in SLC28A1 cause a novel inborn error of metabolism that can be explained by the disrupted activity of the pyrimidine nucleoside transporter CNT1. This is the first report describing a defect in the family of CNT concentrative pyrimidine nucleoside transporter proteins encoded by the SLC28 gene family. In all likelihood, the epilepsy phenotype in the index is unrelated to the SLC28A1 defect, as this can be fully explained by the pathogenic PRRT2 variant. Clinical data on more patients are required to prove whether pathogenic mutations in SLC28A1 have any clinical consequences or are to be considered a benign metabolic phenotype.",Possible female philopatry of the smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena revealed by genetic structure patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847921,Journal of fish biology,2019 06 04,"We assessed the spatial pattern of genetic structure of smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena in 10 localities from the Northern Mexican Pacific. A total of 35 haplotypes were identified in 129 sequences of the mtDNA control region. The results showed slight but significant genetic structure among localities (ΦST = 0.044, P < 0.001). In addition, the localities with highest number of juveniles were genetically different (ΦST = 0.058, P < 0.024), which may be representative of nursery areas. The genetic differentiation pattern can be associated to female philopatry and preference for particular birthing sites. Finally, historical demography shows that S. zygaena populations present a recent demographic expansion that occurred during glacial events in the late Pleistocene to early Holocene.",Successful implementation of intestinal endoscopy in non-human primates prompts the possibility of achieving AIDS longitudinal intestinal research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847920,Journal of medical primatology,2019 05 15,"HIV infection induces pathological changes in the intestinal mucosa.

The development of artificial lakes and wetlands in streams has become a widely used management tool to reduce nutrient load to coastal areas. Such wetlands may threaten anadromous populations. In this study we quantify net ground speed of downstream migrating brown trout Salmo trutta smolts in equally long stream and lake sections in a Danish lowland stream and artificial lake. This was done by passive integrated transponder telemetry in 2016 and 2017. Mean net ground speed in the stream section was 36.58 and 0.8 km day-1 in the lake section. This decrease of net ground speed through the lake may lead to prolonged exposure to predators and probably contributes to high mortalities threatening anadromous populations.,Otoliths of sub-adult Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens contain aragonite and vaterite calcium carbonate polymorphs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847918,Journal of fish biology,2019 05 10,"In this study we quantified the percent CaCO3 polymorph composition in otoliths of larval and juvenile Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens via X-ray microdiffraction.

The human 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase (hE1a) is a novel protein, which is encoded by the DHTKD1 gene. Both missence and nonsense mutations were identified in the DHTKD1 that lead to alpha-aminoadipic and alpha-oxoadipic aciduria, a metabolic disorder with a wide variety of the neurological abnormalities, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2Q, an inherited neurological disorder affecting the peripheral nervous system.

Acute clinical episodes usually involve severe metabolic decompensation and lactate acidosis that result in neurological, cardiological, and/or hepatological manifestations. Clinical severity is due to the fact that LADH is a common E3 subunit to the alpha-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, alpha-ketoadipate, and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complexes, and is also a constituent in the glycine cleavage system, thus a loss in LADH function adversely affects multiple key metabolic routes. However, the severe clinical pictures frequently still do not parallel the LADH activity loss, which implies the involvement of auxiliary biochemical mechanisms; enhanced reactive oxygen species generation as well as affinity loss for multienzyme complexes proved to be key auxiliary exacerbating pathomechanisms.

The brain region that plays a central role in this regulation is the preoptic area, and lesions in this area eliminates maternal behaviors in rodents. The molecular background of the behavioral changes has not been established yet; therefore, in the present study, we applied proteomics to compare protein level changes associated with maternal care in the rat preoptic area. Using 2-dimensional fluorescence gel electrophoresis followed by identification of altered spots with mass spectrometry, 12 proteins were found to be significantly increased, and 6 proteins showed a significantly reduced level in mothers. These results show some similarities with a previous proteomics study of the maternal medial prefrontal cortex and genomics approaches applied to the preoptic area. Gene ontological analysis suggested that most altered proteins are involved in glucose metabolism and neuroplasticity. These proteins may support the maintenance of increased neuronal activity in the preoptic area, and morphological changes in preoptic neuronal circuits are known to take place in mothers. An increase in the level of alpha-crystallin B chain (Cryab) was confirmed by Western blotting. This small heat shock protein may also contribute to maintaining the increased activity of preoptic neurons by stabilizing protein structures. Common regulator and target analysis of the altered proteins suggested a role of prolactin in the molecular changes in the preoptic area. These results first identified the protein level changes in the maternal preoptic area. The altered proteins contribute to the maintenance of maternal behaviors and may also be relevant to postpartum depression, which can occur as a molecular level maladaptation to motherhood.",Absolute myocardial blood flows derived by dynamic CZT scan vs invasive fractional flow reserve: Correlation and accuracy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847856,Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,2019 03 08,To define the diagnostic power of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) evaluation on dynamic CZT imaging in intermediate risk patients in comparison with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and fractional flow reserve (FFR).,"CDK4/6 Inhibitors Expand the Therapeutic Options in Breast Cancer: Palbociclib, Ribociclib and Abemaciclib.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847853,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",2019 03 29,"The majority of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative disease. For this subgroup, endocrine therapy is the key therapeutic option. Recently, therapeutic options have been expanded by introduction of the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6i). Three compounds, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, have already been approved by the FDA for use together with endocrine therapy such as aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or fulvestrant; abemaciclib is also approved as a single agent. In the first-line setting, all three agents-together with an AI-substantially prolonged progression-free survival with a consistent hazard ratio of around 0.5 in all phase III trials. The data for second-line settings and beyond is also quite consistent, with again a substantial prolongation of progression-free survival demonstrated for fulvestrant together with palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib. Treatment with CDK4/6i is well tolerated and side effects are manageable. With palbociclib and ribociclib, hematological toxicities are most frequent. Abemaciclib has a lower incidence of neutropenia and a much greater incidence of all grades of diarrhea compared with other CDK4/6i, making diarrhea the key toxicity for abemaciclib. Patient quality of life is maintained under therapy and, particularly in later line settings, deterioration of quality of life is slowed down and symptoms such as pain are better controlled by CDK4/6i. Their consistent and clinically relevant efficacy makes these drugs an important improvement in our armamentarium against MBC and, potentially, ideal candidates in early breast cancer (EBC).

Moreover, these cells can be used to validate the effect of candidate molecules identified by high throughput screening approaches applied to the development of targeted therapy for human disorders in which chondrogenic differentiation may be involved, as in conditions characterized by heterotopic endochondral bone formation. Chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells can be monitored by applying quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), one of the most sensitive methods that allows detection of small dynamic changes in gene expression between samples obtained under different experimental conditions. In this work, we have used qPCR to monitor the expression of specific markers during chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells in micromass cultures. Then we have applied the geNorm approach to identify the most stable reference genes suitable to get a robust normalization of the obtained expression data. Among 12 candidate reference genes (Ap3d1, Csnk2a2, Cdc40, Fbxw2, Fbxo38, Htatsf1, Mon2, Pak1ip1, Zfp91, 18S, ActB, GAPDH) we identified Mon2 and Ap3d1 as the most stable ones during chondrogenesis. ActB, GAPDH and 18S, the most commonly used in the literature, resulted to have an expression level too high compared to the differentiation markers (Sox9, Collagen type 2a1, Collagen type 10a1 and Collagen type 1a1), therefore are actually less recommended for these experimental conditions. In conclusion, we identified nine reference genes that can be equally used to obtain a robust normalization of the gene expression variation during the C3H10T1/2 chondrogenic differentiation."

Health status of animals was monitored by physical assessment of body weight, organ indices, and histological appearances of liver and intestine along with measurement of hematological parameters (Hb, WBC, RBC count, MCHC, MCV, MCH), biochemical analytes in blood involving glucose, serum enzymes (ALT, AST and LDH), urea, creatinine, and lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, VLDL, LDL, and atherogenic index). LF showed no adverse effects on above parameters of general health status after continuous consumption for the experimental period.

In contrast, spectra recorded from gold nanoparticles directly mixed with an alkali cyanide exhibited an additional peak at m/z 249, indicating an abundant generation of gaseous [Au(CN)2]- ions upon irradiation. The relative intensity of the m/z 249 peak surged when the amount of cyanide in the mixture was increased. Most remarkably, a peak at m/z 249 was observed even from neat AuNPs upon irradiation, if a nearby spot, which was not irradiated, happened to bear a cyanide sample. We postulated that traces of HCN emanating from the headspace of aqueous cyanide solution during the sample-plate preparation is sufficient to convert gold to AuCN, which is subsequently detected as [Au(CN)2]-. Further experiments demonstrated that the relative intensity of the m/z 249 peak diminishes exponentially as the AuNP spot becomes more distant from the putative HCN source. Eventually, the method was developed as an efficient procedure to detect HCN or alkali cyanides. Using KCN, the detection limits were determined to be below 10 pg of CN- per spot. The method also demonstrated that, upon crushing, the seeds or roots of certain fruits and vegetables such as apple, peach, radish, and cassava, but not carrot, release HCN in amounts detectable by this method.

Fifty-one nucleosides and nucleotides were identified from rat liver and 23 were quantified with concentrations of 1.03 nmol/L-31.7 μmol/L. These results demonstrate that the developed method can be used to investigate the concentration change of nucleosides and nucleotides in biological samples for the purposes of biomarker discovery or elucidation of disease mechanisms.","Assessment of Internal Medicine Resident Preparedness to Care for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer/Questioning Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847829,Journal of general internal medicine,2019 06 01,"Recognizing the unique health needs of sexual and gender minorities (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) is critical to providing competent and comprehensive healthcare.",Predictors of Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events with Smoking Cessation Medications in the Randomized Controlled EAGLES Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847828,Journal of general internal medicine,2019 06 01,Pre-treatment factors that increase smokers' risk of experiencing neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPSAEs) when quitting smoking are unknown.,"A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Crossover Studies Comparing Physiological, Perceptual and Performance Measures Between Treadmill and Overground Running.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847825,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 04 15,"Treadmills are routinely used to assess running performance and training parameters related to physiological or perceived effort.

There is a growing body of research indicating that typical resistance exercises impair neuromuscular function and endurance performance during periods of resistance training-induced muscle damage. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the attenuating effects of resistance training-induced muscle damage on endurance performance are influenced by exercise intensity, exercise mode, exercise sequence, recovery and contraction velocity of resistance training. By understanding the influence that training variables have on the level of resistance training-induced muscle damage and its subsequent attenuating effects on endurance performance, concurrent training programs could be prescribed in such a way that minimises fatigue between modes of training and optimises the quality of endurance training sessions. Therefore, this review will provide considerations for concurrent training prescription for endurance development based on scientific evidence. Furthermore, recommendations will be provided for future research by identifying training variables that may impact on endurance development as a result of concurrent training.",Pre-Therapeutic Total Lesion Glycolysis on [18F]FDG-PET Enables Prognostication of 2-Year Progression-Free Survival in MALT Lymphoma Patients Treated with CD20-Antibody-Based Immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847823,Molecular imaging and biology : MIB : the official publication of the Academy of Molecular Imaging,2019 03 21,"Standardized uptake values (SUV), total metabolic tumor volumes (TMTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) based on positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG/positron emission tomography (PET) are established outcome predictors in FDG-avid lymphomas.

Among the five fungi recovered from marine sponges able to degrade pyrene (Py) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), Tolypocladium sp. strain CBMAI 1346 and Xylaria sp. CBMAI 1464 presented the best removal rates of Py and BaP, respectively. Since the decrease in BaP was related to mycelial adsorption, a combined strategy was applied for the investigation of Py degradation by the fungus Tolypocladium sp. CBMAI 1346. The selected fungus was able to degrade about 95% of Py after 7 days of incubation (optimized conditions), generating metabolites different from the ones found before optimization. Metabolites and transcriptomic data revealed that the degradation occurred mainly by the cytochrome P450 pathway. Putative monooxygenases and dioxygenases found in the transcriptome may play an important role. After 21 days of degradation, no toxicity was found in the optimized culture conditions. The findings from the present study highlight the potential of marine-derived fungi to degrade environmental pollutants and convey innovative information related to the metabolism of pyrene.","Environmental assessment of radionuclides levels and some heavy metals pollution along Gulf of Suez, Egypt.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847810,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 06,"This work aims to evaluate radioactivity levels of 238U (226Ra), 232Th(228Ra), and 40K and the associated radiological hazard indices, as well as to assess the current status and concentrations of heavy metals along the coastline of the Gulf of Suez, in order to identify potential sources of contamination and to construct radioactivity baseline for this area. Measurements of the activity concentrations of 238U(226Ra), 232Th(228Ra), and 40K in Bq kg-1 of the collected samples were carried out using high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. Heavy metals in seawater, shore sediment, and algae samples were determined using ICP-OES. The average activity concentrations of 238U(226Ra), 232Th(228Ra), and 40K were found to be 13.79 ± 0.75, 14.57 ± 1.15, and 128.9 ± 4.15 Bq kg-1, respectively.

The distribution patterns of annual effective dose (AED) at the Suez Gulf showed that the south east of the Gulf is characterized by higher AED. Water quality parameters (water temperature, salinity, pH, DO, and Eh) reveal that Suez Gulf was undoubtedly affected by the rate of the human activities. Heavy metal concentrations in shore sediments showed some variation within the study area and followed the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > Al > B > Co > Ni > Pb > V > Cr > Mo > Cu > Cd. Furthermore, heavy metal concentrations indicated that northern part of the Gulf contains the highest levels of these metals compared to the southern one.",Necrotrophic fungus Macrophomina phaseolina tolerates chromium stress through regulating antioxidant enzymes and genes expression (MSN1 and MT).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847809,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 06,"Cr(VI) tolerance level of phytopathogenic fungus viz., Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid was assessed through growth, morphological, physiological, and metal accumulation assays. Initially, the fungus growth assays indicated that the fungus can grow over concentration range of 20-3000 ppm and exhibited high tolerance index (0.88-1.00) and minimum inhibitory concentration at 3500 ppm of Cr. Observations under compound and scanning electron microscope un-revealed the structural features of hyphae under Cr stress as thick-walled, aggregated, branched, short and broken, along with attachment of irregular objects on them. Metal accumulation analysis revealed reduction in Cr(VI) accumulation by the fungus with increase in metal concentration in the growth medium (500-3000 ppm). Cr stress induced upregulation of antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase), expression of genes (MSN1 and metallothionein) and appearnace of new protein bands suggesting the possible role in protection and survival of M. phaseolina against Cr(VI)-induced oxidative stress. This study concludes that interference of Cr with growth and physiological process of M. phaseolina could affect its infection level on its host plant, therefore, synergistic action of two factors needs to be addressed, which may aid to guide future research efforts in understanding impact of plant-pathogen-heavy metal interaction.",Dynamics of associations between perfluoroalkyl substances and uric acid across the various stages of glomerular function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847808,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 06,"National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2014 data (N = 6844) for adults aged ≥ 20 years were analyzed to estimate associations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), namely, PFOA, PFOS, PFDA, PFHxS, and PFNA with uric acid across stages of declining glomerular function. The population was stratified by the estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) stages accompanying kidney disease: GF-1 with eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; GF-2 with eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2; GF-3A with eGFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2; and GF-3B/4 with eGFR 15-44 mL/min/1.73 m2. Adjusted and unadjusted geometric means of uric acid increased from GF-1 to GF-3B/4 for males and females. Adjusted geometric means for uric acid were higher for males by 1.38, 1.03, and 0.62 mg/dL for GF-1, GF2, and GF-3 respectively but for GF-3B/4, females had higher adjusted geometric means than males by 0.16 mg/dL, revealing narrowing of sex differences in uric acid as glomerular function declines. The direction of association between PFAS and uric acid was positive for GF-1 and GF-2 for males and for every PFAS except PFDA for females. For males for GF-3B/4, association between every PFAS except PFHxS and uric acid was found to be negative (p < 0.01). For females, only PFHxS actually reverses its relationship with increasing stages of renal disease. Uric acid associations with PFAS reverse in males with advanced renal failure. An implication is that previously reported association of PFAS exposure with uric acid is not due to renal failure. Understanding of other biomarkers associated with both PFAS exposure and renal failure may benefit from similar evaluation.",Prognostic value of low CDX2 expression in colorectal cancers with a high stromal content - a short report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847807,Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),2019 06 10,Lack of expression of the intestinal transcription factor CDX2 in colorectal cancer (CRC) identifies patients with a poor prognosis.

The heterogeneity of women suffering from vulvodynia as well as its uncertain and likely multifactorial etiology pose a significant challenge to identifying any kind of ""gold standard"" treatment. Thus, treatment providers must be well versed in the various options and the evidence for each. In this review, we begin with pharmacological treatments, followed by non-pharmacological treatments, surgery, and finally multimodal treatments. For each approach, we briefly discuss the method, mechanism of action, and empirical support for the treatment. In sum, pharmacological treatments that may be beneficial but require further research include antinociceptive agents (lidocaine, capsaicin), anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids, interferon), neuromodulating medications (anticonvulsants and antidepressants), hormonal agents, and muscle relaxants (e.g., botulinum toxin). There is strong evidence to support and recommend non-pharmacological interventions including psychological therapy, pelvic floor physical therapy, as well as surgery (i.e., vestibulectomy for provoked vestibulodynia) for the treatment of vulvodynia. We conclude this review with a discussion of issues that may have hindered progress of treatment efficacy and effectiveness, and recommendations for moving the field forward.",Triamcinolone Acetonide Extended-Release: A Review in Osteoarthritis Pain of the Knee.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847805,Drugs,2019 04 14,"Triamcinolone acetonide extended-release (ER) 32 mg (Zilretta®) is approved in the USA for the management of osteoarthritis (OA) pain of the knee and is administered as a single, 5 mL intra-articular (IA) injection. Although the therapeutic effects from IA corticosteroids are typically short-lived, triamcinolone acetonide ER is formulated in poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres that slowly release triamcinolone acetonide in the synovium, enabling their prolonged presence in the joint. This reduces systemic exposure and lessens corticosteroid-related systemic adverse reactions, such as blood glucose elevations. In a 24-week, randomized, phase III clinical trial, triamcinolone acetonide ER 32 mg significantly improved mean average daily pain intensity in patients with knee OA relative to placebo, and pain, stiffness and physical function (according to WOMAC criteria) relative to placebo and triamcinolone acetonide crystalline suspension (CS). Triamcinolone acetonide ER was generally well tolerated, with a tolerability profile similar to that of triamcinolone acetonide CS and placebo. Findings from a single-arm phase IIIb study indicated that a repeat administration of triamcinolone acetonide ER may be similarly efficacious to an initial injection without having deleterious effects on cartilage or other aspects of joint structure. Thus, triamcinolone acetonide ER expands the treatment options available for the management of OA pain of the knee.",From Infection to the Microbiome: An Evolving Role of Microbes in Schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847804,Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2019 04 03,"The study of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi, and protozoa in the context of psychiatric disorders may be surprising to some. This intersection of disciplines, however, has a rich history and is currently revitalized by newfound functions of the microbiome and the gut-brain axis in human diseases. Schizophrenia, in particular, fits this model as a disorder with gene and environmental roots that may be anchored in the immune system. In this context, the combination of a precisely timed pathogen exposure in a person with genetically encoded altered immunity may have especially destructive consequences for the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, significant components of immunity, such as the development of the immune response and the concept of immune tolerance, are largely dictated by the commensal residents of the microbiome. When this community of microbes is imbalanced, perhaps as the result of a pathogen invasion, stress, or immune gene deficiency, a pathological cycle of localized inflammation, endothelial barrier compromise, translocation of gut-derived products, and systemic inflammation may ensue. If these pathologies enable access of gut and microbial metabolites and immune molecules to the CNS across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and studies of the gut-brain axis support this hypothesis, a worsening of cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms is predicted to occur in susceptible individuals with schizophrenia. In this chapter, we review the role of microbes in various stages of this model and how these organisms may contribute to documented phenotypes of schizophrenia. An increased understanding of the role of pathogens and the microbiome in psychiatric disorders will better guide the development of microbial and immune-based therapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.",Aberrant functional connectivity profiles of brain regions associated with salience and reward processing in female patients with borderline personality disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847803,Brain imaging and behavior,2019 03 08,"Recent resting-state functional connectivity studies have shown significant group differences in several networks between patients suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy controls. However, reliable and consistent findings have not been reported yet. Several methodological factors might be responsible for the discrepant findings, including the heterogeneity of patient samples in terms of symptom severity. In the current study, we combined investigations of the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of BPD patients with seed-based connectivity measures and then computed the correlation of connectivity measures with borderline symptom severity. Correlation-based connectivity analysis was performed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 26 female BPD patients and 26 healthy controls. Increased intrinsic connectivity was found in clusters involving part of the caudate nucleus and the left insula in the patient group, indicating greater integration of each region. Further seed-based connectivity analyses revealed that with the caudate seed, the patient data exhibited an increased resting-state functional connectivity in the bilateral ventral striatum and the midline prefrontal regions extending to the ACC, a network associated with reward processing. The left insula seed showed significantly increased connectivity with the bilateral fronto-orbital/insula, the inferior parietal lobule and the mid-cingulate cortex, a network involved in attention and salience encoding, in the patient population. Moreover, symptom severity, as assessed with the BSL-95 outside the scanner, was negatively correlated with the coupling of the insula and the striatum in the BPD group. Overall, an increased functional connectivity within two large-scale circuitries underlying reward and salience processing was evident in patients, as compared to healthy participants. When correlated with borderline symptom severity, a reduced connectivity between key regions belonging to the reward system and salience network was observed in the patients. These findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the BPD pathophysiology and thereby delineate potential treatment targets."

A t-shaped microchip device can be used to test the μCE portion of this integrated system to find appropriate separation conditions. These t-shaped microchips can be fabricated using photolithographically patterned Si templates and hot embossing. PTB biomarkers can be fluorescently labeled using an amine-reactive dye prior to μCE.

In this protocol, a CE-MS strategy is outlined for the profiling of cationic metabolites in biomass-limited samples using a small amount of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells as a model system. By employing a sheathless interfacing design for coupling CE to MS, it is shown that information-rich profiles for cationic metabolites can be obtained when working with a starting amount of 10,000 HepG2 cells and even lower.

However, confirmatory testing of presumptive screen-positive cases is required using high efficiency separations for improved specificity in order to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) for certain classes of IEMs. Here, we describe recent advances using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for reliable second-tier screening or confirmatory testing based on targeted analysis of amino acids, acylcarnitines, nucleosides, and other classes of polar metabolites associated with IEMs. Additionally, nontargeted metabolite profiling enables the identification of unknown biomarkers of clinical significance for other genetic diseases that are currently screened by bioassays and/or mutation panels, such as cystic fibrosis (CF). Noteworthy, CE-MS allows for resolution of isobaric/isomeric interferences without complicated sample handling that is ideal when analyzing volume-restricted biospecimens from neonates/infants, including dried blood spots and sweat specimens.

The starting screening conditions consist of 50 mM phosphate-triethanolamine buffer at pH 2.5, an applied voltage of 15 kV, and a temperature of 25 °C. The design of experiment (DOE) was based on a full factorial design of the crucial two factors (pH and %CD) at three levels, to make a total of nine (32) experiments with high, intermediate, and low values for both factors. Evaluation of the proposed strategy pointed out that best resolution was obtained at pH 2.5 for the investigated racemates using low percentages of HS-γ-CD, while SBE-β-CD was the most successful chiral selector offering acceptable resolution, with best separation at low pH values and at higher %CD within 10 min runtime.

FIDA is based on measuring the change in size of a ligand as it selectively interacts with the target protein. The unbound ligand has a relatively small apparent hydrodynamic radius (size), which increase in the presence of the analyte due to binding to the analyte. The Kd of the interaction may be obtained in a titration experiment and the measurement of the apparent ligand size in an unknown sample forms the basis for determining the analyte concentration. The apparent molecular size is measured by Taylor dispersion analysis (TDA) in fused silica capillary capillaries. FIDA is a ""ligand-binding"" assay and has therefore certain features in common with Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), and Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) based techniques. However, FIDA probes a single in-solution binding event and thus makes assay development straightforward, and the absolute size measurement enables built-in assay quality control. Further, as FIDA does not involve surface chemistries, complications related to nonspecific adsorption of analyte and assay components are minimized enabling direct measurement in, e.g., plasma and serum.",The Control of Glucose and Lactate Levels in Nutrient Medium After Cell Incubation and in Microdialysates of Human Adipose Tissue by Capillary Electrophoresis with Contactless Conductivity Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847786,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 04 22,"Two methods of capillary electrophoresis with contactless conductivity detection have been developed for monitoring the levels of glucose and lactate in clinical samples.

This pattern can change in certain diseases, which has resulted in interest in using AGP glycoforms as potential biomarkers for these diseases. This report describes a method that uses capillary electrophoresis to characterize and analyze AGP glycoforms both in purified samples of AGP and in human serum. This method uses static and dynamic coatings of poly(ethylene oxide) that are applied to a silica capillary for separation of AGP glycoforms in the reversed-polarity mode of CE and in the presence of negligible electroosmotic flow. Electrophoretic injection is performed onto such capillaries by using a stationary stacking interface between the sample and running buffer. In addition, acidic precipitation and desalting are used to allow for the isolation and the analysis of AGP from only 65 μL of serum. Up to eleven AGP glycoform bands can be reproducibly separated by this method, with the difference in migration time between neighboring bands being 12- to almost 60-fold larger than the standard deviation for the migration time of any given band. A limit of detection down to about 2 nM per glycoform band can be obtained by this method for AGP in serum based on absorbance detection and without the need for further sample modification or labeling.",Monitorization of α1-Acid Glycoprotein Deglycosylation Using SU-8 Microchips Electrophoresis with LIF Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847782,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 04 22,"In the last few years, biopharmaceuticals-therapeutic drugs which are generally obtained by using molecular biology techniques-have become a major growing sector in pharmaceutical industry. A large part of these biopharmaceuticals are therapeutic glycoproteins. The production of these drugs and their purification process are implying the development of efficient analytical methods, which allow quick and reliable control of the manufacturing process and ensuring the regulatory compliance about the quality of these drugs. Capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is becoming a method of choice in the quality control of these biopharmaceuticals. On the other hand, CGE can be improved if analyses are carried out in microchip format.This chapter reports a detailed microchips gel electrophoresis (MGE) method to separate glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) labeled with Chromeo P540, using SU-8 microchips and laser induced fluorescence detection. Due to the analogy between AGP and some therapeutic glycoproteins, we have selected AGP as a model system to illustrate the potential of MGE in the analysis of this type of biopharmaceutical compounds.",Rapid and Sensitive Determination of Branched-Chain Amino Acids in Human Plasma by Capillary Electrophoresis with Contactless Conductivity Detection for Physiological Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847781,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019 04 22,"Capillary electrophoresis (CE) with contactless conductivity detection (C4D) represents a strong tool for determining amino acids in clinical samples. This chapter provides detailed instructions for CE/C4D determination of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) valine, isoleucine, and leucine in human plasma, which can be readily employed in physiological studies. Baseline separation of all the BCAAs is achieved on a short separation length equal to 18 cm in optimized background electrolyte consisting of 3.2 M acetic acid dissolved in 20% v/v methanol with addition of 1.0% v/v INST-coating solution. The analysis time does not exceed 3 min and the limit of detection is 0.4 μM for all BCAAs. The pretreatment of human plasma is very simple and is based on fourfold plasma dilution by acetonitrile and subsequent filtration. Only 50 μL of plasma is used for the analysis. The high sensitivity of the CE/C4D method is achieved by injecting a large volume of sample, combined with application of negative pressure to flush the acetonitrile zone out of the capillary."

Alternative medicine utilizes Gymnema inodorum Lour for antipyretic and anti-allergic purposes. There are also other research studies to treat diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, cataract, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, liver cancer, and stomach cancer. This study used particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) technique to analyze the elements in this plant. The advantage of this technique over other methods is the multi-elemental analysis and high sensitivity. The objective of this study was to determine the elemental compositions and to develop new standard methods for analyzing plant elemental compositions in Thailand. A 2-MeV proton beam was used to identify and characterize major and minor elements namely Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, and Zn in Gymnema Inodorum Lour. Results have shown that these elements are present in varying concentrations in the selected parts: roots, stems, and leaves.

This study aims to evaluate the associations between circulating antioxidant minerals and clinical biomarkers of vascular calcification in HD patients. Blood biochemical parameters, antioxidant minerals (selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg)), and several promoters and inhibitors of calcification (matrix Gla protein (MGP), fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and -9), and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and -2)) were determined in HD patients (n = 62) and age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n = 30). Compared with healthy subjects, HD patients had significantly lower plasma concentrations of Se and Zn, increased Cu and Mg, and higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (Cu/Zn ratios, malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and C-reactive protein (CRP)). We observed that HD patients had significantly lower concentrations of MGP and higher levels of FGF-23, MMP-2 and -9, TIMP-1 and -2, and MMP-2/TIMP-2 and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratios. We also observed significant relationships between the concentrations of these minerals and calcification biomarkers in HD patients. These results suggest that changes in the homeostasis of antioxidant minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg) may contribute to the effects of oxidative stress and inflammatory status, thereby participating in the mechanism for accelerated vascular calcification in patients undergoing long-term HD.",Multi-organ segmentation of the head and neck area: an efficient hierarchical neural networks approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847761,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2019 04 19,"In radiation therapy, a key step for a successful cancer treatment is image-based treatment planning.

US efforts have focused on discovery of natural enemies, like viruses, to provide sustainable control of the ant. Nine new virus genomes were sequenced from the invasive fire ant Solenopsis invicta using metagenomic RNA sequencing. The virus genomes were verified by Sanger sequencing and random amplification of cDNA ends reactions. In addition to the nine new virus genomes, the previously described Solenopsis viruses were also detected, including Solenopsis invicta virus 1 (SINV-1), SINV-2, SINV-3, SINV-4, SINV-5, and Solenopsis invicta densovirus. The virus sequences came from S. invicta workers, larvae, pupae, and dead workers taken from midden piles collected from across the ant's native range in Formosa, Argentina. One of the new virus genomes (Solenopsis invicta virus 6) was also detected in populations of North American S. invicta. Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase, the entire nonstructural polyprotein, and genome characteristics were used to tentatively taxonomically place these new virus genome sequences; these include four new species of Dicistroviridae, one Polycipiviridae, one Iflaviridae, one Totiviridae, and two genome sequences that were too taxonomically divergent to be placed with certainty. The S. invicta virome is the best characterized from any ant species and includes 13 positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses (Solenopsis invicta virus 1 to Solenopsis invicta virus 13), one double-stranded RNA virus (Solenopsis midden virus), and one double-stranded DNA virus (Solenopsis invicta densovirus).

Examining Fear Appeals, Help-Seeking Determinants, and Help-Seeking Sources Among University Employees Who Suffer from Depression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847753,Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2019 03 08,"Health promotion strategies have largely focused on activating risk perceptions for health conditions in resistant at-risk populations in order to induce behavior change. Yet, doing so remains a questionable approach when promoting help-seeking behaviors among individuals who suffer from depression because clinical symptoms can negatively affect interpretations and responses to such efforts. This study sought to test the effects and effectiveness of risk-based health messaging utilizing fear appeals on help-seeking determinants, intentions, and sources. One hundred seventeen university employees affected by symptoms of depression were recruited to participate in a lab-based experimental setting. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three message conditions that differed in strength of fear appeal (low, moderate, high) when inducing suicide risk perceptions and promoting help-seeking. Consistent with previous research, participants indicated high stigma perceptions and low intentions to seek help. Risk-based messaging strategies such as fear appeals did not have an effect on help-seeking intentions in this sample. Intentions were largely determined by positive outcome expectations and social norms, whereas efficacy perceptions were positive and not a predictor of help-seeking intentions. Participants were most likely to seek help from intimate partners and friends and least likely to utilize a help-line. Health promotion messages should contain cues that activate, rather than change, the already positive outcome expectations of seeking help when targeting at-risk populations. Future research should explore possibilities for health promotion and education among support networks of those who suffer from depression and anxiety.",An Analysis of Response Shifts in Teacher Reports Associated with the Use of a Universal School-Based Intervention to Reduce Externalising Behaviour.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847752,Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,2019 03 08,"School-based psychosocial interventions are a widely used approach to prevent or reduce externalising behaviour. However, evaluating the effects of such interventions is complicated by the fact that the interventions may not only change the target behaviour, but also the way that informants report on that behaviour. For example, teachers may become more aware of bullying behaviour after delivering lessons on the topic, resulting in increased teacher reports of the behaviour. In this study, we used multi-group confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate whether teachers exposed to the Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS) intervention changed the way they reported on child externalising behaviour. Using data from the z-proso study (802 participants; 51% male; 69 teachers), teacher reports of aggressive behaviour, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and non-aggressive conduct disorder symptoms were compared pre- and post- intervention and across the intervention and control conditions. There was no evidence that teacher reporting was affected by exposure to the intervention. This helps bolster the interpretation of intervention effects as reflecting changes in child behaviour, rather than in the manner of informant reporting."

Thus, EGFR-mutational status should be assessed at diagnosis and in the course of treatment with TKI. However, tissue samples are not always evaluable, and molecular profiling has been increasingly performed in cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) from blood samples. Our objective is to evaluate the reliability of ctDNA profiling in plasma samples in a real-world setting. We retrospectively analyzed the patients diagnosed with non-squamous NSCLC from May 2016 to December 2017 at Hospital Universitario Doctor Peset who had been tested for EGFR mutations in tissue and plasma samples. Both samples were sent to an external laboratory to perform the analysis by the cobas® EGFR assay. Percentage of agreement and concordance were calculated by kappa statistic. Of 102 patients reviewed, 89 were eligible. The overall EGFR mutation frequency was 18.6% for the evaluable tissue samples and 19.6% for evaluable plasma samples. Mutation status concordance between matched samples was 87.4%. Cohen's kappa index (κ) = 0.6 (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 91.7%, positive predictive value 66.7%, negative predictive value 93%). When concordance was stablished only in stage IV tumors κ = 0.7, suggesting a higher agreement in advanced disease. This real-world data suggest that plasma is a feasible sample for ctDNA EGFR mutation assessment.

Certain members of the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family regulate plant secondary metabolism. Although it is clearly documented that AP2/ERF transcription factors (TFs) are involved in sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis, the regulation of diterpenoid biosynthesis by AP2/ERF TFs remains elusive. Here, we report that the novel AP2/ERF TF SmERF128 positively regulates diterpenoid tanshinone biosynthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza. Overexpression of SmERF128 increased the expression levels of copalyl diphosphate synthase 1 (SmCPS1), kaurene synthase-like 1 (SmKSL1) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 76AH1 (SmCYP76AH1), whereas their expression levels were decreased when SmERF128 was silenced. Accordingly, the content of tanshinone was reduced in SmERF128 RNA interference (RNAi) hairy roots and dramatically increased in SmERF128 overexpression hairy roots, as demonstrated through Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Furthermore, SmERF128 activated the expression of SmCPS1, SmKSL1, and SmCYP76AH1 by binding to the GCC box, and to the CRTDREHVCBF2 (CBF2) and RAV1AAT (RAA) motifs within their promoters during in vivo and in vitro assays.

However, many pathologists in Japan cannot diagnose astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumors according to the 2016 WHO CNS due to financial or technical problems. Therefore, the Japan Society of Brain Tumor Pathology established a committee for molecular diagnosis to facilitate the integrated diagnosis of astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors in Japan. We created three levels of diagnoses: Level 1 was defined as simple histopathological diagnosis using hematoxylin and eosin staining and routine cell lineage-based immunostaining. Level 2 was defined as immunohistochemical diagnosis using immunohistochemical examinations using R132H mutation-specific IDH1, ATRX, and/or p53 antibodies. Level 3 was defined as molecular diagnosis, such as diagnosis based on 1p/19q status or the mutation status of the IDH1 and IDH2 genes. In principle, astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors should be diagnosed based on the 2016 WHO CNS and/or cIMPACT-NOW criteria; however, the findings obtained through our diagnostic flowchart can be added to the histological diagnosis in parentheses.

Executive functioning (EF) may be the cognitive and regulatory mechanism that underlies these difficulties. Parents rated 92 children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more challenges than 94 typically developing children on measures of EF (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function; BRIEF), functional communication (FC), and verbal conversation (VC) skills. For both groups, the BRIEF metacognition scale emerged as a strong predictor of FC, while the BRIEF behavior regulation and the inhibit scale were predictive of VC skills. These findings suggest that targeting EF domains specifically may improve FC and VC skills in children with ASD.",Identifying the Cognitive Correlates of Reciprocity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847708,Journal of autism and developmental disorders,2019 03 08,"This study examined the cognitive correlates of reciprocity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Then the sensitization of tumor cells to ionizing radiation (IR) would be beneficial in cancer treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the synergistic effect of mefenamic acid (MEF) on colon cancer cell (HT-29) exposure to IR. HT-29 cells were treated with MEF and then exposed to IR. The synergistic effect of MEF is evaluated by clonogenic assay and flow cytometry. The productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined in irradiated and treated cells with MEF. The findings of this study showed that MEF had anti-cancer effect on colon cancer cell line and it increased the apoptosis in irradiated HT-29 cells. Also MEF reduced the number of cell colonies when HT-29 cells pre-treated with MEF and irradiated. MEF increased ROS production in irradiated cells. This additive effect of MEF with IR in killing of HT-29 cell was observed at low (10 μM) and medium (100 μM) concentrations of MEF.

Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is fundamental for tumor growth and metastasis. The role of local anesthetics on tumor angiogenesis still remains unknown. Using human lung tumor-associated endothelial cell (HLT-EC) and angiogenesis models, our work shows that ropivacaine at the clinically relevant concentration is active against multiple biological functions of HLT-EC but not lung tumor cells. Ropivacaine inhibits HLT-EC capillary network formation, growth and survival. The anti-angiogenic activity of ropivacaine is further confirmed in in vivo angiogenesis mouse model. Mechanistically, we show that ropivacaine inhibits HLT-EC mitochondrial respiration via specifically targeting mitochondrial respiratory complex II. As a consequence of mitochondrial respiration inhibition, we observe the energy depletion, oxidative stress and damage in HLT-EC after ropivacaine exposure. Additionally, an antioxidant agent completely reverses the inhibitory effects of ropivacaine, suggesting that oxidative stress is required for the action of ropivacaine in HLT-EC. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by ropivacaine is sodium channel-independent. Our work demonstrates the potent inhibitory effects of ropivacaine in lung tumor angiogenesis by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings provide significant insight into the potential mechanisms by which local anaesthetics may negatively affect tumor reoccurrence and metastasis.",Imaging of changes in copper trafficking and redistribution in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick C disease using positron emission tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847690,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",2019 04 17,"Niemann-Pick C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in the NPC1 (95% of cases) or NPC2 genes.

In this study we have used whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) and brain electronic autoradiography with copper-64 (64Cu), in the form of the copper(II) bis(thiosemicarbazonato) complex 64Cu-GTSM, to image short-term changes in copper trafficking after intravenous injection in a transgenic mouse model of NPC1 disease. 64Cu-GTSM is taken up in all tissues and dissociates rapidly inside cells, allowing monitoring of the subsequent efflux and redistribution of 64Cu from all tissues. Significantly enhanced retention of 64Cu radioactivity was observed in brain, lungs and blood at 15 h post-injection in symptomatic Npc1-/- transgenic mice compared to wildtype controls. The enhanced retention of 64Cu in brain was confirmed by electronic autoradiography, particularly in the midbrain, thalamus, medulla and pons regions. Positron emission tomography imaging with 64Cu in selected chemical forms could be a useful diagnostic and research tool for the management and understanding of NPC1 disease.","Diagnostic, clinical, and personality correlates of food anxiety during a food exposure in patients diagnosed with an eating disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847689,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2019 03 29,"Eating disorders are characterized by high levels of anxiety, especially while eating.

Complementing experimental databases, virtual databases are thereby increasingly established through the first-principles calculation of computationally inexpensive, but for a given application, decisive microscopic quantities of the system. These so-called descriptors are calculated for vast numbers of candidate materials. In general, the sheer volume of datapoints generated in such studies precludes an in depth human analysis. To this end, smart visualization techniques, based e.g., on so-called chemical space networks (CSN), have been developed to extract general design rules connecting structural modifications to changes in the target functionality. In this work, we generate and visualize the CSN of possible crystalline organic semiconductors based on an in-house database of > 64,000 molecular crystals that we extracted from the exhaustive Cambridge Structural Database and for which we computed prominent charge-mobility descriptors. Our CSN thereby links clusters of molecular crystals based on the chemical similarity of the scaffolds of their molecular building blocks and thus groups communities of similar molecules. Including each cluster's median descriptor values, the CSN visualization not only reproduces known trends of good organic semiconductors but also allows us to extract general design rules for organic molecular scaffolds. Finally, the local environment of each scaffold in our visualization shows how thoroughly its local chemical space has already been explored synthetically. Of special interest here are those clusters with promising descriptor values, yet with little or no connections in the sampled chemical space, as these offer the most room for scaffold optimization.","Localised scleroderma en coup de sabre affecting the skin, dentition and bone tissue within craniofacial neural crest fields.

Recent genetic findings have confirmed that elevated Lp(a) similar to elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) might be causally related to premature ASCVD. Lp(a) is relatively refractory to lifestyle interventions. The results of studies with statins and their possible effect on Lp(a) are conflicting. Specific Lp(a) apheresis is used as a treatment against background statin therapy and can decrease Lp(a). The purpose of this review is to discuss whether new drugs which decrease Lp(a) can prevent ASCVD and decrease ASCVD mortality when applied in addition to statins.

It is possible, however, that spending time with parents not only protects against the onset of depressive symptoms, but also reduces symptoms in adolescents who are already depressed. The current study was designed to test this formulation while also examining whether affective dimensions of family functioning - specifically parental warmth - accounted for or moderated observed associations. Finally, we tested the reverse direction of the associations, examining whether greater severity of depression in adolescents results in parents spending less time with them. Forty-one adolescents (ages 14 to 17 years) who met criteria for a current major depressive episode participated in the present study with one parent. Once each month for six time points, dyads completed reports of depressive symptoms and the amount of time parents and adolescents spent with each other. Participants also completed measures of parental warmth. Results of lagged multilevel modeling indicated that spending more time with a parent predicted fewer depressive symptoms in adolescents at the following assessment relative to their mean; in contrast, greater severity of depressive symptoms did not predict spending less time with a parent at the following assessment. In contrast, parental warmth did not account for or moderate the association between time together and depressive symptoms.

Fundamental questions remain about how different types of fluid stresses translate to red cell membrane failure. While cellular- and molecular-level simulations hold promise, spatial resolution to such small scales is computationally intensive. This review summarizes approaches to continuum-level modeling of hemolysis, a method that is likely to be useful well into the future for design of typical cardiovascular devices. Weaknesses are revealed for the Eulerian method of hemolysis prediction and for the linearized damage function. Wide variations in scaling of red cell membrane tension are demonstrated with different types of fluid stresses when the scalar fluid stress is the same, as well as when the energy dissipation rate is the same. New experimental data are needed for red cell damage in simple flows with controlled levels of different types of stresses, including laminar shear, laminar extension (normal), turbulent shear, and turbulent extension. Such data can be curve-fit to create more universal continuum-level models and can serve to validate numerical simulations.",Temperature-Dependent HfO2/Si Interface Structural Evolution and its Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847661,Nanoscale research letters,2019 03 29,"In this work, hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films are deposited on p-type Si substrates by remote plasma atomic layer deposition on p-type Si at 250 °C, followed by a rapid thermal annealing in nitrogen.

The crystallization of the HfO2 films and HfO2/Si interface is studied by field emission transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. The experimental results show that during annealing, the oxygen diffuse from HfO2 to Si interface. For annealing temperature below 400 °C, the HfO2 film and interfacial layer are amorphous, and the latter consists of HfO2 and silicon dioxide (SiO2). At annealing temperature of 450-550 °C, the HfO2 film become multiphase polycrystalline, and a crystalline SiO2 is found at the interface. Finally, at annealing temperature beyond 550 °C, the HfO2 film is dominated by single-phase polycrystalline, and the interfacial layer is completely transformed to crystalline SiO2.","Competitive fluorometric assay for the food toxin T-2 by using DNA-modified silver nanoclusters, aptamer-modified magnetic beads, and exponential isothermal amplification.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847660,Mikrochimica acta,2019 04 25,"The authors describe an aptamer based assay for the mycotoxin T-2.

This study assessed STE at admission and during the treatment of patients with sepsis to evaluate its changes as a potential factor for predicting in-hospital outcome. This study included 26 patients with sepsis who underwent STE echocardiography on day 1 and 7 during treatment. Myocardial deformation of both ventricles was assessed using global longitudinal strain. The endpoint was in-hospital mortality. The mean age was 51.4 ± 18.3 years, and 54% were female. The average SOFA score at T0 was 8.6 ± 3.8 points and at day 7 was 4.9 ± 4.7 points.

Primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, myocardial infarction associated with percutaneous coronary intervention, bleeding complication requiring transfusion, and stent thrombosis during in-hospital stay. Propensity score matching (PS) and instrumental variable (IV) analyses were used to account for treatment selection. The incidence of post-treatment adverse events was lower in the TRI group by 0.95% compared to the TFI group with PS (p < 0.001) and by 0.34% with IV (p = 0.127). A significantly lower risk for access site bleeding was observed by 0.34% with PS (p < 0.001) and by 0.53% with IV (p < 0.001). Radial access was related to a significantly lower risk for access site bleeding compared with femoral access, even without strong antithrombotic drugs for ACS in Japan, and may also relate to lower risk for a wider set of post-treatment adverse events."

Exposure to a live cat induces striking activation in the rostrodorsal and caudal ventral PAG. In the present investigation, we first showed that cytotoxic lesions of the rostrodorsal and caudal ventral PAG had similar effects on innate fear responses during cat exposure, practically abolishing freezing and increasing risk assessment responses. Conversely, rostrodorsal PAG lesions but not caudal ventral lesions disrupted learned contextual fear responses to cat exposure. Next, we examined how muscimol inactivation of the rostrodorsal PAG at different times (i.e., during, immediately after and 20 min after cat exposure) influences learned contextual fear responses, and we found that inactivation of the rostrodorsal PAG during or immediately after cat exposure but not 20 min later impaired contextual fear learning. Thus, suggesting that the rostrodorsal PAG is involved in the acquisition, but not the consolidation, of contextual fear memory to predatory threat. Notably, the dosolateral PAG contains a distinct population of neurons containing the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) enzyme, and in the last experiment, we investigated how nitric oxide released in rostrodorsal PAG influences contextual fear memory processing. Accordingly, injection of a selective nNOS inhibitor into the rostrodorsal PAG immediately after cat exposure disrupted learned contextual responses. Overall, the present findings suggest that the acquisition of contextual fear learning is influenced by an optimum level of dorsal PAG activation, which extends from during to shortly after predator exposure and depends on local NO release.",Uncovering the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle and its topological organization in non-human primates: the missing connection for language evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847641,Brain structure & function,2019 05 10,"Whether brain networks underlying the multimodal processing of language in humans are present in non-human primates is an unresolved question in primate evolution. Conceptual awareness in humans, which is the backbone of verbal and non-verbal semantic elaboration, involves intracerebral connectivity via the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle (IFOF). While non-human primates can communicate through visual information channels, there has been no formal demonstration that they possess a functional homologue of the human IFOF. Therefore, we undertook a post-mortem diffusion MRI tractography study in conjunction with Klingler micro-dissection to search for IFOF fiber tracts in brain of Old-World (vervet) monkeys. We found clear and concordant evidence from both techniques for the existence of bilateral fiber tracts connecting the frontal and occipital lobes. These tracts closely resembled the human IFOF with respect to trajectory, topological organization, and cortical terminal fields. Moreover, these fibers are clearly distinct from other bundles previously described in this region of monkey brain, i.e., the inferior longitudinal and uncinate fascicles, and the external and extreme capsules. This demonstration of an IFOF in brain of a species that diverged from the human lineage some 22 millions years ago enhances our comprehension about the evolution of language and social behavior.",A combination of oral L-citrulline and L-arginine improved 10-min full-power cycling test performance in male collegiate soccer players: a randomized crossover trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847640,European journal of applied physiology,2019 05 05,"Oral L-citrulline (Cit) increases plasma L-arginine (Arg) concentration and the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO dilates blood vessels and potentially improves sports performance. The combination of oral Arg and Cit (Arg + Cit) immediately and synergistically increases plasma Arg and nitrite/nitrate (NOx) concentrations more than either Cit or Arg alone.

In addition, previous research has paid limited attention to the mechanisms that could help to explain teacher effects. This 5-wave study (2010-2015) examined the effects of perceived teacher support on the anti-immigrant attitudes of Swedish majority youth (N = 671, Mage = 13.41, 50.2% girls, 34 classrooms). It also tested whether social trust would mediate these effects. The results of multilevel analyses showed that perceived teacher support was associated with less prejudice at all levels of analysis. At the within-person level, fluctuations in teacher support were related to fluctuations in youth prejudice: in years when, on average, adolescents perceived their teachers as more supportive, they reported lower prejudice. At the between-person level, adolescents who perceived their teachers as more supportive compared to their peers reported lower prejudice. Similarly, classrooms where students shared an experience of teacher support were lower in prejudice than classrooms with weaker teacher support. The results also showed that social trust explained teacher effects: adolescents who experienced their teachers as more supportive displayed higher levels of trust and, in turn, lower levels of prejudice than youth with less supportive teachers. These findings suggest that teachers can counteract the development of prejudice and facilitate social trust in adolescents by being supportive of them.",Autonomy-related Parenting Processes and Adolescent Adjustment in Latinx Immigrant Families.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847637,Journal of youth and adolescence,2019 05 21,"It is unclear how autonomy-related parenting processes are associated with Latinx adolescent adjustment. This study uses Latent Profile Analysis to identify typologies of parental monitoring and parent-adolescent conflict and examines their association with Latinx youth's school performance and depressive symptoms. The sample included 248 Latinx 9th and 10th graders (50% female) who completed surveys during fall (Time 1) and spring (Time 2) semesters of the school year. When compared to a high monitoring/low conflict parenting profile, a moderate monitoring/moderate conflict profile was associated with stronger declines in school performance; for boys, a high monitoring/moderately high conflict profile also was associated with greater increases in depressive symptoms. For Latinx immigrant families, researchers should consider monitoring and conflict as co-occurring processes.",Accuracy and precision of protein structures determined by magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy: for some 'with a little help from a friend'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847635,Journal of biomolecular NMR,2019 04 06,"We present a systematic investigation into the attainable accuracy and precision of protein structures determined by heteronuclear magic angle spinning solid-state NMR for a set of four proteins of varied size and secondary structure content. Structures were calculated using synthetically generated random sets of C-C distances up to 7 Å at different degrees of completeness. For single-domain proteins, 9-15 restraints per residue are sufficient to derive an accurate model structure, while maximum accuracy and precision are reached with over 15 restraints per residue. For multi-domain proteins and protein assemblies, additional information on domain orientations, quaternary structure and/or protein shape is needed. As demonstrated for the HIV-1 capsid protein assembly, this can be accomplished by integrating MAS NMR with cryoEM data. In all cases, inclusion of TALOS-derived backbone torsion angles improves the accuracy for small number of restraints, while no further increases are noted for restraint completeness above 40%. In contrast, inclusion of TALOS-derived torsion angle restraints consistently increases the precision of the structural ensemble at all degrees of distance restraint completeness.",Identifying Risk Factors for Disordered Eating among Female Youth in Primary Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847634,Child psychiatry and human development,2019 03 08,"Eating disorders are a serious, life-threating condition impacting adolescents and young adults.

A latent class analysis with twenty psychosocial factors identified three DE risk groups. The group at highest risk for DE was characterized by endorsement of internalizing symptoms and a history of trauma. The next risk group consisted of those with externalizing symptoms, particularly substance use. The group at lowest risk for DE reported more time spent with friends compared to their peers.

Elephantopus scaber, a tropical plant species has been recognized for its various pharmacological activities and especially anti-snake venom property; however, the molecular basis for this property is not understood. It is reported that snake venom PLA2 is a toxic factor with pharmacological effects independent of their catalytic activity. Here we report the inhibition of catalytic property of Cobra and Viper (group I and group II) snake venom PLA2 by the phytocompounds from E. scaber through molecular docking and dynamics studies. Initially, Lipinski's rule, ADMET, and molecular docking studies were carried out. Our results show that among 124 phytocompounds, crepiside E (deacylcynaropicrin-3' beta-glucopyranoside) has shown interactions with the conserved catalytic active site residues, His 48 and Asp 49, in both the PLA2s. Further, molecular dynamic simulations for 60 ns confirmed the stability of crepiside E in the active site of PLA2s and were found to be stable throughout the simulation. In order to understand the drug-likeness of crepiside E, pIC50 and MMGBSA scores were correlated by performing a linear regression analysis. Crepiside E was found to have similar chemical features to that of doxycycline, a known PLA2 inhibitor as indicated by a similarity score of 64.15%. Hence, it is concluded that crepiside E beta glucopyranoside present in Elephantopus scaber contributes to neutralizing the snake venom."

However, little is known about the role of the plant nucleolus under environmental stresses such as heat and chilling stress. In this study, we analyzed nucleolus morphology by determining the distribution of newly synthesized rRNAs with an analog of uridine, 5-ethynyl uridine (EU). When EU was incorporated into the root of the Arabidopsis thaliana, EU signals were strongly localized in the nucleolus. The results of the short-term incorporation of EU implied that there is no compartmentation among the processes of transcription, processing, and construction of rRNAs. Nevertheless, under heat and chilling stress, EU was not incorporated into the center of the nucleolus. Morphological analyses using whole rRNA staining and differential interference contrast observations revealed speckled and round structures in the center of the nucleolus under heat and chilling stress, respectively.",Oral infection of mice and host cell invasion by Trypanosoma cruzi strains from Mexico.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847614,Parasitology research,2019 04 26,"Oral infection by Trypanosoma cruzi has been responsible for frequent outbreaks of acute Chagas disease in the north of South America and in the Amazon region, where T. cruzi genetic group TcI predominates. TcI strains from different geographical regions have been used in oral infection in mice, but there is no information about strains from Mexico where TcI is prevalent. Here, we analyzed four Mexican strains as concerns the course of oral infection, the ability to invade host cells in vitro, and the profile of metacyclic trypomastigote surface molecules gp82 and gp90 that are implicated in parasite internalization. Oral infection of mice with metacyclic forms of all strains resulted in reduced blood and tissue parasitism, and mild to moderate inflammatory process in the heart/skeletal muscle. They expressed pepsin-resistant gp82 and gp90 molecules at high levels and invaded host cells poorly in full nutrient medium and efficiently under nutrient-deprived condition. The properties exhibited by Mexican strains were similar to those displayed by TcI strains from other geographical regions, reinforcing the notion that these features are common to the genetic group TcI as a whole.","First ultrastructural and cytochemical data on the spermatozoon and its differentiation in progenetic and adult Archigetes sieboldi Leuckart, 1878 (Cestoda, Caryophyllidea, Caryophyllaeidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847613,Parasitology research,2019 05 03,"Spermiogenesis in progenetic and adult stages of Archigetes sieboldi Leuckart, 1878, a tapeworm parasitic in oligochaetes and fish respectively, has been examined using transmission electron microscopy and cytochemical staining for glycogen. General pattern of spermiogenesis is essentially like that of other caryophyllideans, i.e., apical dense material in the zone of differentiation in the early stages of spermiogenesis, rotation of free flagellum and a flagellar bud, and proximo-distal fusion. Interestingly, rotation of a free flagellum and flagellar bud to the median cytoplasmic process (MCP) has been observed unconventionally at > 90° only in progenetic stages. Typical striated roots associated with the centrioles occur rarely in A. sieboldi, and only in form of faint structures in advanced stages of spermiogenesis. In contrast to most caryophyllideans studied to date, penetration of the nucleus into the spermatid body has started before the fusion of the free flagellum with the MCP. This feature has been reported rarely but exclusively in the family Caryophyllaeidae. The unipartite mature spermatozoon of A. sieboldi is composed of one axoneme of the 9 + '1' trepaxonematan pattern with its centriole, parallel nucleus, and parallel cortical microtubules which are situated in a moderately electron-dense cytoplasm with glycogen particles. An unusual arrangement of cortical microtubules in the two parallel rows in region I of the spermatozoon is described here for the first time in the Caryophyllidea. Ultrastructural data on spermiogenesis and the spermatozoon in A. sieboldi from tubuficids and carp are compared and discussed with those in other caryophyllideans and/or Neodermata.","First report of sparganosis manifested by pleuritis and decreased peripheral blood eosinophils in Jiangsu province, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847612,Parasitology research,2019 04 26,"Sparganosis is a parasitic infection caused by the metacestode stage of Spirometra mansoni and some other related diphyllobothriidean cestodes.

In this study, the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), the mitochondrial region spanning the COI-trnT-rrnL, and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit I (NADI) markers were used to characterize Fasciola flukes from Algeria. Fasciola appeared widespread from the east to the west of Algeria. Among 1701 sampled cattle from 8 Algerian provinces, 5% were infected. Using morphological and morphometric analysis, one morphotype of Fasciola was observed. Nuclear ITS marker indicated that all collected flukes belong to F. hepatica. Multiple alignments of ITS dataset revealed two haplotypes, one described here for the first time. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of mitochondrial markers revealed weak population structure in Algeria. Mismatch distributions, neutrality tests, and median-joining network analysis all were compatible with a recent expansion of Algerian F. hepatica population. Fasciolosis appeared common in Algerian cattle, it seems that the absence of control strategy coupled to the favorable Mediterranean climate may lead to a reconstruction and dispersion of its populations.

This study was conducted to investigate the periodical alterations of whole cellular lipids and their associations with secondary products in Trichoderma brevicompactum. An electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry-based lipidomics strategy was used to acquire the metabolic profiles of membrane lipids during fermentation. Univariate analyses showed that most fungi glycerophospholipids were significantly altered at the early phase compared with the late phase. In addition, correlation analyses showed high correlations between phosphatidylcholine alterations and fermentation duration. In addition, the fermentation-associated alterations of phosphatidylcholines were found to be in accordance with the degrees of unsaturation of acyl-chains. Harzianum A reached a maximum on the 12th day, while trichodermin and 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one showed the highest abundances on the 9th day, both of which were inclined to correlate with the alterations of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines, respectively.

Composting the agricultural waste can reduce emissions and provide 'compost' as an organic fertilizer and soil amendment; yet, it has not been implemented at the national level. To develop a local marketing strategy for compost, this study views a need to identify farmers' perceptions and willingness of compost production and use in agriculture and examine various socioeconomic, agricultural, and individual factors shaping them. The case of Wadi al-Far'a watershed (WFW) is investigated, where farmers practice inappropriate waste disposal and overuse of agrochemicals. A semi-structured questionnaire is administered to 409 farmers through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, Chi-square test, and binary logistic regression are used for data analysis. High acceptance level (84%) is disclosed among farmers in WFW for the hypothetical idea of producing and using compost. Farmers also have high, yet lower, willingness level (63.6%) of the more salient option of producing compost themselves and using it in agriculture. Tenure systems, large cultivated areas, rainfed irrigation, and lack of access to training sessions inhibit farmers' acceptance of the idea of compost production (overall p value = 0.000). Large cultivated areas and rainfed irrigation is also associated with farmers' unwillingness to produce compost, besides high household monthly income, animal or mixed animal-plant farming, experience in compost production, and use of pesticides (overall p value = 0.000).",Blood Glucose Regulation for Post-Operative Patients with Diabetics and Hypertension Continuum: A Cascade Control-Based Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847581,Journal of medical systems,2019 04 02,"Management of glycemic level in post-operative condition is critical for hypertensive patients and the post-operative stress may results in hyperglycemia, hyper insulin and osmotic diuresis.

We also showed that various hexoses and polyols interact with phospholipid and alter the phase transition temperature. Thus, we hypothesized that the improvement of barrier recovery by hexoses and polyols might be related to the interaction with phospholipid. Here, we tested this idea by examining the effects of xylitol (a component of some skin-care products) and fructose on lipid dynamics in an epidermal-equivalent model at the single-cell level by means of two-photon microscopy after staining with Laurdan, a fluorescent dye sensitive to the physical properties of its membrane environment. First, we confirmed that topical application of xylitol aqueous solution on tape-stripped human skin accelerated barrier recovery. Then, we examined changes of lipid fluidity in the epidermal-equivalent model after application of water or an aqueous solution of xylitol or fructose. Application of xylitol and/or fructose increased the lipid fluidity in the uppermost part of the stratum granulosum layer, compared to treatment with water alone, and accelerated the exocytosis of lamellar bodies to the intercellular domain between stratum corneum and stratum granulosum. Our results support the idea that the improvement of epidermal barrier homeostasis upon topical application of xylitol or fructose is due to increased lipid fluidity in the uppermost layer of the stratum granulosum, which enables accelerated release of lipid from the stratum granulosum, thereby improving the lamellar structure and accelerating epidermal permeability barrier recovery.",Gestational trophoblastic neoplasms (GTNs) do not display epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) features.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847562,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2019 03 08,"Although epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been described in the development of complete hydatidiform moles and the invasion of the maternal decidua by trophoblasts during normal human placentation, its implication in gestational trophoblastic neoplasm (GTN) without villi is totally unknown.

RA causes significant disability and diminishes health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). The aim of this study was to investigate how RAPID3 is related to HR-QoL in patients with RA. In this cross-sectional study performed at the tertiary outpatient clinic 68 consecutive patients (58 females, and 10 males) with established RA were enrolled. RAPID3 and EuroQoL-5D-3L (EQ-5D-3L) were used to measure disease activity and quality of life, respectively. Alongside, demographic and clinical data were obtained, as well as HAQ-DI as a measure of physical function, and Steinbrocker's score for radiographic damage. To test the relationships among RAPID3 and study variables we used the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, with the significance was set at P < 0.05. Linear and forward stepwise regression was used to show how variables of interest contributed to RAPID3. The mean value of RAPID3 (standard deviation, SD) was 14.12 (± 5.21), while the median (IQR) value of EQ-5D-3L was 0.51 (0.62-0.23). There was a high significant correlation (r = - 0.73) between RAPID3 scores and EQ-5D-3L. Among the other variables of interest, the strongest correlation was found between RAPID3 and intensity of pain (r = 0.88), while the EQ-5D-3L and pain were moderately correlated (r = - 0.68). In evaluating the influence of variables of interest on RAPID3, a forward stepwise regression model was constructed to evaluate whether VAS pain, EQ-5D-3L and EQ-VAS predicted RAPID3. The given variables significantly explained approximately 81% of the variation in RAPID3. Based on the results of this study RAPID3, a simple and practical tool to assess disease activity, reflects well HR-QoL in patients with established RA.",The contribution of astrocytes to the neuroinflammatory response in multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847559,Acta neuropathologica,2019 04 27,"Neuroinflammation is the coordinated response of the central nervous system (CNS) to threats to its integrity posed by a variety of conditions, including autoimmunity, pathogens and trauma. Activated astrocytes, in concert with other cellular elements of the CNS and immune system, are important players in the modulation of the neuroinflammatory response. During neurological disease, they produce and respond to cellular signals that often lead to dichotomous processes, which can promote further damage or contribute to repair. This occurs also in multiple sclerosis (MS), where astrocytes are now recognized as key components of its immunopathology. Evidence supporting this role has emerged not only from studies in MS patients, but also from animal models, among which the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model has proved especially instrumental. Based on this premise, the purpose of the present review is to summarize the current knowledge of astrocyte behavior in MS and EAE. Following a brief description of the pathological characteristics of the two diseases and the main functional roles of astrocytes in CNS physiology, we will delve into the specific responses of this cell population, analyzing MS and EAE in parallel. We will define the temporal and anatomical profile of astroglial activation, then focus on key processes they participate in. These include: (1) production and response to soluble mediators (e.g., cytokines and chemokines), (2) regulation of oxidative stress, and (3) maintenance of BBB integrity and function. Finally, we will review the state of the art on the available methods to measure astroglial activation in vivo in MS patients, and how this could be exploited to optimize diagnosis, prognosis and treatment decisions. Ultimately, we believe that integrating the knowledge obtained from studies in MS and EAE may help not only better understand the pathophysiology of MS, but also uncover new signals to be targeted for therapeutic intervention.",Afghanistan: conduits of human migrations identified using AmpFlSTR markers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847558,International journal of legal medicine,2019 03 08,"This study describes autosomal STR profiles of the populations of South and North Afghanistan. A total of 188 unrelated individuals residing north (n = 42) and south (n = 146) of the Hindu Kush Range within the territory of Afghanistan were examined against the background of 54 geographically targeted reference populations from Eurasia and North East Africa. The main objective of this study was to investigate longitudinal gene flow across the Hindu Kush Range and Eurasia. Genetic differentiation tests between North and South Afghanistan generated insignificant genetic differences for all loci. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots based on Fst distances and Neighbor-Joining (N-J) analysis indicated genetic affinities between the Afghani groups and Indian/Near East/West Asian populations. Admixture and Structure analyses demonstrate a gradient of genetic continuity within a major east to west cline that includes North and South Afghanistan as intermediate populations.

Metals with a density larger than 5 g cm-3 have been termed as heavy metals and have been stated to be potentially toxic to human and animals. Algae are known to be pioneer organisms with the potential to grow under extreme conditions including heavy metal-polluted sites. They have evolved efficient defense strategies to combat the toxic effects exerted by heavy metal ions. Most of the algal strains are reported to accumulate elevated metal ion concentration in cellular organelles. With respect to that, this review focuses on understanding the various strategies used by algal system for heavy metal resistance. Additionally, the application of this metal resistance in biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles and metal oxide nanoparticles has been investigated in details. We thereby conclude that algae serve as an excellent system for understanding metal uptake and accumulation. This thereby assists in the design and development of low-cost approaches for large-scale synthesis of nanoparticles and bioremediation approach, providing ample opportunities for future work.",Beneficial effects of endophytic fungi colonization on plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847542,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 05,"Due to increasingly limited water resources, diminishing farmland acreage, and potentially negative effects of climate change, an urgent need exists to improve agricultural productivity to feed the ever-growing population. Plants interact with microorganisms at all trophic levels, adapting growth, developmental, and defense responses within a complicated network of community members. Endophytic fungi have been widely reported for their ability to aid in the defense of their host plants. Currently, many reports focus on the application of endophytic fungi with the capability to produce valuable bioactive molecules, while others focus on endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents. Plant responses upon endophytic fungi colonization are also good for the immune system of the plant. In this paper, the possible mechanisms between endophytic fungi and their hosts were reviewed. During long-term evolution, plants have acquired numerous beneficial strategies in response to endophytic fungi colonization. The interaction of endophytic fungi with plants modulates the relationship between plants and both biotic and abiotic stresses. It has previously been reported that this endophytic relationship confers additional defensive mechanisms on the modulation of the plant immune system, as the result of the manipulation of direct antimicrobial metabolites such as alkaloids to indirect phytohormones, jasmonic acid, or salicylic acid. Furthermore, plants have evolved to cope with combinations of stresses and experiments are required to address specific questions related to these multiple stresses. This review summarizes our current understanding of the intrinsic mechanism to better utilize these benefits for plant growth and disease resistance. It contributes new ideas to increase plant fitness and crop productivity.",A cellulolytic fungal biofilm enhances the consolidated bioconversion of cellulose to short chain fatty acids by the rumen microbiome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847541,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 18,"The ability of the multispecies biofilm membrane reactors (MBM reactors) to provide distinguished niches for aerobic and anaerobic microbes at the same time was used for the investigation of the consolidated bioprocessing of cellulose to short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). A consortium based consolidated bioprocess (CBP) was designed. The rumen microbiome was used as the converting microbial consortium, co-cultivated with selected individual aerobic fungi which formed a biofilm on the tubular membrane flushed with oxygen. The beneficial effect of the fungal biofilm on the process yields and productivities was attributed to the enhanced cellulolytic activities compared with those achieved by the rumen microbiome alone. At 30 °C, the MBM system with Trichoderma reesei biofilm reached a concentration 39% higher (7.3 g/L SCFAs), than the rumen microbiome alone (5.1 g/L) using 15 g/L crystalline cellulose as the substrate. Fermentation temperature was crucial especially for the composition of the short chain fatty acids produced. The temperature increase resulted in shorter fatty acids produced. While a mixture of acetic, propionic, butyric, and caproic acids was produced at 30 °C with Trichoderma reesei biofilm, butyric and caproic acids were not detected during the fermentations at 37.5 °C carried out with Coprinopsis cinerea as the biofilm forming fungus. Apart from the presence of the fungal biofilm, no parameter studied had a significant impact on the total yield of organic acids produced, which reached 0.47 g of total SCFAs per g of cellulose (at 30 °C and at pH 6, with rumen inoculum to total volume ratio equal to 0.372).",Effect of range of heading differences on human visual-inertial heading estimation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847539,Experimental brain research,2019 06 10,"Both visual and inertial cues are salient in heading determination. However, optic flow can ambiguously represent self-motion or environmental motion. It is unclear how visual and inertial heading cues are determined to have common cause and integrated vs perceived independently. In four experiments visual and inertial headings were presented simultaneously with ten subjects reporting visual or inertial headings in separate trial blocks. Experiment 1 examined inertial headings within 30° of straight-ahead and visual headings that were offset by up to 60°. Perception of the inertial heading was shifted in the direction of the visual stimulus by as much as 35° by the 60° offset, while perception of the visual stimulus remained largely uninfluenced. Experiment 2 used ± 140° range of inertial headings with up to 120° visual offset. This experiment found variable behavior between subjects with most perceiving the sensory stimuli to be shifted towards an intermediate heading but a few perceiving the headings independently. The visual and inertial headings influenced each other even at the largest offsets. Experiments 3 and 4 had similar inertial headings to experiments 1 and 2, respectively, except subjects reported environmental motion direction. Experiment 4 displayed similar perceptual influences as experiment 2, but in experiment 3 percepts were independent. Results suggested that perception of visual and inertial stimuli tend to be perceived as having common causation in most subjects with offsets up to 90° although with significant variation in perception between individuals. Limiting the range of inertial headings caused the visual heading to dominate the perception.",Clinical utility of 68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography for recurrent renal cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847538,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,2019 06 10,"Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with 68Ga-labelled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N″,N″'-tetraacetic acid-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (DOTATOC) has been accepted as a diagnostic imaging tool especially for patients with neuroendocrine tumours.

The fibrogenic potentials of respirable particulates are influenced by their physicochemical properties and their interactions with major pathways to drive fibrotic development in the lung. Macrophages were exposed to six carbon nanotubes (CNTs) of varying dimensions, crystalline silica, or carbon black (CB), with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 as positive controls. Macrophage-conditioned media was collected and applied to cultures of human pulmonary fibroblast line WI38-VA13 to induce myofibroblast transformation. Multi-walled and single-walled CNTs (MWCNTs and SWCNTs, respectively) and silica, but not CB, stimulated robust myofibroblast transformation through macrophage-conditioned media. On an equal weight basis, MWCNTs induced higher induction than SWCNTs. High induction was observed for MWCNTs with a long and slender or a short and rigid shape, and silica, at levels comparable to those by LPS and TGF-β1. Fibrogenic particulates induced high levels of IL-1β mRNA expression and protein secretion that are required for macrophage-guided myofibroblast transformation. Induction of IL-1β is dependent on the activation of the NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome and ROS (reactive oxygen species) production in macrophages, as inhibition of NLRP3 by MCC950 and reduction of ROS production by N-acetylcysteine blocked NLRP3 activation, IL-1β induction, and fibroblast activation and differentiation. Therefore, fibrogenic CNTs and silica, but not CB, elicit robust macrophage-guided myofibroblast transformation, which depends on the induction of IL-1β through the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and the increased production of ROS in macrophages.",Aptazymes: Expanding the Specificity of Natural Catalytic Nucleic Acids by Application of In Vitro Selected Oligonucleotides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847536,Advances in biochemical engineering/biotechnology,2019 03 08,"Aptazymes are synthetic molecules composed of an aptamer domain and a catalytic active nucleic acid unit, which may be a ribozyme or a DNAzyme. In these constructs the aptamer domain serves as a molecular switch that can regulate the catalytic activity of the ribozyme or DNAzyme subunit. This regulation is triggered by binding of the aptamers target molecule, which causes significant structural changes in the aptamer and thus in the entire aptazyme. Therefore, aptazymes function similar to allosteric enzymes, whose catalytic activity is regulated by binding of ligands (effectors) to allosteric sites due to alteration of the three-dimensional structure of the active site of the enzyme. In case of aptazymes, the allosteric site is composed of an aptamer. Aptazymes can be designed for different applications and have already been used in analytical assays as well as for the regulation of gene expression.

Cumulating evidence indicates that in addition to a dysbalance of mediators regulating vascular tone and growth factors promoting vascular remodeling, failure to resolve inflammation and altered immune processes play a pivotal role in the development and progression of PH. Here, we highlight the role of key inflammatory pathways in the pathobiology of vascular remodeling and PH, and discuss potential therapeutic interventions that may halt disease progression or even reverse pulmonary vascular remodeling. Perivascular inflammation is present in all forms of PH, and inflammatory pathways involve numerous mediators and cell types including macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells. Dysfunctional bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) signaling and dysregulated immunity enable the accumulation of macrophages and other inflammatory cells in obliterative vascular lesions. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were shown to be of particular relevance in the control of inflammatory responses. Key cytokines/chemokines include interleukin-6, functioning via classic or trans-signaling, macrophage migratory inhibitory factor (MIF), but also other mediators such as neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase.

Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora has been associated with insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and heart failure. The negative cardiovascular effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus could therefore partly be mediated by gut microbiota. This review article discusses specific gut microbiome-associated mechanisms, which are modulated in both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. It is presented how intestinal bacteria may contribute to systemic low-grade inflammation. Furthermore, it is shown how the intestinal microbiome as a complex metabolic organ is able to influence the cardiometabolic phenotype via production of bioactive metabolites. Further studies will have to demonstrate whether these mechanisms contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetes.",[Update of the German S3 breast cancer guideline : What is new for pathologists?],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847505,Der Pathologe,2019 03 29,"The relevant content changes for pathologists in the updated interdisciplinary S3 guideline ""Early detection, diagnosis, therapy and aftercare of breast cancer"" are explained and discussed in the context of the most recent evidence.

Thus, the generation of kidney organoids (mainly comprising glomeruli and renal tubules) from multipotent stem cells represents an important advance in regenerative medicine of the kidney. Recently, a protocol that can generate the higher-order structure of the mouse embryonic kidney was reported.

Many current approaches for this problem leverage sequence and interaction network data to transfer knowledge across species, exemplified by network alignment methods. While these techniques do well, they are limited in scope, creating metrics to address one specific problem or task. We take a different approach by creating an environment where multiple knowledge transfer tasks can be performed using the same protein representations. Specifically, our kernel-based method, MUNK, integrates sequence and network structure to create functional protein representations, embedding proteins from different species in the same vector space. First we show proteins in different species that are close in MUNK-space are functionally similar. Next, we use these representations to share knowledge of synthetic lethal interactions between species. Importantly, we find that the results using MUNK-representations are at least as accurate as existing algorithms for these tasks. Finally, we generalize the notion of a phenolog ('orthologous phenotype') to use functionally similar proteins (i.e. those with similar representations). We demonstrate the utility of this broadened notion by using it to identify known phenologs and novel non-obvious ones supported by current research.",The immunometabolic role of indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: immune homeostatic mechanisms in the artery wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847484,Cardiovascular research,2019 03 08,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, the two most common cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) worldwide, are triggered by complications of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaques are triggered by a maladaptive immune response initiated by accumulation of lipids in the artery wall. Hence, disease is influenced by several non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, smoking, and diabetes. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (Trp) degradation, is modulated by inflammation and regarded as a key molecule driving immunotolerance and immunosuppressive mechanisms. A large body of evidence indicates that IDO-mediated Trp metabolism is involved directly or indirectly in atherogenesis. This review summarizes evidence from basic and clinical research showing that IDO is a major regulatory enzyme involved in the maintenance of immunohomeostasis in the vascular wall, as well as current knowledge about promising targets for the development of new anti-atherosclerotic drugs.",RNase H activities counteract a toxic effect of Polymerase η in cells replicating with depleted dNTP pools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847483,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 21,"RNA:DNA hybrids are transient physiological intermediates that arise during several cellular processes such as DNA replication. In pathological situations, they may stably accumulate and pose a threat to genome integrity. Cellular RNase H activities process these structures to restore the correct DNA:DNA sequence. Yeast cells lacking RNase H are negatively affected by depletion of deoxyribonucleotide pools necessary for DNA replication. Here we show that the translesion synthesis DNA polymerase η (Pol η) plays a role in DNA replication under low deoxyribonucleotides condition triggered by hydroxyurea. In particular, the catalytic reaction performed by Pol η is detrimental for RNase H deficient cells, causing DNA damage checkpoint activation and G2/M arrest. Moreover, a Pol η mutant allele with enhanced ribonucleotide incorporation further exacerbates the sensitivity to hydroxyurea of cells lacking RNase H activities. Our data are compatible with a model in which Pol η activity facilitates the formation or stabilization of RNA:DNA hybrids at stalled replication forks. However, in a scenario where RNase H activity fails to restore DNA, these hybrids become highly toxic for cells.",Ablative fractional resurfacing in acute care management of facial burns: a new approach to minimise the need for acute surgical reconstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847482,Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2019 03 08,"Current evidence suggests awaiting for scars to fully mature prior to engaging surgical reconstruction unless acute indications to prevent secondary damage, such as microstomia and eyelid ectropion are apparent.",A High-Quality Grapevine Downy Mildew Genome Assembly Reveals Rapidly Evolving and Lineage-Specific Putative Host Adaptation Genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847481,Genome biology and evolution,2019 04 11,"Downy mildews are obligate biotrophic oomycete pathogens that cause devastating plant diseases on economically important crops. Plasmopara viticola is the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew, a major disease in vineyards worldwide. We sequenced the genome of Pl. viticola with PacBio long reads and obtained a new 92.94 Mb assembly with high contiguity (359 scaffolds for a N50 of 706.5 kb) due to a better resolution of repeat regions. This assembly presented a high level of gene completeness, recovering 1,592 genes encoding secreted proteins involved in plant-pathogen interactions. Plasmopara viticola had a two-speed genome architecture, with secreted protein-encoding genes preferentially located in gene-sparse, repeat-rich regions and evolving rapidly, as indicated by pairwise dN/dS values. We also used short reads to assemble the genome of Plasmopara muralis, a closely related species infecting grape ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata). The lineage-specific proteins identified by comparative genomics analysis included a large proportion of RxLR cytoplasmic effectors and, more generally, genes with high dN/dS values. We identified 270 candidate genes under positive selection, including several genes encoding transporters and components of the RNA machinery potentially involved in host specialization. Finally, the Pl. viticola genome assembly generated here will allow the development of robust population genomics approaches for investigating the mechanisms involved in adaptation to biotic and abiotic selective pressures in this species.",Utilizing the RE-AIM framework to understand adoption of nutrition policies at food pantries across the USA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847480,Translational behavioral medicine,2019 03 08,"Emergency food networks consist of food banks, food pantries, and other feeding programs. Food pantries help supplement the diets of low-income populations through direct distribution of food. There is a gap in understanding whether food pantries are adopting nutrition policies to guide food donation and distribution. Guided by the RE-AIM framework, which has been applied to public health policies, this study aimed to determine the adoption of nutrition policies at food pantries across the USA. A secondary research question was to determine if the perceived barriers that food pantries associate with distributing healthful foods differed among pantries with a formal, informal, or no policy. A cross-sectional electronic survey was distributed to a national sample of food pantry directors (N = 5,500). The response rate for the survey was 28% (n = 1,539). Survey respondents were categorized by policy and analyses were conducted to determine differences between the three groups in characteristics and perceived barriers to distributing healthful foods. Two hundred eighty-two pantries (20.9%) were identified as having a formal nutrition policy, 677 (50.2%) were determined to have an informal policy, and 389 (28.9%) had no policy. There were significant differences between mean barrier scores and policy types for 8 of the 10 barriers. More research is needed to better understand how nutrition policies affect donations and distribution of food at food pantries. Using additional RE-AIM dimensions can allow for researchers to fully understand the role these policies have on the nutritional quality of food at food pantries.",Genetic Variation in Pan Species Is Shaped by Demographic History and Harbors Lineage-Specific Functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847478,Genome biology and evolution,2019 05 01,"Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are the closest living relatives of humans, but the two species show distinct behavioral and physiological differences, particularly regarding female reproduction. Despite their recent rapid decline, the demographic histories of the two species have been different during the past 1-2 Myr, likely having an impact on their genomic diversity. Here, we analyze the inferred functional consequences of genetic variation across 69 individuals, making use of the most complete data set of genomes in the Pan clade to date. We test to which extent the demographic history influences the efficacy of purifying selection in these species. We find that small historical effective population sizes (Ne) correlate not only with low levels of genetic diversity but also with a larger number of deleterious alleles in homozygosity and an increased proportion of deleterious changes at low frequencies. To investigate the putative genetic basis for phenotypic differences between chimpanzees and bonobos, we exploit the catalog of putatively deleterious protein-coding changes in each lineage. We show that bonobo-specific nonsynonymous changes are enriched in genes related to age at menarche in humans, suggesting that the prominent physiological differences in the female reproductive system between chimpanzees and bonobos might be explained, in part, by putatively adaptive changes on the bonobo lineage.",Correlation between systemic osteoporosis and local bone erosion with rheumatoid arthritis patients in Chinese population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847477,"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",2019 03 08,RA is a systemic auto-immune inflammatory disease that can lead to local bone erosions and generalized osteoporosis (OP).

Yet scans for positive selection rely on codon models which incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we perform a large-scale comparison of approaches which incorporate codon substitution rate variation and propose our own simple yet effective modification of existing models. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. More than 70% of the genes detected by the classical branch-site model are presumably false positives caused by the incorrect assumption of uniform synonymous substitution rate. We propose a new model which is strongly favored by the data while remaining computationally tractable. With the new model we can capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we propose that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. Although we detect fewer genes under positive selection in Drosophila than without rate variation, the genes which we detect contain a stronger signal of adaptation of dynein, which could be associated with Wolbachia infection. We provide software to perform positive selection analysis using the new model."

To this end, we have systematically explored C-X bond activation via oxidative addition of CH3X substrates (X = H, Cl, CH3) to model catalysts mFe(CO)4q (q = 0, -2; m = singlet, triplet) and, for comparison, Pd(PH3)2 and Pd(CO)2, using relativistic density functional theory at the ZORA-OPBE/TZ2P level. We find that the neutral singlet iron catalyst 1Fe(CO)4 activates all three C-X bonds via barriers that are lower than those for Pd(PH3)2 and Pd(CO)2. This is a direct consequence of the capability of the iron complex to engage not only in π-backdonation, but also in comparably strong σ-donation. Interestingly, whereas the palladium complexes favor C-Cl activation, 1Fe(CO)4 shows a strong preference for activating the C-H bond, with a barrier as low as 10.4 kcal mol-1. Our results suggest a high potential for iron to feature in palladium-type cross-coupling reactions.",Correlations between secondary structure- and protein-protein interface-mimicry: the interface mimicry hypothesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847453,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 03 29,"An active segment of the research community designing small molecules (""minimalist mimics"" of peptide fragments) to interfere with protein-protein interactions have based their studies on an implicit hypothesis. Here we refer to this as the Secondary Structure Hypothesis, that might be defined as, ""If a small molecule can orient amino acid side-chains in directions that resemble side-chains of the parent secondary structure at the interface, then that small molecule is a candidate to perturb the protein-protein interaction"". Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require co-crystallization of minimalist mimics with protein receptors, and comparison of the bound conformations with the interface secondary structures they were designed to resemble. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such analysis in the literature, and it is unlikely that enough examples will emerge in the near future to test the hypothesis. Research described here was designed to challenge this hypothesis from a different perspective. In a previous study, preferred conformations of a series of novel minimalist mimics were simulated then systematically overlaid on >240 000 crystallographically characterized protein-protein interfaces. Select data from that overlay procedure revealed chemotypes that overlay side chains on various PPI interfaces with a relatively high frequency of occurrence. The first aim of this work was to determine if good secondary structure mimics overlay frequently on PPI interfaces. The second aim of this work was to determine if overlays of preferred conformers at interface regions involve secondary structures. Thus situations where these conformations overlaid extremely well on PPI interfaces were analyzed to determine if secondary structures featured the PPI regions where these molecules overlaid in the previous study. Combining conclusions from these two studies enabled us to formulate a hypothesis that is complementary to the Secondary Structure Hypothesis, but, unlike this, is supported by abundant data. We call this the Interface Mimicry Hypothesis.",Selective reduction of formamides to O-silylated hemiaminals or methylamines with HSiMe2Ph catalyzed by iridium complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847452,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 28,"The reaction of (4-methyl-pyridin-2-iloxy)ditertbutylsilane (NSitBu-H, 1) with [IrCl(coe)2]2 affords the iridium(iii) complex [Ir(H)(Cl)(κ2-NSitBu)(coe)] (2), which has been fully characterized including X-ray diffraction studies.

Germline genome editing and correction promises to permanently remove monogenic cardiovascular disorders from the offspring and subsequent generations of affected families.

Although currently beset by several technical challenges, and not yet past small animal models, somatic genome editing may also be useful for a variety of cardiovascular disorders. It potentially avoids ethical concerns about permanent editing of the germline and allows treatment of already diseased individuals. If technical challenges of Cas9-gRNA delivery (viral vector immune response, nonviral vector delivery) can be worked out, then CRISPR-Cas9 may have a significant place in the treatment of a wide variety of disorders in which partial or complete gene knockout is desired. However, CRISPR may not work for gene correction in the human heart because of low rates of homology directed repair.

Combining chest compressions during sustained inflation (CC+SI) has recently been shown to improve morbidity and mortality outcomes during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Overall, CC+SI accomplishes the following: 1) significantly reduces time to return of spontaneous circulation, mortality, and epinephrine administration, and improves systemic and regional hemodynamic recovery; 2) significantly increases tidal volume and minute ventilation, and therefore alveolar oxygen delivery; 3) allows for passive ventilation during chest compression; and 4) does not increase lung or brain injury markers compared with the current standard of using 3:1 compression:ventilation ratio.

These grafts repolarize macrophages to anti-inflammatory phenotypes, leading to modulation of the pro-inflammatory microenvironment and ultimately to a reduction of foreign body encapsulation and inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia development. These resulting functional improvements have significant implications for the next generation of synthetic vascular grafts.",Cardiomyocyte SMAD4-Dependent TGF-β Signaling is Essential to Maintain Adult Heart Homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847418,JACC. Basic to translational science,2019 03 11,"The role of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway in myocardial fibrosis is well recognized. However, the precise role of this signaling axis in cardiomyocyte (CM) biology is not defined. In TGF-β signaling, SMAD4 acts as the central intracellular mediator. To investigate the role of TGF-β signaling in CM biology, the authors deleted SMAD4 in adult mouse CMs. We demonstrate that CM-SMAD4-dependent TGF-β signaling is critical for maintaining cardiac function, sarcomere kinetics, ion-channel gene expression, and cardiomyocyte survival. Thus, our findings raise a significant concern regarding the therapeutic approaches that rely on systemic inhibition of the TGF-β pathway for the management of myocardial fibrosis.",Empagliflozin Improves Diastolic Function in a Nondiabetic Rodent Model of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847416,JACC. Basic to translational science,2019 03 10,"Recent studies send an unambiguous signal that the class of agents known as sodium-glucose-linked co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) prevent heart failure hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms remain unclear. Herein the authors utilize a rodent model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and demonstrate that treatment with the SGLT2i empagliflozin, reduces left ventricular mass, improving both wall stress and diastolic function. These findings extend the observation that the main mechanism of action of empagliflozin involves improved hemodynamics (i.e., reduction in preload and afterload) and provide a rationale for upcoming trials in patients with HFpEF irrespective of glycemic status.","SGLT2 Inhibitor, Canagliflozin, Attenuates Myocardial Infarction in the Diabetic and Nondiabetic Heart.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847415,JACC. Basic to translational science,2019 03 10,"The authors hypothesized that despite similar cardiovascular event rates, the improved cardiovascular survival from sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition, seen clinically, could be via a direct cytoprotective effect, including protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. Langendorff-perfused hearts, from diabetic and nondiabetic rats, fed long-term for 4 weeks with canagliflozin, had lower infarct sizes; this being the first demonstration of canagliflozin's cardioprotective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury in both diabetic and nondiabetic animals. By contrast, direct treatment of isolated nondiabetic rat hearts with canagliflozin, solubilized in the isolated Langendorff perfusion buffer, had no impact on infarct size. This latter study demonstrates that the infarct-sparing effect of long-term treatment with canagliflozin results from either a glucose-independent effect or up-regulation of cardiac prosurvival pathways. These results further suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors could be repurposed as novel cardioprotective interventions in high-risk cardiovascular patients irrespective of diabetic status.","Neutrophil Subsets, Platelets, and Vascular Disease in Psoriasis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847414,JACC.

Because neutrophils are implicated in atherosclerosis development, this study reports that the interaction among low-density granulocytes, a subset of neutrophils, and platelets is associated with a noncalcified coronary plaque burden assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography. Because early atherosclerotic noncalcified burden can lead to fatal myocardial infarction, the low-density granulocyte-platelet interaction may play a crucial target for clinical intervention."

Furthermore, we aimed to explore whether non-traditional biomarker such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is superior for CVD risk prediction over old traditional risk factors. A total of 180 participants with DM2 (of them 50% females) were included in the current cross-sectional study. Biochemical and anthropometric parameters, and blood pressure were obtained. More males than females were classified at high UKPDS risk category (p<0.001). Also, about one third of diabetic patients (29.4%) were classified into the high-risk category. In multivariate regression analysis, triglycerides [Odds ratio (OR) =1.703, p=0.001] and creatinine concentration (OR=1.040, p<0.001) were independent predictors of CVD risk, whereas hsCRP was not correlated with CVD risk.

Smoking is a risk factor for the development of ARDS, although the mechanism is unclear. We examined the effect of smoking on alveolar and systemic inflammation, in addition to alveolar-capillary permeability, leading to ARDS in patients undergoing oesophagectomy. We compared clinical, biomarker and PiCCO system data between current smokers (n=14) and ex-smokers (n=36) enrolled into a translational substudy of the BALTI-P (Beta Agonist Lung Injury Trial Prevention) trial. Current smokers compared with ex-smokers had significantly higher numbers of circulating neutrophils, elevated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor-1 and pre-operative plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and lower BAL vascular endothelial growth factor and post-operative plasma IL-17 (p<0.05).

Weaning impairs the intestinal integrity, disturbs digestive and absorptive capacity, and increases the intestinal oxidative stress, and susceptibility of diseases in piglets. The improvement of intestinal development and health is critically important for enhancing nutrient digestibility capacity and disease resistance of weaned pigs, therefore, increasing their survival rate at this most vulnerable stage, and overall productive performance during later stages. A healthy gut may include but not limited several important features: a healthy proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells, an integrated gut barrier function, a preferable or balanced gut microbiota, and a well-developed intestinal mucosa immunity. Burgeoning evidence suggested nutritional intervention are one of promising measures to enhance intestinal health of weaned pigs, although the exact protective mechanisms may vary and are still not completely understood. Previous research indicated that functional amino acids, such as arginine, cysteine, glutamine, or glutamate, may enhance intestinal mucosa immunity (i.e., increased sIgA secretion), reduce oxidative damage, stimulate proliferation of enterocytes, and enhance gut barrier function (i.e., enhanced expression of tight junction protein) of weaned pigs. A number of feed additives are marketed to assist in boosting intestinal immunity and regulating gut microbiota, therefore, reducing the negative impacts of weaning, and other environmental challenges on piglets. The promising results have been demonstrated in antimicrobial peptides, clays, direct-fed microbials, micro-minerals, milk components, oligosaccharides, organic acids, phytochemicals, and many other feed additives.

For 5 feline cadaver heads and 22 client-owned cats admitted for evaluation and treatment of dental disease, 32 predefined dentoalveolar lesions were evaluated separately and scored by use of dental radiography and 3 CBCT software modules [multiplanar reconstructions (MPR), tridimensional (3-D) rendering, and reconstructed panoramic views]. A qualitative scoring system was used. Dentoalveolar lesions were grouped into 14 categories for statistical analysis. Point of reference for presence or absence of a dentoalveolar lesion was determined as the method that could be used to clearly identify the disorder as being present. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated with the McNemar χ2 test of marginal homogeneity of paired data. When all 3 CBCT software modules were used in combination, the diagnostic yield of CBCT was significantly higher than that of dental radiography for 4 of 14 categories (missing teeth, horizontal bone loss, loss of tooth integrity, feline resorptive lesions), and higher, although not significantly so, for 9 categories (supernumerary teeth, supernumerary roots, abnormally shaped roots, vertical bone loss, buccal bone expansion, periapical disease, inflammatory root resorption, and external replacement root resorption). In conclusion, we found that CBCT provided more clinically relevant detailed information as compared to dental radiography.

Most research in the field of assistance animals has been focused on the effect of these animals on people. Only recently has there been a growing interest in the welfare and well-being of these animals and the effect of the work on the animals themselves. The concept of retirement, or withdrawing the animal from its working life, is an important welfare consideration that has received minimal discussion in the scientific literature. The notion of retirement is typically regarded as a reward earned after a lifetime of work, but this inevitable phase of an animal's working life has positive and negative implications for both animal and handler. Some of these implications include recognizing the emotional impact of this life-altering event on both animal and handler. The decisions of when and how to appropriately retire an animal are typically made at the discretion of the assistance animal agencies and handlers, but standard evidence-based guidelines for the proper retirement of assistance animals are currently unavailable.

Recently, several putative pestiviruses species have been discovered and characterized in mammalian species (giraffe pestivirus, antelope pestivirus, HoBi virus, Bungowannah virus, and Linda virus); one of these is a genetically distinct pestivirus, named atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV), discovered using the next-generation sequencing technology. APPV has been detected in piglets with congenital tremor (CT) from four different continents, including North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. There is strong evidence that experimental inoculation and in field outbreaks involving APPV induce CT in piglets. Additionally, splay leg (SL) syndrome has been observed concurrently with CT, and it was induced by APPV in experimental studies and some field cases. Animals with a persistent and/or chronic infection condition can shed the virus over time. Viral-RNA is frequently detected in different tissues from CT-piglets; however, high loads of APPV are detected most consistently in central nervous tissue. Moreover, the APPV genome has been recently detected in semen and preputial swabs from boar studs, as well as in serum and tissue samples from wild boars and domestic adult pigs, all known to be clinically healthy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the APPV sequence (complete or partial polyprotein) exhibits high genetic diversity between viral strains detected in different countries and formed independent clusters according to geographic location. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the molecular detection and sero-prevalence of APPV around the world. Lastly, more research is needed to understand clinical presentations associated with APPV infection, as well as the economic losses related to the virus in pig production worldwide.",Production of an Enzymatic Extract From Aspergillus oryzae DIA-MF to Improve the Fructooligosaccharides Profile of Aguamiel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847344,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 03 10,"Aguamiel is a natural sap produced by some species of agave plants, such as Agave salmiana, A. atrovirens, or A. angustifolia. It is a product with a high concentration of fructose, glucose or sucrose, although its composition may vary depending on the season in which it is produced, and may also contain agave fructans (or agavins) or fructooligosaccharides (FOS). It has been reported that FOS can be produced by enzymes that act on sucrose or inulin, transfructosylating or hydrolyzing these materials, respectively. Due to the sugar content in aguamiel, the application of an enzymatic complex produced by Aspergillus oryzae DIA MF was carried out. This complex was characterized by 1-D electrophoresis SDS-PAGE, and its transfructosylation and hydrolysis activities were determined by HPLC. In order to determine the conditions at which the concentration of FOS in this beverage increased, kinetics were carried out at different temperatures (30, 50, and 70°C) and times (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 15 h). Finally, the antioxidant and prebiotic activities were evaluated. FOS concentration in aguamiel was increased from 1.61 ± 0.08 to 31.01 ± 3.42 g/ L after 10 h reaction at 30°C applying 10% enzymatic fraction-substrate (v/v). Antioxidant activity was highly increased (34.81-116.46 mg/eq Trolox in DPPH assay and 42.65 to 298.86 mg/eq Trolox in FRAP assay) and growth of probiotic bacteria was higher in aguamiel after the enzymatic treatment.

We identified 211 variants, from which 23 occurred only in Danish subjects and 79 were found only in Brazilian individuals, resulting in 109/211 variations in common between European and Brazilian population in the HAE families analyzed. BDKRB2 and CPM presented a large number of variants in untranslated regions, 46/49 and 19/24, respectively; whereas ACE (n = 26), SERPING1 (n = 26), CPM (n = 24), and NOS3 (n = 16) genes presented the higher number of variants directly affecting amino acid sequence. Despite the large amount of variants identified, the lack of association between genotype and phenotype indicates that the modulation of HAE symptom requires a more complex regulation, probably involving pathways beyond the KKS, epigenetics and environmental factors. Considering the new HAE types recently described, molecules involved in the regulation of vasculature and in plasminogen activation become promising targets for future genetic studies.",Identification and Characterization of Five Cold Stress-Related Rhododendron Dehydrin Genes: Spotlight on a FSK-Type Dehydrin With Multiple F-Segments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847341,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019 03 10,"Dehydrins are a family of plant proteins that accumulate in response to dehydration stresses, such as low temperature, drought, high salinity, or during seed maturation. We have previously constructed cDNA libraries from Rhododendron catawbiense leaves of naturally non-acclimated (NA; leaf LT50, temperature that results in 50% injury of maximum, approximately -7°C) and cold-acclimated (CA; leaf LT50 approximately -50°C) plants and analyzed expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Five ESTs were identified as dehydrin genes. Their full-length cDNA sequences were obtained and designated as RcDhn 1-5. To explore their functionality vis-à-vis winter hardiness, their seasonal expression kinetics was studied at two levels. Firstly, in leaves of R. catawbiense collected from the NA, CA, and de-acclimated (DA) plants corresponding to summer, winter and spring, respectively. Secondly, in leaves collected monthly from August through February, which progressively increased freezing tolerance from summer through mid-winter. The expression pattern data indicated that RcDhn 1-5 had 6- to 15-fold up-regulation during the cold acclimation process, followed by substantial down-regulation during deacclimation (even back to NA levels for some). Interestingly, our data shows RcDhn 5 contains a histidine-rich motif near N-terminus, a characteristic of metal-binding dehydrins. Equally important, RcDhn 2 contains a consensus 18 amino acid sequence (i.e., ETKDRGLFDFLGKKEEEE) near the N-terminus, with two additional copies upstream, and it is the most acidic (pI of 4.8) among the five RcDhns found. The core of this consensus 18 amino acid sequence is a 11-residue amino acid sequence (DRGLFDFLGKK), recently designated in the literature as the F-segment (based on the pair of hydrophobic F residues it contains). Furthermore, the 208 orthologs of F-segment-containing RcDhn 2 were identified across a broad range of species in GenBank database. This study expands our knowledge about the types of F-segment from the literature-reported single F-segment dehydrins (FSKn) to two or three F-segment dehydrins: Camelina sativa dehydrin ERD14 as F2S2Kn type; and RcDhn 2 as F3SKn type identified here. Our results also indicate some consensus amino acid sequences flanking the core F-segment in dehydrins. Implications for these cold-responsive RcDhn genes in future genetic engineering efforts to improve plant cold hardiness are discussed."

Although de-intensification strategies have been propelled to the forefront of clinical research in human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer, three cycles of 100 mg/m2 cisplatin given every 3 weeks concurrently with conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy represent a cost-effective and globally accessible treatment option for the majority of LA-SCCHN cases. Based on four large randomized trials, this regimen has become the non-surgical standard of care for cisplatin-eligible patients. Nevertheless, the outcomes in terms of efficacy, toxicity, and compliance have been rather disappointing. Therefore, there is an unmet need to find a better alternative. With limited support from randomized trials, weekly low-dose cisplatin regimens have replaced the standard high-dose schedule at some institutions. Four prospective trials exploring radiotherapy with and without weekly low-dose cisplatin have been published. Two of them were conducted in the 1980s, one of which had a negative outcome, the third study provided insufficient information on toxicity, and the fourth trial had to be prematurely terminated due to poor accrual. Moreover, the findings of two phase III trials comparing the two concurrent cisplatin regimens favored the high-dose protocol. We performed a composite meta-analysis of 59 prospective trials enrolling a total of 5,582 patients. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Reflecting different radiotherapy fractionation schemes and treatment intents, three meta-analyses were carried out, one for postoperative conventional chemoradiotherapy, one for definitive conventional chemoradiotherapy, and one for definitive altered fractionation chemoradiotherapy. In the former two settings, both high- and low-dose regimens yielded similar survival outcomes, thus, the primary objective was not met. When given concurrently with altered fractionation radiotherapy, patients treated with high-dose cisplatin had significantly longer overall survival than those who received low-dose cisplatin. In this article we provide a synthetic view of the results, discuss the issue of cumulative dose, compare two vs. three cycles of high-dose cisplatin, and present our three-step recommendations for use of the current standard of care, high-dose cisplatin, in clinical practice.",Association Between ERCC1 rs3212986 and ERCC2/XPD rs1799793 and OS in Patients With Advanced Esophageal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847299,Frontiers in oncology,2019 03 10,"Esophageal cancer (EC) is a very aggressive tumor, and no reliable prognostic markers exist especially for resectable advanced neoplasia. The principal aim of this study was to investigate the association of germline polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway genes with the overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced EC. As a second aim, we also studied the association of NER gene variants with response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Among the EC patients referred to our Institution between 2004 and 2012, we selected a cohort of 180 patients diagnosed with a clinical tumor stage ranging from IIB and IVA. Patients were genotyped for four NER variants, two in the ERCC1 (rs11615 and rs3212986) and two in the ERCC2/XPD (rs1799793 and rs13181) genes. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate the associations of the selected variants with OS; association with response to neoadjuvant therapy was investigated using logistic regression. Results showed that the ERCC1 rs3212986 and the ERCC2/XPD rs1799793 were significantly associated with shorter OS. On the contrary, response association analysis displayed that, while rs11615 and rs3212986 in ERCC1 were associated with response, both ERCC2/XPD variants were not. By creating survival prediction models, we showed that the rs3212986 and the rs1799793 have a better predictability of the tumor stage alone. Furthermore, they were able to improve the power of the clinical model (AUC = 0.660 vs. AUC = 0.548, p = 0.004). In conclusion, our results indicate that the ERCC1 rs3212986 and the ERCC2/XPD rs1799793 could be used as surrogate markers for a better stratification of EC patients with advanced resectable tumor.",Role of Microenvironment on the Fate of Disseminating Cancer Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847298,Frontiers in oncology,2019 03 10,"Disseminating Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) initiate growth in specific niches of the host tissues, the cellular and molecular components of which sustain signaling pathways that support their survival, self-renewal dormancy and reactivation. In the metastatic niche, tumor cells may enter in a dormant state to survive and, consequently, the metastasis can remain latent for years. Despite the clinical importance of metastatic latency, little is known about what induces CSCs to enter a dormant state and what allows them to remain viable for years in this state. CSCs exhibit genetic, epigenetic and cellular adaptations that confer resistance to classical therapeutic approaches. The identification of potential CSC targets is complicated by the fact that CSCs may arise as a consequence of their relationship with the local microenvironment into the metastatic niches. Indeed, microenvironment modulates the capability of CSCs to evade the innate immune response and survive. Some new therapeutic options that include drugs targeting microenvironment components are achieving encouraging results in reducing the number of CSCs in tumors and/or overcoming their resistance in preclinical studies. This review will focus on specific CSC features with an emphasis on the role of tumor microenvironment in supporting metastatic dissemination of CSCs. In addition, it sheds light on potential microenvironment-targeted therapies aimed to counteract seeding and survival of CSCs in the metastatic niche.",Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STATs) Proteins in Cancer and Inflammation: Functions and Therapeutic Implication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847297,Frontiers in oncology,2019 03 10,"Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) pathway is connected upstream with Janus kinases (JAK) family protein and capable of integrating inputs from different signaling pathways.

Analyses examined differences in water-related practices by school characteristics. Response rates for the 3 questionnaires used in this analysis ranged from 69%-94% (Ns ranged from 495 to 577). We found that less than half of schools flush drinking water outlets after periods of non-use (46.4%), conduct periodic inspections that test drinking water outlets for lead (45.8%), and require staff training on drinking water quality (25.6%). Most schools teach the importance of water consumption (81.1%) and offer free drinking water in the cafeteria (88.3%). Some water-related school practices differed by school demographic characteristics though no consistent patterns of associations by school characteristics emerged. In US schools, some water quality-related practices are limited, but water availability and education-related practices are more common.

One-third of adult epileptic patients do not respond to antiepileptic drugs or surgical treatment and therefore suffer from the resistant type of epilepsy. Stem cells have been given substantial consideration in the field of epilepsy therapeutics. The implication of pathologic vascular response in sustained seizures and the eminent role of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in maintaining vascular integrity tempted us to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of EPCs in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced rat model of epilepsy. Modulation of autophagy, a process that enables neurons to maintain an equilibrium of synthesis, degradation and subsequent reprocessing of cellular components, has been targeted. Intravenously administered EPCs homed into the hippocampus and amended the deficits in memory and locomotor activity. The cells mitigated neurological damage and the associated histopathological alterations and boosted the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. EPCs corrected the perturbations in neurotransmitter activity and enhanced the expression of the downregulated autophagy proteins light chain protein-3 (LC-3), beclin-1, and autophagy-related gene-7 (ATG-7). Generally, these effects were comparable to those achieved by the reference antiepileptic drug, valproic acid. In conclusion, EPCs may confer therapeutic effects against epilepsy and its associated behavioural and biochemical abnormalities at least in part via the upregulation of autophagy. The study warrants further research in experimental and clinical settings to verify the prospect of using EPCs as a valid therapeutic strategy in patients with epilepsy.",Exercise Training and Heart Failure: A Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847247,Cardiac failure review,2019 03 10,Exercise and cardiac rehabilitation have been underused therapy options for patients with congestive heart failure despite being recommended in international guidelines and being covered by Medicare in the US.

Natriuretic peptides are also excellent prognostic markers of chronic heart failure, but the clinical value of such prognostic information is less clear. One possible application for this information is guiding medical therapy in chronic heart failure.

The myocardial injury induced by chemotherapies is probably a continuum starting with cardiac biomarkers increase before the occurence of a structural myocardial deformation leading to a LVEF decline. An individualised risk profile (depending on age, cardiovascular risk factors, type of chemotherapy, baseline troponin, baseline global longitudinal strain and baseline LVEF) has to be determined before starting chemotherapy to consider cardioprotective treatment. To date, there is no proof of a systematic cardioprotective treatment (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or beta-blocker) in all cancer patients. However, early cardioprotective treatment in case of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction seems to be promising in the prevention of cardiac events.",Treatment of Heart Failure with Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors and Other Anti-diabetic Drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847242,Cardiac failure review,2019 03 10,"Patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of developing heart failure, cardiovascular death and renal failure.

Selection for heart transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation is a rigorous and validated process performed by specialised heart failure teams. This entails comprehensive assessment of complex diagnostic tests and risk scores, and selecting patients with the optimal benefit-risk profile. In contrast, referral for advanced heart failure evaluation is an arbitrary and poorly studied process, performed by generalists, and patients are often referred too late or not at all.

Unresolved congestion trumps serum creatinine increases in predicting adverse heart failure outcomes. No pharmacological approach for acute heart failure has reduced these deleterious consequences. Simplified ultrafiltration devices permit fluid removal in lower acuity hospital settings, but results regarding safety and efficacy have been variable. However, adjustment of ultrafiltration rates to patients' vital signs and renal function has been associated with more effective decongestion and fewer heart failure events. Many aspects of ultrafiltration, including patient selection, fluid removal rates, venous access, prevention of therapy-related complications and costs, require further investigation."

The masses were not accompanied by pain, or significant functional or neurosensory dysfunction. The results of the laboratory tests revealed an increased eosinophil count and markedly elevated serum IgE levels. On magnetic resonance imaging examination, a widespread abnormal signal was detected in the area of the lesions; the contrast-enhanced scan revealed inhomogeneous enhancement, with partial involvement of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the parotid gland. The patient underwent surgical resection of the right parotid and neck masses, and the postoperative pathological examination revealed eosinophilic hyperplastic lymphogranuloma, also referred to as KD.

A retrospective comparative cohort study was conducted in Changzheng Hospital. Patients were identified using the hospital information system from January 1999 to December 2016, collecting all of the data regarding clinical, treatment and prognostic profiles. Patient follow-up was also executed to obtain information on patients' survival status, serum markers profiles, disease progression, androgen substitution requirement and paternity status. In total 158 patients were enrolled into the cohort study, including 23 TSS cases. The TSS procedure was primarily conducted in younger patients (average age, 31.9 vs. 47.7 years) or those with smaller tumors (average tumor diameter, 26.0 vs. 51.5 mm). The overall survival and recurrence free survival revealed no differences in the two groups, suggesting similar oncological outcomes. Kaplan-Maier analysis demonstrated a higher cumulative paternity rate in the TSS group than in RO group, indicating a possible advantage of preserving patients' fertility in TSS over RO. TSS with proper adjuvant therapies proved to be a promising alternative in the avoidance of emasculation, infertility, life-long androgen substitution and other psychosexual difficulties, as the oncological outcomes were not inferior to RO in the selected cases.

The currently available treatments for UBC of the hand commonly involve curettage, bone grafting, partial resection with or without grafting, multiple drilling, fracture immobilization and observation alone, and steroid injection. We herein report a case treated with total resection of the cyst and non-vascularized fibular graft in a 9-year-old right-handed female patient. The patient presented with a chief complaint of a large, fast growing lump over the first metacarpal of the left hand. Flexion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint was limited. After the diagnosis was established with plain radiographs followed by biopsy, the cyst was completely removed by resecting the shaft of the metacarpal bone with preservation of the epiphyseal plate. A bone graft was obtained from the fibula and inserted in the gap, distally attached to the epiphyseal plate of the metacarpal and fixed with a Kirshner wire proximally. Radiographs revealed solid union of the bone graft to the epiphyseal plate at the head after 7 weeks, with improving function of the thumb. SBC or UBC of the metacarpal bone is very rare.

Recently, specific miRNA expression profiles have been identified in adult glioblastoma (aGBM), but there are only limited data available on the role of miRNAs in pediatric GBM (pGBM). In the present study, the expression profile of miRNAs was examined in seven pGBMs and three human GBM cell lines (U87MG, A172 and T98G), compared with a non-tumoral pool of pediatric cerebral cortex samples by microarray analysis. A set of differentially expressed miRNAs was identified, including miR-490, miR-876-3p, miR-876-5p, miR-448 and miR-137 (downregulated), as well as miR-501-3p (upregulated). Through bioinformatics analysis, a series of target genes was predicted. In addition, similar gene expression patterns in pGBMs and cell lines was confirmed. Of note, drug resistant T98G cells had upregulated nuclear casein kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1 (NUCKS1) expression, a protein overexpressed in many tumors that serves an important role in cell proliferation and progression. On the basis of the present preliminary report, it could be intriguing to further investigate the relationship between each of the identified differentially expressed miRNAs and NUCKS1, in order to clarify their involvement in the multi-drug resistance mechanism of pGBMs.",Fingerprints of volatile flavor compounds from southern stinky tofu brine with headspace solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and chemometric methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847168,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"It is difficult to produce southern stinky tofu, a famous traditional Chinese snack, at industry scale due to the complex composition of its brine. In this study, the fingerprints of organic volatile flavor compounds in the southern stinky tofu brine samples from five manufacturers were studied using headspace solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS) with the aid of chemometric methods. The fingerprints were obtained by HS-SPME/GC-MS and analyzed with the time shift alignment method, Shannon entropy, correlation coefficient, and principal component analysis. The results show that the time shifts in the samples can be accurately corrected by the time shift alignment method despite unexpected interferences. The fingerprint information was evaluated by Shannon entropy, while the similarities and differences in the fingerprints were investigated by correlation coefficient. Moreover, the identification of stinky tofu manufacturers can be achieved by principal component analysis. The predominant volatile compounds in southern stinky tofu brines were indole, 3-methylindole, phenol, and 4-methylphenol. Therefore, the established fingerprinting of volatile compounds for the brines by combining HS-SPME/GC-MS with chemometric methods was a simple and reliable method.",Nutritional and sensory quality of composite extruded complementary food.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847167,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Complementary foods in Ethiopia have nutritional and sensory limitations which can be attributed to cereal-dominated ingredients and lack of appropriate processing techniques. This study aimed to optimize the nutritional and sensory quality of complementary food product through compositing and extrusion of various local ingredients. A constrained D-optimal mixture experiment with 13 runs was designed. Accordingly, 55-65 g/100 g oats, 11-23 g/100 g soybean and 6-11 g/100 g linseed, and a premix of 9.9 g/100 g sugar, 0.6 g/100 g table salt, three g/100 g moringa and 1.5 g/100 g fenugreek were blended and extruded using a co-rotating twin screw extruder with set parameters.

Results showed that increasing the fat content from 25% to 35% leads to an increase in the elastic modulus. Furthermore, by increasing the amount of RBP from 1% to 3% in both creams, significant increase occurred in the complex modulus. As the fat content increased from 25% to 35%, the slope of flow behavior was increased, which revealed more thinning behavior and pseudoplasticity index of cream. The cream containing 35% fat and 3% RBP had also shown the low index (n = 0.298) which confirmed the firmer structure of the cream. The maximum consistency index (k) obtained was 9.41 for the cream with 35% fat and 3% RBP, which approved its strong foam structure. In general, according to our results it is obvious that whipped cream with the highest amount of fat and the lowest value of protein can lead to maximum stability of the whipping cream. Among the samples, the lowest stiffness was observed in cream of 35% fat, containing 3% rice bran protein. However, cream containing 35% fat and 1% RBP had convenient overrun and good stability. The microstructural results showed that the cream structure has relatively large globular aggregates in network and develops large pores, which permit to retain sufficient water/air. By increasing the fat content of cream from 25% to 35%, the voids and spaces in the cream were significantly decreased and the pores become less which improve the foam structure. Therefore, it can be concluded the cream with more fat has the more overrun and stability. In general, it is possible to improve the foam structure of cream by substituting fat by RBP.",Serum concentration of appetite-regulating hormones of mother-infant dyad according to the type of feeding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847165,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Satiety and appetite-stimulating hormones play a role in the regulation of food intake.

We propose to demonstrate that the serum concentration of appetite regulatory hormones differs according to the type of feeding and that there is a correlation between the serum concentrations of these hormones in mothers and in infants at 4 months of age. In a cross-sectional analysis, 167 mother-newborn dyads at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara were enrolled: 74 full breastfeeding (FBF), 56 partial breastfeeding (PBF), and 37 receiving human milk substitutes (HMS). Serum levels of ghrelin (pg/ml), leptin (ng/ml), peptide YY (pg/ml), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (pM) were measured. We performed one-way analysis of variance, unpaired Student t test, post hoc Tukey test, and Pearson correlation. The total sample at 16 weeks postpartum included 167 dyads. The mean age was 16 ± 1 weeks. The concentrations of GLP-1 (pM) and peptide YY (pg/ml) were higher in the FBF group (42.6 and 442.9) than in the HMS group (35.2 and 401.9), respectively, p = 0.046 and p = 0.056. And, the FBF group had higher correlation coefficients of ghrelin (r = 0.411 vs. 0.165), GLP-1 (r = 0.576 vs. 0.407), and peptide YY (r = 0.218 vs. 0.067), respectively, than the HMS group. The concentrations of GLP-1 and peptide YY were higher in the FBF group when compared with the HMS group. Mother-infant dyads fed by FBF had more significant direct correlations of appetite-regulating hormones than those who received HMS.",Recovery of high value-added protein from enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction (EAE) of soybeans by dead-end ultrafiltration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847164,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"The skim fraction (SF) obtained from enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction (EAE) of soybeans is a by-product with high protein content of up to 60.67%. As such, it is of great interest to develop an efficient method to recover protein from this fraction. In this study, the potential of dead-end ultrafiltration (UF) in recovering skim protein extracted with different proteases was evaluated. Two polyethersulfone (PES) membranes with molecular weight cutoffs (MWCO) of 3 kDa and 5 kDa were utilized. Results revealed that the membrane with the MWCO of 5 kDa exhibited better filtration efficiency, since higher permeate flux values and lower impurity rejections were observed. Compared with Flavourzyme and Protex 7L, Alcalase 2.4L and Protex 6L exhibited stronger hydrolyzing ability, resulting in higher filtration fluxes but lower protein rejection coefficients. The recovered protein showed comparable amino acid profile to SPC, while with significantly reduced levels of trypsin inhibitors and phytate (p < 0.05), indicating high quality of the recovered protein. Overall, UF can be applicable to recover high value-added protein from EAE of soybeans and remove undesired components from the resulting protein products.",Genomic analysis of Lactobacillus reuteri WHH1689 reveals its probiotic properties and stress resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847163,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) WHH1689, which was isolated from Chinese traditional highland barley wine, exhibited high survival period at room temperature in drinkable probiotic yogurt.

However, new food products have to face with the growing consumer consciousness about what they eat and hedonic responses, which represent a key factor in determining food preference and choices. The aim of this study was to design a vegetable-based product (a pumpkin and carrot soup) added with increasing concentration of P. ostreatus powder rich in β-glucans, which are fibers with demonstrated bioactivity in humans, and to obtain a sensory description of these fortified products to find the desirable and undesirable sensory properties that affect their acceptance. A total of 109 subjects (women N = 52; men N = 57; age = 36.1 ± 14.4 years) evaluated five samples of pumpkin and carrot soup added with increasing concentrations of mushroom powder (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, and a hidden control at 0%) for liking and sensory properties by means of the check-all-that-apply method. Results showed that creaminess, orange color, mild odor, and taste were positively related to vegetable soups liking, whereas strong taste, dark color, and mushroom odor described the less liked samples. Sample added with 2% of mushroom powder obtained comparable liking scores to the unmodified sample, while liking decreased with increasing concentration of P. ostreatus powder. The present results demonstrated that it is possible to fortify a vegetable soup with P. ostreatus powder developing well-accepted foods by consumers.

Rice gels were prepared from seven high-amylose rice varieties. The results demonstrated the significant differences in rice gel hardness and hardening rates during storage based on the rice variety used. The proportion of short chains of amylopectin was negatively correlated with the hardness of the rice gel. The sample temperature before shear treatment also influenced the rice gel hardness. Rice gels prepared from cooked rice maintained at 75°C prior to homogenization showed a higher breaking force than those from cooked rice at 25°C. Observation using scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the tendency of the cooked rice sample maintained at 75°C to form a finer gel network after homogenization than those at 25°C from the same rice variety.",Effect of pasteurization on delayed kimchi ripening and regression analysis for shelf life estimation of kimchi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847149,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Pasteurization-mediated delayed kimchi ripening and regression analysis for shelf life estimation were investigated. Various initial kimchi microbial communities were simplified to lactic acid bacteria Leuconostoc sp. and Lactobacillus sp. over time, with concomitant pH decrease from 6.39 to 4.34 and acidity increase from 0.06% to 0.35%. Other quality characteristics (organic acid, carbon dioxide, and microbial population) also changed, exhibiting high intercorrelation. Pasteurization decreased the initial bacterial counts from 5.20 to 1.92 log CFU/g, thereby delaying the change in quality characteristics (pH, acidity, organic acid, microbial population, carbon dioxide, and microbial community); however, the texture did not differ significantly (p < 0.05). In addition, the regression equation for the relationship between acidity and carbon dioxide levels suggested that shelf life could be estimated in conjunction with the ideal gas equation. In conclusion, pasteurization and regression analysis for kimchi shelf life estimation may enable the maintenance of quality and effective management during the distribution process.",The comparison of krill oil extracted through ethanol-hexane method and subcritical method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847148,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"This study aimed to develop a safe method EH (ethanol-hexane) to extract two kinds of krill oil (KO) simultaneously and analyze their composition. Meanwhile, subcritical butane and subcritical butane-dimethyl ether extraction were used to extract KO for analysis comparison. Folch method was used to extract total lipids. When the volume ratio of ethanol to hexane is 4:6, the separation effect of ethanol layer and hexane layer is best. At this condition, the EH method yielded similar amount of lipids (up to 97. 72% of total lipids) with subcritical butane extraction method (97.60%). The recovery rate of ethanol and hexane was 83.6% and 86.86%, respectively. KO in hexane layer and extracted by the subcritical butane method are abundant in astaxanthin (910 and 940 mg/kg respectively), while KO in the ethanol layer had the highest phospholipid (PL) content (47.34%), n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) content (45.51%), and the lowest fluorine content (11.17 μg/g), making it a potential candidate in the nutraceutical and antioxidant industry.","The effect of jujube powder incorporation on the chemical, rheological, and sensory properties of toffee.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847146,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"One of the major problems caused by the consumption of toffee is its high sugar content. So, great efforts have been made to replace sugar in toffee with bioactive ingredients. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research relevant to the application of jujube powder as sugar replacer in toffee. In this study, the sugar content of the toffee was replaced with the jujube powder in six different levels 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, and the physico-chemical, rheological, and sensory properties of the toffee were evaluated. The results showed that the fat, raw energy, pH, color (L*, a*, b*), sucrose, and firmness of the toffee samples decreased by increasing the percentage of jujube powder in the formulas but their moisture, water activity, ash, protein, glucose, and fructose increased. The rheological results revealed that storage modulus (G') was greater than loss modulus (G″), which represents the elastic behavior (solid-like) of the samples. Also storage modulus (G') of the control sample (jujube powder instead of 0% sugar) was greater than that the other samples. On the other hand, the firmness of the samples was decreased by increasing the percent of jujube powder. According to the chemical and rheological results, samples III and IV (jujube powder instead of 40% and 60% sugar, respectively) were selected as optimum samples. Then the sensory properties were compared to that of control. No significant difference observed in chewiness, taste, flavor, sweetness, color, after-taste, and overall acceptance between the control and the two other samples.",Study of a common azo food dye in mice model: Toxicity reports and its relation to carcinogenicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847145,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"This study was conducted to evaluate the toxic effects of an azo dye carmoisine widely used in foods and to investigate its relation to carcinogenicity. Carmoisine administered into mice orally in four different doses as control, low, medium, and high equivalent to 0, 4, 200, and 400 mg/kg bw, respectively, for 120 days. The key toxicological endpoint was observed including animal body weight, organ weights, hematology, biochemistry, and molecular biology assessment. The body weights of medium- and high-dose carmoisine-treated mice group were significantly decreased as compared to the control mice group. Platelet, white blood cell and monocyte counts of treated group were considerably higher, while Hb and red blood cell counts were drastically lower than the control group. The biochemical parameters such as serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, globulin, urea, and creatinine level were significantly increased, while serum cholesterol level was decreased after treatment as compared to the control. RT-PCR results showed that expression of Bcl-x and PARP gene was intensively increased, whereas expression of p53 gene was decreased in the mouse liver tissues treated with carmoisine. This study revealed that high-dose (400 mg/kg bw) treatment of carmoisine was attributable to renal failure and hepatotoxicity. It also would be suspected as a culprit for liver oncogenesis.",Evaluation of some quality parameters of cassava starch and soy protein isolate matrices during deep fat frying in soybean oil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847144,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Snack industry is recently focused on the production of snacks with minimal oil content and enhanced quality attributes which prompted the need to study the changes in snack matrices produced from cassava starch processed from three varieties of cassava roots (TMS-950289, TME-419, and TMS-30572) and soy protein isolate blends fried in soybean oil. Effect of frying temperature (170-180°C), frying time (2-4 min), soy protein isolate inclusion level (5%-15%) on proximate composition, color changes, expansion, texture, and sensory attributes of the snacks was investigated. Optimization of process variables was carried out based on a factorial design (2 level by 3 factor) in the Design Expert version 6.0.8, and models were generated showing the relationship between the independent variables and the responses. The desired goal for each constraint (processing conditions) was kept within 170-180°C for 2-4 min, while all responses, except chewiness, expansion, yellowness, and protein, were set at minimum. Evaluation of sensory attributes of the optimized sample was carried out to determine its level of desirability. The optimized frying conditions for matrices produced from starches of TMS-950289 are 170°C/4 min/5% SPI with desirability value of 0.507; from TME-419 are 180°C/2 min/5% SPI with desirability value of 0.475 while for those from TMS-30572 are 170°C/4 min/15% SPI with desirability value of 0.459. At higher SPI level, the protein content was high at 170°C. At 4 min frying time for all the varieties, the moisture content reduces. The most desired optimized fried snack produced from starch of TMS-30572 (containing 15% SPI) had higher crispness and lower oil content than other optimized fried snacks.",Microbial quality of reduced-sodium napa cabbage kimchi and its processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847142,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"This study evaluated the microbial safety of reduced-sodium napa cabbage kimchi products by comparing with conventional kimchi samples. Five commercial kimchi samples were collected from different manufacturers in Korea. Total aerobic plate counts and coliforms counts between regular and reduced-sodium kimchi were not significantly (p > 0.05) different and major foodborne pathogens, including Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in any sample. Bacillus cereus contamination among all kimchi samples was less than the regulation level (3.0 log CFU/g). However, high levels of coliforms were observed in both types of samples. To investigate microbial hazards of kimchi processing, we analyzed specific kimchi production processes and found five control points which can reduce coliform levels in kimchi samples. The results of this study could be helpful for the kimchi industry to produce safe reduced-sodium kimchi products.",Production of blueberry wine and volatile characterization of young and bottle-aging beverages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847141,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"The aim of this study was the production of blueberry wine and the characterization of the volatile compounds of fermented and aging in bottle products. Multivariate data analysis indicated similarity of volatile compounds released when fermentations were conducted at laboratory-scale and midscale, with the exception of one replicate creating a distinctive group characterized by low concentrations of acetaldehyde, methanol, 1-hexanol, and ethyl hexanoate, and the production of polyalcohols such as 2,3-butanediols. This experiment was the only one where no adjustments of YAN were performed. Some of the major volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and 2-phenylethanol) were found above their perception thresholds. Esters and terpenic compounds were the groups of volatiles expressed the most in blueberry wines, followed by volatile fatty acids, alcohols, and norisoprenoids (3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionone, 3-oxo-α-ionol, and 3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-β-ionol). The wines that experienced bottle-aging are characterized by high concentrations of ethyl esters, diethyl succinate, ethyl lactate, and diethyl malonate. The results contribute for deeper knowledge of the technological procedure, analytical characteristics, and volatile compounds of blueberry wines, reinforcing the interest in this beverage and opening perspectives for further studies on the production of new blueberry-based products with differential characteristics that value its nutraceutical and functional properties.",Effect of domestic cooking on rice protein digestibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847140,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"The effects of washing, soaking, and common domestic cooking methods (normal cooking, high-pressure cooking, and microwave cooking) on protein content, in vitro protein digestibility, and amino acid composition of japonica and indica rice were investigated. All processes in rice domestic cooking did not affect protein content. However, the gastric and gastrointestinal protein digestibilities decreased significantly after cooking. Protein solubility methods were used to observe the formation of disulfide bonds and hydrophobicity interactions after cooking. Disulfide bonds and hydrophobicity interactions were formed during cooking, and the cooking-induced disulfide bond cross-linking decreased the protein digestibility observably. Moreover, the solubility of 13 kDa prolamin subunit sharply decreased after cooking due to intramolecular disulfide bond cross-linking. Therefore, cooking-induced formation of intramolecular disulfide linkages might stabilize and strengthen the structure of protein body-I, which exhibited strong resistance to proteases, particularly pepsin. Cooking had limited effect on amino acids."

Meat extenders can contribute to lower sodium content by imparting complementary flavors while reducing caloric and sodium content. A systematic comparison of two meat extenders, namely mushrooms and textured soy (TSP) in terms of physical and sensory characteristics, is presented herein. The physical properties of the samples suggested that the use of mushroom and TSP extender would perform statistically similar to an all-meat control depending on the level of substitution. Hedonic sensory analysis showed meat extension using mushrooms yielded liking scores more similar to the all-meat formulations than TSP in reduced sodium applications. The results of this research suggest that mushrooms have the potential to be successfully incorporated into reduced sodium meat products to provide a healthier product.",Characterization of γ-glutamyltranspeptidases from dormant garlic and onion bulbs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847128,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"This study investigated the characteristics of γ-glutamyltranspeptidases (GGTs) isolated from dormant garlic (Allium sativum L.) and onion (Allium cepa L. var. agrogatum Don) bulbs. GGTs were isolated using (NH 4)2 SO 4 precipitation and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (phenyl-Sepharose column). The optimal temperature, optimal pH of extraction, and the effects of metal ions and organic compounds on the activity of GGTs were investigated. The optimal pH of the GGTs of garlic and onion was 5 and 7, respectively; the optimal temperatures were 70 and 50°C, respectively. Garlic's GGT had a major band at 53 kDa, whereas onion's GGT had two bands at 55 and 22 kDa. Cu2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, glucose, aspartic acid, and cysteine significantly enhanced the activity of garlic's GGT. Lysine and proline remarkably promoted the activity of onion's GGT, whereas Cu2+, glucose, and aspartic acid repress its activity. These results may deepen our understanding of allium GGTs and promote the commercial production of bioactive allium compounds.","Effects of chlorogenic acid, epicatechin gallate, and quercetin on mucin expression and secretion in the Caco-2/HT29-MTX cell model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847127,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Mucins are a family of large glycoproteins that represent the major structural components of the mucus and are encoded by 20 different mucin genes. Mucin expression can be modulated by different stimuli. In this study, we analyzed four mucins (MUC2, MUC3, MUC13, and MUC17) in coculture of Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells to demonstrate the variation in gene expression in the presence of antioxidant compounds like chlorogenic acid, epicatechin gallate, and quercetin (apple, tea, and coffee polyphenols, respectively). coculture of Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells was treated with polyphenols, and the expression of four mucins was determined by reverse-transcriptase PCR. In addition, the secretion levels of MUC2 were established by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) analysis. The results showed that each polyphenol compound induces different expression patterns of the mucin genes. Statistically significant up-regulation of MUC17 was observed following incubation with epicatechin gallate and quercetin. ELISA results did not prove any significant differences in protein levels of MUC2 after treatment by the polyphenol compounds. The polyphenols considered in this study may influence mucin secretion and act on diverse salivary substrates to change the barrier properties of mucins for mucus secretion in different ways.","Effects of prefermentative cold soak on polyphenols and volatiles of Aglianico, Primitivo and Nero di Troia red wines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847126,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Effectiveness of prefermentative cold soak (PCS) on polyphenols and volatiles extraction during winemaking of three red grape cultivars grown in southern Italy (Aglianico, Primitivo and Nero di Troia) was investigated. Four 200-L stainless steel horizontal rotary wine fermenters were used. The main result was that PCS improved the extraction of polyphenols and increased the antioxidant activity of wines. Extraction of proanthocyanidins was enhanced (+25%, +14% and +7% for Aglianico, Primitivo and Nero di Troia, respectively) and, consequently, the ratio flavans reactive with vanillin/proanthocyanidin was reduced, thus potentially favoring the chromatic and tannic stabilization of wines. As regards volatiles, PCS increased ester compounds at levels above their odor thresholds, potentially conferring fruity odor to wines. In conclusion, PCS could be favorably introduced in winemaking to enhance the enological potential of Aglianico, Primitivo and Nero di Troia wines.",Physicochemical properties of malted finger millet (Eleusine coracana) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847125,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Germinated and raw finger millet (Eleusine coracana) and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) were investigated for their physicochemical (pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), proximate, mineral analysis), phytochemical, and antioxidant properties. The results showed that there were decreases in pH (8.50-7.60) with a corresponding increase in TTA (0.0038-0.18 g/L) during germination of the millets. Proximate composition of the millets revealed slight increases in protein (7.61%-7.81%; 10.57%-11.87%) and crude fiber (5.54%-8.81%; 1.07%-2.55%) with reductions in fat (3.84%-2.73%; 7.69%-2.30%) after germination for finger and pearl millet, respectively. The millets were found to be rich sources of minerals, which include magnesium (1,028.42-1,763.50 ppm), calcium (36.42-4,158.40 ppm), sodium (150.00-510.00 ppm), potassium (470.00-4,500 ppm), zinc (20.00-40.00 ppm), and iron (66.00-121.00 ppm) which either decreased or increased with germination. The results of the phytochemical composition revealed that during germination, alkaloid (36.03-74.53 mg/g) and saponin (4.46-31.91 mg/g) contents were found to increase while there were reductions in tannin (0.88-1.64 mg/g) and phytate (7.00-17.72 mg/g) content of the flour. For finger millet, DPPH ranged from 70.00% to 72.14% and pearl millet (49.95%-64.01%), while for FRAP, pearl millet (53.69-53.76 mg/g) demonstrated better activity compared to finger millet (46.91-53.54 mg/g). Findings from this work may suggest that further studies should be carried out on germinated finger and pearl millets to examine their abilities to serve as functional foods.","Bioactive compounds, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Arum maculatum leaves extracts as affected by various solvents and extraction methods.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847124,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"The different species of Arum maculatum plant can be found in all over the world, and a wide range of medicinal applications has been mentioned for them. Thus, it can also be valued as a source of natural compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. In this study, the effect of solvents (water, ethanol, ethanol:water (50:50)) and extraction methods (maceration and ultrasound) on the extraction yields and bioactive properties of extracts were analyzed. The antioxidant capacity of Arum maculatum leaves extracts was investigated, and the concentrations of total phenolics, tocopherols, tannins and flavonoids were determined. 1,1-diphenyl 2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH), β-Carotene bleaching, and oxidative stability index (OSI) were used to determine antioxidant activity. The ability to scavenge radicals was measured in these experiments by the discoloration of the solution. Also, the antimicrobial activity of different extracts against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was evaluated by using of microdilution and agar diffusion assays. The results demonstrated that ultrasonic extracts (especially ethanol:water (50:50) solvent) had the higher extraction yield and antioxidant potential than maceration extracts. All extracts were effective against all tested bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes was the most sensitive bacterium with lowest MIC value (12.5 mg/ml) and biggest diameter of growth inhibition zone (13.77 mm). Generally, this Arum maculatum leaves extracts can be suggested as an economical source of antioxidant and antimicrobial agents and can be a suitable substitute for artificial and chemical food preservatives.",The effect of different processing methods on nutrient and isoflavone content of soymilk obtained from six varieties of soybean grown in Rwanda.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847123,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Soymilk is rich in nutrients and isoflavones, and could greatly promote nutrition and health. However, this product is not widely accepted due to an objectionable beany flavor. Several methods involving heat treatment and soaking in basic solutions prior to soymilk extraction have been reported to reduce the objectionable flavor. However, the effects of such treatments on the nutritional value and isoflavone content of soymilk, and the responses of different soybean varieties to nutrient extraction by these methods is not well studied. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of three processing methods on protein, fat, minerals, and isoflavone content in soymilk from six soybean varieties grown in Rwanda (Peka-6, SB 24, Sc. Sequel, Sc, Squire, and a local variety) to find the best variety and processing method. The first method (M1) involved soaking soybeans in water for 12 hr prior to milk extraction, M2 involved blanching in NaHCO 3 prior to extraction and M3 involved soaking in NaHCO 3 solution for 16 hr and subsequent cooking prior to extraction. M1 resulted in significantly higher nutrient and isoflavone extraction than M2 and M3. Thus, M1 extracted more nutrients and can be recommended for soymilk production. However, where consumers prefer soymilk obtained by M2 or M3, Sc Squire and the local variety may be recommended. Sc. Squire has another advantage of higher isoflavone content than the other varieties. Further comprehensive studies on the sensory acceptability of products made from different varieties by different methods among different consumer categories will be necessary.",Purification of total flavonoids from Rhizoma Smilacis Glabrae through cyclodextrin-assisted extraction and resin adsorption.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847122,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Flavonoids are the main bioactive components responded for the health promoting effects of Rhizoma Smilacis Glabrae (RSG), an herbal material used in many functional food of China. An eco-friendly method with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-assisted extraction and resin adsorption/desorption was developed for total flavonoids purification from RSG. Because of complexes formation between flavonoids and β-CD, aqueous solution was used for extraction instead of ethanol. The CD-assisted extraction was optimized through defining optimal CD species, concentration, extraction temperature, and time. The adsorption property of eight macroporous resins on astilbin was compared by adsorption kinetics and capacity. All resins could reach the adsorption equilibrium within 2 hr. Further analyzed by Langmuir and Freundlich models, H103 resin with the best adsorption capacity was selected. The desorption property of different ethanol-water solution was compared. Results showed that by using 75% ethanol, astilbin could be well desorbed from the resin with the recovery of 96.3%. Because of complexes formation, the presence of β-CD would slightly decrease the adsorption rate and capacity of H103 with concentration dependent. In dynamic adsorption, decreasing the flow rate could minish the effects of β-CD. The developed method was successfully used for total flavonoids purified from RSG. The yield of purified product was 8.78%, with astilbin and total flavonoids content of 363.8 and 505.7 mg/g, respectively. The purity was 1.74 times increased with the recovery of 94.38% compared with the extract obtained directly through 50% ethanol extraction.",Effects of postharvest polyamine application and edible coating on maintaining quality of mango (Mangifera indica L.) cv. Langra during cold storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847120,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"Mango is a tropical fruit which is sensitive to chilling injury. The present work investigated the potential of edible coatings of chitosan and polyamine spermidine in increasing shelf life and quality of mango. The control fruits (treated with distilled water) and the mango fruits treated with different concentrations of chitosan (0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) and spermidine (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM) were studied to improve postharvest characteristics and quality maintenance during cold storage. Parameters such as firmness, weight loss, fungal contamination, total phenol, antioxidant activity, vitamin C, pH, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), flavor index, color index, and ethylene production were measured after at harvest (0), 8, 16, and 24 days of storage at 15 ± 2°C and relative humidity of 85%-90%. Chitosan and spermidine delayed water loss, firmness, and fungal contamination. Application of chitosan containing ascorbic acid significantly increased phenolic content and antioxidant activity compared to the control plants. It also changed soluble solid content, TA, pH of pulp, and sugar content and decreased ethylene production. The obtained results suggested that chitosan (2%) and spermidine (2 mM) had potential to improve firmness and delay deterioration processes of ""Langra"" mango after harvest.","Heat stability of the in vitro inhibitory effect of spices on lipase, amylase, and glucosidase enzymes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847119,Food science & nutrition,2019 03 10,"This study investigated the effect of boiling on the inhibitory action of spices on digestive enzymes. Unboiled extracts of Trigonella foenum-graecum (seed) (25.42%), Myristica fragrans (seed) (22.70%), and Cuminum cyminum (seed) (19.17%) showed significantly (p < 0.05) a higher lipase inhibitory activity than their respective boiled extracts (20.23%, 15.74%, and 12.57%). Unboiled extracts of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (stem bark) (-16.98%) and Foeniculum officinale (seed) (-16.05%) showed an activation of lipase enzyme, and boiling significantly (p < 0.05) changed the activity into lipase inhibition as 8.47% and 9.54%, respectively. Unboiled extracts of Coriandrm sativum (seed), C. cyminum, and Elettaria cardamomum (seed) showed an activation of amylase enzyme, and boiling these extracts significantly reduced the enzyme activation. The other unboiled extracts showed a higher amylase inhibition than the boiled extracts, whereas the boiled extracts of C.longa (rhizome) and Syzygium aromaticum (flower) exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) lower values. Unboiled extracts of C. zeylanicum, M. fragrans, and S. aromaticum showed an insignificantly higher glucosidase inhibitory activity than the boiled extracts. Inhibition of digestive enzymes by nutritional intervention is one avenue to be considered in treating diet-induced obesity and in the management of postprandial hyperglycemia. Spices, used as food additives, could be a potential source of digestive enzyme inhibitors. The current study revealed that unboiled extracts of T. foenum-graecum (seed), C. cyminum (seed), and M. fragrans (seed) are more effective than the boiled extracts as an antiobesity therapy. Moreover, it endorses the use of infusion of T. foenum-graecum seeds as an antiobesity therapy."

We examined the evolution of bifenazate resistance in China in the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) Tetranychus uticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), one of the most resistant arthropods, by using bioassays, detection of mutations in the target cytb gene, and population genetic structure analysis using microsatellite markers. Bioassays showed variable levels of resistance to bifenazate. The cytb mutation G126S, which confers medium resistance in TSSM to bifenazate, had previously been detected prior to the application of bifenazate and was now widespread, suggesting likely resistance evolution from standing genetic variation. G126S was detected in geographically distant populations across different genetic clusters, pointing to the independent origin of this mutation in different TSSM populations. A novel A269V mutation linked to a low-level resistance was detected in two southern populations. Widespread resistance associated with a high frequency of the G126S allele was found in four populations from the Beijing area which were not genetically differentiated. In this case, a high level of gene flows likely accelerated the development of resistance within this local region, as well as into an outlying region distant from Beijing. These findings, therefore, suggest patterns consistent with both local evolution of pesticide resistance as well as an impact of migration, helping to inform resistance management strategies in TSSM.",Prioritization of landscape connectivity for the conservation of Peary caribou.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847104,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Adequate connectivity between discontinuous habitat patches is crucial for the persistence of metapopulations across space and time. Loss of landscape connectivity is often a direct result of fragmentation caused by human activities but also can be caused indirectly through anthropogenic climate change. Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) are widely dispersed across the islands of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and rely on sea ice to move seasonally between island habitats throughout their range. Seasonal connectivity provided by sea ice is necessary to maintain genetic diversity and to facilitate dispersal and recolonization of areas from which caribou have been extirpated. We used least-cost path analysis and circuit theory to model connectivity across Peary caribou range, and future climate projections to investigate how this connectivity might be affected by a warming climate. Further, we used measures of current flow centrality to estimate the role of High Arctic islands in maintaining connectivity between Peary caribou populations and to identify and prioritize those islands and linkages most important for conservation. Our results suggest that the Bathurst Island complex plays a critical role in facilitating connectivity between Peary caribou populations. Large islands, including Banks, Victoria, and Ellesmere have limited roles in connecting Peary caribou. Without rigorous greenhouse gas emission reductions our projections indicate that by 2100 all connectivity between the more southern Peary caribou populations will be lost for important spring and early-winter movement periods. Continued connectivity across the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and possibly Peary caribou persistence, ultimately hinges on global commitments to limit climate change. Our research highlights priority areas where, in addition to emission reductions, conservation efforts to maintain connectivity would be most effective.",Different roles of elevational and local environmental factors on abundance-based beta diversity of the soil Enchytraeidae on the Changbai Mountain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847103,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"The elevational alpha biodiversity gradient in mountain regions is one of the well-known ecological patterns, but its beta diversity pattern remains poorly known. Examining the beta diversity and its components could enhance the understanding of community assembly mechanism. We studied the beta diversity pattern of the soil enchytraeids along a distinct elevational gradient (705-2,280 m) on the Changbai Mountain, the best-preserved mountain in northeastern China. The overall abundance-based community dissimilarity was relatively high (ca. 0.70), largely due to the balanced-variation component (85%). The overall dissimilarity and its balanced-variation (substitution) component were related to both local environmental heterogeneity and elevational distance, with the environmental relationships being stronger. In contrast, the abundance-gradient (subsets) component was not related to the two gradients. The same important spatial and environmental variables were detected in structuring overall dissimilarity and substitution component, different from that in subsets component. Variation partitioning analysis showed that environmental control played a more important role than spatial (vertical and horizontal) factors in structuring the patterns of overall beta diversity and its two components. The predictive power of multivariate analysis was higher for the substitution component (nearly 50%) and overall dissimilarity (35%), but much lower for subsets components (<4%). These findings implied that abundance-based beta diversity patterns of the soil enchytraeids were the results of different ecological processes (e.g., environmental sorting and dispersal limitation), operating in the two antithetic components. Our study showed the substitution and loss of individuals reflecting different ecological processes and highlights the importance of partitioning beta diversity in assessing biodiversity patterns and their causes.",Scent of death: Evolution from sea to land of an extreme collective attraction to conspecific death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847102,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"All living organisms must eventually die, though in some cases their death can bring life-giving opportunities. Few studies, however, have experimentally tested how animals capitalize on conspecific death and why this specialization would evolve. Here, we conducted experiments on the phylogenetically most closely-related marine and terrestrial hermit crabs to investigate the evolution of responses to death during the sea-to-land transition. In the sea, death of both conspecifics and heterospecifics generates unremodeled shells needed by marine hermit crabs. In contrast, on land, terrestrial hermit crabs are specialized to live in architecturally remodeled shells, and the sole opportunity to acquire these essential resources is conspecific death. We experimentally tested these different species' responsiveness to the scent of conspecific versus heterospecific death, predicting that conspecific death would have special attractive value for the terrestrial species. We found the terrestrial species was overwhelmingly attracted to conspecific death, rapidly approaching and forming social groupings around conspecific death sites that dwarfed those around heterospecific death sites. This differential responsiveness to conspecific versus heterospecific death was absent in marine species. Our results thus reveal that on land a reliance on resources associated exclusively with conspecifics has favored the evolution of an extreme collective attraction to conspecific death.",Seed germination and seedling growth of five desert plants and their relevance to vegetation restoration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847101,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Due to significant decreases in precipitation in northern China, knowledge of the response of seed germination and plant growth characteristics to key limiting factors is essential for vegetation restoration. We examined seed germination under different temperatures and water potentials, and we examined seedling growth under different amounts of water supply. Experiments were carried out in automatic temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled growth chambers. Under low water potentials, the final germination percentages of four herbaceous species were high, while seed germination of the shrub species Caragana microphylla was significantly inhibited. Under the different water supply amounts, seedlings of Agropyron cristatum allocated more biomass to the root and had a higher growth rate than those of Elymus dahuricus and C. microphylla. In light of these results and drier environmental conditions (annual mean precipitation is 366 mm, which falling mainly between June and August), potential selections for revegetation of different landscapes include the following: A. cristatum for shifting sand dunes, the establishment of the pioneer species Agriophyllum squarrosum, C. microphylla for semifixed sand dunes, E. dahuricus for fixed sand dunes, and Melilotus suaveolens and Medicago sativa for cultivation.",Seed germination responses to seasonal temperature and drought stress are species-specific but not related to seed size in a desert steppe: Implications for effect of climate change on community structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847100,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Investigating how seed germination of multiple species in an ecosystem responds to environmental conditions is crucial for understanding the mechanisms for community structure and biodiversity maintenance. However, knowledge of seed germination response of species to environmental conditions is still scarce at the community level. We hypothesized that responses of seed germination to environmental conditions differ among species at the community level, and that germination response is not correlated with seed size. To test this hypothesis, we determined the response of seed germination of 20 common species in the Siziwang Desert Steppe, China, to seasonal temperature regimes (representing April, May, June, and July) and drought stress (0, -0.003, -0.027, -0.155, and -0.87 MPa). Seed germination percentage increased with increasing temperature regime, but Allium ramosum, Allium tenuissimum, Artemisia annua, Artemisia mongolica,Artemisia scoparia, Artemisia sieversiana, Bassia dasyphylla, Kochia prastrata, and Neopallasia pectinata germinated to >60% in the lowest temperature regime (April). Germination decreased with increasing water stress, but Allium ramosum, Artemisia annua, Artemisia scoparia, Bassia dasyphylla, Heteropappus altaicus, Kochia prastrata, Neopallasia pectinata, and Potentilla tanacetifolia germinated to near 60% at -0.87 MPa. Among these eight species, germination of six was tolerant to both temperature and water stress. Mean germination percentage in the four temperature regimes and the five water potentials was not significantly correlated with seed mass or seed area, which were highly correlated. Our results suggest that the species-specific germination responses to environmental conditions are important in structuring the desert steppe community and have implications for predicting community structure under climate change. Thus, the predicted warmer and dryer climate will favor germination of drought-tolerant species, resulting in altered proportions of germinants of different species and subsequently change in community composition of the desert steppe.",Climate and food diversity as drivers of mammal diversity in Inner Mongolia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847099,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Traditionally, geographical distribution of biodiversity is assumed to be codetermined by multiple factors, for example, temperature, precipitation, environmental heterogeneity, and biotic interactions. However, few studies have simultaneously compared the relative roles of these factors in shaping the mammal diversity patterns for different feeding groups, that is, herbivores, insectivores, and carnivores. In this study, we assessed the relations between mammal diversity and current climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation), altitudinal range as well as mammal's food diversity in Inner Mongolia. Our results showed that the species richness for the three feeding guilds of mammals consistently increased with their food diversity, that is, species richness of plants, insects, and rodents. Mammal diversity also significantly decreased with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Random Forest models indicated that climate and food diversity were always included in the combinations of variables most associated with mammal diversity. Our findings suggest that while climate is an important predictor of large scale distribution of mammal diversity, biotic interactions, that is, food diversity, could also play important roles.",Toward reliable population density estimates of partially marked populations using spatially explicit mark-resight methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847098,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Camera traps are used increasingly to estimate population density for elusive and difficult to observe species. A standard practice for mammalian surveys is to place cameras on roads, trails, and paths to maximize detections and/or increase efficiency in the field. However, for many species it is unclear whether track-based camera surveys provide reliable estimates of population density.Understanding how the spatial arrangement of camera traps affects population density estimates is of key interest to contemporary conservationists and managers given the rapid increase in camera-based wildlife surveys.We evaluated the effect of camera-trap placement, using several survey designs, on density estimates of a widespread mesopredator, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, over a two-year period in a semi-arid conservation reserve in south-eastern Australia. Further, we used the certainty in the identity and whereabouts of individuals (via GPS collars) to assess how resighting rates of marked foxes affect density estimates using maximum likelihood spatially explicit mark-resight methods.Fox detection rates were much higher at cameras placed on tracks compared with off-track cameras, yet in the majority of sessions, camera placement had relatively little effect on point estimates of density. However, for each survey design, the precision of density estimates varied considerably across sessions, influenced heavily by the absolute number of marked foxes detected, the number of times marked foxes was resighted, and the number of detection events of unmarked foxes.Our research demonstrates that the precision of population density estimates using spatially explicit mark-resight models is sensitive to resighting rates of identifiable individuals. Nonetheless, camera surveys based either on- or off-track can provide reliable estimates of population density using spatially explicit mark-resight models. This underscores the importance of incorporating information on the spatial behavior of the subject species when planning camera-trap surveys.",Vegetation phenology and nest survival: Diagnosing heterogeneous effects through time.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847097,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Birds should select nest sites that minimize predation risk, but understanding the influence of vegetation on nest survival has proven problematic. Specifically, the common practice of measuring vegetation on nest fate date can overestimate its effect on nest survival, simply because vegetation at hatched nests grows for a longer period of time than vegetation at nests that were depredated. Here, we sampled the literature to determine the prevalence of this bias in studies of duck breeding ecology. We then used survival data collected from ~2,800 duck nests to empirically evaluate evidence of bias in four different vegetation metrics: vegetation density measured when the nest was found, density when the nest was fated, and date-corrected regression residuals of these two. We also diagnosed the magnitude of vegetation effects on nest survival by restricting our analysis to only nests which were fated contemporaneously (thereby removing potential bias in the timing of measurement). Finally, we examined whether systematic phenological differences exist between vegetation at hatched and depredated nests that have the potential to further obfuscate the relationship between vegetation and nest survival. We found evidence for a true-positive effect of vegetation density on nest survival that appeared to be inflated when using raw vegetation measurements collected at fate date. However, taken in combination with the literature review, our results suggest that the majority of duck nesting studies have evaluated the role of vegetation on nest survival using a relatively less biased metric-vegetation density when the nest was found. Finally, we found that over the course of a nesting attempt, vegetation increased in density at successful nests, but decreased in density at depredated nests. As a consequence, duck researchers using vegetation data collected when the nest was found may actually be underestimating the magnitude of the effect. This seasonal change potentially points to an important new metric for understanding predation risk, but further experimental research is required to fully eliminate potential biases in the timing of vegetation measurements.",Comparing RADseq and microsatellites for estimating genetic diversity and relatedness - Implications for brown trout conservation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847096,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"The conservation and management of endangered species requires information on their genetic diversity, relatedness and population structure. The main genetic markers applied for these questions are microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the latter of which remain the more resource demanding approach in most cases. Here, we compare the performance of two approaches, SNPs obtained by restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) and 16 DNA microsatellite loci, for estimating genetic diversity, relatedness and genetic differentiation of three, small, geographically close wild brown trout (Salmo trutta) populations and a regionally used hatchery strain. The genetic differentiation, quantified as FST, was similar when measured using 16 microsatellites and 4,876 SNPs. Based on both marker types, each brown trout population represented a distinct gene pool with a low level of interbreeding. Analysis of SNPs identified half- and full-siblings with a higher probability than the analysis based on microsatellites, and SNPs outperformed microsatellites in estimating individual-level multilocus heterozygosity. Overall, the results indicated that moderately polymorphic microsatellites and SNPs from RADseq agreed on estimates of population genetic structure in moderately diverged, small populations, but RADseq outperformed microsatellites for applications that required individual-level genotype information, such as quantifying relatedness and individual-level heterozygosity. The results can be applied to other small populations with low or moderate levels of genetic diversity."

This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the phylogeography of the European stone crayfish (Austropotamobius torrentium) and includes samples from previously unstudied sites. Two mitochondrial markers were used to reveal evolutionary relationships among haplogroups throughout the species' distributional range and to estimate the divergence time by employing both substitution rates and geological calibration methods. Our haplotype network reconstruction and phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of a previously unknown haplogroup distributed in Romania's Apuseni Mountains. This haplogroup is closely related to others that are endemic in the Dinarides, despite their vast geographical separation (~600 km). The separation is best explained by the well-dated tectonic displacement of the Tisza-Dacia microplate, which started in the Miocene (~16 Ma) and possibly carried part of the A. torrentium population to the current location of the Apuseni Mountains. This population may thus have been isolated from the Dinarides for a period of ca. 11 m.y. by marine and lacustrine phases of the Pannonian Basin. The inclusion of this geological event as a calibration point in divergence time analyses challenges currently accepted crayfish evolutionary time frames for the region, constraining the evolution of this area's crayfish to a much earlier date. We discuss why molecular clock calibrations previously employed to date European crayfish species divergences should therefore be reconsidered.","DNA barcoding of Corydalis, the most taxonomically complicated genus of Papaveraceae.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847083,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"The genus Corydalis is recognized as one of the most taxonomically challenging plant taxa. It is mainly distributed in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains, a global biodiversity hotspot. To date, no effective solution for species discrimination and taxonomic assignment in Corydalis has been developed. In this study, five nuclear and chloroplast DNA regions, ITS, ITS2, matK, rbcL, and psbA-trnH, were preliminarily assessed based on their ability to discriminate Corydalis to eliminate inefficient regions, and the three regions showing good performance (ITS, ITS2 and matK) were then evaluated in 131 samples representing 28 species of 11 sections of four subgenera in Corydalis using three analytical methods (NJ, ML, MP tree; K2P-distance and BLAST). The results showed that the various approaches exhibit different species identification power and that BLAST shows the best performance among the tested approaches. A comparison of different barcodes indicated that among the single barcodes, ITS (65.2%) exhibited the highest identification success rate and that the combination of ITS + matK (69.6%) provided the highest species resolution among all single barcodes and their combinations. Three Pharmacopoeia-recorded medicinal plants and their materia medica were identified successfully based on the ITS and ITS2 regions. In the phylogenetic analysis, the sections Thalictrifoliae, Sophorocapnos, Racemosae, Aulacostigma, and Corydalis formed well-supported separate lineages. We thus hypothesize that the five sections should be classified as an independent subgenus and that the genus should be divided into three subgenera. In this study, DNA barcoding provided relatively high species discrimination power, indicating that it can be used for species discrimination in this taxonomically complicated genus and as a potential tool for the authentication of materia medica belonging to Corydalis.",Investigating the role of Osiris genes in Drosophila sechellia larval resistance to a host plant toxin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847082,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"The underlying genetic basis of adaptive phenotypic changes is generally poorly understood, yet a growing number of case studies are beginning to shed light on important questions about the molecular nature and pleiotropy of such changes. We use Drosophila sechellia, a dietary specialist fruit fly that evolved to specialize on a single toxic host plant, Morinda citrifolia, as a model for adaptive phenotypic change and seek to determine the genetic basis of traits associated with host specialization in this species. The fruit of M. citrifolia is toxic to other drosophilids, primarily due to high levels of the defense chemical octanoic acid (OA), yet D. sechellia has evolved resistance to OA. Our prior work identified three Osiris family genes that reside in a fine-mapped QTL for OA resistance: Osiris 6 (Osi6), Osi7, and Osi8, which can alter OA resistance in adult D. melanogaster when knocked down with RNA interference suggesting they may contribute to OA resistance in D. sechellia. Genetic mapping identified overlapping genomic regions involved in larval and adult OA resistance in D. sechellia, yet it remains unknown whether Osiris genes contribute to resistance in both life stages. Furthermore, because multiple genomic regions contribute to OA resistance, we aim to identify other gene(s) involved in this adaptation. Here, we identify candidate larval OA resistance genes using RNA sequencing to measure genome-wide differential gene expression in D. sechellia larvae after exposure to OA and functionally test identified genes for a role in OA resistance. We then test the Osiris genes previously shown to alter adult OA resistance for effects on OA resistance in larvae. We found that Osi8 knockdown decreased OA resistance in D. melanogaster larvae. These data suggest that evolved changes in Osi8 could impact OA resistance in multiple life stages while Osi6 and Osi7 may only impact adult resistance to OA.",Water salinity and inundation control soil carbon decomposition during salt marsh restoration: An incubation experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847081,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Coastal wetlands are a significant carbon (C) sink since they store carbon in anoxic soils. This ecosystem service is impacted by hydrologic alteration and management of these coastal habitats. Efforts to restore tidal flow to former salt marshes have increased in recent decades and are generally associated with alteration of water inundation levels and salinity. This study examined the effect of water level and salinity changes on soil organic matter decomposition during a 60-day incubation period. Intact soil cores from impounded fresh water marsh and salt marsh were incubated after addition of either sea water or fresh water under flooded and drained water levels. Elevating fresh water marsh salinity to 6 to 9 ppt enhanced CO2 emission by 50%-80% and most typically decreased CH4 emissions, whereas, decreasing the salinity from 26 ppt to 19 ppt in salt marsh soils had no effect on CO2 or CH4 fluxes. The effect from altering water levels was more pronounced with drained soil cores emitting ~10-fold more CO2 than the flooded treatment in both marsh sediments. Draining soil cores also increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Stable carbon isotope analysis of CO2 generated during the incubations of fresh water marsh cores in drained soils demonstrates that relict peat OC that accumulated when the marsh was saline was preferentially oxidized when sea water was introduced. This study suggests that restoration of tidal flow that raises the water level from drained conditions would decrease aerobic decomposition and enhance C sequestration. It is also possible that the restoration would increase soil C decomposition of deeper deposits by anaerobic oxidation, however this impact would be minimal compared to lower emissions expected due to the return of flooding conditions.",Environmental filtering predicts plant-community trait distribution and diversity: Kettle holes as models of meta-community systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847080,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Meta-communities of habitat islands may be essential to maintain biodiversity in anthropogenic landscapes allowing rescue effects in local habitat patches. To understand the species-assembly mechanisms and dynamics of such ecosystems, it is important to test how local plant-community diversity and composition is affected by spatial isolation and hence by dispersal limitation and local environmental conditions acting as filters for local species sorting.We used a system of 46 small wetlands (kettle holes)-natural small-scale freshwater habitats rarely considered in nature conservation policies-embedded in an intensively managed agricultural matrix in northern Germany. We compared two types of kettle holes with distinct topographies (flat-sloped, ephemeral, frequently plowed kettle holes vs. steep-sloped, more permanent ones) and determined 254 vascular plant species within these ecosystems, as well as plant functional traits and nearest neighbor distances to other kettle holes.Differences in alpha and beta diversity between steep permanent compared with ephemeral flat kettle holes were mainly explained by species sorting and niche processes and mass effect processes in ephemeral flat kettle holes. The plant-community composition as well as the community trait distribution in terms of life span, breeding system, dispersal ability, and longevity of seed banks significantly differed between the two habitat types. Flat ephemeral kettle holes held a higher percentage of non-perennial plants with a more persistent seed bank, less obligate outbreeders and more species with seed dispersal abilities via animal vectors compared with steep-sloped, more permanent kettle holes that had a higher percentage of wind-dispersed species. In the flat kettle holes, plant-species richness was negatively correlated with the degree of isolation, whereas no such pattern was found for the permanent kettle holes.Synthesis: Environment acts as filter shaping plant diversity (alpha and beta) and plant-community trait distribution between steep permanent compared with ephemeral flat kettle holes supporting species sorting and niche mechanisms as expected, but we identified a mass effect in ephemeral kettle holes only. Flat ephemeral kettle holes can be regarded as meta-ecosystems that strongly depend on seed dispersal and recruitment from a seed bank, whereas neighboring permanent kettle holes have a more stable local species diversity.",Microsite conditions in retrogressive thaw slumps may facilitate increased seedling recruitment in the Alaskan Low Arctic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847079,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"In Low Arctic tundra, thermal erosion of ice-rich permafrost soils (thermokarst) has increased in frequency since the 1980s. Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS) are thermokarst disturbances forming large open depressions on hillslopes through soil wasting and vegetation displacement. Tall (>0.5 m) deciduous shrubs have been observed in RTS a decade after disturbance. RTS may provide conditions suitable for seedling recruitment, which may contribute to Arctic shrub expansion. We quantified in situ seedling abundance, and size and viability of soil seedbanks in greenhouse trials for two RTS chronosequences near lakes on Alaska's North Slope. We hypothesized recent RTS provide microsites for greater recruitment than mature RTS or undisturbed tundra. We also hypothesized soil seedbanks demonstrate quantity-quality trade-offs; younger seedbanks contain smaller numbers of mostly viable seed that decrease in viability as seed accumulates over time. We found five times as many seedlings in younger RTS as in older RTS, including birch and willow, and no seedlings in undisturbed tundra. Higher seedling counts were associated with bare soil, warmer soils, higher soil available nitrogen, and less plant cover. Seedbank viability was unrelated to size. Older seedbanks were larger at one chronosequence, with no difference in percent germination. At the other chronosequence, germination was lower from older seedbanks but seedbank size was not different. Seedbank germination was positively associated with in situ seedling abundance at one RTS chronosequence, suggesting postdisturbance revegetation from seedbanks. Thermal erosion may be important for recruitment in tundra by providing bare microsites that are warmer, more nutrient-rich, and less vegetated than in undisturbed ground. Differences between two chronosequences in seedbank size, viability, and species composition suggest disturbance interacts with local conditions to form seedbanks. RTS may act as seedling nurseries to benefit many Arctic species as climate changes, particularly those that do not produce persistent seed.",Fire legacies in eastern ponderosa pine forests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847078,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Disturbance legacies structure communities and ecological memory, but due to increasing changes in disturbance regimes, it is becoming more difficult to characterize disturbance legacies or determine how long they persist. We sought to quantify the characteristics and persistence of material legacies (e.g., biotic residuals of disturbance) that arise from variation in fire severity in an eastern ponderosa pine forest in North America. We compared forest stand structure and understory woody plant and bird community composition and species richness across unburned, low-, moderate-, and high-severity burn patches in a 27-year-old mixed-severity wildfire that had received minimal post-fire management. We identified distinct tree densities (high: 14.3 ± 7.4 trees per ha, moderate: 22.3 ± 12.6, low: 135.3 ± 57.1, unburned: 907.9 ± 246.2) and coarse woody debris cover (high: 8.5 ± 1.6% cover per 30 m transect, moderate: 4.3 ± 0.7, low: 2.3 ± 0.6, unburned: 1.0 ± 0.4) among burn severities. Understory woody plant communities differed between high-severity patches, moderate- and low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p < 0.05). Bird communities differed between high- and moderate-severity patches, low-severity patches, and unburned patches (all p < 0.05). Bird species richness varied across burn severities: low-severity patches had the highest (5.29 ± 1.44) and high-severity patches had the lowest (2.87 ± 0.72). Understory woody plant richness was highest in unburned (5.93 ± 1.10) and high-severity (5.07 ± 1.17) patches, and it was lower in moderate- (3.43 ± 1.17) and low-severity (3.43 ± 1.06) patches. We show material fire legacies persisted decades after the mixed-severity wildfire in eastern ponderosa forest, fostering distinct structures, communities, and species in burned versus unburned patches and across fire severities. At a patch scale, eastern and western ponderosa system responses to mixed-severity fires were consistent.","DNA barcoding of flowering plants in Sumatra, Indonesia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847077,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"The rapid conversion of Southeast Asian lowland rainforests into monocultures calls for the development of rapid methods for species identification to support ecological research and sustainable land-use management. Here, we investigated the utilization of DNA barcodes for identifying flowering plants from Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 1,207 matK barcodes (441 species) and 2,376 rbcL barcodes (750 species) were successfully generated. The barcode effectiveness is assessed using four approaches: (a) comparison between morphological and molecular identification results, (b) best-close match analysis with TaxonDNA, (c) barcoding gap analysis, and (d) formation of monophyletic groups. Results show that rbcL has a much higher level of sequence recoverability than matK (95% and 66%). The comparison between morphological and molecular identifications revealed that matK and rbcL worked best assigning a plant specimen to the genus level. Estimates of identification success using best-close match analysis showed that >70% of the investigated species were correctly identified when using single barcode. The use of two-loci barcodes was able to increase the identification success up to 80%. The barcoding gap analysis revealed that neither matK nor rbcL succeeded to create a clear gap between the intraspecific and interspecific divergences. However, these two barcodes were able to discriminate at least 70% of the species from each other. Fifteen genera and twenty-one species were found to be nonmonophyletic with both markers. The two-loci barcodes were sufficient to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among the plant taxa in the study area that are congruent with the broadly accepted APG III phylogeny.",A multilocus phylogeny of the fish genus Poeciliopsis: Solving taxonomic uncertainties and preliminary evidence of reticulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847076,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"The fish genus Poeciliopsis constitutes a valuable research system for evolutionary ecology, whose phylogenetic relationships have not been fully elucidated. We conducted a multilocus phylogenetic study of the genus based on seven nuclear and two mitochondrial loci with a thorough set of analytical approaches, that is, concatenated (also known as super-matrix), species trees, and phylogenetic networks. Although several relationships remain unresolved, the overall results uncovered phylogenetic affinities among several members of this genus. A population previously considered of undetermined taxonomic status could be unequivocally assigned to P. scarlli; revealing a relatively recent dispersal event across the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) or Pacific Ocean, which constitute a strong barrier to north-south dispersal of many terrestrial and freshwater taxa. The closest relatives of P. balsas, a species distributed south of the TMVB, are distributed in the north; representing an additional north-south split in the genus. An undescribed species of Poeciliopsis, with a highly restricted distribution (i.e., a short stretch of the Rio Concepcion; just south of the US-Mexico border), falls within the Leptorhaphis species complex. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that this species originated by ""breakdown"" of an asexual hybrid lineage. On the other hand, network analyses suggest one or more possible cases of reticulation within the genus that require further evaluation with genome-wide marker representation and additional analytical tools. The most strongly supported case of reticulation occurred within the subgenus Aulophallus (restricted to Central America), and implies a hybrid origin for P. retropinna (i.e., between P. paucimaculata and P. elongata). We consider that P. balsas and P. new species are of conservation concern.","Limited effects of early snowmelt on plants, decomposers, and soil nutrients in Arctic tundra soils.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847075,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"In addition to warming temperatures, Arctic ecosystems are responding to climate change with earlier snowmelt and soil thaw. Earlier snowmelt has been examined infrequently in field experiments, and we lack a comprehensive look at belowground responses of the soil biogeochemical system that includes plant roots, decomposers, and soil nutrients. We experimentally advanced the timing of snowmelt in factorial combination with an open-top chamber warming treatment over a 3-year period and evaluated the responses of decomposers and nutrient cycling processes. We tested two alternative hypotheses: (a) Early snowmelt and warming advance the timing of root growth and nutrient uptake, altering the timing of microbial and invertebrate activity and key nutrient cycling events; and (b) loss of insulating snow cover damages plants, leading to reductions in root growth and altered biological activity. During the 3 years of our study (2010-2012), we advanced snowmelt by 4, 15, and 10 days, respectively. Despite advancing aboveground plant phenology, particularly in the year with the warmest early-season temperatures (2012), belowground effects were primarily seen only on the first sampling date of the season or restricted to particular years or soil type. Overall, consistent and substantial responses to early snowmelt were not observed, counter to both of our hypotheses. The data on soil physical conditions, as well interannual comparisons of our results, suggest that this limited response was because of the earlier date of snowmelt that did not coincide with substantially warmer air and soil temperatures as they might in response to a natural climate event. We conclude that the interaction of snowmelt timing with soil temperatures is important to how the ecosystem will respond, but that 1- to 2-week changes in timing of snowmelt alone are not enough to drive season-long changes in soil microbial and nutrient cycling processes."

GPS units, which form the primary source of location data, have become cheaper, more accurate, lighter and less power-hungry, and their accuracy has been further improved with the addition of inertial measurement units. The consequence is a glut of geospatial time series data, recorded at rates that range from one position fix every several hours (to maximize system lifetime) to ten fixes per second (in high dynamic situations). Since data of this quality and volume have only recently become available, the analytical methods to extract behavioral information from raw position data are at an early stage of development. An instance of this lies in the analysis of animal movement patterns. When investigating solitary animals, the timing and location of instances of avoidance and association are important behavioral markers. In this paper, a novel analytical method to detect avoidance and association between individuals is proposed; unlike existing methods, assumptions about the shape of the territories or the nature of individual movement are not needed. Simulations demonstrate that false positives (type I error) are rare (1%-3%), which means that the test rarely suggests that there is an association if there is none.",SPECIES: A platform for the exploration of ecological data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847061,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"The modeling of ecological data that include both abiotic and biotic factors is fundamental to our understanding of ecosystems.

However, there is a lack of tools with which to efficiently extract such knowledge. In this paper, we present SPECIES, an open, web-based platform designed to extract implicit information contained in large scale sets of ecological data. SPECIES is based on a tested methodology, wherein the correlations of variables of arbitrary type and spatial resolution, both biotic and abiotic, discrete and continuous, may be explored from both niche and network perspectives. In distinction to other modeling systems, SPECIES is a full stack exploratory tool that integrates the three basic components: data (which is incrementally growing), a statistical modeling and analysis engine, and an interactive visualization front end. Combined, these components provide a powerful tool that may guide ecologists toward new insights. SPECIES is optimized to support fast hypothesis prototyping and testing, analyzing thousands of biotic and abiotic variables, and presenting descriptive results to the user at different levels of detail. SPECIES is an open-access platform available online (http://species.conabio.gob.mx), that is, powerful, flexible, and easy to use. It allows for the exploration and incorporation of ecological data and its subsequent integration into predictive models for both potential ecological niche and geographic distribution. It also provides an ecosystemic, network-based analysis that may guide the researcher in identifying relations between different biota, such as the relation between disease vectors and potential disease hosts.",Potential limitations of behavioral plasticity and the role of egg relocation in climate change mitigation for a thermally sensitive endangered species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847059,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Anthropogenic climate change is widely considered a major threat to global biodiversity, such that the ability of a species to adapt will determine its likelihood of survival. Egg-burying reptiles that exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, such as critically endangered hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), are particularly vulnerable to changes in thermal regimes because nest temperatures affect offspring sex, fitness, and survival. It is unclear whether hawksbills possess sufficient behavioral plasticity of nesting traits (i.e., redistribution of nesting range, shift in nesting phenology, changes in nest-site selection, and adjustment of nest depth) to persist within their climatic niche or whether accelerated changes in thermal conditions of nesting beaches will outpace phenotypic adaption and require human intervention. For these reasons, we estimated sex ratios and physical condition of hatchling hawksbills under natural and manipulated conditions and generated and analyzed thermal profiles of hawksbill nest environments within highly threatened mangrove ecosystems at Bahía de Jiquilisco, El Salvador, and Estero Padre Ramos, Nicaragua. Hawksbill clutches protected in situ at both sites incubated at higher temperatures, yielded lower hatching success, produced a higher percentage of female hatchlings, and produced less fit offspring than clutches relocated to hatcheries. We detected cooler sand temperatures in woody vegetation (i.e., coastal forest and small-scale plantations of fruit trees) and hatcheries than in other monitored nest environments, with higher temperatures at the deeper depth. Our findings indicate that mangrove ecosystems present a number of biophysical (e.g., insular nesting beaches and shallow water table) and human-induced (e.g., physical barriers and deforestation) constraints that, when coupled with the unique life history of hawksbills in this region, may limit behavioral compensatory responses by the species to projected temperature increases at nesting beaches. We contend that egg relocation can contribute significantly to recovery efforts in a changing climate under appropriate circumstances.",Phylogeography of lethal male fighting in a social spider mite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847058,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"When males fight for access to females, such conflict rarely escalates into lethal fight because the risks and costs involved, that is, severe injury or death, are too high. The social spider mite, Stigmaeopsis miscanthi, does exhibit lethal male fights, and this male-male aggressiveness varies among populations. To understand the evolution of lethal fighting, we investigated aggressiveness in 42 populations and phylogenetic relationships in 47 populations along the Japanese archipelago. By analysis of the male weapon morph, a proxy for aggressiveness, we confirmed the existence of a mildly aggressive (ML) form, besides the low aggression (LW) and high aggression (HG) forms reported earlier. To evaluate demographic history of these three forms, we employed the approximate Bayesian computation approach using mtCOI sequences and taking into consideration the postlast glacial expansion history of the host plant, Miscanthus sinensis. As results, hierarchical split models are more likely to explain the observed genetic pattern than admixture models, and the ML form in the subtropical region was considered the ancestral group. The inferred demographic history was consistent with the one reconstructed for the host plant in a previous study. The LW form was split from the ML form during the last glacial period (20,000-40,000 years BP), and subsequently, the HG form was split from the ML form at the end of or after the last glacial period (5,494-10,988 years BP). The results also suggest that the mite invaded Japan more than once, resulting in the present parapatric distribution of LW and HG forms in eastern Japan.","Animal Scanner: Software for classifying humans, animals, and empty frames in camera trap images.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847057,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Camera traps are a popular tool to sample animal populations because they are noninvasive, detect a variety of species, and can record many thousands of animal detections per deployment. Cameras are typically set to take bursts of multiple photographs for each detection and are deployed in arrays of dozens or hundreds of sites, often resulting in millions of photographs per study. The task of converting photographs to animal detection records from such large image collections is daunting, and made worse by situations that generate copious empty pictures from false triggers (e.g., camera malfunction or moving vegetation) or pictures of humans. We developed computer vision algorithms to detect and classify moving objects to aid the first step of camera trap image filtering-separating the animal detections from the empty frames and pictures of humans. Our new work couples foreground object segmentation through background subtraction with deep learning classification to provide a fast and accurate scheme for human-animal detection. We provide these programs as both Matlab GUI and command prompt developed with C++. The software reads folders of camera trap images and outputs images annotated with bounding boxes around moving objects and a text file summary of results. This software maintains high accuracy while reducing the execution time by 14 times. It takes about 6 seconds to process a sequence of ten frames (on a 2.6 GHZ CPU computer). For those cameras with excessive empty frames due to camera malfunction or blowing vegetation automatically removes 54% of the false-triggers sequences without influencing the human/animal sequences. We achieve 99.58% on image-level empty versus object classification of Serengeti dataset. We offer the first computer vision tool for processing camera trap images providing substantial time savings for processing large image datasets, thus improving our ability to monitor wildlife across large scales with camera traps.",Incomplete datasets obscure associations between traits affecting dispersal ability and geographic range size of reef fishes in the Tropical Eastern Pacific.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847056,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Dispersal is thought to be an important process determining range size, especially for species in highly spatially structured habitats, such as tropical reef fishes. Despite intensive research efforts, there is conflicting evidence about the role of dispersal in determining range size. We hypothesize that traits related to dispersal drive range sizes, but that complete and comprehensive datasets are essential for detecting relationships between species' dispersal ability and range size. We investigate the roles of six traits affecting several stages of dispersal (adult mobility, spawning mode, pelagic larval duration (PLD), body size, aggregation behavior, and circadian activity), in explaining range size variation of reef fishes in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP). All traits, except for PLD (148 species), had data for all 497 species in the region. Using a series of statistical models, we investigated which traits were associated with large range sizes, when analyzing all TEP species or only species with PLD data. Furthermore, using null models, we analyzed whether the PLD-subset is representative of the regional species pool. Several traits affecting dispersal ability were strongly associated with range size, although these relationships could not be detected when using the PLD-subset. Pelagic spawners (allowing for passive egg dispersal) had on average 56% larger range sizes than nonpelagic spawners. Species with medium or high adult mobility had on average a 25% or 33% larger range, respectively, than species with low mobility. Null models showed that the PLD-subset was nonrepresentative of the regional species pool, explaining why model outcomes using the PLD-subset differed from the ones based on the complete dataset. Our results show that in the TEP, traits affecting dispersal ability are important in explaining range size variation. Using a regionally complete dataset was crucial for detecting the theoretically expected, but so far empirically unresolved, relationship between dispersal and range size.","Using functional traits to predict species growth trajectories, and cross-validation to evaluate these models for ecological prediction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847055,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Modeling plant growth using functional traits is important for understanding the mechanisms that underpin growth and for predicting new situations. We use three data sets on plant height over time and two validation methods-in-sample model fit and leave-one-species-out cross-validation-to evaluate non-linear growth model predictive performance based on functional traits. In-sample measures of model fit differed substantially from out-of-sample model predictive performance; the best fitting models were rarely the best predictive models. Careful selection of predictor variables reduced the bias in parameter estimates, and there was no single best model across our three data sets. Testing and comparing multiple model forms is important. We developed an R package with a formula interface for straightforward fitting and validation of hierarchical, non-linear growth models. Our intent is to encourage thorough testing of multiple growth model forms and an increased emphasis on assessing model fit relative to a model's purpose.",Phenotypic plasticity of four Chenopodiaceae species with contrasting saline-sodic tolerance in response to increased salinity-sodicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847054,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"It is unknown whether phenotypic plasticity in fitness-related traits is associated with salinity-sodicity tolerance. This study compared growth and allocation phenotypic plasticity in two species with low salinity-sodicity tolerance (Chenopodium acuminatum and C. stenophyllum) and two species with high salinity-sodicity tolerance (Suaeda glauca and S. salsa) in a pot experiment in the Songnen grassland, China. While the species with low tolerance had higher growth and allocation plasticity than the highly tolerant species, the highly tolerant species only adjusted their growth traits and maintained higher fitness (e.g., plant height and total biomass) in response to increased soil salinity-sodicity, with low biomass allocation plasticity. Most plasticity is ""apparent"" plasticity (ontogenetic change), and only a few traits, for example, plant height:stem diameter ratio and root:shoot biomass ratio, represent ""real"" plasticity (real change in response to the environment). Our results show that phenotypic plasticity was negatively correlated with saline-sodic tolerance and could be used as an index of species sensitivity to soil salinity-sodicity.",Why can't we make research grant allocation systems more consistent? A personal opinion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847053,Ecology and evolution,2019 03 10,"Uncertainty is expected to enter into our grant allocation processes at many points, not limited to those directly involving assessment by peers. The selection of grants for funding is thus prodigiously low in statistical power and will remain so. The replacement of current systems with some form of lottery, as has been proposed, seriously risks weakening the quality of applications. Opportunities exist for agencies to encourage and reward greater clarity and innovation in research outcomes.",Multispectral analysis tools can increase utility of RGB color images in histology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847052,Journal of optics (2010),2019 04 01,"Multispectral imaging (MSI) is increasingly finding application in the study and characterization of biological specimens. However, the methods typically used come with challenges on both the acquisition and the analysis front. MSI can be slow and photon-inefficient, leading to long imaging times and possible phototoxicity and photobleaching. The resulting datasets can be large and complex, prompting the development of a number of mathematical approaches for segmentation and signal unmixing. We show that under certain circumstances, just three spectral channels provided by standard color cameras, coupled with multispectral analysis tools, including a more recent spectral phasor approach, can efficiently provide useful insights. These findings are supported with a mathematical model relating spectral bandwidth and spectral channel number to achievable spectral accuracy. The utility of 3-band RGB and MSI analysis tools are demonstrated on images acquired using brightfield and fluorescence techniques, as well as a novel microscopy approach employing UV-surface excitation. Supervised linear unmixing, automated non-negative matrix factorization and phasor analysis tools all provide useful results, with phasors generating particularly helpful spectral display plots for sample exploration."

""pCure"" is a toilet rim block containing API-degrading enzymes; the producing company claims positive in vitro results but no implementation studies have been performed. Materials and methods: In a university hospital setting, 16 weeks were randomized to installation or no installation of pCure in all 261 toilets connected to the same cesspit where sewage water was sampled daily. Ninety-six samples were analyzed for 102 APIs using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Results and Discussion: Fifty-one APIs were detected with a large variation in levels but no significant differences in the initial statistical analysis. More statistical testing of API level ratios (pCure installed/not installed) yielded some cases of significant decrease. Differences were small and not consistent when comparing means and medians. We cannot exclude a small pCure effect but clearly pCure has no effect of biological importance. Conclusion: pCure is not useful to reduce drug residue discharge in a hospital setting. In a bigger perspective, our study exemplifies that products claiming to reduce an environmental problem need to be tested in on-site implementation studies by independent researchers before reaching the market.","Checklist of Fishes at Pergau Lake, Jeli, Kelantan, Malaysia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847039,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"A survey was conducted to determine the diversity of fish in Pergau Lake, Jeli, Kelantan, Malaysia from 2 September to 18 October of 2016. Fish samples were collected at seven random sampling stations around the lake by using setting trap method.

Fourteen species, namely as Hemibagrus nemurus, Hampala macrolepidota, Clarias batrachus, Channa striata, Cyprinus carpio, Poropuntius smedleyi, Pangasius sp., Oreochromis niloticus, Oreochromis mossambicus, Leptobarbus hoevenii, Neolissochilus hexagonolepis, Tor tambroides, Osteochilus hasselti and Neolissochilus soroides, comprising of six families were collected during this study. From this study, family of Cyprinidae was the dominant species in Pergau Lake with exactly 50% of catch percentage, followed by family of Bagridae (29%), Cichlidae (10%), Clariidae (5%), Channidae (3%) and Pangasiidae (3%). This study shows that there is still a diversity of fish species in Pergau Lake, showing that the water and its environmental condition is very good.","Efficient and High-Quality RNA Isolation from Metabolite-Rich Tissues of Stevia rebaudiana, an Important Commercial Crop.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847038,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"Stevia rebaudiana, a perennial herb native to northeastern Paraguay, has gained immense attention globally over the recent decades due to the natural sweetness of its leaves. Like in most plants, this particular species contains high amount of secondary metabolites, thus rendering the isolation of high quality and quantity RNA extract for molecular applications rather challenging. An effective, high-yield and high-quality RNA isolation protocol for this economically important plant species was devised here based on the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) extraction method, with an additional genomic DNA (gDNA) removal step. DNA and other contaminants that may affect downstream applications were effectively removed. Our results exhibited that RNA samples isolated from the leaves and stems of Stevia rebaudiana using this improvised method are high in integrity and quality with RNA integrity number (RIN) of more than 8 and low in contaminants.",Isolation and Partial Characterisation of Thermophilic Cellulolytic Bacteria from North Malaysian Tropical Mangrove Soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847037,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"This study reports the biodiversity of thermophilic cellulolytic bacterial strains that present in the north Malaysian mangrove ecosystem. Soil samples were collected at the four most northern state of Malaysia (Perak, Pulau Pinang, Kedah and Perlis). The samples obtained were first enriched in nutrient broth at 45°C and 55°C prior culturing in the carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar medium. Repeated streaking was performed on the CMC agar to obtain a pure culture of each isolate prior subjecting it to hydrolysis capacity testing. The isolates that showing the cellulolytic zone (halozone) were sent for 16S rRNA sequencing. Total seven isolates (two from Perak, three from Kedah, another two were from Perlis and Penang each) showed halozone. The isolate (KFX-40) from Kedah exhibited highest halozone of 3.42 ± 0.58, meanwhile, the one obtained from Perak (AFZ-0) showed the lowest hydrolysis capacity (2.61 ± 0.10). Based on 16S rRNA sequencing results, 5 isolates (AFY-40, AFZ-0, KFX-40, RFY-20, and PFX-40) were determined to be Anoxybacillus sp. The other two isolates were identified as Bacillus subtilis (KFY-40) and Paenibacillus dendritiformis (KFX-0). Based on growth curve, doubling time of Anoxybacillus sp. UniMAP-KB06 was calculated to be 32.3 min. Optimal cellulose hydrolysis temperature and pH of this strain were determined to be 55°C and 6.0 respectively. Addition of Mg2+ and Ca2+ were found to enhance the cellulase activity while Fe3+ acted as an enzyme inhibitor.",Induction of Systemic Resistance in Cucumber by Hypovirulent Binucleate Rhizoctonia against Anthracnose Caused by Colletotrichum orbiculare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847036,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"Treatment with hypovirulent binucleate Rhizoctonia (HBNR) isolates induced systemic resistance against anthracnose infected by Colletotrichum orbiculare in cucumber, as there were no direct interaction between HBNR and C. orbiculare. This is because of the different distances between HBNR and C. orbiculare, where the root was treated with HBNR isolate and C. orbiculare was challenged and inoculated in leaves or first true leaves were treated with HBNR isolate and C. orbiculare was challenged and inoculated in second true leaves. The use of barley grain inocula and culture filtrates of HBNR significantly reduced the lesion diameter compared to the control (p = 0.05). The total lesion diameter reduction by applying barley grain inoculum of HBNR L2, W1, W7, and Rhv7 was 28%, 44%, 39%, and 40%, respectively. Similar results was also observed in treatment using culture filtrate, and the reduction of total lesion diameter by culture filtrate of HBNR L2, W1, W7, and Rhv7 was 45%, 46%, 42%, and 48%, respectively. When cucumber root was treated with culture filtrates of HBNR, the lignin was enhanced at the pathogen penetration, which is spread along the epidermis tissue of cucumber hypocotyls. Peroxidase activity in hypocotyls in the treated cucumber plant with culture filtrates of HBNR significantly increased before and after inoculation of pathogens as compared to the control. Significant enhancement was also observed in the fast-moving anodic peroxidase isozymes in the treated plants with culture filtrates of HBNR. The results showed the elicitor(s) contained in culture filtrates in HBNR. The lignin deposition as well as the peroxidase activity is an important step to prevent systemically immunised plants from pathogen infection.",The Phosphofructokinase and Pyruvate Kinase Genes in Apis andreniformis and Apis cerana indica: Exon Intron Organisation and Evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847035,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"Genes related to carbohydrate metabolism have evolved rapidly in eusocial bees, including honey bees. However, the characterisation of carbohydrate metabolism genes has not been reported in Apis andreniformis or Apis cerana indica. This study aimed to characterise phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) genes in these honey bee species and to analyse the evolution of the genus Apis using these genes. This study found the first data regarding A. andreniformis PFK and PK-like nucleotide sequences. A BLAST-n algorithm-based search showed that A. andreniformis and A. c. indica PFK and PK genes were homologous with those of Apis florea and Apis cerana cerana from Korea, respectively. Multiple alignments of PFKs from five Apis species showed many exon gains and losses, but only one among the PKs. Thus, the exon-intron organisation of the PK genes may be more conserved compare with that of the PFKs. Another evolutionary pattern indicated that more nucleotide substitutions occurred in Apis' PK than PFK genes. Deduced PFK amino acid sequences revealed a PFK consensus pattern of 19 amino acids, while the deduced PK amino acid sequences were predicted to have barrel and alpha/beta domains. Based on these two metabolism-related genes, The Neighbour-joining and Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees are congruent and revealed that the A. andreniformis and A. florea group were in the basal position. Apis mellifera, A. cerana, and Apis dorsata formed a monophyletic clade, although the positions of A. mellifera and A. dorsata were different in the nucleotide- and amino acid-based phylogenetic trees.",Endophytic Bacteria Isolated from Citrus Plants for Biological Control of Citrus Canker in Lime Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847034,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"Citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri is a disease affecting the yield and fruit quality of lime (Citrus aurantiifolia). This research investigated endophytic bacteria obtained from six healthy Citrus spp. to inhibit the pathogen and to control citrus canker on lime plants. Numbers of the endophytic bacteria isolated from C. aurantifolia, C. hystrix, C. maxima, C. nobilis, C. reticulata and C. sinensis were 28, 25, 29, 42, 12 and 34 isolates, respectively. The selected endophytic bacteria that were effective against X. citri subsp. citri were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LE109, B. subtilis LE24 and B. tequilensis PO80. The optimum culture medium for an antagonistic effect on the pathogen in B. amyloliquefaciens LE109 and B. tequilensis PO80 was yeast extract peptone dextrose broth, and in B. subtilis LE24 was modified soluble starch broth. To control citrus canker in lime, young expanded leaves of lime plants were aseptically punctured and inoculated with 30 μl of bacterial suspension of the pathogen (108 CFU/ml in 0.85% NaCl) per punctured location. After the pathogenic inoculation for 24 h, the leaves were then inoculated with 30 μl of the selected endophytic bacteria (108 CFU/ml in 0.85% NaCl), and treated with 30 μl of the culture media containing bioactive compounds produced by the selected endophytic bacteria. The leaves inoculated with cell suspensions of B. amyloliquefaciens LE109 or B. subtilis LE24 could completely control citrus canker. However, the leaves inoculated with B. tequilensis PO80 displayed 10% disease incidence. Additionally, the leaves treated with the crude bioactive compounds of B. amyloliquefaciens LE109 or B. subtilis LE24 could completely control citrus canker. Notably, the leaves treated with the crude bioactive compounds of B. tequilensis PO80 displayed 5% disease incidence. The results of this study showed that the Bacillus strains play important roles in the biocontrol of citrus canker in lime.","Analysis of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhi by Outer Membrane Protein (OMP) Profiling, Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847033,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"A number of countries, including developed countries, still have typhoid fever as a major problem resulting in frequent outbreaks. The importance of controlling spread of typhoid fever is well known and necessitates periodic studies to delineate epidemiological relationships. Although phage typing remains to be the preferred conventional method for characterisation of typhoid bacilli, it is of limited use due to prevalence of few predominant phage types in the country like India. Therefore, an effort has been made to assess three molecular methods [Outer Membrane Protein (OMP) Profiling, Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE)] for typing of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. 128 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi isolates were identified using biotyping and serotyping followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. These isolates were further subjected to OMP analysis, RAPD and PFGE. PFGE (114 unique clusters) was found to be the most discriminatory method followed by RAPD (94 unique clusters) and OMP profiling (50 unique clusters). Multidrug resistant strains were well discriminated by all three methods used in the study. PFGE still remains the most preferred method for detailed epidemiological investigations. However, random amplification of polymorphic DNA and outer membrane protein profiling can also be considered for molecular discrimination of the isolates in the laboratories lacking high-end facilities.",Efficacy of Several Plants Extracts on the Tunneling Activity and Survival of Subterranean Termites (Coptotermes gestroi and Globitermes sulphureus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847032,Tropical life sciences research,2019 03 10,"This study examined the tunneling activity and the behaviour of two subterranean termites, Globitermes sulphurues and Coptotermes gestroi treated with four plant extracts, namely Pyllanthus niruri, Azadirachta indica, Leucaena leucocephala and Andrographis paniculata. All plants were extracted with three different solvents (methanol, hexane and water) and were diluted into three concentrations (500, 5,000 and 10,000 ppm). A group of 50 workers and 2 soldiers were tested and observed daily during the exposure in order to determine their survivorship and behaviour. Both sections were scored to determine their tunneling activities after seven days. There was a significant difference of tunneling activities of C. gestroi on sand treated with plant extracts (X2(2) = 31.790, p < 0.0001) with a mean rank of 8.50 for methanolic extracts and 32.50 for both hexane and water extracts. Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed on tunneling activity of G. sulphureus on treated sand (X2(2) = 2.200, p = 0.333) with a mean rank of 20.72 for methanolic extracts, 26.31 for water extracts and 26.47 for hexane extracts. Results showed that plants extracted with methanol demonstrated strong repellent properties with 0 tunneling activity on the treated sand and low survivorship of both termites. Moreover, both termites did not survive (0%) when they were treated with methanolic extracts at 10,000 ppm. They also displayed a different behaviour post-exposure such as avoidance, gradually losing the ability to walk and low feeding consumption. These results indicate that there is a strong termiticidal activity of plants extracted with methanol against C. gestroi and G. sulphureus."

The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is the world's most heavily cultivated shellfish species and has been introduced to all continents except Antarctica for aquaculture. We therefore used a medium-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to investigate the genetic structure of this species in Europe, where it was introduced during the 1960s and has since become a prolific invader of coastal ecosystems across the continent. We analyzed 21,499 polymorphic SNPs in 232 individuals from 23 localities spanning a latitudinal cline from Portugal to Norway and including the source populations of Japan and Canada. We confirmed the results of previous studies by finding clear support for a southern and a northern group, with the former being indistinguishable from the source populations indicating the absence of a pronounced founder effect. We furthermore conducted a large-scale comparison of oysters sampled from the wild and from hatcheries to reveal substantial genetic differences including significantly higher levels of inbreeding in some but not all of the sampled hatchery cohorts. These findings were confirmed by a smaller but representative SNP dataset generated using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing. We therefore conclude that genomic approaches can generate increasingly detailed insights into the genetics of wild and hatchery produced Pacific oysters.",Fully oxygenated water columns over continental shelves before the Great Oxidation Event.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847006,Nature geoscience,2019 03 11,"Late Archaean sedimentary rocks contain compelling geochemical evidence for episodic accumulation of dissolved oxygen in the oceans along continental margins before the Great Oxidation Event. However, the extent of this oxygenation remains poorly constrained. Here we present thallium and molybdenum isotope compositions for anoxic organic-rich shales of the 2.5 billion-year-old Mount McRae Shale from Western Australia, which previously yielded geochemical evidence of a transient oxygenation event. During this event, we observe an anti-correlation between thalium and molybdenum isotope data, including two shifts to higher molybdenum and lower thalium isotope compositions. Our data indicate pronounced burial of manganese oxides in sediments elsewhere in the ocean at these times, which requires that water columns above portions of the ocean floor were fully oxygenated: all the way from the air-sea interface to well below the sediment-water interface. Well-oxygenated continental shelves were likely the most important sites of manganese oxide burial and mass-balance modeling results suggest that fully oxygenated water columns were at least a regional-scale feature of early-Earth's oceans 2.5 billion years ago.",Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging Texture Analysis Predicts Early Progression in Rectal Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847005,Gastroenterology research and practice,2019 03 10,"We hypothesized that texture analysis (TA) from the preoperative MRI can predict early disease progression (ePD), defined as the percentage of patients who relapsed or showed distant metastasis within three months from the radical surgery, in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC, stage II and III, AJCC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (C-RT).",Identifying Multi-Omics Causers and Causal Pathways for Complex Traits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847004,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 10,"The central dogma of molecular biology delineates a unidirectional causal flow, i.e., DNA → RNA → protein → trait. Genome-wide association studies, next-generation sequencing association studies, and their meta-analyses have successfully identified ~12,000 susceptibility genetic variants that are associated with a broad array of human physiological traits. However, such conventional association studies ignore the mediate causers (i.e., RNA, protein) and the unidirectional causal pathway. Such studies may not be ideally powerful; and the genetic variants identified may not necessarily be genuine causal variants. In this article, we model the central dogma by a mediate causal model and analytically prove that the more remote an omics level is from a physiological trait, the smaller the magnitude of their correlation is. Under both random and extreme sampling schemes, we numerically demonstrate that the proteome-trait correlation test is more powerful than the transcriptome-trait correlation test, which in turn is more powerful than the genotype-trait association test. In conclusion, integrating RNA and protein expressions with DNA data and causal inference are necessary to gain a full understanding of how genetic causal variants contribute to phenotype variations.","Phytochemicals Rosmarinic Acid, Ampelopsin, and Amorfrutin-A Can Modulate Age-Related Phenotype of Serially Passaged Human Skin Fibroblasts in vitro.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847003,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 10,"One of the aims of the EU-funded Research and Innovation Action (RIA), titled ""Ageing with Elegans"" (AwE) is to enhance better understanding of the factors causing health and disease in aging and develop evidence-based preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and other strategies. The work package-5 of this project is focused on testing the effects of phytochemicals of natural and synthetic origin on aging, longevity, and health of human cells in vitro, after the initial screening using the animal model systems of nematodes and rats and mice. Accordingly, the first series of three compounds, rosmarinic acid (ROSM), ampelopsin (AMPEL), and amorfrutin-A (AMOR), were selected to test for their short-term and long-term effects on human skin fibroblasts undergoing aging and senescence in vitro. The lifelong modulatory effects of these compounds were tested individually at two doses (0.5 and 1.0 μM), selected after a short-term dose response check of a 20,000-fold range (0.01-200 μM). The results show that these compounds do have some beneficial effects in terms of supporting the long-term lifelong growth and enhanced stress tolerance of serially passaged cells. These effects seem to be achieved by reducing the extent of loss of telomeres, of 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) and of 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-hmC), by reducing the accumulation of oxidative DNA damage product 8-OHdG. There is also some indication that these compounds induce at least one of the stress responses in terms of the increased synthesis of heat shock protein Hsp70. Thus, these phytochemicals may be potential hormetins, which bring about their health beneficial effects by the phenomenon of mild stress-induced hormesis.",Beyond Pathway Analysis: Identification of Active Subnetworks in Rett Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847002,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 10,"Pathway and network approaches are valuable tools in analysis and interpretation of large complex omics data. Even in the field of rare diseases, like Rett syndrome, omics data are available, and the maximum use of such data requires sophisticated tools for comprehensive analysis and visualization of the results. Pathway analysis with differential gene expression data has proven to be extremely successful in identifying affected processes in disease conditions. In this type of analysis, pathways from different databases like WikiPathways and Reactome are used as separate, independent entities. Here, we show for the first time how these pathway models can be used and integrated into one large network using the WikiPathways RDF containing all human WikiPathways and Reactome pathways, to perform network analysis on transcriptomics data. This network was imported into the network analysis tool Cytoscape to perform active submodule analysis. Using a publicly available Rett syndrome gene expression dataset from frontal and temporal cortex, classical enrichment analysis, including pathway and Gene Ontology analysis, revealed mainly immune response, neuron specific and extracellular matrix processes. Our active module analysis provided a valuable extension of the analysis prominently showing the regulatory mechanism of MECP2, especially on DNA maintenance, cell cycle, transcription, and translation. In conclusion, using pathway models for classical enrichment and more advanced network analysis enables a more comprehensive analysis of gene expression data and provides novel results.",What Do Nectarivorous Bats Like? Nectar Composition in Bromeliaceae With Special Emphasis on Bat-Pollinated Species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847001,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 10,"Floral nectar is the most important reward for pollinators and an integral component of the pollination syndrome. Nectar research has mainly focused on sugars or amino acids, whereas more comprehensive studies on the nectar composition of closely related plant species with different pollination types are rather limited. Nectar composition as well as concentrations of sugars, amino acids, inorganic ions, and organic acids were analyzed for 147 species of Bromeliaceae. This plant family shows a high diversity in terms of floral morphology, flowering time, and predominant pollination types (trochilophilous, trochilophilous/entomophilous, psychophilous, sphingophilous, chiropterophilous). Based on the analyses, we examined the relationship between nectar traits and pollination type in this family. Nectar of all analyzed species contained high amounts of sugars with different proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose. The total concentrations of amino acids, inorganic cations, and anions, or organic acids were much lower. The analyses revealed that the sugar composition, the concentrations of inorganic cations and anions as well as the concentration of malate in nectar of bat-pollinated species differed significantly from nectar of species with other pollination types. Flowers of bat-pollinated species contained a higher volume of nectar, which results in a total of about 25-fold higher amounts of sugar in bat-pollinated species than in insect-pollinated species. This difference was even higher for amino acids, inorganic anions and cations, and organic acids (between 50 and 100-fold). In general, bat-pollinated plant species invest large amounts of organic and inorganic compounds for their pollinators. Furthermore, statistical analyses reveal that the characteristics of nectar in Bromeliaceae are more strongly determined by the pollinator type rather than by taxonomic groups or phylogenetic relations. However, a considerable part of the variance cannot be explained by either of the variables, which means that additional factors must be responsible for the differences in the nectar composition.","Overexpression of LcSABP, an Orthologous Gene for Salicylic Acid Binding Protein 2, Enhances Drought Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Tobacco.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30847000,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 10,"Salicylic acid (SA) plays an essential role in the growth and development of plants, and in their response to abiotic stress. Previous studies have mostly focused on the effects of exogenously applied SA on the physiological response of plants to abiotic stresses; however, the underlying genetic mechanisms for the regulatory functions of endogenous SA in the defense response of plants remain unclear. In plants, SA binding protein 2 (SABP2), possessing methyl salicylate (MeSA) esterase activity, catalyzes the conversion of MeSA to SA. Herein, a SABP2-like gene, LcSABP, was cloned from Lycium chinense, which contained a complete open reading frame of 795 bp and encoded a protein of 264 amino acids that shared high sequence similarities with SABP2 orthologs from other plants. Overexpression of LcSABP enhanced the drought tolerance of transgenic tobacco plants. The results indicated that increased levels of LcSABP transcripts and endogenous SA content were involved in the enhanced drought tolerance. Physiological and biochemical studies further demonstrated that higher chlorophyll content, increased photosynthetic capacity, lower malondialdehyde content, and higher activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase enhanced the drought tolerance of transgenic plants. Moreover, overexpression of LcSABP also increased the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)- and stress-responsive genes under drought stress. Overall, our results demonstrate that LcSABP plays a positive regulatory role in drought stress response by enhancing the endogenous SA content, promoting the scavenging of ROS, and regulating of the expression of stress-related transcription factor genes. Our findings indicate that LcSABP functions as a major regulator of the plant's response to drought stress through a SA-dependent defense pathway.",Lipids or Proteins: Who Is Leading the Dance at Membrane Contact Sites?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846999,Frontiers in plant science,2019 03 10,"Understanding the mode of action of membrane contact sites (MCSs) across eukaryotic organisms at the near-atomic level to infer function at the cellular and tissue levels is a challenge scientists are currently facing. These peculiar systems dedicated to inter-organellar communication are perfect examples of cellular processes where the interplay between lipids and proteins is critical. In this mini review, we underline the link between membrane lipid environment, the recruitment of proteins at specialized membrane domains and the function of MCSs. More precisely, we want to give insights on the crucial role of lipids in defining the specificity of plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) MCSs and we further propose approaches to study them at multiple scales. Our goal is not so much to go into detailed description of MCSs, as there are numerous focused reviews on the subject, but rather try to pinpoint the critical elements defining those structures and give an original point of view by considering the subject from a near-atomic angle with a focus on lipids. We review current knowledge as to how lipids can define MCS territories, play a role in the recruitment and function of the MCS-associated proteins and in turn, how the lipid environment can be modified by proteins."

Excessive activation potential of signaling pathways may play a role in this profile, but the intracellular signaling profile of the disease is not well characterized. To gain insights into potentially dysfunctional intracellular signaling profiles of pSS patients we conducted an exploratory analysis of MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling networks in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 25 female pSS patients and 25 female age-matched healthy donors using phospho-specific flow cytometry. We analyzed unstimulated samples, as well as samples during a 4 h time period following activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 9. Expression levels of MxA, IFI44, OAS1, GBP1, and GBP2 in PBMC were analyzed by real-time PCR. Cytokine levels in plasma were determined using a 25-plex Luminex-assay. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that basal phosphorylation profiles could be used to differentiate pSS patients from healthy donor samples by stronger intracellular signaling pathway activation in NK and T cells relative to B cells. Stimulation of PBMC with TLR7 and -9 ligands showed significant differences in the phosphorylation profiles between samples from pSS patients and healthy donors. Including clinical parameters such as extraglandular manifestations (EGM), we observed stronger responses of NF-κB and STAT3 S727 in B cells from EGM-negative patients compared to EGM-positive patients and healthy controls. Plasma cytokine levels were correlated to the basal phosphorylation levels in these patients. In addition, 70% of the patients had a positive IFN score. These patients differed from the IFN score negative patients regarding their phosphorylation profiles and their plasma cytokine levels. In conclusion, we here report increased signaling potentials in peripheral B cells of pSS patients in response to TLR7 and -9 stimulation through STAT3 S727 and NF-κB that correlate with a type I IFN signature. Induction of these pathways could contribute to the generation of a type I IFN signature in pSS. Patients displaying elevated potentiation of STAT3 S727 and NF-κB signaling could therefore benefit from therapies targeting these pathways.",Effect of in vivo Hydroxychloroquine and ex vivo Anti-BDCA2 mAb Treatment on pDC IFNα Production From Patients Affected With Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846987,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 10,"Objective: Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a major source of Type-I Interferon (IFN-I), a key driver in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). Currently evaluated in Phase II clinical trial, 24F4A (BIIB059) is an antibody targeting BDCA2, an inhibitory receptor expressed on pDCs. Given that Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a widely-used CLE therapy, and 24F4A are both able to inhibit pDC-derived IFN-I production; this study aimed to determine whether 24F4A would show an additional inhibitory effect on pDC response after ex vivo or in vivo treatment with HCQ. Methods: The effect of 24F4A on pDC-derived IFNα was measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) either from healthy donors in presence or absence of HCQ or from CLE patients clinically exposed to various levels of HCQ. TLR7, TLR7/8, and TLR9 agonists (ssRNA, R848, and CpG-A) were used for pDC stimulation. Results: PDCs were the only producers of IFNα in response to CpG-A, R848, and ssRNA stimulation in PBMC cultures. CLE patients with higher levels of blood HCQ showed lower ex vivo pDC responses to CpG-A, but not R848 or ssRNA. In contrast, 24F4A reduced the amount of IFNα produced by pDCs from CLE patients in response to all TLR agonists, irrespective of the blood HCQ level. Conclusion: Our findings reveal that clinically-relevant HCQ concentrations partially inhibit the pDC response to TLR9 and weakly affect the response to TLR7/8 stimulation. 24F4A robustly inhibits pDC responses even in the presence of HCQ, highlighting its unique potential to disrupt pDC disease relevant biology, which could provide additional therapeutic benefit for CLE patients.",Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Induces Macrophages to Produce IL-1β During Mycobacterium bovis Infection via a Positive Feedback Loop Between Mitochondrial Damage and Inflammasome Activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846986,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 10,"Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle and humans, infects host macrophages and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), mitochondrial damage, and interleukin (IL)-1β production. The relationship between these phenotypes is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of ERS in mitochondrial damage and IL-1β production in macrophages during infection with a virulent M. bovis strain. We found that ERS activates the inflammasome via NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-caspase-8 and that IFN-inducible protein absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) triggered mitochondrial damage. ERS increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), which promoted translocation of the inflammasome to the mitochondria. NLRP3, but not AIM2, was involved in the ERS-induced cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid, leading to mitochondrial damage, which was required for the production of mature IL-1β. Our data suggest that ERS induces macrophages to produce mature IL-1β during infection with virulent M. bovis through a positive feedback loop between mitochondrial damage and inflammasome activation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the involvement of ERS and mitochondrial damage in inflammasome activation during M. bovis infection.",Infection-Induced Resistance to Experimental Cerebral Malaria Is Dependent Upon Secreted Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Pathogenic CD8+ T Cell Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846985,Frontiers in immunology,2019 06 12,"Cerebral malaria (CM) is one of the most severe complications of Plasmodium falciparum infection. There is evidence that repeated parasite exposure promotes resistance against CM. However, the immunological basis of this infection-induced resistance remains poorly understood. Here, utilizing the Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), we show that three rounds of infection and drug-cure protects against the development of ECM during a subsequent fourth (4X) infection. Exposure-induced resistance was associated with specific suppression of CD8+ T cell activation and CTL-related pathways, which corresponded with the development of heterogeneous atypical B cell populations as well as the gradual infection-induced generation and maintenance of high levels of anti-parasite IgG. Mechanistically, transfer of high-titer anti-parasite IgG did not protect 1X infected mice against ECM and depletion of atypical and regulatory B cells during 4X infection failed to abrogate infection-induced resistance to ECM. However, IgMi mice that were unable to produce secreted antibody, or undergo class switching, during the repeated rounds of infection failed to develop resistance against ECM. The failure of infection-induced protection in IgMi mice was associated with impaired development of atypical B cell populations and the inability to suppress pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses. Our results, therefore, suggest the importance of anti-parasite antibody responses, gradually acquired, and maintained through repeated Plasmodium infections, for modulating the B cell compartment and eventually suppressing memory CD8+ T cell reactivation to establish infection-induced resistance to ECM.",Crucial Role of Nucleic Acid Sensing via Endosomal Toll-Like Receptors for the Defense of Streptococcus pyogenes in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846984,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 10,"Streptococcus pyogenes is a major human pathogen causing a variety of diseases ranging from common pharyngitis to life-threatening soft tissue infections and sepsis. Microbial nucleic acids, especially bacterial RNA, have recently been recognized as a major group of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) involved in the detection of Streptococcus pyogenes via endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in vitro. However, the individual contribution and cooperation between TLRs as well as cell-type and strain specific differences in dependency on nucleic acid detection during S. pyogenes infection in vitro have not been clarified in detail. Moreover, the role of particularly bacterial RNA for the defense of S. pyogenes infection in vivo remains poorly defined. In this study, we report that in all investigated innate immune cells involved in the resolution of bacterial infections, including murine macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils, recognition of S. pyogenes strain ATCC12344 is almost completely dependent on nucleic acid sensing via endosomal TLRs at lower MOIs, whereas at higher MOIs, detection via TLR2 plays an additional, yet redundant role. We further demonstrate that different S. pyogenes strains display a considerable inter-strain variability with respect to their nucleic acid dependent recognition. Moreover, TLR13-dependent recognition of S. pyogenes RNA is largely non-redundant in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), but less relevant in neutrophils and bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic cells (BMDCs) for the induction of an innate immune response in vitro. In vivo, we show that a loss of nucleic acid sensing blunts early recognition of S. pyogenes, leading to a reduced local containment of the bacterial infection with subsequent pronounced systemic inflammation at later time points. Thus, our results argue for a crucial role of nucleic acid sensing via endosomal TLRs in defense of S. pyogenes infection both in vitro and in vivo.",Recombinant Expression of Serratia marcescens Outer Membrane Phospholipase A (A1) in Pichia pastoris and Immobilization With Graphene Oxide-Based Fe3O4 Nanoparticles for Rapeseed Oil Degumming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846983,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 10,"Enzymatic degumming is an effective approach to produce nutritional, safe, and healthy refined oil. However, the high cost and low efficiency of phospholipase limit the application of enzymatic degumming. In this study, an 879 bp outer membrane phospholipase A (A1) (OM-PLA1) gene encoding 292 amino acid residues was isolated from the genome of Serratia marcescens. The recombinant OM-PLA1 profile of appropriately 33 KDa was expressed by the engineered Pichia pastoris GS115. The OM-PLA1 activity was 21.2 U/mL with the induction of 1 mM methanol for 72 h. The expression efficiencies of OM-PLA1 were 0.29 U/mL/h and 1.06 U/mL/OD600. A complex of magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) and OM-PLA1 (MGO-OM-PLA1) was prepared by immobilizing OM-PLA1 with graphene oxide-based Fe3O4 nanoparticles by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The content of phosphorus decreased to 5.1 mg/kg rapeseed oil from 55.6 mg/kg rapeseed oil with 0.02% MGO-OM-PLA1 (w/w) at 50°C for 4 h. MGO-OM-PLA1 retained 51.7% of the initial activity after 13 times of continuous recycling for the enzymatic degumming of rapeseed oil. This study provided an effective approach for the enzymatic degumming of crude vegetable oil by developing a novel phospholipase and improving the degumming technology.",Lactobacillus casei Strain Shirota Alleviates Constipation in Adults by Increasing the Pipecolinic Acid Level in the Gut.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846982,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 10,"The benefits of probiotics for constipation are widely accepted, but the mechanisms involving gut metabolites are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) on constipated patients and revealed that a metabolite mediator is involved in the LcS-induced constipation alleviation. Sixteen constipated patients and 22 non-constipated participants were recruited. The subjects consumed 100 mL of an LcS beverage (108 CFU/mL) per day for 28 days. The fecal non-volatile metabolites were determined by GC/MS, and the targeted metabolites were further verified in a constipated mouse model. In constipated patients, LcS intervention significantly improved defecation frequency (from 4.81 to 7.81 times per week, p < 0.05), stool consistency (from 2.52 to 3.68, p < 0.05) and constipation-related symptoms. A total of 14 non-volatile fecal metabolites were obtained as potential constipation-related metabolites that were regulated by LcS. Among these metabolites, pipecolinic acid (PIPA) had a significant positive correlation with defecation frequency in constipated patients. PIPA significantly promoted the small intestinal propulsive rate (from 25.45 to 39.68%) and increased the number of fecal pellets (from 30.38 to 57.38 pellets) in constipated mice (p < 0.05). The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and acetylcholine (ACh) in colonic tissue may be partly involved in PIPA-mediated constipation alleviation. In conclusion, PIPA was a metabolic mediator in the gut that participated in LcS-induced constipation alleviation.",Nutritional Interventions Improved Rumen Functions and Promoted Compensatory Growth of Growth-Retarded Yaks as Revealed by Integrated Transcripts and Microbiome Analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846981,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 10,"Growth retardation reduces the incomes of livestock farming. However, effective nutritional interventions to promote compensatory growth and the mechanisms involving digestive tract microbiomes and transcripts have yet to be elucidated. In this study, Qinghai plateau yaks, which frequently suffer from growth retardation due to malnutrition, were used as an experimental model. Young growth-retarded yaks were pastured (GRP), fed basal ration (GRB), fed basal ration addition cysteamine hydrochloride (CSH; GRBC) or active dry yeast (ADY; GRBY). Another group of growth normal yak was pastured as a positive control (GNP). After 60-day nutritional interventions, the results showed that the average daily gain (ADG) of GRB was similar to the level of GNP, and the growth rates of GRBC and GRBY were significantly higher than the level of GNP (P < 0.05). Basal rations addition of CSH or ADY either improved the serum biochemical indexes, decreased serum LPS concentration, facilitated ruminal epithelium development and volatile fatty acids (VFA) fermentation of growth-retarded yaks. Comparative transcriptome in rumen epithelium between growth-retarded and normal yaks identified the differentially expressed genes mainly enriched in immune system, digestive system, extracellular matrix and cell adhesion pathways. CSH addition and ADY addition in basal rations upregulated ruminal VFA absorption (SLC26A3, PAT1, MCT1) and cell junction (CLDN1, CDH1, OCLN) gene expression, and downregulated complement system (C2, C7) gene expression in the growth-retarded yaks. 16S rDNA results showed that CSH addition and ADY addition in basal rations increased the rumen beneficial bacterial populations (Prevotella_1, Butyrivibrio_2, Fibrobacter) of growth-retarded yaks. The correlation analysis identified that ruminal VFAs and beneficial bacteria abundance were significantly positively correlated with cell junction and VFA absorption gene expressions and negatively correlated with complement system gene expressions on the ruminal epithelium. Therefore, CSH addition and ADY addition in basal rations promoted rumen health and body growth of growth-retarded yaks, of which basal ration addition of ADY had the optimal growth-promoting effects. These results suggested that improving nutrition and probiotics addition is a more effective method to improve growth retardation caused by gastrointestinal function deficiencies.",Lentinula edodes Mycelium as Effective Agent for Piroxicam Mycoremediation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846979,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 10,"Pollution of the environment with inorganic and organic substances is one of the main problems in the world. For this reason, it is necessary to conduct researches for effective methods of biodegradation of xenobiotics, including drugs whose unmetabolized forms are introduced into the environment, especially into water. One possible solution to this problem may be the use of white rot fungi, such as Lentinula edodes. This is an edible species used in medicine because of its beneficial anti-cancer, hypocholesterolemic, hypotensive, hypoglycemic and antioxidant effects. Due to the fact that the mycelium of L. edodes produces enzymes with oxidizing properties that can degrade xenobiotics. The aim of the work was verification if in vitro cultures of L. edodes can be used for bioremediation of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug: piroxicam. For this purpose, the in vitro culture of L. edodes was derived and the mycelial cultures of this species enriched with piroxicam were analyzed. The biodegradation pathway of piroxicam by L. edodes mycelium was carried out by the UPLC/MS/MS method. The degradation process of piroxicam was found to affect primarily the linker between the thiazine and the piperidine ring, leading to its oxidation and cleavage. Additionally, oxidation of the benzothiazine moiety was observed, leading to hydroxylation and oxidation of the phenyl ring as well as oxidation of the thiazine ring leading to partial or complete removal of the sulfonamide moiety. It seems that the degradation process led finally to 2-hydroxybenozquinone, which may be further oxidized to inorganic compounds. What's more, concentration of piroxicam in in vitro cultures of L. edodes was not correlated with effectiveness of biodegradation of this compound - on each experimental series, the level of degradation was the same. The results confirm the possibility of using the investigated L. edodes mycelium for remediation of piroxicam.",Optimization and Characterization of a Galleria mellonella Larval Infection Model for Virulence Studies and the Evaluation of Therapeutics Against Streptococcus pneumoniae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846978,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 10,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia. Infection is linked to high morbidity and mortality rates and antibiotic resistance within this pathogen is on the rise. Therefore, there is a need for novel antimicrobial therapies. To lower the time and costs of the drug discovery process, alternative in vivo models should be considered. As such, Galleria mellonella larvae can be of great value. The larval immunity consisting of several types of haemocytes is remarkably similar to the human innate immune system. Furthermore, these larvae don't require specific housing, are cheap and are easy to handle. In this study, the use of a G. mellonella infection model to study early pneumococcal infections and treatment is proposed. Firstly, the fitness of this model to study pneumococcal virulence factors is confirmed using streptococcal strains TIGR4, ATCC®49619, D39 and its capsule-deficient counterpart R6 at different inoculum sizes. The streptococcal polysaccharide capsule is considered the most important virulence factor without which streptococci are unable to sustain an in vivo infection. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed indeed a higher larval survival after infection with streptococcal strain R6 compared to strain D39. Then, the infection was characterized by determining the number of haemocytes, production of oxygen free radicals and bacterial burden at several time points during the course of infection. Lastly, treatment of infected larvae with the standard antibiotics amoxicillin and moxifloxacin was evaluated. Treatment has proven to have a positive outcome on the course of infection, depending on the administered dosage. These data imply that G. mellonella larvae can be used to evaluate antimicrobial therapies against S. pneumoniae, apart from using the larval model to study streptococcal properties. The in-depth knowledge acquired regarding this model, makes it more suitable for use in future research."

While guidelines exist for BP thresholds during and after thrombolytic therapy, there is substantially less data to guide management during mechanical thrombectomy. Ideal blood pressure targets after attempted recanalization depend both on the degree of reperfusion achieved as well as the extent of infarction present. Following complete reperfusion, lower blood pressure targets may be warranted to prevent reperfusion injury and promote penumbra recovery however prospective clinical trials addressing this issue are warranted.",A Detailed Overview of Long-Term Outcomes in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Eight Years Post-injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846966,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 10,"Background and aims: Severe traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of acquired persistent disabilities, and represents an important health and economic burden. However, the determinants of long-term outcome have rarely been systematically studied in a prospective longitudinal study of a homogeneous group of patients suffering exclusively from severe TBI Methods: Prospective observational study of an inception cohort of adult patients with severe traumatic brain injury in the Parisian area (PariS-TBI). Outcome was assessed with face-to-face interview 8 years after Traumatic Brain Injury, focusing on impairments, activity limitations, and participation restriction. Results: Five hundred and four patients were included between 2005 and 2007. At 8-year follow-up, 261 patients were deceased, 128 were lost to follow-up, 22 refused to participate, and 86 were finally evaluated. Age, gender, initial injury severity did not significantly differ between evaluated patients and lost to follow-up, but the latter were more frequently students or unemployed. Mean age was 41.9 (SD 13.6), 79% were male, median initial Glasgow Coma Scale Score was 6. The most frequent somatic complaints concerned balance (47.5%), motricity (31%), and headaches (36%), but these were less frequent than cognitive complaints (Memory 71%, Slowness 68%, Concentration 67%). According to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 25 % had a score >8 for anxiety and 23.7% for depression. According to the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, 19.8% remained severely disabled, 46.5% moderately disabled, 33.7% had a good recovery. Older age, longer education duration, lower functional status upon intensive care discharge, and more severe 8-year dysexecutive problems were significantly associated with a lower Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score in multivariable analysis. At 8 years, 48.7% of patients were employed in a productive job. Of those, 38% declared a salary loss since traumatic brain injury. Unemployment was significantly associated with lower 1-year GOSE score and more severe 8-year dysexecutive problems. Conclusions: These results from an inception cohort study highlight the fact that long-term outcome after severe TBI is determined by a complex combination of injury-related, demographic and neuropsychological factors. Long after the injury, persisting impairments still interfere with social integration, and participation.",Buzzing Sympathetic Nerves: A New Test to Enhance Anisocoria in Horner's Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846965,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 10,"Introduction: Patients with suspected Horner's syndrome having equivocal pupil dilation lag and pharmacologic testing may undergo unnecessary MR imaging and work up in the case of false positive pupil test results. Our goal was to increase the diagnostic accuracy of pupillometry by accentuating the inter-ocular asymmetry of sympathetic innervation to the iris dilator with surface electrical stimulation of the median nerve using a standard electromyography machine. We hypothesized that an accentuated difference in sympathetic response between the two eyes would facilitate the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome. Methods: Eighteen patients with pharmacologically proven Horner's syndrome were compared to ten healthy volunteers tested before and after monocular instillation of 0.2% brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution to induce pharmacological Horner's syndrome. Pupillary responses were measured with binocular pupillometry in response to sympathetic activation by electrical stimulation of the median nerve in darkness and at various times after extinction of a light stimulus. Sudomotor sympathetic responses from the palm of the stimulated arm were recorded simultaneously. Results: In subjects with Horner's syndrome and pharmacologically induced unilateral sympathetic deficit, electrical stimulation in combination with the extinction of light greatly enhanced the anisocoria during the evoked pupil dilation, while there was no significant increase in anisocoria in healthy subjects. The asymmetry of the sympathetic response was greatest when the electrical stimulus was given 2 s after termination of the light or under constant low light conditions. When given 2 s after termination of light, the electrical stimulation increased the mean anisocoria from 1.0 to 1.2 mm in Horner's syndrome (p = 0.01) compared to 0.22-0.26 mm in healthy subjects (p = 0.1). In all subjects, the maximal anisocoria induced by the electrical stimulation appeared within a 2 s interval after the stimulus. Correspondingly, the largest change in anisocoria between light and dark without electrical stimulation was seen between 3 and 4 s after light-off. While stronger triple stimulation further enhanced the anisocoria, it was less well tolerated. Conclusions: Electrical stimulation 2 s after light-off greatly enhances the sensitivity of pupillometry for diagnosing Horner's syndrome. This new method may help to rule in or rule out a questionable Horner's syndrome, especially if the results of topical pharmacological testing are inconclusive.",Vocational Rehabilitation in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Supporting Return to Work and Daily Life Functioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846964,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 10,"Persisting post-concussive symptoms are challenging to treat and may delay return-to-work (RTW). The aims of this study were to describe a multidisciplinary and holistic vocational rehabilitation (VR) program for individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and to explore course and predictors of employment outcome during VR. The VR program was described using the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) framework. Further, a retrospective, cohort study on individuals with mTBI receiving VR was conducted based on clinical records (n = 32; 22% males; mean age 43.2 years; 1.2 years since injury on average). The primary outcome was difference in hours at work per week from pre- to post-VR, and the secondary outcome was change in a three-level RTW-status. Time since injury, age, sex, and loss of consciousness were investigated as predictors of the outcomes. The VR intervention is individually tailored and targets patients' individual needs. Thus, it may combine a variety of methods based on a biopsychosocial theoretical model. During VR, hours at work, 17.0 ± 2.2, p < 0.001, and RTW-status, OR = 14.0, p < 0.001, improved significantly with 97% having returned to work after VR. Shorter length of time since injury and male sex were identified as predictors of a greater gain of working hours. Time since injury was the strongest predictor; double the time was associated with a reduction in effect by 4.2 ± 1.4 h after adjusting for working hours at start of VR. In sum, these results suggest that individuals facing persistent problems following mTBI may still improve employment outcomes and RTW after receiving this multidisciplinary and holistic VR intervention, even years after injury. While results are preliminary and subject to bias due to the lack of a control group, this study warrants further research into employment outcomes and VR following mTBI, including who may benefit the most from treatment.","Unconscious Motives and Actions - Agency, Freedom and Responsibility.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846963,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 10,"According to many criteria, agency, intentionality, responsibility and freedom of decision, require conscious decisions. Freud already assumed that many of our decisions are influenced by dynamically unconscious motives or that we even perform unconscious actions based on completely unconscious considerations. Such actions might not be intentional, and perhaps not even actions in the narrow sense, we would not be responsible for them and freedom of decision would be missing. Recent psychological and neurophysiological research has added to this a number of phenomena (the ""new unconscious"") in which behavior is completely unconscious or in which the decision or its execution is influenced by unconscious factors: priming, automatic behavior, habitualized behavior, actions based on plain unconscious deliberations, intrusion of information from the dorsal pathway, etc. However, since this makes up the largest part of the behavior which is generally regarded as action, intentionality, yet agency, responsibility and even compatibilist freedom of decision for the largest part of our behavior may be threatened. Such considerations have led to a lively debate, which, however, suffers from generalizations that lump all these unconscious phenomena together. In contrast, the aim of this article is to discuss individual unconscious influences on our behavior separately with respect to what extent they require changes in traditional conceptualizations. The first part (sections 2-4) of the article outlines the ""traditions"" and their elaborations: the intentional causalist concept of action, an associated empirical theory of action and standard concepts of responsibility and compatibilist freedom of decision, as well as the challenges for them. In the second part (sections 5-9), the aforementioned unconscious influences on our actions (except for automated and habitualized actions, which I discuss elsewhere) are examined: 1. unconscious priming, 2. dynamically unconscious motives, 3. dorsal pathway information influencing conscious decisions, 4. unconsciously altered execution of conscious intentions, and 5. unconscious deliberations and decisions. To what extent do these phenomena C1. require a change in the concept of action, C2. curtail intentionality or agency, C3. responsibility, and C4. freedom? The result is: The curtailments prove to be far less dramatic than they initially appear; they require more watchfulness but no conceptual change.",The Relation of Violent Video Games to Adolescent Aggression: An Examination of Moderated Mediation Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846962,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 10,"To assess the moderated mediation effect of normative beliefs about aggression and family environment on exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression, the subjects self-reported their exposure to violent video games, family environment, normative beliefs about aggression, and aggressive behavior. The results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression; normative beliefs about aggression had a mediation effect on exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression, while family environment moderated the first part of the mediation process. For individuals with a good family environment, exposure to violent video games had only a direct effect on aggression; however, for those with poor family environment, it had both direct and indirect effects mediated by normative beliefs about aggression. This moderated mediation model includes some notions of General Aggression Model (GAM) and Catalyst Model (CM), which helps shed light on the complex mechanism of violent video games influencing adolescent aggression.",Validating Driver Behavior and Attitude Measure for Older Italian Drivers and Investigating Their Link to Rare Collision Events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846960,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 10,"The present study aimed to: (a) validate the factor structures of three scales assessing driving behavior, attitudes toward traffic safety (ATTS) and self-regulation in driving, in a sample of Italian older adults, through confirmatory factor analyses and (b) to determine the effectiveness of these measures in predicting the likelihood and the frequency of collision involvements in the following year. A 28-item driver behavior questionnaire (DBQ), a 16-item ATTS, a 21-item extended driving mobility questionnaire (DMQ-A) were administered to 369 active Italian drivers, aged between 60 and 91 years. Results showed a four-factor structure for the DBQ, a five-factor structure for the ATTS and a two-factor structure for the Extended DMQ-A, as the best fitting models. Hurdle model analysis of count data with extra-zeros showed that all factors of DBQ predicted the likelihood of road collisions. Risky behavior, except for aggressive violations, self-regulation and attitudes toward traffic rules were associated with the frequency of collision involvement. The aforementioned three scales seemed to be a useful and concise suite of instruments assessing risky as well as protective factors of driving behavior in elderly.",Career-Specific Parenting Practices and Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Among Chinese Adolescents: The Interactive Effects of Parenting Practices and the Mediating Role of Autonomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846959,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 10,"This study examined the unique and interactive effects of various career-specific parenting practices (i.e., parental career support, interference, and lack of engagement) on Chinese high school students' career decision-making self-efficacy (CDSE) as well as the mediating role of autonomy in such associations. Based on data from 641 Chinese high school students (47.6% male; mean age = 15.28 years old, SD = 0.49) in 2016, two moderated mediating effects were identified. Higher level of parental career engagement strengthened the positive association between parental career support and adolescents' autonomy, which in turn, was associated positively with adolescents' CDSE. Parental career interference related negatively with adolescents' CDSE via autonomy when lack of parental career engagement was low, but related positively with adolescents' CDSE via autonomy when lack of parental career engagement was high. These findings advance our understanding of the underlying processes between career-specific parenting practices and adolescents' CDSE. Implications for practices were discussed.","Effect of Narcissism, Psychopathy, and Machiavellianism on Entrepreneurial Intention-The Mediating of Entrepreneurial Self-Efficacy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846958,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 10,"The driving factors behind the exploration and search for entrepreneurial intention (EI) are critical to entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial practice. To reveal in depth the influence of personality traits on EI, our study introduces the opposite of proactive personality-the dark triad that consists of narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism. Our study used the MBA students of Tianjin University as a sample to analyze the relationship between the dark triad, entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) and EI. A total of 334 MBA students aged 24-47 years participated and the participation rate is 95.71%. The data collection was largely concentrated in the period from May 15 to June 5, 2018. From the overall perspective of the dark triad, the results show that the dark triad positively predicts EI, and ESE has a partial mediating effect on the dark triad and EI. From the perspective of the three members of the dark triad, the study found that narcissism/psychopathy has a negative effect on ESE and EI; narcissism/psychopathy has a non-linear effect on EI; Machiavellianism has a positive effect on ESE and EI; and ESE has a mediating effect on the three members of the dark triad and EI. In short, our research reveals that the three members of the dark triad have different effects on EI in different cultural contexts, and the research findings have certain reference value for further improvement of entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial practice.",Parental Psychological Control and Adolescent Aggressive Behavior: Deviant Peer Affiliation as a Mediator and School Connectedness as a Moderator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846957,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 10,"Abundant evidence has demonstrated an association between parental psychological control and adolescent aggressive behavior. However, the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation are still under-investigated. Grounded in the social development model and stress-buffering model, this study investigated whether deviant peer affiliation mediates the relation between parental psychological control and adolescent aggressive behavior, and whether this indirect link is moderated by school connectedness. A total of 4265 adolescents (Meanage = 13.66 years, SD = 2.74, 48.63% male) from southern China completed questionnaires regarding parental psychological control, deviant peer affiliation, school connectedness, and aggressive behavior. Structural equation models revealed that the relation between parental psychological control and aggressive behavior is partially mediated by deviant peer affiliation. Moreover, this indirect link was stronger for adolescents with low levels of school connectedness than for those with high levels of school connectedness. This study thus identifies the potential underlying mechanism by which parental psychological control is associated with adolescent aggressive behaviors, which has important implications for theory and prevention."

This intrinsic complexity requires systems thinking to decipher hair fiber accurately. Hair research, studied by various disciplines, follows a reductionist research approach, where elements of interest are studied from a local context with a certain amount of detachment from other elements or contexts. Following a systems approach, the authors are currently developing a cross-disciplinary taxonomy to provide a holistic view of fiber constituents and their interactions within large-scale dynamics. Based on the development process, this paper presents a review that explores the associated features, interrelationships and interactive complexities between physical, mechanical, biochemical and geometric features of natural, healthy hair fibers. Through the review, the importance of an appropriate taxonomy for interpreting hair fiber data across different disciplines is revealed. The review also demonstrates how seemingly unrelated fiber constituents are indeed interdependent and that these interdependencies may affect the behavior of the fiber. Finally, the review highlights how a non-integrative approach may have a negative impact on the reliability of hair data interpretation.","VasoTracker, a Low-Cost and Open Source Pressure Myograph System for Vascular Physiology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846942,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 10,"Pressure myography, one of the most commonly used techniques in vascular research, measures the diameter of isolated, pressurized arteries to assess the functional activity of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Despite the widespread adoption of this technique for assessing vascular function, there are only a small number of commercial systems and these are expensive. Here, we introduce a complete, open source pressure myograph system and analysis software, VasoTracker, that can be set-up for approximately 10% of the cost of commercial alternatives. We report on the development of VasoTracker and demonstrate its ability to assess various components of vascular reactivity. A unique feature of the VasoTracker platform is the publicly accessible website (http://www.vasotracker.com/) that documents how to assemble and use this affordable, adaptable, and expandable pressure myograph.",Altered Venous Blood Nitric Oxide Levels at Depth and Related Bubble Formation During Scuba Diving.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846941,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 10,"Introduction: Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of diving, and the related endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress roles have been extensively investigated. However, most available data have been obtained before and after the dive, whilst, as far as we know, no data is available about what happens during the water immersion phase of dive. The scope of this study is to investigate the Nitrate and Nitrite (NOX) concentration and the total plasma antioxidant capacity (TAC) before, during and after a single SCUBA dive in healthy scuba diving volunteers, as well as to look for evidence of a possible relationship with venous gas bubble formation. Materials and Methods: Plasma, obtained from blood of 15 expert SCUBA divers, 13 male and 2 female, was investigated for differences in NOX and TAC values in different dive times. Differences in NOX and TAC values in subjects previously known as ""bubble resistant"" (non-bubblers - NB) and ""bubble prone"" (Bubblers - B) were investigated. Results: We found a statistically significant increase of NOX plasma concentration in the ""bottom blood draw"" and in the ""safety stop blood draw"" as compared to the basal pre diving condition. We did not find any difference in NOX plasma concentration between the basal value and the post diving samples. We did not find any significant statistical difference in TAC in the bottom blood sample, while the safety-stop and the post-dive samples showed higher TAC values compared with the basal value. We did not find any difference in NOX and TAC mean values between non-bubblers and Bubblers. Discussion: Our protocol, by including underwater blood drawing, allowed to monitor plasma NOX changes occurred during diving activity, and not only by comparing pre and post diving values. It is particularly interesting to note that the increased NOX values found at the bottom and at the safety stop were not observed at post dive sampling (T0, T30, T60), showing a very rapid return to the pre-dive values. In this preliminary study we did not find any relationship between bubble formation and changes in NOX parameters and TAC response.",MiR-409-3p Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Invasion of Osteosarcoma by Targeting Zinc-Finger E-Box-Binding Homeobox-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846940,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 10,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone cancer worldwide. There is evidence that microRNA-409 (miR-409-3p) is involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, however, its possible role in OS requires clarification. In the present study, we evaluated the expression level, clinical significance, and mode of action of miR-409-3p in OS. The miR-409-3p levels were diminished in the OS cells and tissues compared with associated adjacent non-tumor tissues and a non-cancer osteoplastic cell line. Low miR-409-3p expression levels were associated with clinical stage and distant metastasis in patients with OS. Resumption of miR-409-3p expression attenuated OS cell proliferation and invasion. Additionally, based on informatics analyses, we predicted that zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox-1 (ZEB1) is a possible target of miR-409-3p. This hypothesis was confirmed using luciferase reporter assays, reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analyses. The findings of the current study indicated that ZEB1 was up-regulated in the OS tissues and cell lines, and that this up-regulation was inversely proportional to miR-409-3p expression levels. Furthermore, down-regulation of ZEB1 decreased OS cell invasion and proliferation, illustrating that the tumor suppressive role of miR-409-3p in OS cells may be exerted via negative regulation of ZEB1. Taken together, our observations highlight the potential role of miR-409-3p as a tumor suppressor in OS partially through down-regulation of ZEB1 and suggest that miR-409-3p has potential applications in OS treatment.",Altered Regulation of Striatal Neuronal N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Trafficking by Palmitoylation in Huntington Disease Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846936,Frontiers in synaptic neuroscience,2019 03 10,"N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a critical role in synaptic signaling, and alterations in the synaptic/extrasynaptic NMDAR balance affect neuronal survival. Studies have shown enhanced extrasynaptic GluN2B-type NMDAR (2B-NMDAR) activity in striatal neurons in the YAC128 mouse model of Huntington disease (HD), resulting in increased cell death pathway activation contributing to striatal vulnerability to degeneration. However, the mechanism(s) of altered GluN2B trafficking remains unclear. Previous work shows that GluN2B palmitoylation on two C-terminal cysteine clusters regulates 2B-NMDAR trafficking to the surface membrane and synapses in cortical neurons. Notably, two palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs), zDHHC17 and zDHHC13, also called huntingtin-interacting protein 14 (HIP14) and HIP14-like (HIP14L), directly interact with the huntingtin protein (Htt), and mutant Htt disrupts this interaction. Here, we investigated whether GluN2B palmitoylation is involved in enhanced extrasynaptic surface expression of 2B-NMDARs in YAC128 striatal neurons and whether this process is regulated by HIP14 or HIP14L. We found reduced GluN2B palmitoylation in YAC128 striatum, specifically on cysteine cluster II. Consistent with that finding, the palmitoylation-deficient GluN2B Cysteine cluster II mutant exhibited enhanced, extrasynaptic surface expression in striatal neurons from wild-type mice, mimicking increased extrasynaptic 2B-NMDAR observed in YAC128 cultures. We also found that HIP14L palmitoylated GluN2B cysteine cluster II. Moreover, GluN2B palmitoylation levels were reduced in striatal tissue from HIP14L-deficient mice, and siRNA-mediated HIP14L knockdown in cultured neurons enhanced striatal neuronal GluN2B surface expression and susceptibility to NMDA toxicity. Thus, altered regulation of GluN2B palmitoylation levels by the huntingtin-associated PAT HIP14L may contribute to the cell death-signaling pathways underlying HD.",Disruption of Cerebellar Prediction in Verbal Working Memory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846935,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019 03 10,"Mounting evidence suggests that the right cerebellum contributes to verbal working memory, but the functional role of this contribution remains unclear. In an established theory of motor control, the cerebellum is thought to predict sensory consequences of movements through an internal ""forward model."" Here, we hypothesize a similar predictive process can generalize to cerebellar non-motor function, and that the right cerebellum plays a predictive role that is beneficial for rapidly engaging the phonological loop in verbal working memory. To test this hypothesis, double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was administered over either the right cerebellum or right occipital lobe (control site), on half the trials, to interrupt the rehearsal of a 6-letter sequence. We found that cerebellar stimulation resulted in greater errors in participants' report of the letter in the current position. Additional analyses revealed that immediately after cerebellar TMS, participants were more likely to use out of date information to predict the next letter in the sequence. This pattern of errors is consistent with TMS causing a temporary disruption of state estimation and cerebellar forward model function, leading to prediction errors in the phonological loop.",Detection Analysis of Epileptic EEG Using a Novel Random Forest Model Combined With Grid Search Optimization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846934,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019 03 10,"In the automatic detection of epileptic seizures, the monitoring of critically ill patients with time varying EEG signals is an essential procedure in intensive care units. There is an increasing interest in using EEG analysis to detect seizure, and in this study we aim to get a better understanding of how to visualize the information in the EEG time-frequency feature, and design and train a novel random forest algorithm for EEG decoding, especially for multiple-levels of illness. Here, we propose an automatic detection framework for epileptic seizure based on multiple time-frequency analysis approaches; it involves a novel random forest model combined with grid search optimization. The short-time Fourier transformation visualizes seizure features after normalization. The dimensionality of features is reduced through principal component analysis before feeding them into the classification model. The training parameters are optimized using grid search optimization to improve detection performance and diagnostic accuracy by in the recognition of three different levels epileptic of conditions (healthy subjects, seizure-free intervals, seizure activity). Our proposed model was used to classify 500 samples of raw EEG data, and multiple cross-validations were adopted to boost the modeling accuracy. Experimental results were evaluated by an accuracy, a confusion matrix, a receiver operating characteristic curve, and an area under the curve. The evaluations indicated that our model achieved the more effective classification than some previous typical methods. Such a scheme for computer-assisted clinical diagnosis of seizures has a potential guiding significance, which not only relieves the suffering of patient with epilepsy to improve quality of life, but also helps neurologists reduce their workload.",Acute but Not Permanent Effects of Propranolol on Fear Memory Expression in Humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846933,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019 03 10,"Experimental evidence in humans and non-human animals suggests that the administration of propranolol shortly after the retrieval of an emotional memory can lead to an attenuation of its later expression, a phenomenon known as post-reactivation amnesia. Using more potent amnestic drugs, post-reactivation amnesia has been shown in animals to be reversible by re-administration of the drug prior to memory retention testing. The latter finding suggests that, at least under some circumstances, post-reactivation amnesia may not reflect a disruption of reconsolidation (i.e., a memory storage deficit) but an acquired state-dependency of memory expression (i.e., a memory retrieval deficit that is relieved when the drug state is recreated during testing). We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate whether the previously established amnestic effects of post-reactivation propranolol administration on memory retention in humans may similarly reflect a retrieval deficit. In four groups of participants, fear memories were first established through differential fear conditioning. One day later, a single presentation of the CS+ without shock was used to reactivate the memory in three of the four groups, followed by the administration of 40 mg Propranolol HCl (Groups PrPl and PrPr) or placebo (Group PlPl). Memory was not reactivated in the fourth group (Group NR). Another 24 h later, Propranolol HCl (Group PrPr) or placebo (Groups PrPl, PlPl, and NR) was again administered, followed by a test of memory retention (extinction testing) and recovery (reinstatement testing). We did not observe any effects of post-reactivation propranolol on memory retention; conditioned responding was similar for all groups at the start of retention testing and similarly sensitive to recovery through reinstatement. We did observe an acute effect of propranolol administration on fear-potentiated startle responding during retention testing in Group PrPr, where participants exhibited attenuated startle responses during extinction testing but similar sensitivity to reinstatement as participants in the other groups. While our findings fail to corroborate previous reports of propranolol-induced post-reactivation amnesia in humans, they do point to acute effects of propranolol administration on extinction performance.",Cytoarchitectonic Areas of the Gyrus ambiens in the Human Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846932,Frontiers in neuroanatomy,2019 03 10,"The Gyrus ambiens is a gross anatomical prominence in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), associated closely with Brodmann area 34 (BA34). It is formed largely by the medial intermediate subfield of the entorhinal cortex (EC) [Brodmann area 28 (BA28)]. Although the MTL has been widely studied due to its well-known role on memory and spatial information, the anatomical relationship between G. ambiens, BA34, and medial intermediate EC subfield has not been completely defined, in particular whether BA34 is part of the EC or a different type of cortex. In order to clarify this issue, we carried out a detailed analysis of 37 human MTLs, determining the exact location of medial intermediate EC subfield and its extent within the G. ambiens, its cortical thickness, and the histological-MRI correspondence of the G. ambiens with the medial intermediate EC subfield in 10 ex vivo MRI. Our results show that the G. ambiens is limited between two small sulci in the medial aspect of the MTL, which correspond almost perfectly to the extent of the medial intermediate EC subfield, although the rostral and caudal extensions of the G. ambiens may extend to the olfactory (rostrally) and intermediate (caudally) entorhinal subfields. Moreover, the cortical thickness averaged 2.5 mm (1.3 mm for layers I-III and 1 mm for layers V-VI). Moreover, distance among different landmarks visible in the MRI scans which are relevant to the identification of the G. ambiens in MRI are provided. These results suggest that BA34 is a part of the EC that fits best with the medial intermediate subfield. The histological data, together with the ex vivo MRI identification and thickness of these structures may be of use when assessing changes in MRI scans in clinical settings, such as Alzheimer disease.",Optimization of Traced Neuron Skeleton Using Lasso-Based Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846931,Frontiers in neuroanatomy,2019 03 10,"Reconstruction of neuronal morphology from images involves mainly the extraction of neuronal skeleton points. It is an indispensable step in the quantitative analysis of neurons. Due to the complex morphology of neurons, many widely used tracing methods have difficulties in accurately acquiring skeleton points near branch points or in structures with tortuosity. Here, we propose two models to solve these problems. One is based on an L1-norm minimization model, which can better identify tortuous structure, namely, a local structure with large curvature skeleton points; the other detects an optimized branch point by considering the combination patterns of all neurites that link to this point. We combined these two models to achieve optimized skeleton detection for a neuron. We validate our models in various datasets including MOST and BigNeuron. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can optimize the traced skeletons from large-scale images. These characteristics of our approach indicate that it can reduce manual editing of traced skeletons and help to accelerate the accurate reconstruction of neuronal morphology."

The root concentrations of pesticides were low in very young seedlings with undeveloped root systems, highest in seedlings with developed root systems, and tended to decrease until the usual harvesting stage. Additionally, the shoot concentrations of tested pesticides showed the same trends as the roots. The pesticide-uptake abilities of roots were lowest in very young seedlings and then constant for seedlings until the harvesting stage. In contrast, the pesticide-translocation abilities from root to shoot were constant regardless of growth stage. The results indicated that changes in shoot concentrations with growth stage were affected by the development of the root system and pesticide-uptake ability of roots.",New and noteworthy boletes from subtropical and tropical China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846903,MycoKeys,2019 03 10,"The morphology, ecology, and phylogenetic relationships of specimens of the family Boletaceae from subtropical and tropical China were investigated.

Therefore, secondary succession and seasonal changes after loss of vegetal cover will have a significant influence on their community patterns. Accordingly, responses of leaf beetles to such environmental heterogeneity make them a suitable taxon for monitoring disturbance, which is more important for endangered habitats such as the low thorn forests (LTF) in northeastern Mexico. We conducted a study in a LTF fragment in order to assess the effects of secondary succession and seasonality on leaf beetle communities, as well as to quantify the importance of Chrysomelidae as an indicator taxon. Landsat scenes were used for delimiting a successional gradient, in which four succession categories were selected: four years, 17 years, and 31 years since loss of vegetal cover, and conserved areas. Eight plots of 100 m2 were randomly delimited in each category; plots were sampled monthly, using an entomological sweep net, from May 2016 to April 2017. In total, 384 samples were collected by the end of study, from which 6978 specimens, six subfamilies, 57 genera, and 85 species were obtained. Species richness was higher in early succession areas. Abundance declined significantly from early successional to conserved areas, but the conserved areas had the higher diversity. Furthermore, differences in abundance were significant between rainy and dry seasons in areas of four, 17, and 31 years of succession, but not in conserved areas; also, all categories had a similar abundance during the dry season. Intermediate (17 and 31 years) and conserved areas differed in the season of higher diversity. Regarding inventory completeness, it was close to or above 70 % for all comparisons, although it was very low for the 17-year category during the rainy season. Faunistic similarity was higher between intermediate categories. A total of 24 species had a significant indicator value. Effects of succession time and seasonality on leaf beetle communities are here quantified for first time in LTF forests. Influences of environmental heterogeneity and intermediate disturbance are discussed as main drivers of the results obtained. Several leaf beetle species are proposed that could be useful for monitoring succession time and secondary LTF vegetation in northeastern Mexico. However, studies must be replicated at other regions, in order to obtain a better characterization of disturbance influence on leaf beetles.","Two new species and one new regional record of Indonemoura from Guangxi, China, with additions to larval characters (Plecoptera, Nemouridae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846900,ZooKeys,2019 03 10,"Two new species of Nemouridae of the genus Indonemoura Baumann, 1975, Indonemouraquadratasp. n. and Indonemouraquadrispinasp. n., are described from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of southern China, on the basis of both sexes and larval stage.

Two grain mounts were analyzed with the same techniques but in a different sequence: The first one was measured with NanoSIMS followed by noble gas mass spectrometry, and the second one in reverse order. No grain contained 4He and only one grain on the second mount contained 3He. On the first mount, the grains had been extensively sputtered with NanoSIMS ion beams prior to noble gas analysis; we found only one grain out of 15 with presolar 22Ne above detection limit. In contrast, we found presolar 22Ne in six out of seven grains on the second mount that was not exposed to an ion beam prior to noble gas analysis. All 22 grains on the two mounts were imaged with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and/or Auger microscopy. We present evidence that this contrasting observation is most likely due to e-beam-induced heating of the generally smaller grains on the first mount during SEM and Auger imaging, and not primarily due to the NanoSIMS analysis. If thermal contact of the grains to the substrate is absent, such that heat can only be dissipated via radiation, then the smaller, sputter-eroded grains are heated to higher temperatures such that noble gases can diffuse out. We discuss possible gas loss mechanisms and suggest solutions to reduce heating during e-beam analyses by minimizing voltages, beam currents, and dwell times. We also found small amounts of 21Ne in five grains. Using isotope data we determined that the dominant sources of most grains are core-collapse supernovae, congruent with earlier studies of low-density presolar graphite from Murchison. Only two of the grains are most likely from AGB stars, and two others have an ambiguous origin.","The Association of Appendectomy, Adhesions, Tubal Pathology, and Female Infertility.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846898,JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,2019 05 03,"The aim of the study was to investigate a potential association between previous childhood appendectomy, tube pathology, and female infertility.","New Crosslinked Hyaluronan Gel, Intrauterine Device, or Both for the Prevention of Intrauterine Adhesions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846896,JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,2019 05 03,To compare the efficacy of 3 different techniques for prevention of adhesion reformation after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis in patients with moderate-to-severe intrauterine adhesions.

Here, a suite of IIAB iron meteorites was studied in order to accurately determine the contribution from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and from potential decay of 184Os to measured excesses in the minor isotope 180W. In addition to W isotopes, trace element concentrations (Re, Os, Ir, Pt, W) were determined on the same samples, as well as their cosmic ray exposure ages, using 36Cl-36Ar systematics. These data were used in combination with an improved model of GCR effects on W isotopes to correct effects resulting from neutron capture and spallation reactions. After these corrections, the residual 180W excesses correlate with Os/W ratios and indicate a clear contribution from 184Os decay. A newly derived decay constant is equivalent to a half-life for 184Os of (3.38 ± 2.13) × 1013 a. Furthermore, when the data are plotted on an Os-W isochron diagram, the intercept (ε180Wi = 0.63 ± 0.35) reveals that the IIAB parent body was characterized by a small initial nucleosynthetic excess in 180W upon which radiogenic and GCR effects were superimposed.

With the right media and growth conditions, many other microorganisms ranging from common yeasts to extremophiles such as hyperthermophilic archaea can also generate high current densities. Electrotrophic microorganisms that grow by using electrons derived from the cathode are less diverse and have no common or prototypical traits, and current densities are usually well below those reported for model exoelectrogens. However, electrotrophic microorganisms can use diverse terminal electron acceptors for cell respiration, including carbon dioxide, enabling a variety of novel cathode-driven reactions.

Cardiology,2019 03 20,"Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven inflammatory disease of the arterial intima in which the balance of pro-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving mechanisms dictates the final clinical outcome. Intimal infiltration and modification of plasma-derived lipoproteins and their uptake mainly by macrophages, with ensuing formation of lipid-filled foam cells, initiate atherosclerotic lesion formation, and deficient efferocytotic removal of apoptotic cells and foam cells sustains lesion progression. Defective efferocytosis, as a sign of inadequate inflammation resolution, leads to accumulation of secondarily necrotic macrophages and foam cells and the formation of an advanced lesion with a necrotic lipid core, indicative of plaque vulnerability. Resolution of inflammation is mediated by specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators derived from omega-3 fatty acids or arachidonic acid and by relevant proteins and signalling gaseous molecules. One of the major effects of inflammation resolution mediators is phenotypic conversion of pro-inflammatory macrophages into macrophages that suppress inflammation and promote healing. In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, the ratio between specialized pro-resolving mediators and pro-inflammatory lipids (in particular leukotrienes) is strikingly low, providing a molecular explanation for the defective inflammation resolution features of these lesions.

We report on the developmental, physiological and grain-characteristic responses of the Bd21-3 accession of Brachypodium to variations in NO3- availability. As previously described in wheat and barley, we show that vegetative growth, shoot/root ratio, tiller formation, spike development, tissue NO3- and N contents, grain number per plant, grain yield and grain N content are sensitive to pre- and/or post-anthesis NO3- supply. We subsequently described constitutive and NO3--inducible components of both High and Low Affinity Transport Systems (HATS and LATS) for root NO3- uptake, and BdNRT2/3 candidate genes potentially involved in the HATS. Taken together, our data validate Brachypodium Bd21-3 as a model to decipher cereal N nutrition. Apparent specificities such as high grain N content, strong post-anthesis NO3- uptake and efficient constitutive HATS, further identify Brachypodium as a direct source of knowledge for crop improvement.",Subacute to chronic Alzheimer-like alterations after controlled cortical impact in human tau transgenic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846870,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked to late life development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disorder histopathologically characterized by perivascular tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau at the depth of sulci to later widespread neurofibrillary pathology. Although tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary-like pathology have been observed in the brain of transgenic mice overexpressing human tau with aggregation-prone mutation after TBI, they have not been consistently recapitulated in rodents expressing wild-type tau only. Here, we characterized Alzheimer-like alterations behaviorally, biochemically and immunohistochemically 6 weeks and 7 months after unilateral mild-to-moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) in 5-7-month-old Tg/htau mice, which express all six isoforms of non-mutated human tau in a mouse tau null background. We detected hyperphosphorylation of tau at multiple sites in ipsilateral hippocampus 6 weeks but not 7 months after CCI. However, neuronal accumulation of AT8 positive phospho-tau was sustained in the chronic phase, in parallel to prolonged astrogliosis, and decreased neural and synaptic markers. The mice with CCI also exhibited cognitive and locomotor impairment. These results indicate subacute to chronic Alzheimer-like alterations after CCI in Tg/htau mice. This is the first known study providing insight into the role of CCI in Alzheimer-like brain alterations in young adult mice expressing only non-mutated human tau.",Long-term Use of Clozapine is Protective for Bone Density in Patients with Schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846868,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Low bone mineral density (BMD) prevails among patients with schizophrenia. Antipsychotics use plays an important role in BMD. Previous cross-section study suggests that clozapine treatment may benefit BMD of women with schizophrenia. However, the effect of long-term clozapine therapy on BMD remains unknown. This prospective study compared clozapine and non-clozapine antipsychotics in long-term effects on BMD among both men and women with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia and age-matched healthy individuals were enrolled from two centers. All patients, including clozapine receivers and non-clozapine antipsychotics recipients, kept clinically stable with unchanged antipsychotics and doses for at least 6 months at enrollment and during the follow-up period. BMD was examined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer upon enrollment and at 1- or 3-year follow-up. Thorough clinical and laboratory variables were measured too. The mean BMD of patients receiving clozapine was higher than that of the non-clozapine patients at both enrollment and follow-up. Overall, the patients in the clozapine group gained BMD, while those in the non-clozapine group lost BMD after 1-3 years (p = 0.015). There was no significant difference of BMD change between clozapine-treated patients and healthy controls. Factors associated with BMD change in the clozapine group included calcium level (B = -0.607, p = 0.021) and T3 level (B = -0.077, p = 0.007). This longitudinal study suggests that long-term clozapine treatment may protect BMD compared to prolactin-raising and non-clozapine prolactin-sparing antipsychotics among patients with schizophrenia. Future prospective studies are warranted to testify whether switching from non-clozapine antipsychotics to clozapine can rescue BMD."

The two most frequent mutations are CALR del52 (type 1, approximately 60%) and CALR ins5 (type 2, around 30%), but many other rarer mutations exist accounting each for less than 2% of all CALR mutations. Most of them are structurally classified as type 1-like and type 2-like CALR mutations according to the absence or presence of a residual wild-type calcium-binding motif and the modification of the alpha-helix structure. Yet, several key questions remain unanswered, especially the reason of such low frequencies of these other mutations. In an attempt to investigate specific pathogenic differences between type 1-like and type 2-like CALR mutations and del52 and ins5, we modeled two type 1-like (del34 and del46) and one type 2-like (del19) mutations in cell lines and in mice. All CALR mutants constitutively activate JAK2 and STAT5/3/1 in a similar way in the presence of the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) and induced cytokine-independent cell growth but to a lesser extent with rare mutants over time. This correlates with reduced expression levels of rare CALR mutants compared to del52 and ins5. Lethally irradiated mice that were engrafted with bone marrow transduced with the different CALR mutations developed thrombocytosis, but to a much lesser extent with ins5 and the type 2-like CALR mutation. In contrast to type 2-like mice, type 1-like mice developed marked myelofibrosis and splenomegaly 10 months after engraftment. Similar to del52, type 1-like CALR mutations induced an expansion at an early stage of hematopoiesis compared to ins5 and type 2-like mutation. Thus, type 1-like and type 2-like CALR mutants structurally and functionally resemble del52 and ins5 mutants, respectively.",Re(I)-catalyzed hydropropargylation of enamides: a useful method for the preparation of 4-pentynylamine derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846847,The Journal of antibiotics,2019 04 26,"Hydropropargylation of enamides was achieved in good yields through the 1,4-addition of enamides to the α,β-unsaturated carbene complex intermediate, followed by intramolecular hydrogen transfer to the iminium carbon.

It is a single stranded (-)RNA virus with a segmented genome. Eight segments of genomic viral RNA (vRNA) form the virion, which are then transcribed and replicated in host cells. The secondary structure of vRNA is an important regulator of virus biology and can be a target for finding new therapeutics. In this paper, the secondary structure of segment 5 vRNA is determined based on chemical mapping data, free energy minimization and structure-sequence conservation analysis for type A influenza. The revealed secondary structure has circular folding with a previously reported panhandle motif and distinct novel domains. Conservations of base pairs is 87% on average with many structural motifs that are highly conserved. Isoenergetic microarray mapping was used to additionally validate secondary structure and to discover regions that easy bind short oligonucleotides. Antisense oligonucleotides, which were designed based on modeled secondary structure and microarray mapping, inhibit influenza A virus proliferation in MDCK cells. The most potent oligonucleotides lowered virus titer by ~90%.

Our experimental results are consistent with the theoretical predictions. From the experimental and theoretical results, we find that interference filters with a narrower bandwidth can help to give a larger coherence length, due to the broadening of photon wave-packet in the spatial domain, resulting in an higher interference visibility. Furthermore, a combination of interference filters with different bandwidths may help to achieve a nice balance between coincidence counting rate and interference visibility. Our present work might provide valuable reference for further implementation of HOM interference in the field of quantum information.",Emergency Department Visits and Disease Burden Attributable to Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions in Elderly Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846843,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"Many countries worldwide are aging rapidly, and the complex care needs of older adults generate an unprecedented demand for health services. Common reasons for elderly emergency department (ED) visits frequently involve conditions triggered by preventable infections also known as ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs). This study aims to describe the trend and the associated disease burden attributable to ACSC-related ED visits made by elderly patients and to characterize their ED use by nursing home residence. We designed a population-based ecological study using administrative data on Taiwan EDs between 2002 and 2013. A total of 563,647 ED visits from individuals aged 65 or over were examined. All elderly ED visits due to ACSCs (tuberculosis, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, sepsis, cellulitis and urinary tract infection (UTI)) were further identified. Subsequent hospital admissions, related deaths after discharge, total health care costs and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were compared among different ACSCs. Prevalence of ACSCs was then assessed between nursing home (NH) residents and non-NH residents. Within the 12-year observation period, we find that there was a steady increase in both the rate of ACSC ED visits and the proportion of elderly with a visit. Overall, pneumonia is the most prevalent among six ACSCs for elderly ED visits (2.10%; 2.06 to 2.14), subsequent hospital admissions (5.77%; 5.59 to 5.94) and associated mortality following admission (17.37%; 16.74 to 18.01). UTI is the second prevalent ACSC consistently across ED visits (2.02%; 1.98 to 2.05), subsequent hospital admissions (2.36%, 2.25 to 2.48) and mortality following admission (10.80%; 10.28 to 11.32). Sepsis ranks third highest in the proportion of hospitalization following ED visit (2.29%; 2.18 to 2.41) and related deaths after hospital discharge (7.39%; 6.95 to 7.83), but it accounts for the highest average total health care expenditure (NT$94,595 ± 120,239; ≈US$3185.02) per case. When examining the likelihood of ACSC-attributable ED use, significantly higher odds were observed in NH residents as compared with non-NH residents for: pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 5.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.50-5.58); UTI (aOR: 4.44, 95% CI 3.97-4.98); sepsis (aOR: 3.54, 95% CI 3.06-4.10); and tuberculosis (aOR: 2.44, 95% CI 1.63-3.65). Here we examined the ACSC-related ED care and found that, among the six ACSCs studied, pneumonia, UTI and sepsis were the leading causes of ED visits, subsequent hospital admissions, related mortality, health care costs and DALYs in Taiwanese NH elderly adults. Our findings suggest that efficient monitoring and reinforcing of quality of care in the residential and community setting might substantially reduce the number of preventable elderly ED visits and alleviate strain on the health care system.",Dissemination of brain inflammation in traumatic brain injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846842,Cellular & molecular immunology,2019 05 21,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as a global health problem due to its increasing occurrence, challenging treatment, and persistent impacts on brain pathophysiology. Neural cell death in patients with TBI swiftly causes inflammation in the injured brain areas, which is recognized as focal brain inflammation. Focal brain inflammation causes secondary brain injury by exacerbating brain edema and neuronal death, while also exerting divergent beneficial effects, such as sealing the damaged limitans and removing cellular debris. Recent evidence from patients with TBI and studies on animal models suggest that brain inflammation after TBI is not only restricted to the focal lesion but also disseminates to remote areas of the brain. The dissemination of inflammation has been detected within days after the primary injury and persists chronically. This state of inflammation may be related to remote complications of TBI in patients, such as hyperthermia and hypopituitarism, and may lead to progressive neurodegeneration, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms that govern the initiation and propagation of brain inflammation after TBI and its impacts on post-trauma brain pathology.",Rotatable precipitates change the scale-free to scale dependent statistics in compressed Ti nano-pillars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846841,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"Compressed nano-pillars crackle from moving dislocations, which reduces plastic stability. Crackling noise is characterized by stress drops or strain bursts, which scale over a large region of sizes leading to power law statistics. Here we report that this ""classic"" behaviour is not valid in Ti-based nanopillars for a counterintuitive reason: we tailor precipitates inside the nano-pillar, which ""regulate"" the flux of dislocations. It is not because the nano-pillars become too small to sustain large dislocation movements, the effect is hence independent of size. Our precipitates act as ""rotors"": local stress initiates the rotation of inclusions, which reduces the stress amplitudes dramatically. The size distribution of stress drops simultaneously changes from power law to exponential. Rotors act like revolving doors limiting the number of passing dislocations. Hence each collapse becomes weak. We present experimental evidence for Ti-based nano-pillars (diameters between 300 nm and 2 μm) with power law distributions of crackling noise P(s) ∼ s-τ with τ ∼ 2 in the defect free or non-rotatable precipitate states. Rotors change the size distribution to P(s) ∼ exp(-s/s0). Rotors are inclusions of ω-phase that aligns under stress along slip planes and limit dislocation glide to small distances with high nucleation rates. This opens new ways to make nano-pillars more stable.",Src activation in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus may play an important role in pain hypersensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846840,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"Src family of kinases (SFKs) has been found to play an important role in the regulation of nociception. However, how each member of this family acts in the central nervous system (CNS) structures involved in the relay and/or modulation of nociceptive signals, and thereby contributes to the formation and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity, is still a challenge. In this work, a combined study using biochemical, genetic and behavioral approaches was conducted. We found that the expression of activated SFKs in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) area was significantly increased following the development of inflammation induced by injection of complete freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paw of rats. Furthermore, we identified that Src, but not Fyn or Lyn in the Src family, was activated, and that Src knockdown in the ARC area blocked the inflammation-induced increases in the expression of activated SFKs, the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B subunit and phosphorylated GluN2B at Y1472 in this region. Moreover, the CFA injection-induced allodynia and hyperalgesia, and the analgesic effect produced by systemic application of the SFK inhibitor, SU6656, were significantly diminished. However, the Src knockdown did not induce any change in the expression of activated SFKs  and the NMDAR GluN2B subunit in normal rats which were not injected with CFA. Neither the Src knockdown nor the systemic application of SU6656 affected the mechanical and thermal sensitivity of the normal rats. Thus, Src activation in the ARC may be a key event for formation and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity associated with peripheral inflammation.",Development of a novel short 12-meric papiliocin-derived peptide that is effective against Gram-negative sepsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846839,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"The development of novel peptide antibiotics with potent activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and anti-septic activity is urgently needed. In this study, we designed short, 12-meric antimicrobial peptides by substituting amino acids from the N-terminal 12 residues of the papiliocin (Pap12-1) peptide to alter cationicity and amphipathicity and improve antibacterial activity and bacterial membrane interactions. Pap12-6, with an amphipathic α-helical structure and Trp12 at the C-terminus, showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, especially against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Dye leakage, membrane depolarization, and electron microscopy data proved that Pap12-6 kills bacteria by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane. Additionally, Pap12-6 significantly reduced the secretion of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 and secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter gene activity confirmed that Pap12-6 shows anti-inflammatory activity via a TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway. In a mouse sepsis model, Pap12-6 significantly improved survival, reduced bacterial growth in organs, and reduced LPS and inflammatory cytokine levels in the serum and organs. Pap12-6 showed minimal cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells and controlled liver and kidney damage, proving its high bacterial selectivity. Our results suggest that Pap12-6 is a promising peptide antibiotic for the therapeutic treatment of Gram-negative sepsis via dual bactericidal and immunomodulatory effects on the host.",First-in-human clinical study of novel technique to diagnose malignant melanoma via thermal conductivity measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846837,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that originates from melanocytes and, especially in the case of early-stage melanoma, is distributed adjacent to the epidermis and superficial dermis. Although early-stage melanoma can be distinguished from benign nevus via a dermoscopy, it is difficult to distinguish invasive melanoma in its early stages from in situ melanoma. Because invasive melanoma must undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy to be diagnosed, a non-invasive method to detect the micro-invasion of early-stage melanoma is needed for dermato-oncologists. This paper proposes a novel quantitative melanoma identification method based on accurate measurements of thermal conductivity using a pen-shaped device. This method requires skin temperature data for one minute to determine the effective thermal conductivity of the skin, allowing it to distinguish melanoma lesions from healthy skin. Results suggest that effective thermal conductivity was negative for in situ melanoma. However, in accordance with tumour progression, effective thermal conductivity was larger in invasive melanoma. The proposed thermal conductivity measurement is a novel tool that detects the micro-invasion of melanoma."

All experimental fish were fed the same diet throughout life and fasted for 14 days prior to slaughter. Still, there were relatively large individual variations in EPA and DHA content of skeletal muscle. Higher DHA content was concurrent with increased expression of genes of the glycolytic pathway and the production of pyruvate and lactate, whereas EPA was associated with increased expression of pentose phosphate pathway and glycogen breakdown genes. Furthermore, EPA, but not DHA, was associated with expression of genes involved in insulin signaling. Expression of genes specific for skeletal muscle function were positively associated with both EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA were also associated with expression of genes related to eicosanoid and resolvin production. EPA was negatively associated with expression of genes involved in lipid catabolism. Thus, a possible reason why some individuals have a higher level of EPA in the skeletal muscle is that they deposit - rather than oxidize - EPA for energy.",Soil carbon is a useful surrogate for conservation planning in developing nations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846824,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Defining the optimal placement of areas for biodiversity conservation in developing nations remains a significant challenge. Our best methods for spatially targeting potential locations for biodiversity conservation rely heavily on extensive georeferenced species observation data which is often incomplete or lacking in developing nations. One possible solution is the use of surrogates that enable site assessments of potential biodiversity values which use either indicator taxa or abiotic variables, or both. Among the plethora of abiotic variables, soil carbon has previously been identified as a potentially powerful predictor for threatened biodiversity, but this has not yet been confirmed with direct observational data. Here we assess the potential value of soil carbon for spatial prediction of threatened species using direct measurements as well as a wide range of GIS derived abiotic values as surrogates for threatened plant species in the PEBANPA network of permanent plots in Southern Patagonia. We find that soil carbon significantly improves the performance of a biodiversity surrogate elaborated using abiotic variables to predict the presence of threatened species. Soil carbon could thus help to prioritize sites in conservation planning. Further, the results suggest that soil carbon on its own can be a much better surrogate than other abiotic variables when prioritization of sites for conservation are calibrated on increasingly small sets of observation plots. We call for the inclusion of soil carbon data in the elaboration of surrogates used to optimize conservation investments in the developing world.",Microwave treatment regulates the free volume of rice starch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846823,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The aim of this work was to investigate the role of microwave parameters and moisture content on the free volume (FV) changes of rice starch by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy analysis (PALS) and to explore the potential relationship between the changes of FV and physicochemical properties of rice starch. Microwave heating and water molecules lead to the increasing of FV of starch. However, this result is largely influenced by the plasticization of water molecule. The anti-plasticization caused by water evaporation resulting in a decrease in the size and concentration of FV during microwave heating. Significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the thickness of amorphous region of microwave-heated rice starch was found by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and the glass transition temperature (Tg) and gelatinization temperature significantly increase (p < 0.05) after microwave heating. According to correlation analysis, the power intensity and heating time were correlated negatively with the lifetime of o-Ps. In addition, the changes of amorphous region and Tg of rice starch were strongly related to FV changes. These results provided a theoretical basis for further research on the directional regulation of FV and improvement the quality of starch-based food by using microwave treatment.",Calmodulin-specific small interfering RNA induces consistent expression suppression and morphological changes in Echinococcus granulosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846822,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Among parasitic helminths, biological features of Echinococcus granulosus have been a focus of particular interest in biology and medicine. The determinants and underlying molecular mechanisms of Echinococcus development in different host settings is largely unknown. The phenomenal bi-directional development of E. granulosus protoscoleces into multi-proglottid and/or microcysts, is a fascinating feature of the parasite cultivation. Calmodulin (CaM) is the major intracellular Ca2+ binding protein in plant and animal organisms. Many Ca2+-related processes in the physiology of eukaryotic organisms are CaM-dependent, however little is known on the role of CaM in platyhelminths growth and development. Small interfering (si) RNA-induced manipulations of the genes involving in the parasite development is an opportunity to explore novel approaches for cystic echinococcosis (CE) prevention and management. Regarding the fundamental role of CaM in cellular function of the parasites, in this study, we investigated the molecular and morphological changes induced by siRNA on CaM in different in vitro stages of E. granulosus. Three developmental stages of the tapeworm, protoscoleces, microcysts and strobilated worms, were cultivated in vitro in mono- and di-phasic media and three delivery methods, i.e. electroporation, soaking and electro-soaking, were used for RNA interference. The level of mRNA suppression as well as the phenotypic changes of the parasites were measured. Following RNA interference, EgCaM mRNA suppressions of 65-99% were recorded in different stages of the tapeworm as compared to untreated/unrelated siRNA controls. Lower viability, growth retardation, morphological abnormalities as well as EgCaM expression suppression were documented in the parasite implying potential of siRNA technology for the prevention and management of CE.",Verification and rectification of cell type-specific splicing of a Seckel syndrome-associated ATR mutation using iPS cell model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846821,Journal of human genetics,2019 04 17,"Seckel syndrome (SS) is a rare spectrum of congenital severe microcephaly and dwarfism. One SS-causative gene is Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-Related Protein (ATR), and ATR (c.2101 A>G) mutation causes skipping of exon 9, resulting in a hypomorphic ATR defect. This mutation is considered the cause of an impaired response to DNA replication stress, the main function of ATR, contributing to the pathogenesis of microcephaly. However, the precise behavior and impact of this splicing defect in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is unclear. To address this, we established induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from fibroblasts carrying the ATR mutation and an isogenic ATR-corrected counterpart iPSC clone. SS-patient-derived iPSCs (SS-iPSCs) exhibited cell type-specific splicing; exon 9 was dominantly skipped in fibroblasts and iPSC-derived NPCs, but it was included in undifferentiated iPSCs and definitive endodermal cells. SS-iPSC-derived NPCs (SS-NPCs) showed distinct expression profiles from ATR non-mutated NPCs with negative enrichment of neuronal genesis-related gene sets. In SS-NPCs, abnormal mitotic spindles occurred more frequently than in gene-corrected counterparts, and the alignment of NPCs in the surface of the neurospheres was perturbed. Finally, we tested several splicing-modifying compounds and found that TG003, a CLK1 inhibitor, could pharmacologically rescue the exon 9 skipping in SS-NPCs. Treatment with TG003 restored the ATR kinase activity in SS-NPCs and decreased the frequency of abnormal mitotic events. In conclusion, our iPSC model revealed a novel effect of the ATR mutation in mitotic processes of NPCs and NPC-specific missplicing, accompanied by the recovery of neuronal defects using a splicing rectifier.",Temporal road closures improve habitat quality for wildlife.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846820,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Increasing levels of human activity threaten wildlife populations through direct mortality, habitat degradation, and habitat fragmentation. Area closures can improve habitat quality for wildlife, but may be difficult to achieve where tourism or other economic drivers are a priority. Temporal closures that limit human use during specific times of day have potential to increase habitat quality for wildlife, while continuing to provide opportunities for human use. However, the effectiveness of daily temporal closures has not been tested. We assessed how implementation of a temporal road closure affected wildlife movements in Banff National Park. Parks Canada closed a popular 17 km stretch of road between 2000 and 0800 hours to improve habitat quality for wildlife. We assessed the effectiveness of the closure on nine mammal species using three sets of data: remote cameras, road surveys, and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos) GPS data. In all three analyses, wildlife detection rates on the road doubled during the closure while remaining unchanged in reference areas. Our strong and consistent results suggest temporal closures are an important conservation tool that can increase habitat quality for wildlife while minimizing effects on people.",Direct Effects of Nicotine Exposure on Murine Calvaria and Calvarial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846819,Scientific reports,2019 05 08,"Despite the link between adverse birth outcomes due to pre- and peri-natal nicotine exposure, research suggests 11% of US women continue to smoke or use alternative nicotine products throughout pregnancy. Maternal smoking has been linked to incidence of craniofacial anomalies. We hypothesized that pre-natal nicotine exposure may directly alter craniofacial development independent of the other effects of cigarette smoking. To test this hypothesis, we administered pregnant C57BL6 mice drinking water supplemented with 0, 50, 100 or 200 μg/ml nicotine throughout pregnancy. On postnatal day 15 pups were sacrificed and skulls underwent micro-computed tomography (µCT) and histological analyses. Specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, α3, α7, β2, β4 were identified within the calvarial growth sites (sutures) and centers (synchondroses). Exposing murine calvarial suture derived cells and isotype cells to relevant circulating nicotine levels alone and in combination with nicotinic receptor agonist and antagonists resulted in cell specific effects. Most notably, nicotine exposure increased proliferation in calvarial cells, an effect that was modified by receptor agonist and antagonist treatment. Currently it is unclear what component(s) of cigarette smoke is causative in birth defects, however these data indicate that nicotine alone is capable of disrupting growth and development of murine calvaria.",Targeting Coagulation Factor Xa Promotes Regression of Advanced Atherosclerosis in Apolipoprotein-E Deficient Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846818,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"Atherosclerosis is a progressive inflammatory vascular disorder, complicated by plaque rupture and subsequently atherothrombosis. In vitro studies indicate that key clotting proteases, such as factor Xa (FXa), can promote atherosclerosis, presumably mediated through protease activated receptors (PARs). Although experimental studies showed reduced onset of atherosclerosis upon FXa inhibition, the effect on pre-existing plaques has never been studied. Therefore, we investigated effects of FXa inhibition by rivaroxaban on both newly-formed and pre-existing atherosclerotic plaques in apolipoprotein-e deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. Female ApoE-/- mice (age: 8-9 weeks, n = 10/group) received western type diet (WTD) or WTD supplemented with rivaroxaban (1.2 mg/g) for 14 weeks. In a second arm, mice received a WTD for 14 weeks, followed by continuation with either WTD or WTD supplemented with rivaroxaban (1.2 mg/g) for 6 weeks (total 20 weeks). Atherosclerotic burden in aortic arch was assessed by haematoxilin & eosin immunohistochemistry (IHC); plaque vulnerability was examined by IHC against macrophages, collagen, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In addition, PAR1 and -2 expressions and their main activators thrombin and FXa in the plaque were determined in the plaque. Administration of rivaroxaban at human therapeutic concentrations reduced the onset of atherosclerosis (-46%, p < 0.05), and promoted a regression of pre-existing plaques in the carotids (-24%, p < 0.001). In addition, the vulnerability of pre-existing plaques was reduced by FXa inhibition as reflected by reduced macrophages (-39.03%, p < 0.05), enhanced collagen deposition (+38.47%, p < 0.05) and diminished necrotic core (-31.39%, p < 0.05). These findings were accompanied with elevated vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced MMPs. Furthermore, expression of PARs and their activators, thrombin and FXa was diminished after rivaroxaban treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of FXa promotes regression of advanced atherosclerotic plaques and enhances plaque stability. These data suggest that inhibition of FXa may be beneficial in prevention and regression of atherosclerosis, possibly mediated through reduced activation of PARs.",Depression-like state behavioural outputs may confer beneficial outcomes in risky environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846817,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Recent theories in evolutionary medicine have suggested that behavioural outputs associated with depression-like states (DLS) could be an adaptation to unpredictable and precarious situations. In animal models, DLS are often linked to diverse and unpredictable stressors or adverse experiences. Theoretically, there are a range of potential fitness benefits associated with behavioural inhibition (typical to DLS), as opposed to more active/aggressive responses to adverse or uncontrollable events. This stance of evolutionary medicine has to our knowledge not been tested empirically. Here we address a possible key benefit of behavioural inhibition in a comparative model for social stress (territorial rainbow trout). By treating fish with the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine, we reversed the behavioural inhibition (i.e. stimulated an increase in activity level) in subordinate fish. During confrontation with a previously unfamiliar larger, aggressive and dominant individual, this increase in activity led to higher amounts of received aggression compared to sham-treated subordinates. This suggests that the behavioural inhibition characterizing animal models of DLS is indeed an effective coping strategy that reduces the risk of injuries in vulnerable social situations.",Multi-scale stochastic organization-oriented coarse-graining exemplified on the human mitotic checkpoint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846816,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The complexity of biological models makes methods for their analysis and understanding highly desirable. Here, we demonstrate the orchestration of various novel coarse-graining methods by applying them to the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint. We begin with a detailed fine-grained spatial model in which individual molecules are simulated moving and reacting in a three-dimensional space. A sequence of manual and automatic coarse-grainings finally leads to the coarsest deterministic and stochastic models containing only four molecular species and four states for each kinetochore, respectively. We are able to relate each more coarse-grained level to a finer one, which allows us to relate model parameters between coarse-grainings and which provides a more precise meaning for the elements of the more abstract models. Furthermore, we discuss how organizational coarse-graining can be applied to spatial dynamics by showing spatial organizations during mitotic checkpoint inactivation. We demonstrate how these models lead to insights if the model has different ""meaningful"" behaviors that differ in the set of (molecular) species. We conclude that understanding, modeling and analyzing complex bio-molecular systems can greatly benefit from a set of coarse-graining methods that, ideally, can be automatically applied and that allow the different levels of abstraction to be related."

Body Mass Index, body fat percentage, and fat free mass index were also measured. PSE was not as sensitive in predicting body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms as the VBSM. JND and average RT were found to be sensitive predictors of body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms across the 82 male participants. JND proved to be a better indicator of weight concern than the VBSM-M. Whilst the body categorization task offers new insights into the way body images may be processed by males with different levels of body dissatisfaction, the VBSM and the conventional self-report measures are likely to be clinically more efficacious at measuring body dissatisfaction.",Mediterranean isolation preconditioning the Earth System for late Miocene climate cooling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846804,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"A global Neogene cooling trend culminated ~7 million years ago with the onset of Greenland glaciation. Increased ocean-atmosphere interaction and low- to high-latitude circulation are thought to be key factors in reorganizing late Miocene global temperature and precipitation patterns, but the drivers of this reorganization have yet to be identified. Here, we present new information about the evolution of the Atlantic-Mediterranean gateway that generated Mediterranean overflow. We use sedimentary and palaeogeographic evidence to constrain the timing and dimensions of this gateway and document the initiation of a saline plume of water within the North Atlantic. Today, this saline jet entrains and transports Eastern North Atlantic water and its dissolved inorganic carbon into the interior of the ocean, contributing to the drawdown of CO2 and the sensitivity of the ocean to atmospheric changes. We show that during the Miocene this transport emerged simultaneously with gateway restriction and propose that the resulting interaction of ocean-surface and ocean-interior carbon inventories would have greatly enhanced ocean-atmosphere exchange, preconditioning the Earth System for late Miocene cooling.",Probing chemotaxis activity in Escherichia coli using fluorescent protein fusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846802,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Bacterial chemotaxis signaling may be interesting for the development of rapid biosensor assays, but is difficult to quantify. Here we explore two potential fluorescent readouts of chemotactically active Escherichia coli cells. In the first, we probed interactions between the chemotaxis signaling proteins CheY and CheZ by fusing them individually with non-fluorescent parts of stable or unstable 'split'-Green Fluorescent Protein. Wild-type chemotactic cells but not mutants lacking the CheA kinase produced distinguishable fluorescence foci, two-thirds of which localize at the cell poles with the chemoreceptors and one-third at motor complexes. Fluorescent foci based on stable split-eGFP displayed small fluctuations in cells exposed to attractant or repellent, but those based on an unstable ASV-tagged eGFP showed a higher dynamic behaviour both in the foci intensity changes and the number of foci per cell. For the second readout, we expressed the pH-sensitive fluorophore pHluorin in the cyto- and periplasm of chemotactically active E. coli. Calibrations of pHluorin fluorescence as a function of pH demonstrated that cells accumulating near a chemo-attractant temporally increase cytoplasmic pH while decreasing periplasmic pH. Both readouts thus show promise for biosensor assays based on bacterial chemotaxis activity.",Context-induced contrast and assimilation effects in explicit and implicit measures of agency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846800,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Virtual-hand-illusion studies often use explicit and implicit measures of body ownership but no agreed-on implicit measure of agency exists. We investigated whether the Intentional Binding (IB) effect could serve as such a measure. A pilot study confirmed that current consistency increases both perceived agency and IB. In three experiments, current consistency was 50% but the previously experienced consistency was either 100% or 0%. When previous and present consistency experience were separated by a short break, both explicit judgments and IB showed a contrast effect. Eliminating the break reversed the effect in explicit agency but not in IB; and making the transition between previous and present consistency smoother replicated the effect for explicit agency but reversed the pattern for IB. Our findings suggest that explicit agency and IB rely on different sources of information, presumably including cross-sensory correlations, predictions of expected action-effects, and comparisons between present and previous consistency experiences.",Comparison of the functional properties of trimeric and monomeric CaiT of Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846799,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Secondary transporters exist as monomers, dimers or higher state oligomers. The significance of the oligomeric state is only partially understood. Here, the significance of the trimeric state of the L-carnitine/γ-butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT of Escherichia coli was investigated. Amino acids important for trimer stability were identified and experimentally verified. Among others, CaiT-D288A and -D288R proved to be mostly monomeric in detergent solution and after reconstitution into proteoliposomes, as shown by blue native gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, and determination of intermolecular distances. CaiT-D288A was fully functional with kinetic parameters similar to the trimeric wild-type. Significant differences in amount and stability in the cell membrane between monomeric and trimeric CaiT were not observed. Contrary to trimeric CaiT, addition of substrate had no or only a minor effect on the tryptophan fluorescence of monomeric CaiT. The results suggest that physical contacts between protomers are important for the substrate-induced changes in protein fluorescence and the underlying conformational alterations.",Loading of AgNPs onto the surface of boron nitride nanosheets for determination of scopoletin in Atractylodes macrocephala.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846798,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"In this work, silver nanoparticles prepared by a molten salt method were deposited onto the surface of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheet (NS/AgNP) to from a composite. The synthesized nanocomposite was applied for surface modification of screen-printed electrode (SPE). The modified electrode showed a superior performance for electrochemical detection of scopoletin. The electrochemical behaviour of NS/AgNP/SPE was studied in detail. An electrocatalytic oxidation was observed and used for analytical determination of scopoletin concentration. The response of the proposed electrochemical sensing platform was linear over a wide detection range of 2 μM to 0.45 mM with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.89 μM. The NS/AgNP/SPE also showed excellent reproducibility and anti-interference property. In addition, the proposed scopoletin sensor was successfully used for the determination of scopoletin in Atractylodes macrocephala herb samples.",Indole Pulse Signalling Regulates the Cytoplasmic pH of E. coli in a Memory-Like Manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846797,Scientific reports,2019 04 04,"Bacterial cells are critically dependent upon pH regulation. Here we demonstrate that indole plays a critical role in the regulation of the cytoplasmic pH of Escherichia coli. Indole is an aromatic molecule with diverse signalling roles. Two modes of indole signalling have been described: persistent and pulse signalling. The latter is illustrated by the brief but intense elevation of intracellular indole during stationary phase entry. We show that under conditions permitting indole production, cells maintain their cytoplasmic pH at 7.2. In contrast, under conditions where no indole is produced, the cytoplasmic pH is near 7.8. We demonstrate that pH regulation results from pulse, rather than persistent, indole signalling. Furthermore, we illustrate that the relevant property of indole in this context is its ability to conduct protons across the cytoplasmic membrane. Additionally, we show that the effect of the indole pulse that occurs normally during stationary phase entry in rich medium remains as a ""memory"" to maintain the cytoplasmic pH until entry into the next stationary phase. The indole-mediated reduction in cytoplasmic pH may explain why indole provides E. coli with a degree of protection against stresses, including some bactericidal antibiotics.",Resting-state abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846796,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"The gold standard for clinical assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) relies on assessing behavior via semi-structured play-based interviews and parent interviews. Although these methods show good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing ASD cases, behavioral assessments alone may hinder the identification of asymptomatic at-risk group. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) could be an appropriate approach to produce objective neural markers to supplement behavioral assessments due to its non-invasive and task-free nature. Previous neuroimaging studies reported inconsistent resting-state abnormalities in ASD, which may be explained by small sample sizes and phenotypic heterogeneity in ASD subjects, and/or the use of different analytical methods across studies. The current study aims to investigate the local resting-state abnormalities of ASD regardless of subject age, IQ, gender, disease severity and methodological differences, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). MEDLINE/PubMed databases were searched for whole-brain rs-fMRI studies on ASD published until Feb 2018. Eight experiments involving 424 subjects were included in the ALE meta-analysis. We demonstrate two ASD-related resting-state findings: local underconnectivity in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and in the right medial paracentral lobule. This study contributes to uncovering a consistent pattern of resting-state local abnormalities that may serve as potential neurobiological markers for ASD.",Anomalous Release Kinetics of Prodigiosin from Poly-N-Isopropyl-Acrylamid based Hydrogels for The Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846795,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"This paper presents the anomalous release kinetics of a cancer drug (prodigiosin) frompoly-n-isopropyl-acrylamide (P(NIPA))-based gels. The release exponents, n, which correspond to the drug release mechanisms, were found to be between 0.41 and 1.40. This is within a range that include Fickian case I (n = 0.45) and non-Fickian diffusion (case II) (n > 0.45) for cylindrical drug-loaded structures. The results, however, suggest that the release exponents, n, correspond mostly to anomalous case II and super case II transport mechanics with sigmoidal characteristics. The drug release kinetics of the P(NIPA)-based hydrogels are well described by bi-dose functions. The observed drug release behavour is related to the porosity of the hydrogels, which can be controlled by cross-linking and copolymerization with acrylamide, which also improves the hydrophilicity of the gels. The paper also presents the effects of cancer drug release on cell survival (%), as well as the cell metabolic activities of treated cells and non-treated cells. The implications of the results are discussed for the development of implantable thermosensitive gels for the controlled release of drugs for localized cancer treatment.",A novel graphene barrier against moisture by multiple stacking large-grain graphene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30846794,Scientific reports,2019 03 12,"The moisture barrier properties of stacked graphene layers on Cu surfaces were investigated with the goal of improving the moisture barrier efficiency of single-layer graphene (SLG) for Cu metallization. SLG with large grain size were stacked on Cu surfaces coated with CVD-SLG to cover the grain-boundaries and defective areas of the underneath SLG film, which was confirmed to be oxidized by Raman spectroscopy measurements. To evaluate the humidity resistance of the graphene-coated Cu surfaces, temperature humidity storage (THS) testing was conducted under accelerated oxidation conditions (85 °C and 85% relative humidity) for 100 h. The color changes of the Cu surfaces during THS testing were observed by optical microscopy, while the oxidized Cu into Cu2O and CuO was detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The experimental results were accord with the results of first-principle simulation for the energetic barrier against water diffusion through the stacked graphene layers with different overlap. The results demonstrate the efficiency of SLG stacking approach against moisture for Cu metallization."
