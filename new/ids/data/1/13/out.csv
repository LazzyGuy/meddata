However, XLF deficiency leads to phenotypes in mice and humans that are not necessarily consistent with an isolated defect in NHEJ. Here we show that XLF functions during DNA replication. XLF undergoes cell division cycle 7-dependent phosphorylation; associates with the replication factor C complex, a critical component of the replisome; and is found at replication forks. XLF deficiency leads to defects in replication fork progression and an increase in fork reversal. The additional loss of H2AX, which protects DNA ends from resection, leads to a requirement for ATR to prevent an MRE11-dependent loss of newly synthesized DNA and activation of DNA damage response. Moreover, H2ax-/-:Xlf-/- cells exhibit a marked dependence on the ATR kinase for survival. We propose that XLF and H2AX function in series to prevent replication stress induced by the MRE11-dependent resection of regressed arms at reversed replication forks.",TORC2 controls endocytosis through plasma membrane tension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123183,The Journal of cell biology,2019 05 24,"Target of rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) is a conserved protein kinase that regulates multiple plasma membrane (PM)-related processes, including endocytosis. Direct, chemical inhibition of TORC2 arrests endocytosis but with kinetics that is relatively slow and therefore inconsistent with signaling being mediated solely through simple phosphorylation cascades. Here, we show that in addition to and independently from regulation of the phosphorylation of endocytic proteins, TORC2 also controls endocytosis by modulating PM tension. Elevated PM tension, upon TORC2 inhibition, impinges on endocytosis at two different levels by (1) severing the bonds between the PM adaptor proteins Sla2 and Ent1 and the actin cytoskeleton and (2) hindering recruitment of Rvs167, an N-BAR-containing protein important for vesicle fission to endocytosis sites. These results underline the importance of biophysical cues in the regulation of cellular and molecular processes.",Early Glomerular Hyperfiltration and Long-Term Kidney Outcomes in Type 1 Diabetes: The DCCT/EDIC Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123181,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2019 06 08,"Glomerular hyperfiltration has been considered to be a contributing factor to the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

Metastasis and therapy-resistance of melanoma and other cancers is driven by tumor cell plasticity, largely via acquisition/loss of stem-like characteristics and transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes (EMT/MET). NME1 is a metastasis suppressor gene that inhibits metastatic potential when its expression is enforced in melanoma and other cancers. Herein, we have unmasked a novel role for NME1 as a driver of melanoma growth distinct from its canonical function as a metastasis suppressor. NME1 promotes expansion of stem-like melanoma cells that exhibit elevated expression of stem cell markers (e.g. Sox2, Sox10, Oct-4, KLF4 and Ccnb-1), enhanced growth as melanoma spheres in culture, and enhanced tumor growth and lung colonizing activities in vivo. In contrast, NME1 expression did not affect proliferation of melanoma cell lines in monolayer culture conditions. Silencing of NME1 expression resulted in a dramatic reduction in melanoma sphere size, and impaired tumor growth and metastatic activities of melanoma sphere cells when xenografted in immunocompromised mice. Individual cells within melanoma sphere cultures displayed a wide range of NME1 expression across multiple melanoma cell lines. Cell subpopulations with elevated NME1 expression were fast-cycling and displayed enhanced expression of stem cell markers. Implications: Our findings suggest the current model of NME1 as a metastasis-suppressing factor requires refinement, bringing into consideration its heterogeneous expression within melanoma sphere cultures and its novel role in promoting expansion and tumorigenicity of stem-like cells.",Putting out fires: a qualitative study exploring the use of patient complaints to drive improvement at three academic hospitals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123172,BMJ quality & safety,2019 05 24,"Recent years have seen increasing calls for more proactive use of patient complaints to develop effective system-wide changes, analogous to the intended functions of incident reporting and root cause analysis (RCA) to improve patient safety.

Furthermore, the relationship between LINC01220 expression and clinicopathological features of EC patients was analyzed. After transfected with sh-LINC01220 and pcDNA-MAPK11 in EC cells, proliferative, colony formation abilities and apoptosis were determined by CCK-8, colony formation assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was conducted to determine the regulatory role of LINC01220 on MAPK11.ResultsTCGA data showed LINC01220 expression is markedly higher in EC tissues than that of paracancerous tissues, which was consistent with out detection in EC patients of our hospital. LINC01220 expression was positively correlated to pathological grade and FIGO stage of EC patients. After knockdown of LINC01220 in EC cells, proliferative and colony formation abilities decreased, whereas apoptotic rate increased. Cor function analysis revealed the positive correlation between LINC01220 and MAPK11 in EC. MAPK11 expression was regulated by LINC01220 in EC cells. Overexpression of MAPK11 can reverse the tumor suppressing effect of LINC01220 on EC.ConclusionsLINC01220 promotes EC development by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of EC cells through upregulating MAPK11."

This can be achieved with a positron emission tomography (PET) reporter gene strategy. Here we report the development of a PET reporter gene system using the PKM2 gene with its associated radiotracer [18F]DASA-23. The PKM2 reporter gene was delivered to the brains of mice by adeno-associated virus (AAV9) via stereotactic injection. Serial PET imaging was carried out over 8 wk to assess PKM2 expression. After 8 wk, the brains were excised for further mRNA and protein analysis. PET imaging at 8 wk post-AAV delivery showed an increase in [18F]DASA-23 brain uptake in the transduced site of mice injected with the AAV mice over all controls.

We found that, although Arabidopsis CAP1 is distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm, its loss of function has differential effects on the actin cytoskeleton within different regions of the pollen tube. Specifically, the F-actin level increases in the shank but decreases in the apical region of cap1 pollen tubes. The reduction in apical F-actin results mainly from impaired polymerization of membrane-originated actin within cap1 pollen tubes. The actin nucleotide exchange activity of CAP1 is involved in apical actin polymerization. CAP1 acts synergistically with pollen ADF and profilin to promote actin turnover in vitro, and it can overcome the inhibitory effects of ADF and synergize with profilin to promote actin nucleotide exchange. Consistent with its role as a shuttle molecule between ADF and profilin, the cytosolic concentration of CAP1 is much lower than that of ADF and profilin in pollen. Thus, CAP1 synergizes with ADF and profilin to drive actin turnover in pollen and promote apical actin polymerization in pollen tubes in a manner that involves its actin nucleotide exchange activity.",A scarcity mindset alters neural processing underlying consumer decision making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123150,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 12,"Not having enough of what one needs has long been shown to have detrimental consequences for decision making. Recent work suggests that the experience of insufficient resources can create a ""scarcity"" mindset; increasing attention toward the scarce resource itself, but at the cost of attention for unrelated aspects. To investigate the effects of a scarcity mindset on consumer choice behavior, as well as its underlying neural mechanisms, we used an experimental manipulation to induce both a scarcity and an abundance mindset within participants and examined the effects of both mindsets on participants' willingness to pay for familiar food items while being scanned using fMRI. Results demonstrated that a scarcity mindset affects neural mechanisms related to consumer decision making. When in a scarcity mindset compared with an abundance mindset, participants had increased activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a region often implicated in valuation processes. Moreover, again compared with abundance, a scarcity mindset decreased activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area well known for its role in goal-directed choice. This effect was predominant in the group of participants who experienced scarcity following abundance, suggesting that the effects of scarcity are largest when they are compared with previous situations when resources were plentiful. More broadly, these data suggest a potential neural locus for a scarcity mindset and demonstrate how these changes in brain activity might underlie goal-directed decision making.",An activatable PET imaging radioprobe is a dynamic reporter of myeloperoxidase activity in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123149,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 12,"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a critical proinflammatory enzyme implicated in cardiovascular, neurological, and rheumatological diseases. Emerging therapies targeting inflammation have raised interest in tracking MPO activity in patients. We describe 18F-MAPP, an activatable MPO activity radioprobe for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The activated radioprobe binds to proteins and accumulates at sites of MPO activity. The radioprobe 18F-MAPP has a short blood half-life, remains stable in plasma, does not demonstrate cytotoxicity, and crosses the intact blood-brain barrier. The 18F-MAPP imaging detected sites of elevated MPO activity in living mice embedded with human MPO and in mice induced with chemical inflammation or myocardial infarction. The 18F-MAPP PET imaging noninvasively differentiated varying amounts of MPO activity, competitive inhibition, and MPO deficiency in living animals, confirming specificity and showing that the radioprobe can quantify changes in in vivo MPO activity. The radiosynthesis has been optimized and automated, an important step in translation. These data indicate that 18F-MAPP is a promising translational candidate to noninvasively monitor MPO activity and inflammation in patients.",Coupling of COPII vesicle trafficking to nutrient availability by the IRE1α-XBP1s axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123148,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 12,"The cytoplasmic coat protein complex-II (COPII) is evolutionarily conserved machinery that is essential for efficient trafficking of protein and lipid cargos. How the COPII machinery is regulated to meet the metabolic demand in response to alterations of the nutritional state remains largely unexplored, however. Here, we show that dynamic changes of COPII vesicle trafficking parallel the activation of transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s), a critical transcription factor in handling cellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in both live cells and mouse livers upon physiological fluctuations of nutrient availability. Using live-cell imaging approaches, we demonstrate that XBP1s is sufficient to promote COPII-dependent trafficking, mediating the nutrient stimulatory effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-sequencing analyses reveal that nutritional signals induce dynamic XBP1s occupancy of promoters of COPII traffic-related genes, thereby driving the COPII-mediated trafficking process. Liver-specific disruption of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α)-XBP1s signaling branch results in diminished COPII vesicle trafficking. Reactivation of XBP1s in mice lacking hepatic IRE1α restores COPII-mediated lipoprotein secretion and reverses the fatty liver and hypolipidemia phenotypes. Thus, our results demonstrate a previously unappreciated mechanism in the metabolic control of liver protein and lipid trafficking: The IRE1α-XBP1s axis functions as a nutrient-sensing regulatory nexus that integrates nutritional states and the COPII vesicle trafficking.",Implantable multireservoir device with stimulus-responsive membrane for on-demand and pulsatile delivery of growth hormone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123147,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 12,"Implantable devices for on-demand and pulsatile drug delivery have attracted considerable attention; however, many devices in clinical use are embedded with the electronic units and battery inside, hence making them large and heavy for implantation. Therefore, we propose an implantable device with multiple drug reservoirs capped with a stimulus-responsive membrane (SRM) for on-demand and pulsatile drug delivery. The SRM is made of thermosensitive POSS(MEO2MA-co-OEGMA) and photothermal nanoparticles of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and each of the drug reservoirs is filled with the same amount of human growth hormone (hGH). Therefore, with noninvasive near-infrared (NIR) irradiation from the outside skin, the rGO nanoparticles generate heat to rupture the SRM in the implanted device, which can open a single selected drug reservoir to release hGH. Therefore, the device herein is shown to release hGH reproducibly only at the times of NIR irradiation without drug leakage during no irradiation. When implanted in rats with growth hormone deficiency and irradiated with an NIR light from the outside skin, the device exhibits profiles of hGH and IGF1 plasma concentrations, as well as body weight change, similar to those in animals treated with conventional s.c. hGH injections."

The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of fish at the scale of the entire basin.",Role of AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump in drug-resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123134,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 31,"Drug-resistance dissemination by horizontal gene transfer remains poorly understood at the cellular scale. Using live-cell microscopy, we reveal the dynamics of resistance acquisition by transfer of the Escherichia coli fertility factor-conjugation plasmid encoding the tetracycline-efflux pump TetA. The entry of the single-stranded DNA plasmid into the recipient cell is rapidly followed by complementary-strand synthesis, plasmid-gene expression, and production of TetA. In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, resistance acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump, because it reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer in the presence of antibiotics with other modes of action.",Anti-Markovnikov alcohols via epoxide hydrogenation through cooperative catalysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123133,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 31,"The opening of epoxides typically requires electrophilic activation, and subsequent nucleophilic (SN2) attack on the less substituted carbon leads to alcohols with Markovnikov regioselectivity.

The titanocene enforces the anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity by forming the more highly substituted radical.

Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane-reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities.

We sampled a range of EpoR geometries by varying intermonomer angle and distance, corroborated by several ligand-EpoR complex crystal structures.

Over one generation, we observed selection both for and against variants in specific genomic regions; known variants were more likely to be transmitted than previously unknown variants. However, new heteroplasmies were more likely to match the nuclear genetic ancestry as opposed to the ancestry of the mitochondrial genome on which the mutations occurred, validating our findings in 40,325 individuals. Thus, human mtDNA at the population level is shaped by selective forces within the female germ line under nuclear genetic control, which ensures consistency between the two independent genetic lineages.",Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123109,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 31,"Although spontaneous protein crystallization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden crystals (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma.

Here, we found that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-releasing neurons of the mouse nucleus incertus (NI) selectively inhibit somatostatin-positive interneurons in the hippocampus, both monosynaptically and indirectly through the inhibition of their subcortical excitatory inputs. We demonstrated that NI GABAergic neurons receive monosynaptic inputs from brain areas processing important environmental information, and their hippocampal projections are strongly activated by salient environmental inputs in vivo. Optogenetic manipulations of NI GABAergic neurons can shift hippocampal network state and bidirectionally modify the strength of contextual fear memory formation. Our results indicate that brainstem NI GABAergic cells are essential for controlling contextual memories.",Proteomic analysis of vocal fold fibroblasts exposed to cigarette smoke extract: Exploring the pathophysiology of Reinke's edema.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123107,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2019 05 24,"Reinke's edema is a smoking-associated, benign, mostly bilateral lesion of the vocal folds leading to difficulties in breathing and voice problems. Pronounced histological changes such as damaged microvessels or immune cell infiltration have been described in the vocal fold connective tissue, the lamina propria. Thus, vocal fold fibroblasts, the main cell type of the lamina propria, have been postulated to play a critical role in disease mediation. Yet information about the pathophysiology is still scarce and treatment is only surgical, i.e. symptomatic. To explore the pathophysiology of Reinke's edema, we exposed near-primary human vocal fold fibroblasts to medium conditioned with cigarette smoke extract for 24 hours as well as 4 days followed by quantitative mass spectrometry.Proteomic analyses after 24 hours revealed that cigarette smoke increased proteins previously described to be involved in oxidative stress responses in other contexts. Correspondingly, gene sets linked to metabolism of xenobiotics and reactive oxygen species were significantly enriched among cigarette smoke-induced proteins. Among the proteins most downregulated by cigarette smoke, we identified fibrillar collagens COL1A1 and COL1A2; this reduction was validated by complementary methods. Further, we found a significant increase of UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase, generating a building block for biosynthesis of hyaluronan, another crucial component of the vocal fold lamina propria. In line with this result, hyaluronan levels were significantly increased due to cigarette smoke exposure. Long term treatment of 4 days did not lead to significant changes.The current findings corroborate previous studies but also reveal new insights in possible disease mechanisms of Reinke's edema. We postulate that changes in the composition of the vocal folds' extracellular matrix -reduction of collagen fibrils, increase of hyaluronan- may lead to the clinical findings. This might ease the identification of better, disease-specific treatment options."

The energy costs of root growth are particularly high in both dry and compacted soil, due to high soil penetration resistance. Consequently, more carbon must be allocated from aboveground plant tissue to roots, which limits crop productivity. In this study, we tested the utility of root cortical cell diameter as a potential selection target to reduce the energy costs of root growth. Isothermal calorimetry was adopted for in situ quantification of the energy costs of root growth of 16 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes under three levels of penetration resistance. We show that cortical cell diameter is a pivotal and heritable trait, which is strongly related to the energy costs of root growth. Genotypic diversity was found for cortical cell diameter and the energy costs of root growth. A large root cortical cell diameter correlated with reduced energy costs of root growth, particularly under high soil penetration resistance. Moreover, significant correlations were found between the ability to radially enlarge cortical cells upon greater penetration resistance (i.e., phenotypic plasticity) and the responsiveness in the energy costs of root growth. A higher degree of phenotypic plasticity in cortical cell diameter was associated with reduced energy costs of root growth as soil penetration resistance increased. We therefore suggest that genotypic diversity and phenotypic plasticity in cortical cell diameter should be harnessed to adapt crops to dry and compacted soils.",NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 have functionally diverged and differentially induce drought and heat stress-specific genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123093,Plant physiology,2019 05 24,"Functional diversification of transcription factors allows the precise regulation of transcriptomic changes under different environmental conditions. The NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) transcription factor comprises three subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC, and is broadly diversified in plant species, while Humans (Homo sapiens) have one protein for each subunit. However, there much remains to be learned about the diversified functions of each subunit in plants. Here, we found that NF-YB2 and NF-YB3, which have the greatest sequence similarity to each other among NF-YB family proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), are functionally diversified and specifically activate dehydration-inducible and heat-inducible genes, according to environmental conditions. Overexpression of NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 specifically enhanced drought and heat stress tolerance, respectively, and each single knockout mutant showed adverse stress-sensitive phenotypes. Transcriptomic analyses confirmed that overexpression of NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 largely affected the transcriptomic changes under dehydration and heat stress conditions, respectively. The DNA-binding profiles of each protein in planta also suggested that dehydration and heat stress increased the DNA-binding activity of NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 to dehydration-inducible and heat stress-inducible target genes, respectively. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the NF-YB proteins of angiosperm plants belong to divergent NF-YB2 and NF-YB3 subgroups. These results demonstrate the functional diversification of NF-Y through evolutionary processes and how plants adapt to various abiotic stresses under fluctuating environments.",GATA and PIF transcription factors regulate light-induced vindoline biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123092,Plant physiology,2019 05 24,"Catharanthus roseus is the exclusive source of an array of terpenoid indole alkaloids including the anticancer drugs vincristine and vinblastine, derived from the coupling of catharanthine and vindoline. Leaf-synthesized vindoline is regulated by light. A seven-step enzymatic process is involved in the sequential conversion of tabersonine to vindoline; however, the regulatory mechanism controlling expression of genes encoding these enzymes has not been elucidated. Here, we identified CrGATA1, an LLM-domain GATA transcription factor that regulates light-induced vindoline biosynthesis in C. roseus seedlings. Expression of CrGATA1 and the vindoline pathway genes T16H2, T3O, T3R, D4H, and DAT was significantly induced by light. In addition, CrGATA1 activated the promoters of five light-responsive vindoline pathway genes in plant cells. Two GATC-motifs in the D4H promoter were critical for CrGATA1-mediated transactivation. Transient overexpression of CrGATA1 in C. roseus seedlings resulted in upregulation of vindoline pathway genes and increased vindoline accumulation. Conversely, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of CrGATA1 in young C. roseus leaves significantly repressed key vindoline pathway genes and reduced vindoline accumulation. Furthermore, we showed that a C. roseus Phytochrome Interacting Factor, CrPIF1, is a repressor of CrGATA1 and vindoline biosynthesis. Transient overexpression or VIGS of CrPIF1 in C. roseus seedlings altered CrGATA1 and vindoline pathway gene expression in the dark. CrPIF1 repressed CrGATA1 and DAT promoter activity by binding to G/E-box/PBE elements. Our findings reveal a regulatory module involving PIF-GATA that governs light-mediated biosynthesis of specialized metabolites.",Improving the improvisational pelvic circumferential compression technique for open-book pelvic fractures using a simulation model and a sphygmomanometer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123090,Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps,2019 05 24,"Open-book pelvic fractures are associated with significant mortality.

Root systems are one of the most important but poorly understood aspects of plants, largely due to the three-dimensional, dynamic, and multiscale phenotyping challenge they pose. A critical gap in our knowledge is how root systems build in complexity from a single primary root to a network of thousands of roots that collectively compete for ephemeral and heterogeneous soil resources. We used time-lapse 3D imaging and mathematical modelling to assess root system architectures (RSAs) of two maize inbred genotypes and their hybrid as they grew in complexity from few to many roots. Genetically driven differences in root branching zone size and lateral branching densities along a single root, combined with differences in peak growth rate and the relative allocation of carbon resources to new versus existing roots, manifest as sharply distinct global RSAs over time. 3D imaging of mature field-grown root crowns showed that several genetic differences in seedling architectures could persist throughout development and across environments. The work connects individual and system-wide scales of root growth dynamics that could eventually predict genetic variation for complex RSAs and their functions.",Differential activity of ATR and WEE1 inhibitors in a highly sensitive subpopulation of DLBCL linked to replication stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123088,Cancer research,2019 05 24,"DNA damage checkpoint kinases ATR and WEE1 are among key regulators of DNA damage response pathways protecting cells from replication stress, a hallmark of cancer that has potential to be exploited for therapeutic use. ATR and WEE1 inhibitors are in early clinical trials and success will require greater understanding of both their mechanism of action and biomarkers for patient selection. Here, we report selective anti-tumor activity of ATR and WEE1 inhibitors in a subset of non-Germinal Centre B-Cell (GCB) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, characterized by high MYC protein expression and CDKN2A/B deletion. Activity correlated with the induction of replication stress, indicated by increased origin firing and retardation of replication fork progression. However, ATR and WEE1 inhibitors caused different amounts of DNA damage and cell death in distinct phases of the cell cycle, underlying the increased potency observed with WEE1 inhibition. ATR inhibition caused DNA damage to manifest as 53BP1 nuclear bodies in daughter G1 cells leading to G1 arrest, whereas WEE1 inhibition caused DNA damage and arrest in S phase, leading to earlier onset apoptosis. In vivo xenograft DLBCL models confirmed differences in single agent anti-tumor activity, but also showed potential for effective ATR inhibitor combinations. Importantly, insights into the different inhibitor mechanisms may guide differentiated clinical development strategies aimed at exploiting specific vulnerabilities of tumor cells while maximizing therapeutic index. Our data therefore highlight clinical development opportunities for both ATR and WEE1 inhibitors in non-GCB DLBCL subtypes that represent an area of unmet clinical need.","Asporin Restricts Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Differentiation, Alters the Tumor Microenvironment, and Drives Metastatic Progression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123087,Cancer research,2019 05 24,"Tumor progression to metastasis is not cancer cell autonomous, but rather involves the interplay of multiple cell types within the tumor microenvironment. Here we identify Asporin (ASPN) as a novel, secreted mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) factor in the tumor microenvironment that regulates metastatic development. MSCs expressed high levels of ASPN, which decreased following lineage differentiation. ASPN loss impaired MSC self-renewal and promoted terminal cell differentiation. Mechanistically, secreted ASPN bound to BMP-4 and restricted BMP-4-induced MSC differentiation prior to lineage commitment. ASPN expression was distinctly conserved between MSC and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). ASPN expression in the tumor microenvironment broadly impacted multiple cell types. Prostate tumor allografts in ASPN-null mice had a reduced number of tumor-associated MSCs, fewer cancer stem cells, decreased tumor vasculature, and an increased percentage of infiltrating CD8+ T cells. ASPN-null mice also demonstrated a significant reduction in lung metastases compared to wild type mice. These data establish a role for ASPN as a critical MSC factor that extensively effects the tumor microenvironment and induces metastatic progression.",The primary care and other health system use of home care patients: a retrospective cohort analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123086,CMAJ open,2019 06 13,Robust and integrated primary care and home care are core components of effective chronic disease management in the community.

However, the detailed mechanisms of their regulation remain unsolved. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL was required for Tfh cell development and function upon acute virus infection or antigen immunization. VHL acted through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-dependent glycolysis pathway to positively regulate early Tfh cell initiation. The enhanced glycolytic activity due to VHL deficiency was involved in the epigenetic regulation of ICOS expression, a critical molecule for Tfh development. By using an RNA interference screen, we identified the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH as the key target for the reduced ICOS expression via m6A modification. Our results thus demonstrated that the VHL-HIF-1α axis played an important role during the initiation of Tfh cell development through glycolytic-epigenetic reprogramming.",CD81 is a novel immunotherapeutic target for B cell lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123084,The Journal of experimental medicine,2019 05 24,"The tetraspanin CD81 was initially discovered by screening mAbs elicited against a human B cell lymphoma for their direct antiproliferative effects. We now show that 5A6, one of the mAbs that target CD81, has therapeutic potential. This antibody inhibits the growth of B cell lymphoma in a xenograft model as effectively as rituximab, which is a standard treatment for B cell lymphoma. Importantly, unlike rituximab, which depletes normal as well as malignant B cells, 5A6 selectively kills human lymphoma cells from fresh biopsy specimens while sparing the normal lymphoid cells in the tumor microenvironment. The 5A6 antibody showed a good safety profile when administered to a mouse transgenic for human CD81. Taken together, these data provide the rationale for the development of the 5A6 mAb and its humanized derivatives as a novel treatment against B cell lymphoma."

Beige adipocytes depend on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to drive thermogenesis. The transcriptional mechanisms that promote remodeling in adipose tissue during the cold are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that the transcriptional coregulator transducin-like enhancer of split 3 (TLE3) inhibits mitochondrial gene expression in beige adipocytes. Conditional deletion of TLE3 in adipocytes promotes mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and increases energy expenditure, thereby improving glucose control. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, we found that TLE3 occupies distal enhancers in proximity to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes and that many of these binding sites are also enriched for early B-cell factor (EBF) transcription factors. TLE3 interacts with EBF2 and blocks its ability to promote the thermogenic transcriptional program. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that TLE3 regulates thermogenic gene expression in beige adipocytes through inhibition of EBF2 transcriptional activity.

This process involves factors that operate in two different subcellular compartments: the nuage/Yb body and mitochondria. How these two sites communicate to achieve accurate substrate selection and efficient processing remains unclear. Here, we investigate a previously uncharacterized piRNA biogenesis factor, Daedalus (Daed), that is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Daed is essential for Zucchini-mediated piRNA production and the correct localization of the indispensable piRNA biogenesis factor Armitage (Armi). We found that Gasz and Daed interact with each other and likely provide a mitochondrial ""anchoring platform"" to ensure that Armi is held in place, proximal to Zucchini, during piRNA processing. Our data suggest that Armi initially identifies piRNA precursors in nuage/Yb bodies in a manner that depends on Piwi and then moves to mitochondria to present precursors to the mitochondrial biogenesis machinery.

Although the role of lineage-specific transcription regulators has been studied extensively, their functional integration with chromatin remodelers, one of the key enzymatic machineries that control chromatin accessibility, remains ill-defined. Here we investigate the role of Mi-2β, a SNF-2-like nucleosome remodeler and key component of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex in early B cells. Inactivation of Mi-2β arrested differentiation at the large pre-B-cell stage and caused derepression of cell adhesion and cell migration signaling factors by increasing chromatin access at poised enhancers and chromosome architectural elements. Mi-2β also supported IL-7R signaling, survival, and proliferation by repressing negative effectors of this pathway. Importantly, overexpression of Bcl2, a mitochondrial prosurvival gene and target of IL-7R signaling, partly rescued the differentiation block caused by Mi-2β loss. Mi-2β stably associated with chromatin sites that harbor binding motifs for IKAROS and EBF1 and physically associated with these transcription factors both on and off chromatin. Notably, Mi-2β shared loss-of-function cellular and molecular phenotypes with IKAROS and EBF1, albeit in a distinct fashion. Thus, the nucleosome remodeler Mi-2β promotes pre-B-cell differentiation by providing repression capabilities to distinct lineage-specific transcription factor-based regulatory networks."

However, these therapies rely on a patient's own a priori primed tumor-specific T cells, limiting their efficacy to a subset of patients. Because checkpoint blockade is most effective in patients with inflamed or 'hot' tumors, a priority in the field is learning how to 'turn cold tumors hot'. Inflammation is generally initiated by innate immune cells which receive signals through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) - a diverse family of receptors that sense conserved molecular patterns on pathogens, alarming the immune system of an invading microbe. Their immunostimulatory properties can reprogram the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and activate antigen presenting cells (APC) to present tumors antigens, driving de-novo tumor-specific T cell responses. These features, among others, make PRR-targeting therapies an attractive strategy in immuno-oncology. Here, we discuss mechanisms of PRR activation, highlighting ongoing clinical trials and recent pre-clinical advances focused on therapeutically targeting PRRs to treat cancer.",Default activation and nuclear translocation of the plant cellular energy sensor SnRK1 regulate metabolic stress responses and development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123051,The Plant cell,2019 06 11,"Energy homeostasis is vital to all living organisms and in eukaryotic cells is controlled by fuel gauging protein kinases: AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) in mammals, Sucrose Non-Fermenting1 (SNF1) in yeast, and SnRK1 (SNF1-related kinase1) in plants. These kinases are conserved in structure and function and according to the current paradigm operate as heterotrimeric complexes of catalytic α and regulatory β and γ subunits, responding to low cellular nucleotide charge. Our analyses indicate that the plant SnRK1 catalytic α subunit has regulatory subunit-independent activity, consistent with default activation (and active repression), a strategy that is more generally used by plants. Low energy stress (darkness, inhibition of photosynthesis, hypoxia) also triggers SnRK1α nuclear translocation, controlling induced but not repressed target gene expression to replenish cellular energy crucial for plant survival. The myristoylated and membrane-associated regulatory β subunits restrict nuclear localization and inhibit target gene induction. Transgenic plants with forced SnRK1α subunit localization are affected in metabolic stress responses, but also reveal novel key functions for nuclear SnRK1 in leaf and root growth and development.

ABI5 is precisely modulated at the posttranslational level; however, the transcriptional regulation mechanisms underlying ABI5 and its interacting transcription factors remain largely unknown. Here, INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1) was found to physically associate with ABI5. ICE1 negatively regulates ABA responses during seed germination and directly suppresses ABA-responsive LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT6 (EM6) and EM1. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the ABA-hypersensitive phenotype of the ice1 mutant requires ABI5. Mechanistic investigation revealed that ICE1 interferes with the transcriptional activity of ABI5 to mediate downstream regulons. Significantly, ICE1 also interacts with DELLA proteins, which stimulate ABI5 in ABA signaling. Disruption of ICE1 partially restores the ABA-hyposensitive phenotype of the gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 rgl2-1 mutant (della), showing that ICE1 functions antagonistically with DELLA in ABA signaling. Consistently, DELLA proteins repress ICE1's transcriptional function and the antagonistic effect of ICE1 on ABI5. Collectively, our study demonstrates that ICE1 antagonizes ABI5 and DELLA to maintain appropriate ABA signaling during seed germination and provides a mechanistic understanding of how ABA signaling is fine-tuned by the transcriptional complex involving ABI5 and its interacting partners.",Arabidopsis ENDOMEMBRANE PROTEIN 12 contributes to the endoplasmic reticulum stress response by regulating K/HDEL receptor trafficking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123049,The Plant cell,2019 06 08,"ENDOMEMBRANE PROTEIN 70 (EMP70) proteins constitute a 12-member superfamily in Arabidopsis thaliana, and are the most abundant protein species in plant Golgi proteomes.

Interestingly, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is constitutively activated in the knockout mutant emp12-1 under normal growth conditions, suggesting that the activation is a result of insufficient chaperones in the ER to aid protein folding. Indeed, we have further shown that BiP is secreted into the apoplast in emp12-1, while the K/HDEL receptor ERD2a, which regulates BiP trafficking, is exclusively localized in the ER in emp12-1, instead of its known ER-Golgi dual-localization. Given an enhanced retrograde transport of ERD2a, along with less dimerized receptor formed in the absence of EMP12, ERD2a may be prematurely returned to the ER without its bound ligands. Therefore, we propose that EMP12 may act as a novel regulator of the K/HDEL receptor to ensure an effective retrograde transport of K/HDEL ligands.",Ribonucleoprotein capture by in vivo expression of a designer pentatricopeptide repeat protein in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123048,The Plant cell,2019 05 24,"Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins bind RNA via a mechanism that facilitates the customization of sequence specificity. However, natural PPR proteins have irregular features that limit the degree to which their specificity can be predicted and customized. We demonstrate here that artificial PPR proteins built from consensus PPR motifs selectively bind the intended RNA in vivo, and we use this property to develop a new tool for ribonucleoprotein characterization. We show by RNA coimmunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-seq) that artificial PPR proteins designed to bind the Arabidopsis chloroplast psbA mRNA bind with high specificity to psbA mRNA in vivo. Analysis of coimmunoprecipitating proteins by mass spectrometry showed the psbA translational activator HCF173 and two RNA-binding proteins of unknown function (CP33C and SRRP1) to be highly enriched. RIP-seq showed that these proteins are bound primarily to psbA RNA in vivo, and precise mapping of the HCF173 and CP33C binding sites placed them in different locations on psbA mRNA. These results demonstrate that artificial PPR proteins can be tailored to bind specific endogenous RNAs in vivo, add to the toolkit for characterizing native ribonucleoproteins, and open the door to other applications that rely on the ability to target a protein to a specified RNA sequence.",Danger-Associated Peptides Interact with PIN-Dependent Local Auxin Distribution to Inhibit Root Growth in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123046,The Plant cell,2019 05 24,"Plant elicitor peptides (Peps) are damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are perceived by the receptor-like kinases, PEPR1 and PEPR2, to enhance innate immunity and induce root growth inhibition in Arabidopsis. We report here that Arabidopsis Pep1 inhibited root growth in a PEPR2-dependent manner, which was accompanied by swelling epidermal and cortex cells and root hair formation in the transition zone (TZ). Interestingly, these Pep1-induced changes were mimicked by exogenous application of auxin and were suppressed in auxin perception mutants tir1 or tir1 afb1 afb2. Further analysis showed that Pep1-induced auxin accumulation in the TZ region preceded cell expansion in roots. As local auxin distribution depends on PIN-type auxin transporters, we examined Pep1-PEPR-induced root growth inhibition in several pin mutants and found that pin2 was more sensitive but pin3 was less sensitive to Pep1. The pin2 pin3 double mutant was similarly sensitive to Pep1 treatment as wild-type plants. Furthermore, we found that Pep1 reduced the abundance of PIN2 in plasma membrane through activating endocytosis pathway while increasing PIN3 expression in TZ region, leading to changes in local auxin distribution and root growth inhibition. These results formulate a unique model for Pep-PEPR signaling to crosstalk with auxin accumulation pattern in controlling of cell expansion and differentiation in the roots during immune responses.",Inferring the Nature of Missing Heritability in Human Traits Using Data from the GWAS Catalog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123044,Genetics,2019 05 24,"Thousands of genes responsible for many diseases and other common traits in humans have been detected by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in the last decade. However, candidate causal variants found so far usually explain only a small fraction of the heritability estimated by family data. The most common explanation for this observation is that the missing heritability corresponds to variants, either rare or common, with very small effect, which pass undetected due to a lack of statistical power. We carried out a meta-analysis using data from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog in order to explore the observed distribution of locus effects for a set of 42 complex traits and to quantify their contribution to narrow-sense heritability. With the data at hand we were able to predict the expected distribution of locus effects for 16 traits and diseases, their expected contribution to heritability, and the missing number of loci yet to be discovered to fully explain the familial heritability estimates. Our results indicate that, for six out of the 16 traits, the additive contribution of a great number of loci is unable to explain the familial (broad-sense) heritability, suggesting that the gap between GWAS and familial estimates of heritability may not ever be closed for these traits. In contrast, for the other ten traits, the additive contribution of hundreds or thousands of loci yet to be found could potentially explain the familial heritability estimates, if this were the case. Computer simulations are used to illustrate the possible contribution from non-additive genetic effects to the gap between GWAS and familial estimates of heritability.",Tolerance of DNA Replication Stress Is Promoted by Fumarate Through Modulation of Histone Demethylation and Enhancement of Replicative Intermediate Processing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123043,Genetics,2019 05 24,"Fumarase is a well-characterized TCA cycle enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fumarate to malate. In mammals, fumarase acts as a tumor suppressor, and loss-of-function mutations in the FH gene in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer result in the accumulation of intracellular fumarate, an inhibitor of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. Fumarase promotes DNA repair by non-homologous end joining in mammalian cells through interaction with the histone variant H2A.Z, and inhibition of KDM2B, a H3 K36-specific histone demethylase. Here, we report that Saccharomyces cerevisiae fumarase, Fum1p, acts as a response factor during DNA replication stress, and fumarate enhances survival of yeast lacking Htz1p (H2A.Z in mammals). We observed that exposure to DNA replication stress led to upregulation as well as nuclear enrichment of Fum1p, and raising levels of fumarate in cells via deletion of FUM1 or addition of exogenous fumarate suppressed the sensitivity to DNA replication stress of htz1Δ mutants. This suppression was independent of modulating nucleotide pool levels. Rather, our results are consistent with fumarate conferring resistance to DNA replication stress in htz1Δ mutants by inhibiting the H3 K4-specific histone demethylase Jhd2p, and increasing H3 K4 methylation. Although the timing of checkpoint activation and deactivation remained largely unaffected by fumarate, sensors and mediators of the DNA replication checkpoint were required for fumarate-dependent resistance to replication stress in the htz1Δ mutants. Together, our findings imply metabolic enzymes and metabolites aid in processing replicative intermediates by affecting chromatin modification states, thereby promoting genome integrity.",Different Evolutionary Trajectories of Two Insect-Specific Paralogous Proteins Involved in Stabilizing Muscle Myofibrils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123042,Genetics,2019 05 24,"Alp/Enigma family members have a unique PDZ domain followed by zero to four LIM domains and are essential for myofibril assembly across all species analyzed so far. Drosophila melanogaster has three Alp/Enigma family members, Zasp52, Zasp66, and Zasp67. Ortholog search and phylogenetic tree analysis suggest that Zasp genes have a common ancestor and that Zasp66 and Zasp67 arose by duplication in insects. While Zasp66 has a conserved domain structure across orthologs, Zasp67 domains and lengths are highly variable. In flies, Zasp67 appears to be expressed only in indirect flight muscles, where it colocalizes with Zasp52 at Z-discs. We generated a CRISPR null mutant of Zasp67, which is viable but flightless. We can rescue all phenotypes by re-expressing a Zasp67 transgene at endogenous levels. Zasp67 mutants show extended and broken Z-discs in adult flies, indicating that the protein helps stabilize the highly regular myofibrils of indirect flight muscles. In contrast, a Zasp66 CRISPR null mutant has limited viability, but only mild indirect flight muscle defects illustrating the diverging evolutionary paths these two paralogous genes have taken since they arose by duplication."

A subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, however, is characterized by activating mutations in MYD88/CD79B. We investigated whether MYD88/CD79B mutations could improve the classification and prognostication of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In 250 primary diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, MYD88/CD79B mutations were identified by allele-specific PCR or next-generation-sequencing, MYC/BCL2/BCL6 rearrangements were analyzed by FISH, and EBV was studied by EBER-ISH. Associations of molecular features with clinicopathologic characteristics, outcome, and prognosis according to International Prognostic Index were investigated. MYD88 and CD79B mutations were identified in 29.6% and 12.3%, , MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements in 10.6%, 13.6%, and 20.3%, and EBV in 11.7% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, respectively. Prominent mutual exclusivity between EBV positivity, rearrangements, and MYD88/CD79B mutations established the value of molecular markers for recognition of biologically distinct diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subtypes. MYD88-mutated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma had a significantly inferior 5-year overall survival than wild-type MYD88 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (log-rank;P=0.019). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without any of the studied aberrations had superior overall survival compared to cases carrying ≥1 aberrancy (log-rank;P=0.010). MYD88 mutations retained their adverse prognostic impact upon adjustment for other genetic and clinical variables by multivariable analysis and improved the prognostic performance of the International Prognostic Index. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of defining MYD88-mutated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as a distinct molecular subtype with adverse prognosis. Our data call for sequence analysis of MYD88 in routine diagnostics of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to optimize classification and prognostication, and to guide the development of improved treatment strategies.",Molecular minimal residual disease negativity and decreased stem cell mobilization potential predict excellent outcome after autologous transplant in NPM1 mutant acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123030,Haematologica,2019 05 24,,High activation of STAT5A drives peripheral T-cell lymphoma and leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123029,Haematologica,2019 05 24,"Recurrent gain-of-function mutations in the transcription factors STAT5A and much more in STAT5B were found in hematopoietic malignancies with the highest proportion in mature T- and natural killer-cell neoplasms (peripheral T-cell lymphoma). No targeted therapy exists for these heterogeneous and often aggressive diseases. Given the shortage of models for peripheral T-cell lymphoma, we mimicked graded STAT5A or STAT5B activity by expressing hyperactive Stat5a or STAT5B variants at low or high levels in the hematopoietic system of transgenic mice. Only high activity levels developed a lethal disease resembling human peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Neoplasia displayed massive expansion of CD8 + T-cells and destructive organ-infiltration. T-cells were cytokine-hypersensitive with activated memory CD8+ T-lymphocyte characteristics. Histopathology analysis and mRNA expression profiles revealed close correlation with distinct human peripheral T-cell lymphoma subtypes. Pronounced STAT5 expression and activity in patient samples of different subsets underlines the relevance of JAK/STAT as therapeutic target. JAK inhibitors or a selective STAT5 SH2 domain inhibitor induced cell death and Ruxolitinib blocked T-cell neoplasia in vivo We conclude that enhanced STAT5A or STAT5B action both drive peripheral T-cell lymphoma development, defining both STAT5 molecules as targets for therapeutic intervention.",The novel Isatin analog KS99 targets stemness markers in acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123028,Haematologica,2019 05 24,"Leukemic stem cells are multipotent, self-renewing, highly proliferative cells that can withstand drug treatments. Although presently available treatments potentially destroy blast cells, they fail to eradicate leukemic progenitor cells completely. Aldehyde dehydrogenase and STAT3 are frequently up-regulated in pre-leukemic stem cells as well as in acute myeloid leukemia expressing CD34+CD38- phenotype. The Isatin analog, KS99 has shown anticancer activity against multiple myeloma which may, in part, be mediated by inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase activation. Here we demonstrate that KS99 selectively targets leukemic stem cells with high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3. KS99 targeted cells coexpressing CD34, CD38, CD123, TIM-3, or CD96 immunophenotypes in acute myeloid leukemia, alone or in combination with the standard therapeutic agent cytarabine. Acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplastic-related changes was more sensitive than De Novo acute myeloid leukemia with or without NPM1 mutation. KS99 treatment reduced the clonogenicity of primary human acute myeloid leukemia cells as compared to normal cord blood mononuclear cells. Down-regulation of phosphorylated Bruton's tyrosine kinase, STAT3, and aldehyde dehydrogenase was observed, suggesting interaction with KS99 as predicated through docking. KS99 with or without cytarabine showed in vivo preclinical efficacy in human and mouse acute myeloid leukemia animal models and prolonged the survival. KS99 was well tolerated with an overall negligible adverse effect. In conclusion, KS99 inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and STAT3 activity and causes cell death leukemic stem cells, but not normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.",Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2b regulates neutrophil versus macrophage fate during zebrafish definitive myelopoiesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123027,Haematologica,2019 05 24,"Proper cell fate choice of neutrophil-macrophage progenitor is essential for adequate myeloid sub-populations during embryonic development and in adulthood. The network governing neutrophil-macrophage progenitor cell fate is composed of several key determinants such as myeloid master regulators CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPα) and spleen focus forming virus proviral integration oncogene (PU.1). Nevertheless, more regulators remain to be identified and characterized. To ensure balanced commitment of neutrophil-macrophage progenitor toward each lineage, the interplay among these determinants is not only synergistic, but also antagonistic. Depletion of Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2b (Irf2bp2b), a well known negative transcription regulator, results in a bias in neutrophil-macrophage progenitor cell fate choice which favors macrophages at the expense of neutrophils during the zebrafish definitive myelopoiesis stage in deficient embryos. Mechanistic studies indicate that Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2b acts as a downstream target of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha, to repress spleen focus forming virus proviral integration oncogene expression, and that SUMOylation confers the repressive function of Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2b. Thus, Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2b is a novel determinant in the cell fate choice of neutrophil-macrophage progenitor.",Clinical outcomes under hydroxyurea treatment in polycythemia vera: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31123026,Haematologica,2019 05 24,"Hydroxyurea is the standard treatment in high risk patients with polycythemia vera. Yet, estimates of its effect in terms of clinical outcomes (thrombosis, bleeding, hematological transformations and mortality) are lacking. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the absolute risk of events in contemporary patients under hydroxyurea treatment. We searched for relevant articles or abstracts in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, LILACS. Sixteen studies published from 2008 to 2018 reporting number of events using WHO diagnosis for polycythemia vera were selected. Through a random effect logistic model, incidences, study heterogeneity and confounder effects were estimated for each outcome at different follow-ups. Overall, 3,236 patients were analyzed. While incidences of thrombosis and acute myeloid leukemia were stable over time, mortality and myelofibrosis varied depending on follow-up duration. Thrombosis rates were 1.9, 3.6 and 6.8% persons/year at median ages 60, 70 and 80 respectively. Higher incidence of arterial events was predicted by previous cardiovascular complication. Leukemic transformation incidence was 0·4% persons/year. Incidence of transformation to myelofibrosis and mortality were significantly dependent on age and follow-up duration. For myelofibrosis, rates were 5.0 at 5 year and 33.7% at 10 years; overall mortality was 12.6% and 56.2% at 5 and 10 years respectively. In conclusion, we provide reliable risk estimates for the main outcomes in polycythemia vera patients under hydroxyurea treatment.

Using these survey responses, existing literature, and brainstorming conversations with colleagues, an interdisciplinary workgroup then created a fishbone analysis and developed a 5-step intervention to address these barriers: (1) educate providers and patients on Tdap and pertussis; (2) increase Tdap availability to all pregnant women; (3) remind staff of the established Tdap standing order to facilitate administration; (4) encourage obstetricians to offer Tdap; (5) transfer documentation of Tdap administration from office to hospital. To monitor changes in the process over 15 months of pre- and post-intervention, data were collected from monthly chart audits and a two-phase control chart was created. The main outcome measure was proportion of eligible women who received Tdap during current pregnancy. In the pre-intervention period, 362 of 636 eligible women (56.9%) received Tdap during their current pregnancy; in the post-intervention period, 457 of 708 eligible women (64.5%) received Tdap during their current pregnancy. This absolute difference of 7.6% (64.5% vs. 56.9%, p < 0.01) represents a 13.4% relative increase (64.5%/56.9%) in the proportion of clinically eligible pregnant women who received Tdap. This represents a clinically and statistically significant increase in the rate of antepartum Tdap immunization. More research is needed to further understand obstetric barriers and maternal refusal of antepartum Tdap administration.","SapM mutation to improve the BCG vaccine: Genomic, transcriptomic and preclinical safety characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122861,Vaccine,2019 06 11,"The Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine shows variable efficacy in protection against adult tuberculosis (TB). Earlier, we have described a BCG mutant vaccine with a transposon insertion in the gene coding for the secreted acid phosphatase SapM, which led to enhanced long-term survival of vaccinated mice challenged with TB infection. To facilitate development of this mutation as part of a future improved live attenuated TB vaccine, we have now characterized the genome and transcriptome of this sapM::Tn mutant versus parental BCG Pasteur. Furthermore, we show that the sapM::Tn mutant had an equal low pathogenicity as WT BCG upon intravenous administration to immunocompromised SCID mice, passing this important safety test. Subsequently, we investigated the clearance of this improved vaccine strain following vaccination and found a more effective innate immune control over the sapM::Tn vaccine bacteria as compared to WT BCG. This leads to a fast contraction of IFNγ producing Th1 and Tc1 cells after sapM::Tn BCG vaccination. These findings corroborate that a live attenuated vaccine that affords improved long-term survival upon TB infection can be obtained by a mutation that further attenuates BCG. These findings suggest that an analysis of the effectiveness of innate immune control of the vaccine bacteria could be instructive also for other live attenuated TB vaccines that are currently under development, and encourage further studies of SapM mutation as a strategy in developing a more protective live attenuated TB vaccine.",Immunogenicity and safety of a new live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (NBP608) compared to Zostavax® in healthy adults aged 50 years and older.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122860,Vaccine,2019 06 11,"A multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, active-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial was carried out to assess the immunogenicity and safety of NBP608-a newly developed live-attenuated zoster vaccine in Korea-relative to Zostavax® in healthy adults aged 50 years or older. Immune responses to the vaccine were evaluated by glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays using the interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-2 FluoroSpot kit 6 weeks after vaccination. Safety was monitored for 26 weeks based on subjects' diaries, spontaneous reports from subjects, and history taking by the investigators. A total of 845 subjects participated in the screening, and 823 received the vaccination (413 in the NBP608 group and 411 in the comparator group). The gpELISA-determined geometric mean fold rise from baseline to post NBP608 vaccination was 2.75 [95% confidence interval, CI (2.57, 2.94)]. The gpELISA-determined adjusted geometric mean titers (GMTs) of NBP608 and the comparator were 1346.37 [95% CI (1273.99, 1422.87)] and 1674.94 [95% CI (1585.35, 1769.58)], respectively. The adjusted GMT ratio of NBP608 to the comparator was 0.80 [95% CI (0.75, 0.87)]. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups in terms of the geometric mean spot numbers determined by IFN-γ and IL-2 ELISPOT assays at 6 weeks post vaccination (P = 0.7232, 0.3844). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) within 6 weeks post vaccination was 49.82% overall (410/823, 941 cases), 50.73% (209/412, 474 cases) in the NBP608 group, and 48.91% (201/411, 467 cases) in the comparator group. The difference in AE rate between the two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.6010). Most AEs were mild, with a rate of 83.12% in the NBP608 group and 75.37% in the comparator group. Thus, NBP608 is non-inferior to Zostavax® in terms of inducing the immune response and can be safely administered to adults aged 50 years or older.

No specific curative treatments against dengue disease are available and vaccines are currently the only way to prevent the disease. The tetravalent dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur has demonstrated significant efficacy in phase III studies and is now licensed in several countries for the prevention of disease in dengue-seropositives over 9 years of age. The vaccine is composed of four recombinant, live, attenuated vaccines (CYD 1-4) based on a yellow fever vaccine 17D (YFV 17D) backbone, each expressing the pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes of one of the four DENV serotypes. Virus maturity could impact the biological activity of the vaccine viruses. To address this question, the maturity of the four vaccine viruses used in phase III clinical studies was assessed by two complementary techniques: mass spectrometry (MS) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). MS assessed viral maturity at the molecular level by quantifying specifically the prM, and M proteins. CryoEM provided information at the particle level, allowing visualizing the different phenotypes of viral particles: spiky (immature), smooth/bumpy (mature), and mixed (partially mature). Results of the two assays used in this study show that all four CYD dengue vaccine viruses present in lots used in phase III efficacy trials, display in the majority a mature phenotype.",Deciphering the domain specificity of C. difficile toxin neutralizing antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122858,Vaccine,2019 06 16,"Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the principal cause of nosocomial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis associated with antibiotic therapy. The pathological effects of CDI are primarily attributed to toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). Adequate toxin-specific antibody responses are associated with asymptomatic carriage, whereas insufficient humoral responses are associated with recurrent CDI. While the data supporting the importance of anti-toxin antibodies are substantial, clarity about the toxin domain specificity of these antibodies is more limited. To investigate this matter, combinations of human mAbs targeting multiple domains of TcdB were assessed using toxin neutralization assays. These data revealed that a combination of mAbs specific to all major toxin domains had improved neutralizing potency when compared to equivalent concentrations of a single mAb or a combination of mAbs against one or two domains. The function and toxin domain binding specificity of serum antibodies elicited by immunization of hamsters with a toxoid vaccine candidate was also assessed. Immunization with a toxoid vaccine candidate provoked toxin neutralizing antibodies specific to multiple domains of both TcdA and TcdB. When assessed in a toxin neutralization assay, polyclonal sera displayed greater activity against elevated concentrations of toxins than equivalent concentrations of individual mAbs. These data suggest a potential benefit of any antibody based therapeutic or prophylactic treatment that targets multiple toxin domains.","Effectiveness of the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine among girls, boys, preterm and low-birth-weight infants - Results from a randomized, double-blind vaccine trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122856,Vaccine,2019 06 15,"Several studies have shown differences in susceptibility to infections and immune response to vaccines by sex.

Another phenotype, hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsies (HNPP), could be caused by PMP22 mutations. PMP22 encodes a peripheral myelin protein with molecular weight 22-kDa. Various pathomechanisms have been postulated in PMP22-related disease, including dysfunction due to missense mutations, and alteration of a gene dose due to duplication/deletion mutations. We identified a novel PMP22 splice site acceptor variant, c.179-1G>A, in a patient with adult-onset chronic generalized polyneuropathy and two asymptomatic family members. Pathophysiological features of the members mainly overlapped with those reported in HNPP, but broad intrafamilial clinical variations were observed. PMP22 transcripts lacking of exon 4 were produced by the variant, presumably leading to in-frame deletion of 47 amino acids. The variant was also shown to exert effect on dosage of PMP22 mRNA.

Fifty obese adults (25 men and 25 women; age = 34.20 ± 11.19 years; BMI = 36.14 ± 5.33 kg/m2) had their body fat percentage (BF%) and fat-free mass (FFM) evaluated with 2 segmental BIA devices (InBody 230 and InBody 720), BOD POD, and DXA (Lunar iDXA). Body composition via the BOD POD was determined using the Siri equation whereas manufacturer-based equations generated metrics (ie, BF% and FFM) for the InBody devices. The effect size of the mean differences for all BF% and FFM comparisons were trivial (Cohen's d < 0.20). The standard error of estimate (SEE), total error (TE), and 95% limits of agreement (LOAs) were low for both segmental BIA devices when compared to DXA (SEE < 2.26% and 2.35 kg; TE < 2.58% and 2.66 kg; 95% LOAs < ± 4.94% and 4.86kg). The error for BOD POD was also low when compared to DXA (SEE = 2.39% and 2.57 kg; TE = 2.34% and 2.56 kg; 95% LOAs = 4.63% and 5.06 kg). Validity statistics were slightly higher, but considered acceptable, when comparing the segmental BIA devices against BOD POD (SEE < 3.37% and 3.63 kg; TE < 3.44% and 3.79 kg; 95% LOAs < ± 6.62% and 7.19 kg). Lastly, the 2 segmental BIA devices produced nearly identical validity statistics when compared to each other. However, both BIA devices revealed proportional bias for BF% and FFM when compared to the BOD POD and DXA (all p < 0.05). The current study's findings indicate the InBody 230 is interchangeable with the InBody 720 in obese adults. Also, the trivial effect size, when compared against the BOD POD and DXA, suggest the InBody devices could be used for estimating group BF% and FFM. In contrast, the significant proportional bias demonstrates the BIA devices are not acceptable for individual estimates of body composition in an obese clinical population.",Efficacy and Feasibility of Sorafenib as a Maintenance Agent After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Fms-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia: An Update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122828,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",2019 05 24,"Patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations have a very poor prognosis, despite use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and salvage treatments.",Outcomes of endoscopic treatment of leaks and fistulae after sleeve gastrectomy: results from a large multicenter U.S. cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122826,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,2019 05 24,"Sleeve gastrectomy is the most commonly performed bariatric surgery in the United States.

Paradoxically, vitamin D deficiency increases susceptibility to IBD and gastrointestinal infection. Here we review the roles of vitamin D in immune cells using a kinetic model of the vitamin D-mediated effects on infection to explain the sometimes paradoxical effects of vitamin D on gastrointestinal immunity."

Papilledema from idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is typically bilateral and symmetric, but can be asymmetric and even unilateral. The purpose of this study was to develop ultrasound vibro-elastography (UVE) for non-invasive measurement of ocular tissue wave speed for patients with papilledema. A total of 9 patients with papilledema from IIH and 9 age-matched healthy control patients were enrolled in this study. A local, gentle, 0.1-s harmonic vibration was applied on the eyelid to generate wave propagation in the ocular tissue. We used 3 excitation frequencies of 100, 150 and 200 Hz to measure the wave speeds. A 6.4-MHz ultrasound probe was used to non-invasively measure wave propagation in the ocular structures. Wave speeds were analyzed in the posterior sclera of the maculae of the eyes. The magnitudes of wave speed at each frequency of the IIH patients' posterior sclera were significantly higher than those of healthy patients. It was found that the magnitudes of wave speed at each frequency were statistically higher in the eyes with papilledema than in the contralateral eyes without papilledema for the patients with unilateral papilledema. UVE provides a non-invasive technique to measure the wave speed of posterior sclera, which may be useful for assessing patients with papilledema.","Renal Masses: Evaluation with Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound, with a Special Focus on the Pseudocapsule Sign.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122812,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 05 24,"The aim of this study was to analyze the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in differentiating between benign and malignant renal masses, with a special emphasis on the value of the pseudocapsule sign.

Sensitivity, specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) were calculated for qualitative CEUS, and a multivariate analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the sonographic features and malignancy. Time to peak (TTP) and peak intensity (PI) were compared between benign and malignant renal masses for quantitative CEUS analysis in 72 of 163 patients. Intraclass correlations were calculated for variability in intensity and time parameters between qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Among all qualitative CEUS features, the pseudocapsule sign showed the highest Az (0.777; 95% confidence interval: 0.701-0.853) and yielded the highest sensitivity (67.4%) and specificity (88.0%); multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the pseudocapsule sign and color Doppler flow imaging patterns were the two strongest independent predictors for malignancy. For quantitative CEUS analysis, higher PI and shorter TTP were found in malignant renal masses than those in benign ones.

Based on reversible electroporation, which is a physical method to achieve transient tumor cell membrane permeabilization by means of short electric pulses, ECT increases cellular uptake of bleomycin and cisplatin and their cytotoxicity by 8,000- and 80-fold, respectively. Standard operating procedures were established in 2006 and updated in 2018. Ease of administration, patient tolerability, efficacy across histotypes, and repeatability are peculiar advantages, which make standard ECT (ie, ECT using fixed-geometry electrodes) a reliable option for controlling superficial tumor growth locally and preventing their morbidity. Consolidated indications include superficial metastatic melanoma, breast cancer, head and neck skin tumors, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and Kaposi sarcoma. In well-selected patients with oropharyngeal cancers, ECT ensures appreciable symptom control. Emerging applications include skin metastases from visceral or hematological malignancies, vulvar cancer, and some noncancerous skin lesions (keloids and capillary vascular malformations). Repeatability and integration with other oncologic therapies allow for consolidation of response and sustained tumor control.

With the creation of ""localregional clinical hospital networks"" with their own governance structures, the plan follows the international trend towards hospital consolidation and collaboration. The major complicating factors in the Belgian context are (1) that policy instruments for the redesign of the hospital service delivery system are divided between the federal government and the federated authorities, which can result in an asymmetric hospital landscape with a potentially better distribution of clinical services in the Flanders hospital collaborations than in the other federated entities; and (2) the current regulations stipulate that only hospitals (and not networks) are entitled to hospital budgets. Although the reform is the most significant and drastic transformation of the Belgian hospital sector in the last three decades, networks mainly offer a framework in which hospitals can collaborate.

In international comparison, the new model is ambitious in terms of stakeholder involvement and adherence with principles advocated to ensure procedural justice and fair decision-making processes. However, these procedural innovations have also created new challenges. Notably, the newly formed assessment body, the Danish Medicines Council, is faced with a very high caseload and limited options to prioritise the use of its analytical resources."

Each has limitations yielding discordant results and increasingly complex modeling. The models make a priori assumptions that epitopes must be present only on the mature protein, solvent accessible, on the 'top' (peptide binding surface) of the molecule, restricted to the same class as the antibody, and in the same position on the target allele if reactive to more than one locus. Results obtained counter to these assumptions are routinely discounted. For the 17th International Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics Workshop, we developed a reverse engineering algorithm to define epitopes without these assumptions on a cohort of 332 primary transplant pairs. Complete NGS typing of the transcribed (including leader) genomic DNA for 11 HLA loci of donor and recipient and DSA assignment by single antigen beads was performed. Our results show that, when grouped by 16 class I and II allele specific DSA, uniform clusters and 172 specific amino acid target epitopes are recognized by recipients despite originating from disparate HLA pairs. Data also show that these targets can be in the leader, alpha 3, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, thus calling into question current assumptions regarding immunogenic epitopes.

A,2019 05 24,"Although the inverse gas chromatography technique has been used to measure the surface acid-base properties for almost 50 years, several basic problems still hinder its further development and application. One of the problems is that for the polar probe molecules of dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, and ethanol, the molecular area of each probe has different values in literature. In this paper, we point out the incorrect molecular area values presented in the literature by comparing these values with those indicated in Smallwood's Handbook of Organic Solvent Properties. The correct molecular area values of 11 polar probes are determined by plotting the molecular areas of the polar probes versus the van der Waals surface areas reported in the handbook. The correct molecular areas for six common polar probes, namely, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran, are 38.0, 44.0, 42.5, 48.0, 47.0, and 45.0 Å2, respectively. Benzene is a specific molecule with a conjugated π-bond structure, and its molecular area is estimated to be larger than that of other molecules. Therefore, benzene is unsuitable for use as a probe molecule.",An improved in situ acetylation with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the sensitive determination of phenols in mainstream tobacco smoke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122729,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 24,"Phenols in tobacco smoke can adversely affect health with serious consequences that include cardiovascular toxicity, tumor promotion and genotoxic activity. Hence, an improved method involving in situ acetylation and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed for the determination of 39 phenols in mainstream tobacco smoke (MTS). The in situ acetylation was optimized using four protocols, after which the effects of experimental variables on acetylation efficiency were studied using a multifactorial experimental design. The optimum conditions were found to involve an initial 75 μL volume of acetic anhydride, 140 mg of NaHCO3 and 72 mg of K2CO3. The phenolic acetates were then subjected to DLLME, after which they were identified and quantified by GC-MS. A total of 32 additional phenols were tentatively identified. Good linearity was observed with R > 0.999 and each lack-of-fit P > 0.05. The relative recoveries were in the range of 94.8-104.3% with repeatabilities and reproducibilities less than 5.5% and 6.8%, respectively. The limits of detection ranged from 1.12 to 1.74 ng cig-1, with high enrichment factors between 87 and 144.

They are involved in the stability of rubber particles and natural rubber biosynthesis. Recently, we cloned cDNAs encoding REF and SRPP from laticifers of Ficus carica (Fc). In the present study, we overexpressed REF/SRPPs (HbREF, FcREF, and FcSRPP) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in anticipation of future rubber biosynthesis in recombinant yeast. The proteins were localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplets (LDs), and affected LD morphology. Furthermore, their overexpression resulted in an accumulation of neutral lipids and a decrease in yeast cell size. This suggests that REF/SRPPs affect lipid metabolism and lead to a decline in the phospholipid content of yeast. We also found that expression of these proteins induced accumulation of steryl esters and triacylglycerols in yeast. This suggests that the coexpression of REF/SRPPs with key enzymes for the biosynthesis of target lipids in yeast is a promising way of increasing production of important lipids like triacylglycerols and terpenes, and that a protein complex consisting of cis-prenyltransferase (CPT), CPT-like protein, and REF/SRPPs for rubber biosynthesis could be reconstituted on yeast lipid droplets."

Increasing evidence implicated that aberrant histone acetylation modulates gene expression responsible for MSCs aging. Whether the dysregulation of p300 and its KAT activity is involved in the aging process of MSCs was still unexplored. In this study, we found a significant decrease of p300 but elevated p53/p21 levels in senescent hUC-MSCs at late-passage. Then we used two different approaches: (i) downregulation of p300 by siRNA and (ii) inhibition of the acetyltransferase(KAT) activity by C646 to determine the role of p300 in regulating MSCs senescence. We showed that inhibition of p300 induce premature senescence and decrease proliferation potential in hUC-MSCs. Moreover, upregulations of p53 and p21 expressions were confirmed in p300 knockdown and C646-treated hUC-MSCs. Taken together, these results suggest that p300 plays an important role in aging process of MSCs associated with activation of p53/p21 signaling pathway.",Schwann cell-specific PTEN and EGFR dysfunctions affect neuromuscular junction development by impairing Agrin signaling and autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122699,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is formed by motor nerve terminals, post-junctional muscle membranes, and terminal Schwann cells (SCs). The formation of NMJ requires complex and dynamic molecular interactions. Nerve- and muscle-derived molecules have been well characterized but the mechanistic involvement of SC in NMJ development remains poorly understood. SC-specific phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) inactivation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression (Dhh-Cre; Cnp-EGFR; Ptenflox/flox or DET) mice were used and NMJ malformation was observed in these mice. Acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) were distorted and varicose presynaptic nerve terminals appeared in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of DET mice. Agrin signaling related to NMJ development, was downregulated in TA muscle. Both RAS/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways were activated in the sciatic nerves of DET mice. In addition, autophagy was downregulated in these sciatic nerves. Interestingly, the use of Torin 2, an mTOR inhibitor, rescued the phenotype. The downregulated-autophagy might account for Agrin signaling abnormity, which induced NMJ malformation. Taken together, our results indicate that SCs-specific Pten and EGFR cooperation are essential for NMJ development.",Aminophylline promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in human pulmonary bronchial epithelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122698,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the development of common airway disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are therapeutic agents for various diseases. Aminophylline is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor used to treat common lung diseases. In this study, we show that aminophylline promotes mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured human pulmonary bronchial epithelial cells (HPBECs). Aminophylline treatment induces the expression of transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α and transcriptional factors NRF1 and TFAM. The effect of aminophylline on mitochondrial biogenesis can be revealed by its promotion of the ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA (mtDNA/nDNA), mitochondrial protein cytochrome B and mitochondrial mass. At the cellular level, aminophylline increases the mitochondrial respiration rate and ATP production but reduces oxygen content. Consistently, we show that aminophylline activates the CREB-PGC-1α signaling pathway to promote mitochondrial biogenesis. The inhibition of CREB activation by its specific inhibitor H89 obscures the induction of PGC-1α, NRF1, and TFAM by aminophylline, and also abolishes the action of aminophylline on the mtDNA/nDNA ratio and respiration rate, suggesting that the activation of CREB is required for the action of aminophylline. Collectively, our study supports that aminophylline is a potent metabolic inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis in epithelial cells. Aminophylline could have a therapeutic effect on epithelial mitochondrial function in lung diseases.",miR-613 inhibits Warburg effect in gastric cancer by targeting PFKFB2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122697,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"miR-613 has been demonstrated to play critical roles in tumorigenesis and progression of a various type of cancers. However, its role and expression significance remain unclear in gastric cancer (GC). We detected the expression of miR-613 in 176 paired GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and found that miR-613 was significantly downregulated in GC tissues and its downregulation was correlated with T stage, lymph node invasion and advanced AJCC stages. Moreover, miR-613 expression could be an independent prognostic factor of GC. Biological function analysis indicated that miR-613 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion. Further analysis suggested that miR-613 inhibited Warburg effect of GC cells. Mechanically, we identified that miR-613 could directly bind to the 3'UTR of PFKFB2, thereby suppressing the expression of PFKFB2, which in turn, regulating glycolysis metabolism and cell growth. In conclusion, miR-613 served as a tumor suppressor by targeting PFKFB2, indicating that detecting miR-613 and modulation of miR-613 expression could be potential marker and clinical approach in GC patients.",A circular RNA derived from COL6A3 functions as a ceRNA in gastric cancer development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122696,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"Gastric cancer (GC) poses a serious threat to human life, whereas its pathogenesis remains elusive.

RT-PCR analysis using divergent primers, RNase R digestion assay, and mRNA stability assay were performed to characterize circCOL6A3 (ID: hsa_circ_0006401) in GC cell lines; Western blot was conducted to detect the expression of COL6A3. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU incorporation assay, and Transwell were run to evaluate GC cell proliferation and migration. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate the relationship between miR-3064-5p and COL6A3. Both circCOL6A3 and COL6A3 were highly expressed in GC cells, while miR-3064-5p was down-regulated.

A nonlinear TCP network model with strict-feedback structure is first established. The unknown UDP flow is regarded as the external disturbance, and the maximum UDP flow is calculated by using the minimax approach. And then, a congestion control algorithm is proposed by using the adaptive backstepping approach. Meanwhile, the adaptive law is employed to estimate the unknown link capacity. The design of the adaptive law is to introduce a parameter mapping mechanism to limit the parameter identification range to a specified interval, thereby improving the estimation efficiency of the parameters. Furthermore, a state-feedback congestion controller is presented to make sure that the output of the system tracks the desired queue. The simulation results show the superiority and feasibility of the proposed method.",High-precision tracking differentiator via generalized discrete-time optimal control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122694,ISA transactions,2019 05 24,"An enhanced discrete-time tracking differentiator (TD) with high precision based on discrete-time optimal control (DTOC) law is proposed. This law takes the form of state feedback for a double-integral system that adopts the Isochronic Region approach. There, the control signal sequence is determined by a linearized criterion based on the position of the initial state point on the phase plane. The proposed control law can be easily extended to the TD design problem by combining the first-state variable of the double-integral system with the desired trajectory. To improve the precision of the discretization model, we introduced a zero-order hold on the control signal. We also discuss the general form of DTOC law by analysing the relationship between boundary transformations and boundary characteristic points. After comparing the simulation results from three different TDs, we determined that this new TD achieves better performance and higher precision in signal-tracking filtering and differentiation acquisition than do existing TDs. Also the comparisons of the computational complexities between the proposed DTOC law and normal one are demonstrated. For confirmation of its utility, we processed raw phasor measurement units data via the proposed TD. In the absence of complex power system modelling and historical data, it was verified that the proposed TD is suitable for applications of real-time synchrophasor estimations, especially when the states are corrupted by noise.",Attitude measurement based on imaging ray tracking model and orthographic projection with iteration algorithm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122693,ISA transactions,2019 05 24,"In the field of vision-based attitude estimation, camera model and attitude solving algorithm are the key technologies, which determine the measurement accuracy, effectiveness and applicability. Aiming at this issue, in this paper we probe into the generic imaging model and then develop a corresponding generic camera calibration method using two auxiliary calibration planes. The camera model is named as imaging ray tracking model. Based on the imaging ray tracking camera model and with the knowledge of the calibration parameters, an advanced attitude solving algorithm, imaging ray tracking model and attitude from orthographic projection with iterations algorithm, is deeply investigated, which is inspired by the classical POSIT algorithm. The initial attitude value is provided by the orthographic projection of the object on the two calibration planes and then refined by iteration to approximate the true object attitude. Experimental platform is setup to conduct the imaging ray tracking camera calibration procedure and further evaluate our attitude estimation algorithm. We show the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed attitude estimation algorithm by thorough testing on real-data and by comparison with the POSIT algorithm."

The diagnostic workup showed an increased ionized calcium concentration, mild increase in serum creatinine and urea concentration, and severe hyperlipasemia. A complete abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple hepatic nodules. A cytological diagnosis of malignant epithelial neoplasia, highly suggestive of bile duct adenocarcinoma was made. In order to confirm the presumptive diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy due to the presence of a hepatic neoplasia, serum parathormone-related peptide concentration was measured, and the result revealed an increased concentration. The dog was hospitalized and received supportive treatments consisting of intravenous furosemide and fluid therapy. After ruling out lymphoma and hypoadrenocorticism, oral prednisone was initiated and ionized calcium concentration decreased gradually down to normal concentration after 7 days of hospitalization.

However, the mechanisms by which activity regulates myelination and the extent to which myelin plasticity contributes to non-motor cognitive functions remain incompletely understood. Using a mouse model of chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), we recently demonstrated that methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy induces complex glial dysfunction for which microglial activation is central. Here, we demonstrate that remote MTX exposure blocks activity-regulated myelination. MTX decreases cortical Bdnf expression, which is restored by microglial depletion. Bdnf-TrkB signaling is a required component of activity-dependent myelination. Oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)-specific TrkB deletion in chemotherapy-naive mice results in impaired cognitive behavioral performance. A small-molecule TrkB agonist rescues both myelination and cognitive impairment after MTX chemotherapy. This rescue after MTX depends on intact TrkB expression in OPCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a molecular mechanism required for adaptive myelination that is aberrant in CRCI due to microglial activation.",Incidence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis from a model of dysphagia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122675,Acta otorrinolaringologica espanola,2019 05 24,"To relate symptoms of dysphagia to Forestier-Rotes Querol disease or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), a disorder due to ossification in the anterior longitudinal ligament and calcifications in other entheses.",Active surveillance at the time of hospital admission for multidrug-resistant microorganisms among patients who had recently been hospitalized at health care facilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122673,American journal of infection control,2019 05 24,This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of multidrug-resistant microorganism (MDRO) carriage at hospital admission and to identify risk factors for MDRO influx into hospital settings.,"Spatial epidemiology of African swine fever: Host, landscape and anthropogenic drivers of disease occurrence in wild boar.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122672,Preventive veterinary medicine,2019 05 24,"Host abundance and landscape structure often interact to shape spatial patterns of many wildlife diseases. Emergence, spread, and persistence of African swine fever (ASF) among wild boar in eastern Europe has raised questions on the factors underlying ASF dynamics in this novel host-pathogen system. This work identifies drivers of ASF occurrence in natural wild boar population. We evaluated factors shaping the probability of ASF-postitive wild boar during the first three years (2014-2016) of the ASF epidemic in Poland. We expected to observe positive effects of wild boar density, proportion of forested area, human activity, and proximity to previous infections on ASF case probability. We tested these predictions using the infection status of 830 wild boar samples and generalized mixed-effects models. The probability of ASF case increased from 3 to 20% as population density rose from 0.4 to 2 ind./km2. The positive effect of population density on ASF case probability was stronger at locations near previous ASF incidents. ASF was more likely to occur in forested areas, with the probability of detecting an ASF positive sample rising from 2 to 11% as forest cover around the sample increased from 0.5 to 100%. This pattern was consistent at both low and high wild boar densities. Indicators of human activity were poor predictors of ASF occurrence. Disease control efforts, such as culling and carcass search, should be focused on high-density populations where chances of detecting and eliminating ASF-positive wild boar are higher. The intensity of control measures should decrease with distance from the infected area to match the observed spatial pattern of ASF case probability. Woodlands represent areas of the highest risk of ASF case occurrence. Distribution and connectivity of suitable habitats over the landscape can be used to prioritize disease-management actions.",Microtubule Assembly from Single Flared Protofilaments-Forget the Cozy Corner?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122668,Biophysical journal,2019 06 10,"A paradigm shift for models of MT assembly is suggested by a recent cryo-electron microscopy study of microtubules (MTs). Previous assembly models have been based on the two-dimensional lattice of the MT wall, where incoming subunits can add with longitudinal and lateral bonds. The new study of McIntosh et al. concludes that the growing ends of MTs separate into flared single protofilaments. This means that incoming subunits must add onto the end of single protofilaments, forming only a longitudinal bond. How can growth of single-stranded protofilaments exhibit cooperative assembly with a critical concentration? An answer is suggested by FtsZ, the bacterial tubulin homolog, which assembles into single-stranded protofilaments. Cooperative assembly of FtsZ is thought to be based on conformational changes that switch the longitudinal bond from low to high affinity when the subunit is incorporated in a protofilament. This novel mechanism may also apply to tubulin assembly and could be the primary mechanism for assembly onto single flared protofilaments.",Health Care Resource Utilization and Costs Associated With Switching Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122662,Clinical therapeutics,2019 06 10,"Although biologics are effective in managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), many patients experience at least one biologic switch during treatment.

This article discusses the laws governing Guantánamo's military commissions system and mental health evaluations. Notably, the US government initially treated detainees as ""unlawful enemy combatants"" who were not protected under the US Constitution and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment, allowing for the use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" In subsequent legal documents, however, the US government has excluded evidence obtained through torture, as defined by the US Constitution and the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Using open-source document analysis, this article describes the reasons and outcomes of all forensic mental health evaluations from Guantánamo's opening to 2018. Only thirty of 779 detainees (~3.85%) have ever had charges referred against them to the military commissions, and only nine detainees (~1.16%) have ever received forensic mental health evaluations pertaining to their case. Of these nine detainees, six have alleged mental torture while in US custody. This paper shows that leaders in the United States and Europe should consider whether counterterrorism policies that supersede traditional health and human rights complicate the ability of future governments to prosecute cases when successive leaders change laws, a pertinent consideration as North American and European states grapple with the return of foreign fighters.",Which features of psychopathy and impulsivity matter most for prison violence? New evidence among female prisoners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122637,International journal of law and psychiatry,2019 05 24,"Prison violence is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. While a great deal of research has been conducted in male samples, very few studies are dedicated to understanding violence committed by female offenders. Two constructs that have emerged as important predictors of violence are psychopathy and impulsivity. These constructs may be an important line of inquiry due to the close association between psychopathy, impulsivity, and violence. In a sample of 166 female offenders, we used the 3-facet model of psychopathy and 3-factor model of trait impulsivity with the goal to statistically explain two types of prison violence: official reports of violent misconducts over a 12-month period, and self-report of deliberately instigating a violent altercation. We conducted three separate regression models to test the independent contribution of psychopathy and impulsivity, as well as accounting for the overlap between psychopathy and impulsivity. When impulsivity and psychopathy were not competing within the same model, affective and behavioral psychopathic traits, and nonplanning impulsiveness predicted violent misconducts. However, when accounting for impulsivity and psychopathy within the same model, only affective psychopathic traits remained significant. When predicting if an offender deliberately started a violent altercation, separate statistical models showed affective and interpersonal psychopathic traits, and nonplanning impulsiveness were significant. When competing for variance within the same statistical model, only affective and interpersonal psychopathic traits remained as significant predictors. This suggests an overlap between psychopathic traits and nonplanning impulsivity when understanding violent misconducts in female offenders, while affective psychopathic explains female prison violence, regardless of impulsivity.",How should the law determine capacity to refuse treatment for anorexia?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122636,International journal of law and psychiatry,2019 05 24,"This article critically assesses the way a certain court has determined the capacity of a person diagnosed with anorexia to refuse medical treatment. It is shown that when making this determination, the court has adopted a process of circular reasoning, meaning anyone with the diagnosis will be found to lack capacity to refuse its treatment. This circular reasoning means that indicia of capacity that ought to be considered by the court is ignored. The result is a procedure in which the anorexic patient has no voice, and an outcome against which he or she has no effective legal recourse. This problem, it is argued, can be overcome in two ways. Firstly, courts must make sure that the 'functional' test of capacity is properly applied, meaning any finding of incapacity must rest on evidenced deficits in decision-making ability. Secondly, courts must properly engage with the subjective reasoning of the person making the treatment refusal.",Meta-analysis of second generation competency to stand trial assessment measures: Preliminary findings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122635,International journal of law and psychiatry,2019 05 24,"Since the 1990s, standardized competency to stand trial assessment measures have been developed to improve the reliability and validity of expert assessment and opinion in legal settings.

We test this possibility by controlling for temperament traits related to antisocial behavior and psychopathic personality features in a sample of residentially incarcerated youth (N = 253). Results from negative binomial models revealed that legal cynicism was significantly associated with self-reported delinquency (including violence), but not total arrests. The significant associations with general delinquency and violence held even when controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. However, the associations were rendered either non-significant or greatly attenuated when we included temperament and psychopathy measures in the models.

An empirical study of mental health app privacy policies and practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122630,International journal of law and psychiatry,2019 05 24,"Digital mental health services are increasingly endorsed by governments and health professionals as a low cost, accessible alternative or adjunct to face-to-face therapy. App users may suffer loss of personal privacy due to security breaches or common data sharing practices between app developers and third parties. Loss of privacy around personal health data may harm an individual's reputation or health. The purpose of this project was to identify salient consumer issues related to privacy in the mental health app market and to inform advocacy efforts towards promoting consumer interests. We conducted a critical content analysis of promotional (advertising) materials for prominent mental health apps in selected dominant English-speaking markets in late 2016-early 2017, updated in 2018. We identified 61 prominent mental health apps, 56 of which were still available in 2018. Apps frequently requested permission to access elements of the user's mobile device, including requesting so-called 'dangerous' permissions. Many apps encouraged users to share their own data with an online community. Nearly half of the apps (25/61, 41%) did not have a privacy policy to inform users about how and when personal information would be collected and retained or shared with third parties, despite this being a standard recommendation of privacy regulations. We consider that the app industry pays insufficient attention to protecting the privacy of mental health app users. We advocate for increased monitoring and enforcement of privacy principles and practices in mental health apps and the mobile ecosystem, more broadly. We also suggest a re-framing of regulatory attention that places consumer interests at the centre of guidance.",Involuntary psychiatric admission: Comparative study of mental health legislation in Brazil and in England/Wales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122629,International journal of law and psychiatry,2019 05 24,"Involuntary admission is a controversial measure that can lead to violation of various human rights. On the opposite, involuntary admissions may contribute for the recovery of those with severe mental disorders who represent a danger to themselves or others. From this perspective, legislation must define and limit the circumstances in which this may occur preventing human rights violations. In this context, this descriptive-comparative study aimed at analyzing the similarities and differences between the mental health' laws related to involuntary psychiatric admission in Brazil and England/Wales. Data were collected through bibliographic and documentary research. The analysis was based on the World Health Organization's Checklist on Mental Heallth Legislation, using the comparative method. Results showed that the Brazilian legislation meets 52 (31.32%) of the 166 WHO standards, while legislation in England/Wales meets 90 (54.2%). In addition, the law from England/Wales establishes clearer and detailed procedures for ""involuntary admissions"" and has ""oversight and review mechanisms"" more effective than Brazil; the legislation presents a medium compliance of ""competence, capacity and protection"", and Brazil does not address these issues in its legislation; Brazilian legislation establishes a larger list of ""fundamental rights"", but does not provide ""penalties"" for the breach of those rights, while England/Wales meets WHO criteria in relation to this issue. The main similarities between Brazil and England/Wales refer to standards that require review: ""voluntary patients"", ""emergency treatment"", ""economic and social rights"", ""civil issues"" and ""protection of vulnerable groups."" Both jurisdictions also have the same level of compliance regarding ""clinical and experimental research"", and ""special treatments, seclusion and restraint"". This study may bring light for a reflection from competent authorities on the need to have audits for national mental health legislations, carried out by multidisciplinary committees, as recommended by WHO."

We estimated the annualized per dentist number of oral lesions suspicious for premalignancy/malignancy discovered by United States (U.S.) general dentists and the annualized per dentist number of histologically-confirmed cancers subsequently diagnosed. Eligible participants were licensed, clinically-active U.S. GDs who were members of the U.S. National Dental Practice-Based Research Network. An a priori sample size of 900 was determined; 2000 GDs were invited to participate; 1,073 completed the study. Self-reported, cross-sectional data were obtained via an online questionnaire during 4/12/2017-8/31/2017 and analyzed. The reported numbers of suspicious oral lesions and histologically-confirmed oral cancer cases diagnosed over the previous six months were quantified. Potential outcome predictors were evaluated as covariates in multivariable analyses. Crude and adjusted statistics were produced by regressing each outcome on each independent variable while assuming a Poisson distribution, log link and utilizing robust standard errors. Eighty-seven percent of dentists reported discovering 1+ lesion suspicious for oral premalignancy/malignancy during the preceding six months. The mean number of suspicious lesions/dentist/year was 9.5; adjusted mean: 9.6. Fifteen percent of participants reported discovering 1+ lesion confirmed as cancer during the same period, 213 confirmed cancer cases/6 months or 426/year. Crude and adjusted mean numbers of histologically-confirmed oral cancers were both 0.4 cancers/dentist/year.

By protecting the chromosome ends, the telomeres play a vital role in preserving the information in our genome. Telomeres shorten with age and the rate of telomere erosion provides insight into the proliferation history of cells. The pace of telomere attrition is known to increase at the onset of several pathological conditions. Telomere shortening has been emerging as a potential contributor in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and depression. The rate of telomere attrition in the brain is slower than that of other tissues owing to the low rate of cell proliferation in brain. Telomere maintenance is crucial for the functioning of stem cells in brain. Taking together the studies on telomere attrition in various neurological disorders, an association between telomere shortening and disease status has been demonstrated in schizophrenia, AD and depression, in spite of a few negative reports. But, studies in ASD and PD have failed to produce conclusive results. The cause-effect relationship between TL and neurological disorders is yet to be elucidated. The factors responsible for telomere erosion, which have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, need to be explored in detail. Telomerase activation is now being considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for neurological disorders.",Acute phase reactant serum amyloid A in inflammation and other diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122611,Advances in clinical chemistry,2019 06 05,"Acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A (A-SAA) plays an important role in acute and chronic inflammation and is used in clinical laboratories as an indicator of inflammation. Although both A-SAA and C-reactive protein (CRP) are acute-phase proteins, the detection of A-SAA is more conclusive than the detection of CRP in patients with viral infections, severe acute pancreatitis, and rejection reactions to kidney transplants. A-SAA has greater clinical diagnostic value in patients who are immunosuppressed, patients with cystic fibrosis who are treated with corticoids, and preterm infants with late-onset sepsis. Nevertheless, for the assessment of the inflammation status and identification of viral infection in other pathologies, such as bacterial infections, the combinatorial use of A-SAA and other acute-phase proteins (APPs), such as CRP and procalcitonin (PCT), can provide more information and sensitivity than the use of any of these proteins alone, and the information generated is important in guiding antibiotic therapy. In addition, A-SAA-associated diseases and the diagnostic value of A-SAA are discussed. However, the relationship between different A-SAA isotypes and their human diseases are mostly derived from research laboratories with limited clinical samples. Thus, further clinical evaluations are necessary to confirm the clinical significance of each A-SAA isotype. Furthermore, the currently available A-SAA assays are based on polyclonal antibodies, which lack isotype specificity and are associated with many inflammatory diseases. Therefore, these assays are usually used in combination with other biomarkers in the clinic.",A practical guide to validation and verification of analytical methods in the clinical laboratory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122610,Advances in clinical chemistry,2019 06 05,"Although the measures to improve quality in the clinical laboratory have been enormous in the past years, not least of all due to the introduction of the ISO standards 15189 and 17025, the handling of validation and verification of method performance often still differs widely from laboratory to laboratory. Much of what is published on the topic contains complex statistics and is difficult to implement in routine laboratories. The result is, that this point is often neglected or implemented incorrectly, which in turn can lead to false conclusions about method performances, potentially compromising patient safety or contributing to incorrect diagnoses. As it has long become a standard requirement for accredited laboratories to evaluate and document the analytical performance of all methods not only prior to their first implementation, but also during ongoing operation, there is a need for clear, standardized and practical guidelines on the subject. This review summarizes the current literature on the topic, focusing on the requirements for method validations, or as the case may be, verifications and describes when to validate, when to verify and which statistical tests are appropriate for each. Proper interpretation of statistical test results and acceptance criteria for each procedure are alluded to. Specific topics, which are addressed, are precision and bias verification of quantitative, qualitative and semi-quantitative procedures, method comparisons with Bland-Altman Plots, Passing-Bablok regression analysis, 2×2 contingency tables and bubble charts, linearity studies, analytical sensitivity and specificity, performing carry-over studies and establishing and confirming reference ranges.",Advances in monitoring anticoagulant therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122609,Advances in clinical chemistry,2019 06 05,"Anticoagulant drugs directly or indirectly influence coagulation factors preventing fibrin formation, thus preventing blood clotting. They are classified into two groups according to the mode of application, namely parenteral and oral drugs. Among the latter, vitamin K antagonists (most often warfarin) were most widely used for almost a century. In recent years new oral anticoagulant drugs have become available that directly target either factor IIa or Xa (direct oral anticoagulants, DOACs). The proportion of patients to whom DOACs are prescribed is increasing because clinical studies have proved they are at least as effective and safe as vitamin K antagonists. Some of the anticoagulant drugs require regular laboratory monitoring, while others only need assessment of blood drug levels in specific clinical situations. This chapter provides an overview of appropriate laboratory tests used for either regular laboratory monitoring of therapy or occasional assessment of the anticoagulant effect of both parenteral and oral anticoagulant drugs used in clinical practice.",Phosphaturia in kidney stone formers: Still an enigma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122608,Advances in clinical chemistry,2019 06 05,"Calcium kidney stones are common worldwide. Most are idiopathic and composed of calcium oxalate. Calcium phosphate is present in around 80% and may initiate stone formation. Stone production is multifactorial with a polygenic genetic contribution. Phosphaturia is found frequently among stone formers but until recently received scant attention. This review examines possible mechanisms for the phosphaturia and its relevance to stone formation from a wide angle. There is a striking lack of clinical data. Phosphaturia is associated, but not correlated, with hypercalciuria, increased 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D [1,25 (OH)2D], and sometimes evidence of disturbances in proximal renal tubular function. Phosphate reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules requires tightly regulated interaction of many proteins. Paracellular flow through intercellular tight junctions is the major route of phosphate absorption from the intestine and can be reduced therapeutically in hyperphosphatemic patients. In monogenic defects stones develop when phosphaturia is associated with hypercalciuria, generally explained by increased 1,25 (OH)2D production in response to hypophosphatemia. Calcification does not occur in disorders with increased FGF23 when phosphaturia occurs in isolation and 1,25 (OH)2D is suppressed. Candidate gene studies have identified mutations in the phosphate transporters, but in few individuals. One genome-wide study identified a polymorphism of the phosphate transporter gene SLC34A4 associated with stones. Others did not find mutations obviously linked to phosphate reabsorption. Future genetic studies should have a wide trawl and should focus initially on groups of patients with clearly defined phenotypes. The global data should be pooled.",Titin fragment in urine: A noninvasive biomarker of muscle degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122607,Advances in clinical chemistry,2019 06 05,"Titin/connectin, encoded by the TTN gene, is the largest protein in humans. It acts as a molecular spring in the sarcomere of striated muscles. Although titin is degraded in the skeletal muscles of patients with muscular dystrophies, studies of titin have been limited by its mammoth size. Mutations in the TTN gene have been detected not only in skeletal muscle diseases but in cardiac muscle diseases. TTN mutations result in a wide variety of phenotypes. Recent proteome analysis has found that titin fragments are excreted into the urine of patents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have shown that urinary titin is a useful noninvasive biomarker for the diagnosis and screening of not only DMD, but also of neuromuscular diseases, for predicting the outcome of cardiomyopathy and for evaluating physical activities. The development of ELISA systems to measure urinary titin has opened a door to studying muscle degradation directly and noninvasively. This review provides current understanding of urinary titin and future prospects for measuring this protein.",The circadian clock control of adipose tissue physiology and metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122604,Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,2019 05 24,"The circadian clock organizes the timing of physiological processes in anticipation of diurnal environmental changes that originate from the rotation of the Earth. Several of the metabolic functions of adipose tissues are under regulation by the circadian clock to achieve temporal coordination and whole body homeostasis. Adipose tissues, once believed to only express physiological phenotypes that are downstream of central nervous system regulation, are now well described to communicate not only to other peripheral tissues, but also to the central nervous system for temporal orchestration of metabolism. In this review, we will cover the involvement of the circadian clocks, both master and adipocyte clocks, in the regulation of adipose tissue physiology and the associated consequences for energy homeostasis."

The case also highlights the merit of an approach to the hypoxic patient with an in-situ extraglottic airway device based not only on deciding if the device is functioning to maintain a patent airway, but also, simultaneously considering the patient's physiology. A 71 year old male suffered an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Part of his resuscitation included placement of a dual-balloon extraglottic airway device by EMS. He was hypoxic, but the device seemed to be providing for a patent airway without an air leak. There was also a favorable end-tidal carbon dioxide waveform. The flight team chose to the leave the device in place. PEEP was up-titrated to 17 cmH20 without issue. Sigh breaths, as well as breath holds, were also able to be delivered.

We herein report our experience in using this portable X-ray system at the scene after transportation by a doctor helicopter (DH). An explosion suddenly occurred while a 42-year-old man was handling toluene in a factory, causing his clothes to catch on fire. When the staff of a physician-staffed helicopter (DH) equipped with a portable X-ray system checked the man at the rendezvous point, he had second- and third-degree flame burns to > 70% of his total body surface area. A chest X-ray obtained using the portable X-ray system showed clear lung fields. A noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin monitor indicated a carboxyhemoglobin value of 6%. He was transferred to a special burn center by the DH. This is the first reported case in which a portable X-ray system was used to evaluate blast injuries in the prehospital setting. This system may be useful for performing prehospital medical treatment for blast injury victims.",Hemorrhage Treatment Adjuncts in a Helicopter Emergency Medical Service.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122589,Air medical journal,2019 05 24,"Hemorrhaging is the leading cause of preventable death after trauma. In our helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS), we introduced a bundle of 3 hemostatic adjuncts: 1) tourniquet, 2) hemostatic chitosan-based wound packings, and 3) tranexamic acid (TXA). The real-life frequency of applying these adjuncts in HEMS remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed our electronic HEMS database regarding the use of these hemostatic adjuncts. We analyzed all subsequent dispatches of our HEMS ""Lifeliner 1"" within a searchable digital database (01.02.2013-22.05.2018). This HEMS operates 24/7, servicing ∼4.5 million inhabitants of the Netherlands. During the 75-month study period, we registered 15,759 dispatches, of which 8,658 were canceled, and 7,101 included on-site patient care, including 4,928 (69.4%) trauma cases. In total, we recorded 78 tourniquet applications (1.1% of patients), 104 hemostatic wound packings (1.5% of patients), and 1,379 cases with prehospital TXA administration (19.4% of patients). This difference in the use of hemostatics has several contributors, including a possible lack of awareness for tourniquets and procoagulant wound packing, a high proportion of blunt trauma with internal bleeding not accessible to tourniquet or wound packing, and a liberal use of TXA (eg, in patients with unproven hemorrhage). Besides creating awareness for those hemostatic adjuncts, the practical implications of our findings need further evaluation in future studies.",Lessons Learned in Helicopter Operations During a Large Multiagency Disaster Prevention Drill in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122588,Air medical journal,2019 05 24,"In 2018, the Cabinet Office executed a disaster prevention drill based on the scenario that Nankai had a megathrust earthquake and a large tsunami hit Tokushima Prefecture.

Fatigue assessments completed by flight crews can give early warning when fatigue is accumulating. Countermeasures can then be implemented to improve performance and increase safety. No validated air ambulance fatigue assessment currently exists that incorporates transport-specific factors. The objective of this study was to validate a flight fatigue assessment that accounts for air transport-specific factors. Flight crewmembers from multiple air ambulance programs participated and completed assessments. Results were analyzed to determine if the assessment captured or predicted fatigue levels of crewmembers. When used to measure crewmember fatigue, the assessment was shown to consistently and reliably confirm accumulating fatigue and correlated with crew-reported levels of fatigue. A predicted fatigue scale was created to help crewmembers objectively identify their fatigue level. Used consistently, the transport fatigue assessment should increase awareness of accumulating fatigue. With awareness, crewmembers are better equipped to justify and take advantage of opportunities to mitigate their fatigue, increase crew coordination, enhance safety, and improve patient care.",Teaching Flight Nurses Ultrasonographic Evaluation of Esophageal Intubation and Pneumothorax.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122586,Air medical journal,2019 05 24,"Aeromedical prehospital care has seen an increase in the use of point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS) in recent years.

This article reviews the prevalence, psychosocial correlates, and prevention of smoking in Hong Kong adolescents. The past 30-day smoking prevalence in adolescents decreased from 9.6% in 2003 to 2.5% in 2017. Tobacco advertisements, parental and best friends smoking, nonintact families, poor family relationships, lower socioeconomic status, being a new immigrant, poor knowledge of smoking-related harm, positive attitudes toward smoking, overestimation of peer smoking, and depressive symptoms were positively associated with smoking outcomes, whereas positive youth development, authoritative mother and permissive father, family functioning, school competence, and stronger tobacco industry denormalization beliefs were protective against smoking. Along with tobacco tax increase, ban on tobacco advertisements, smoke-free law and pictorial warnings, educational efforts through theater performances, social norms campaigns, and positive adolescent training programs have been conducted to prevent adolescent smoking. To achieve the ultimate goal of tobacco endgame, further tax increase, plain packaging, banning point-of-sale display of tobacco products, smoke-free area extension, and raising minimum age of purchase should be implemented. The government proposed law to ban e-cigarettes, and heated tobacco products should be passed soon to protect children and adolescents from using these products.",Could serum levels of irisin be used in gestational diabetes predicting?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122538,Taiwanese journal of obstetrics & gynecology,2019 05 24,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic disorder during pregnancy leading to acute and chronic complications in both mother and newborn.

Potential solutions include increased use of randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal trials and large pharmacoepidemiological studies that use electronic health-care records on the long-term effectiveness and safety of medications. Pragmatic head-to-head randomised trials would also provide direct evidence on comparative effectiveness and safety profiles."

Under UV irradiation, the CD displayed blue emission that was quenched in the presence of H2O2 and peroxidase. This property was used to quantify glucose in biological samples, using a standard additions procedure employing a paper platform and the H2O2 formed in the enzymatic reaction with glucose oxidase. The attractive features of the paper platform include low cost, easy availability, biocompatibility, and hydrophilicity. The standard additions calibration method has the advantages that it can be performed using a single device, eliminates the need for external calibration, and reduces matrix effects associated with the sample and/or non-uniformity of the paper. The method developed was applied in the analysis of certified serum and urine samples. There were no statistically significant differences between the certified concentrations and the results obtained using the paper device with standard additions (Student's t-test at 95% confidence level).",Dual functional monomers modified magnetic adsorbent for the enrichment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in water and urine samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122456,Talanta,2019 05 24,"According to the molecular properties of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSADs), a new adsorbent for magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) was designed and synthesized. Triethyl-(4-vinylbenzyl)aminium chloride and 4-vinylbenzeneboronic acid were utilized as dual functional monomers to copolymerize with divinylbenzene on the surface of pre-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The prepared magnetic adsorbent (Fe3O4@TCVA) was characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. Due to the abundant boronic acid, quaternary amine and phenyl groups, the Fe3O4@TCVA displayed satisfactory extraction performance for target NSADs (diclofenac acid, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid) by means of B-N coordination, anion-exchange, π-π and hydrophobic interactions. Under the optimized conditions, the Fe3O4@TCVA/MSPE was combined with high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) to sensitively analyze NSADs in water and human urine samples. Results indicated that the limits of detection for water and urine samples were in the ranges of 0.014-0.031 μg/L and 0.029-0.11 μg/L, respectively. The relative standard deviations for the intra-day and inter-day assay variability were below 10%.

The dye DMSB (3-ethyl-2-[3-(3-ethyl-3H-benzoselenazol-2-ylidene)-2-methylprop-1-enyl] benzoselenazolium bromide) loses the ability of self-assembly, but it can be activated by thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA) G-quadruplex structure. And only the TBA G-quadruplex formed in the presence of K+, can strongly induce J-aggregate signals of DMSB. Because the Pb2+ ions can bind and stabilize the TBA G-quadruplex with much higher efficiency than K+, the J-aggregate signals of DMSB falls sharply when the Pb2+ is present. As a result, the assembly and disassembly of DMSB allows the selective detection of 10 μM K+ and 20 nM Pb2+ respectively, even the competitive sodium ion (Na+) was as high as 145 mM. The linear correlation existed between the J-aggregate intensity and the concentration of K+ and Pb2+ over the range of 0.5-5.0 mM and 200-2000 nM, respectively. Moreover, the concentration of K+ (∼3 mM) and Pb2+ (below 20 nM) in human blood serum samples were determined by the present method, which agreed well with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This work not only opens a door for the further development of G-quadruplex-based aptasensor in complex real system, but also provides a simple and versatile sensing platform for ion detection in clinic.",Simultaneous determination of multiresidue and multiclass emerging contaminants in waters by rotating-disk sorptive extraction-derivatization-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122454,Talanta,2019 05 29,"An efficient method has been developed for the multiresidue and multiclass determination of 16 emerging contaminants (parabens, hormones, anti-inflammatory drugs, triclosan and bisphenol A) in water samples using rotating-disk sorptive extraction (RDSE) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Silylation of the compounds prior to GC-MS analysis was optimized using a factorial experimental design; the optimal derivatization conditions to maximize the response of the set of analytes included 70 μL of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide at 80 °C for 35 min. RDSE was implemented using Oasis® HLB as a sorptive phase and an extraction time of 60 min. The method was applied to Chilean environmental samples.

In the effluent and influent of the wastewater treatment plant, the maximum concentrations of contaminants were 3.1 and 4.2 μg L-1, respectively. The proposed analytical strategy suggests clear improvements with respect to other methods reported in the literature, considering not only the different steps involved in the analytical process (extraction, derivatization and chromatography) but also taking into account that this method involves the determination of different families of analytes with different physicochemical and structural properties.",Protein functionalised self assembled monolayer based biosensor for colon cancer detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122452,Talanta,2019 05 24,"We report results of the studies relating to the fabrication of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based label-free immunosensor for real-time monitoring of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a colon cancer biomarker.

Thin layers of the transparent material allow light transmitting with low attenuation, but coloured cell body can prevent stray light transmitting through. Transparent 3D printing filaments of different colours are compared and Grey-transparent (Grey-T) provides highest sensitivity for the determination of nitrite via Griess reaction. Flow cells of 10-50 mm pathlength have been fabricated by using the Grey-T filament. Effective pathlengths are estimated to be 83.9-96.2% of the physical pathlengths.

Here a highly sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) approach for the selective detection of trace atrazine was proposed with R6G as a Raman reporter, which was adsorbed on silver nanoparticles modified carbon dots. The latter were prepared by the reduction of Ag+ by carbon dots. In the presence of atrazine, the aggregation of the modified carbon dots due to the interaction between silver nanoparticles and atrazine led to great enhancement of the SERS signal of R6G. Under optimal assay conditions, the limit of quantification was estimated to be 10 nM, which matched with the standard for drinking water quality of China and WHO defined limit. A good linear response to atrazine was found in the concentration range of 10-1000 nM with the relative standard deviations between 1.8% and 5.6%. The determination of atrazine in real water samples was also carried out to confirm the practicability of the proposed method, which showed the recoveries from 95% to 117.5%.

The prepared TPE-peptide probe could be completely degraded by carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) to release hydrophobic TPE part, which aggregated in buffer solution and showed strong TPE emission. In the presence of casein kinase (CKII), the phosphorylation of peptide prevented the complete degradation by CPY producing the nonemissive probe. Thus, the developed probe can be used to detect CKII homogeneously and conveniently. This detection process can be finished within 1.5 h with high sensitivity (0.05 mU/μL) and good selectivity.

The classical method to isolate the oligosaccharides after depolymerization by heparinases or nitrous acid I s by size exclusion chromatography which is a time-consuming process. In this study, we explored the possibility for rapid separation of oligosaccharides using a novel polymer material. The magnetic thermoresponsive molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were synthesized using heparin disaccharide as a template, AEM, NIPAAm, and AAm as functional monomer, and MBAA as crosslinker by surface radical polymerization in an aqueous media. Incubation of the MIP with hepairn oligosaccharides demonstrated specific binding to the template molecule. This binding to the targeted molecule was affected by reaction temperature with regard to binding capacity and specificity. The recognition specificity and selectivity can be modulated by varying the compositions of multi-functional monomers. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model provide the best fit to the equilibrium adsorption of heparin disaccharides by MIPs. The results suggest that the new material can be used for rapid separation of di- and tetra-saccharides of heparin, which can also be adapted to the applications for isolation of oligosaccharides from other polysaccharides, e.g. heparan sulfate and chondoriting sulfate."

So far, various methods have been developed to determine the common base mismatch. However most of them are complex, time-consuming. Herein, we report a novel method, which only need one conventional endonuclease (NEase) and achieve site-specific cleavage in a programmable way, to detect single base mismatch, termed aligner-mediated cleavage-based single base mismatch discrimination (AMCMD). The DNA aligner (DA) is in a stem-loop structure, consistent with an incomplete recognition site of NEase on its stem and a 5'-side arm complementary to the target sequence (TS). Once TS contains matched base and hybridizes with DA, the complete recognition site of NEase is formed, and the TS will be cleavaged with fast speed, while converse is not. Based on it, the method can clearly distinguish mismatched and complementary bases. Without sample pre-processing, we were able to obtain and verify all the test result in about 30 min through the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. This endows the proposed method with a simpler advantage. Then we combined AMCMD and EXPAR to create a new method for single base mismatch discrimination, the short sequence obtained by AMCMD as a target to trigger EXPAR, with a detection limit at 1pM level. Another process with human serum underlines that AMCMD is compatible with the complex biological sample, thus it has the potentials for practical applications.",Fabrication of a novel biosensor for biosensing of bisphenol A and detection of its damage to DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122434,Talanta,2019 05 24,"In this work, a novel electrochemical biosensor has been fabricated based on step-by-step modification of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with methylene blue (MB)-DNA/multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)-chitosan (CS)/palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs)/fullerene C60 (C60) for voltammetric and impedimetric detection of DNA damage induced by bisphenol A (BPA). Modifications applied to the GCE were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy. The EIS and DPV responses of the biosensor were increased and decreased, respectively, by the DNA damage induced by BPA which led us to develop novel systems for detection of DNA damage.

The capability of the MCC-HPPI-TOFMS for discrimination of isomeric compounds and elimination of the matrix effect was demonstrated by analyzing flavor mixtures. With the merits of fast separation, soft ionization and high detection sensitivity, satisfactory effects in the 2D analysis were achieved, despite the relatively low chromatographic resolution of MCC. As a result, three isomers, eucalyptol, l-menthone and linalool, in a flavor mixture were successfully categorized within 90 s, and the matrix effect caused by solvent ethanol was significantly eliminated as well.

It revealed acceptable recovery results in the range of 94-104%, indicating that it might be a promising platform for further biosensor development."

These platforms were microwell-based heterogeneous fluoroimmunoassay (FIA) and a kinetic exclusion assay (KinExA) with KinExA™ 3200 immunosensor. Both FIA and KinExA were developed using same reagents; mouse anti-CZT antibody and a capturing reagent of CZT conjugated with bovine serum albumin (CZT-BSA). In the FIA, the CZT-BSA coated onto the microwells of the assay plate was present simultaneously in the assay mixture (CZT and its antibody). In the KinExA, the antibody was allowed to pre-equilibrate with CZT, and then the incubation mixture was rapidly passed through a microcolumn containing CZT-BSA coated onto polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads. The analytical performances of both assays were comparatively evaluated in terms of assay working range, limit of detection, precision profile, and accuracy. The results revealed that KinExA yielded higher sensitivity and better precision than FIA; whereas, both assays had comparable accuracies. Both FIA and KinExA were superior to all the existing chromatographic methods for CZT in terms of the assay sensitivity, convenience, analysis throughputs. The proposed FIA and KinExA are anticipated to effectively contribute to the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of CZT in clinical settings.","Disposable electrochemical immunosensor for analysis of cystatin C, a CKD biomarker.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122413,Talanta,2019 05 24,"Specific monitoring of cystatin C (CysC) levels in biological fluids is critical for diagnosis, treatment and mechanistic understanding of a spectrum of diseases, particularly chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite evidences that CysC correlates with the high risk and/or progression of CKD, its use in clinical practice is still scarce. In this context, we report the development of a simple and sensitive immunosensor for the detection of CysC. The biosensor combines the technology of cost-effective screen-printed electrodes with the high specificity of a sandwich immunoassay. Optimized conditions showed that the sensor operates in a linear range between 10 and 100 ng mL-1, with a detection limit and a sensitivity of 6.0 ng mL-1 and 6.4 ± 0.3 μA ng mL-1 cm-2, respectively. Moreover, the sensor provided precise results (RSD ≤ 6.2%) and the quantification of CysC in CKD serum samples revealed to be in agreement with the values obtained by a particle-enhanced nephelometric immunoassay. In this light, the proposed immunosensor qualifies for clinical application, constituting a step forward in the development of fast, sensitive and cost-effective diagnostic tools that can improve the current medical care settings of CKD patients.",Development of a smartphone-based biomimetic sensor for aflatoxin B1 detection using molecularly imprinted polymer membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122412,Talanta,2019 05 24,"A novel smartphone-based optical biomimetic sensor based on free-standing molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) membranes was developed for rapid and sensitive point-of-care detection of aflatoxin B1. The developed MIP membranes were capable of selective recognition of the target analyte and, at the same time, of generation of a fluorimetric sensor response, which could be registered using the camera of a smartphone and analysed using image analysis. The developed system provides a possibility of synchronous detection of aflatoxin B1 in 96 channels. UV irradiation of aflatoxin B1, selectively bound by the MIP membranes from the analysed samples, initiated fluorescence of aflatoxin B1 with intensity directly proportional to its concentration. The composition of the MIP membranes used as a recognition element was optimised taking into account data of computational modelling. Two functional monomers (2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propansulfonic acid and acrylamide) were identified as optimal for the formation of aflatoxin B1-selective binding sites in the structure of the MIP membranes. Working characteristics of the smartphone-based sensor system were also estimated. The influence of pH and of buffer and NaCl concentrations on the smartphone-based sensor responses were studied. High selectivity of the developed sensor system towards aflatoxin B1 was confirmed in experiments with the close structural analogue of the target analyte - aflatoxin G2, and ochratoxin A. The detection limit for aflatoxin B1 using the smartphone-based sensor systems was found to be 20 ng mL-1 for the sensor based on MIP membranes synthesised with acrylamide as a functional monomer. The storage stability of the recognition elements of the developed sensors was estimated as one year when stored at 22 °C. The possibility to detect the aflatoxin B1 in contaminated food samples was shown. The MIP-membrane-based sensor system provided a convenient point-of-care approach in food safety testing.",Magnetic nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide as a novel magnetic solid-phase extraction adsorbent for the separation of bisphenol endocrine disruptors in carbonated beverages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122411,Talanta,2019 05 29,"A novel magnetic nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (Fe3O4@N-RGO) had been fabricated for the first time on the basis of a simple solvothermal method and then was successfully applied to extract four bisphenol endocrine disruptors (bisphenol A, bisphenol B, bisphenol F and bisphenol AP) in carbonated beverages coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The as-prepared Fe3O4@N-RGO was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The introduction of nitrogen atoms not only made the wrinkle level of N-RGO increased, but also retarded the irreversible aggregation of graphene sheets. Compared with Fe3O4@RGO, Fe3O4@N-RGO owned larger specific surface area and more adsorption sites. Hence, Fe3O4@N-RGO showed excellent extraction efficiency toward bisphenol endocrine disruptors. The analytical parameters influencing the extraction efficiency were optimized in detail. Under the optimal conditions, a satisfactory performance was obtained. The calibration lines were linear over the concentration in the range of 0.4-1000 μg L-1 with determination coefficients (r2) between 0.9976 and 0.9996. The limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0.1 μg L-1 to 0.2 μg L-1. The recoveries varied from 86.52% to 101.47% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) less than 8.59%.

This modality is based on monitoring the quenching of the luminescence intensity at 790 nm of the phthalocyanine fluorophore, in a nanocomposite comprising the fluorophore and cationic polystyrene, which results from interaction with CA 125. The remarkable quenching of the luminescence intensity of the Ni-phthalocyanine complex doped in PS matrix by various concentrations of CA 125 was successfully utilized as an optical sensor for the determination of CA 125 in different serum samples of ovarian disease. The performance of the designed biosensor is determined through monitoring the quenching of the luminescence intensity at 790 nm by cancer antigen 125 after excitation at 685 nm, pH 7.3 in water. The calibration plot was achieved over the concentration range 1.0 × 10-2 - 127 U mL-1 CA-125 with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 and detection limit of 1.0 × 10-4 U mL-1.

The objective of this work was to get the successful resolution of the complex matrix with minimum experimental time in the presence of highly overlapping peaks, of distortions in the time and baseline aspects among chromatograms, and of the presence of unknown and background interferences. All the analysis were based on a short C18 column with the chromatographic system operating in isocratic mode and all analytes can be successfully quantified within 6 min. The second-order HPLC-DAD data acquired were handled intelligently by two typical chemometrics tools including alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). Reasonable resolution and satisfactory quantification results were obtained regardless of the complex matrix interferences from the urine samples and the second-order advantage was fully exploited. With the validation by classic HPLC method, the proposed strategy could take extra advantages such as increased selectivity and sensitivity, shorter analysis time, undemanding elution conditions and sufficiency of lower limit of quantification benefit from multivariate calibration. The method was shown as a promising means for fast and sensitive determination of small molecules in human urine and also for fast diagnosis or surveillance in related diseases.","Isocyanonaphthalenes as extremely low molecular weight, selective, ratiometric fluorescent probes for Mercury(II).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122408,Talanta,2019 05 29,"The specially designed chemical structure of our recently developed solvatochromic amino-isocyanonaphthalene (ICAN) dye family enables the selective detection of Hg2+ and at the same time is able to indicate the presence of Ag+. In addition to its easy preparation and nontoxic nature, ICAN is the lowest molecular weight dye reported for ratiometric fluorescent Hg2+ detection in water, so far. The basis of this double selectivity is the reduction of the isonitrile moiety to amine by a chemical reaction with Hg2+ resulting in a greater than 100 nm hypsochromic shift (and switch on of fluorescence) of the emission maximum relative to ICAN, whereas the complexation of Ag+ with the NC group yields an approximately 20 nm bathochromic shift (and quenching). In contrast, other common ions have little effect on the position of the emission maximum in aqueous medium. In completely aqueous medium at pH = 6, the limit of quantification was found to be lower than 17 nM and the limit of detection lower than 6 nM for Hg2+. The practical applicability of the method was demonstrated on dental amalgam.",7-(Diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxylic acid as derivatization reagent for 405 nm laser-induced fluorescence detection: A case study for the analysis of sulfonamides by capillary electrophoresis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122407,Talanta,2019 05 29,"Diode lasers, especially 405 nm diode laser, as excitation sources offer new opportunities for laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, but the lack of available derivatization reagents limits their widespread applications. Herein, a commercial fluorescent dye, 7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (DEAC-C) was introduced as derivatization reagent and corresponding derivatization strategy for DEAC-C labeling sulfonamides was developed for 405 nm LIF detection. After systematic optimization, three sulfonamides including hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), chlorothiazide (CTZ) and chlortalidone (CTD) could be efficiently labeled by DEAC-C in the presence of cyanuric chloride and triethylamine (1.5%) in acetonitrile at 50 °C for 180 min. Based on the laboratory-built capillary electrophoresis-LIF system, a robust method was then proposed for the separation of DEAC-C labeled sulfonamides by micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) using the classic borax-SDS system. Under the optimized conditions, a baseline separation of three sulfonamides was achieved within 15 min, and the detection limits were determined to be 0.24, 0.29, and 0.23 nM for HCTZ, CTZ, and CTD, respectively.

Because of ERGO perfect electrochemical conductivity and large surface area, it was first modified on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface by electrochemical reduction. NiHCF NPs were immobilized on ERGO/GCE as a signal probe with well-defined peaks and good stability. Subsequently, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) were electrodeposited on NiHCF NPs/ERGO to anchored aptamer and increase the conductivity and stability of the electrode. When ATZ was added, ATZ-aptamer complexes generated with poor conductivity on the sensor surface increased the hindrance of electron transfer, leading to electrochemical signal decrease. The signal change was used to detect ATZ quantitatively. The designed aptasensor exhibited good analytical performance for determining ATZ. A linear curve was obtained in the range of 0.25-250 pM with a low detection limit of 0.1 pM, and it showed perfect selectivity for ATZ in the presence of diverse interferents. Meanwhile, the electrochemical aptasensor was employed to evaluate ATZ content in the samples.",Single-point calibration and standard addition assays on calibrant-loaded paper-based analytical devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122405,Talanta,2019 05 29,"This article describes a new, simplified approach for performing quantitative colorimetric assays on paper-based analytical devices that uses calibrant-loaded paper devices to perform external calibration and standard addition calibration using one calibration point. Calibrant-loaded devices consist of sensing areas pre-loaded with a colored product which is produced from the reaction of a standard solution of the analyte with the appropriate colorimetric reagents. When the sample is added into the calibrant-loaded sensing zone the analytical signal (i.e. color intensity) increases proportionally to the concentration of the analyte in the tested sample. The total measured signal corresponds to the sum of the concentration of the analyte in the sample and the standard solution pre-stored in the device and is used to calculate the concentration of the analyte in the sample based on the principles of linear calibration. The applicability of this approach was benchmarked in three colorimetric assays (i.e., for the determination of iron, nickel, and amino acids) that use different reaction chemistries. This work demonstrates a simplified calibration-free approach for assays performed on paper-based analytical devices that requires minimum experimental and computational effort, it can be used for either external or standard addition calibration and can be used to identify and eliminate the presence of interferences in a sample."

G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) through β-arrestins (β-arrs), which serve as intracellular signaling molecules, integrate different pathways to control multiple aspects of metastatic process. As primary component of a core-scaffold, β-arr-dependent signaling represents a mean to direct spatiotemporal specificity of multi-protein complexes in invasion and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Under this paradigm, β-arrs engage a growing number of signaling molecules and organizing protein networks controlling multiple pathways, and cytoskeleton modifications, permitting adaptation to the tumor microenvironment to sustain metastatic dissemination. These findings implicate GPCR/β-arr function as a regulatory tethering hub to orchestrate diverse cellular mechanisms of cancer cell migration and invasion that are critical for metastatic progression.

Alterations to the integrity of the enamel and dentine through processes of trauma, decay and toothwear can increase dentine permeability. This gives rise to symptoms of sensitivity as dentinal fluid movement in response to thermal, chemical and mechanical cues stimulate the pulpal Aδ fibres. Restorative procedures can also rapidly change the architecture of the protective enamel and dentine layers leading to pulpal inflammation and increased thermal sensitivity of the tooth.<br/> Patient-reported symptoms of dentine hypersensitivity can be attributed to a number of possible causes and a definitive diagnosis can therefore be difficult. A full history including social and medical factors such as occupation, diet and/or medication is likely to provide significant information to aid a diagnosis. Consideration of occlusal factors should not be overlooked as these may contribute to symptoms arising from a cracked tooth.<br/> Management strategies are linked to the diagnosis - from topically applied desensitising pastes and resin bonding agents to direct restorations and possibly more advanced restorative procedures such as root canal treatment.

Based on the results, the Pilates exercises could improve the NME of the muscles tested, since the torque increased and the EMG activity decreased after the intervention.",The Difference in Lower Limb Landing Kinematics Between Adolescent Dancers and Non-Dancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122316,Journal of dance medicine & science : official publication of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science,2019 05 24,"The high prevalence of lower limb overuse injuries among adolescent ballet dancers may be due in part to repetitive land- ings. This cross-sectional study compared how adolescent ballet dancers perform a drop-landing task in comparison to non-dancers in order to help understand injury mechanics. Fifteen adolescent female ballet dancers aged 11.9 ± 1.1 years and 17 non-dancers aged 10.9 ± 0.9 years each performed three single limb drop-landings from a 30 cm box. An 18-camera motion capture system (Vicon MX; Oxford Metrics, Oxford, UK; 250 Hz) and a force platform (Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., Watertown, Massachusetts, USA; 2,000 Hz) were used to collect lower limb joint angles in all three planes of motion and peak vertical ground reaction forces during the landing phase. These variables were compared for the two sets of participants using independent samples t-tests (p < 0.01). While the dancers landed with greater sagittal plane range of motion, this appeared to provide no mechanical advantage with no reduction in ground reaction force. Rather, the increased sagittal range of motion was coupled with increased coronal and frontal plane motion. This may place dancers at increased risk of injury.",Biopsychosocial Characteristics of Contemporary and Irish University-Level Student Dancers A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122315,Journal of dance medicine & science : official publication of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science,2019 05 24,"In addition to the difficulties encountered by non-dancing university students, university-level dancers may encounter a range of challenges due to their status as aesthetic athletes. This pilot study compares the biopsychosocial characteristics of contemporary dance (CD) and Irish dance (ID) university students. CD (N = 30) and ID (N = 27) participants from institutions in Ireland and the United Kingdom were screened using a host of subjective and objective tools to establish baseline biopsychosocial characteristics. Participants also provided extensive information regarding their injury history over the previous year. The groups were compared using simple descriptive statistics, independent t-test or Mann Whitney U tests and chi-square tests as appropriate. CD participants danced for significantly more hours each week (p < 0.001) than the ID group, who spent significantly less time warming up (p < 0.001) and more time engaged in weekly non-dance-related physical activities (p = 0.022). CD participants performed significantly better that the ID group on the Star Excursion Balance Test (p = < 0.001), plank-hold (p = 0.004), and fitness test (p = 0.045). Substantial rates of injury were reported by both groups, with no significant difference in terms of number of injuries or days lost to injury (p > 0.05). Indications of a shared dancer mentality including ego-driven motivation, passion for dance, and lower mood were present and required vigilance on the part of teachers and coaches to mitigate possible negative physical and psychological consequences. Additionally, CD participants demonstrated higher levels of catastrophizing (p = 0.019) and reported significantly more subjective health complaints (p = 0.010) than the ID group."

Camelina meal (Camelina sativa) is an animal feedstuff used to achieve this goal, but the administration of n-3 PUFA-enriched diets in broiler nutrition can accelerate the oxidative processes in meat leading to a decreased quality of final product. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the organic Cr as chromium picolinate (CrPic) on meat quality, fatty acid profile of fat and oxidative stability of meat from broilers fed supplemented dietary Camelina meal. An experiment was conducted on 240 Ross 308 broiler chicken aged 14 days which were assigned to 6 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement. Within the treatment arrangement two concentrations of Camelina meal (0% and 3%) and three concentrations of Cr3+ (0, 200 and 400 μg/kg) were used. Dietary treatments were: (1) Control diet (C) containing a corn-soybean diet with no added Camelina meal or Cr3+; (2) a C diet containing an additional 200 μg/kg of Cr3+ as CrPic; (3) a C diet containing an additional 400 μg/kg of Cr3+ as CrPic; (4) a C diet containing an additional 3% Camelina meal; (5) diet 2 containing an additional 3% Camelina meal; (6) diet 3 containing an additional 3% Camelina meal. Chromium supplementation significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased the CP concentrations and significantly (P&lt;0.05) decreased the crude fat concentrations in breast samples. The Camelina meal groups presented higher values of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly n-3 fatty acids (P&lt;0.05). In CrPic groups, increased retention of Zn and Fe (P &lt; 0.05) was observed in breast samples, compared to control group, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values were significantly (P&lt;0.05) smaller. Myoglobin fraction (metmyoglobin and oximyoglobin) concentrations differ significantly (P&lt;0.05) from the control group, under the influence of Cr3+ supplements.

The composition of nutrients has changed markedly in recent decades which may contribute to the increased prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Fat is an important component of the diet which comes in various forms with fatty acids (FA) of different carbon chain lengths and saturation degrees. In addition to being an energy supply, FA function as potent signalling molecules and influence transcriptional activity. Among other tissues, dietary FA target white adipose tissue function, which is central in maintaining metabolic health. This review focuses on the possible role of dietary FA composition and its effect on human white adipose tissue expandability and transcriptional response. Altogether, the existing literature suggests that unsaturated fat has more benign effects on adipose tissue distribution when compared to long-chain saturated fat. However, the mechanisms of action remain poorly characterised.",Septin6 regulates cell growth and casein synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells via mTORC1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122298,The Journal of dairy research,2019 05 24,"This research paper addresses the hypothesis that Septin6 is a key regulatory factor influencing amino acid (AA)-mediated cell growth and casein synthesis in dairy cow mammary epithelial cells (DCMECs). DCMECs were treated with absence of AA (AA-), restricted concentrations of AA (AAr) or normal concentrations of AA (AA+) for 24 h. Cell growth, expression of CSN2 and Septin6 were increased in response to AA supply. Overexpressing or inhibiting Septin6 demonstrated that cell growth, expression of CSN2, mTOR, p-mTOR, S6K1 and p-S6K1 were up-regulated by Septin6. Furthermore, overexpressing or inhibiting mTOR demonstrated that the increase in cell growth and expression of CSN2 in response to Septin6 overexpression were inhibited by mTOR inhibition, and vice versa. Our hypothesis was supported; we were able to show that Septin6 is an important positive factor for cell growth and casein synthesis, it up-regulates AA-mediated cell growth and casein synthesis through activating mTORC1 pathway in DCMECs.",Optimizing prostate cancer accumulating model: combined PI-RADS v2 with prostate specific antigen and its derivative data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122297,Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society,2019 06 10,To establish a new accumulating model to enhance the accuracy of prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis by incorporating prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and its derivative data into the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2).,"Etanercept treatment for extended oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, enthesitis-related arthritis, or psoriatic arthritis: 6-year efficacy and safety data from an open-label trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122296,Arthritis research & therapy,2019 06 10,"To describe the 6-year safety and efficacy of etanercept (ETN) in children with extended oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (eoJIA), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) METHODS: Patients who completed the 2-year, open-label, phase III CLinical Study In Pediatric Patients of Etanercept for Treatment of ERA, PsA, and Extended Oligoarthritis (CLIPPER) were allowed to enroll in its 8-year long-term extension (CLIPPER2).

Bypassing the apoptotic pathway to induce cancer cell death is considered to be a promising approach to overcoming this problem. Necroptosis is a regulated necrotic cell death modality in a caspase-independent fashion and is mainly mediated by ﻿Receptor-Interacting Protein 1 (RIP1), RIP3, and Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like (MLKL). Necroptosis serves as an alternative mode of programmed cell death overcoming apoptosis resistance and may trigger and amplify antitumor immunity in cancer therapy.The role of necroptosis in cancer is complicated. The expression of key regulators of the necroptotic pathway is generally downregulated in cancer cells, suggesting that cancer cells may also evade necroptosis to survive; however, in certain types of cancer, the expression level of key mediators is elevated. Necroptosis can elicit strong adaptive immune responses that may defend against tumor progression; however, the recruited inflammatory response may also promote tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis, and necroptosis may generate an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Necroptosis also reportedly promotes oncogenesis and cancer metastasis despite evidence demonstrating its antimetastatic role in cancer. In addition, necroptotic microenvironments can direct lineage commitment to determine cancer subtype development in liver cancer. A plethora of compounds and drugs targeting necroptosis exhibit potential antitumor efficacy, but their clinical feasibility must be validated.Better knowledge of the necroptotic pathway mechanism and its physiological and pathological functions is urgently required to solve the remaining mysteries surrounding the role of necroptosis in cancer.

Many studies have pointed towards the engineered yeast not sensing that xylose is a fermentable carbon source despite growing and fermenting on it, which is paradoxical. We have previously used fluorescent biosensor strains to in vivo monitor the sugar signalome in yeast engineered with xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase (XR/XDH) and have established that S. cerevisiae senses high concentrations of xylose with the same signal as low concentration of glucose, which may explain the poor utilization."

In this paper, I will flesh out the transformation noted by Golinski of chemistry into a respectable discipline under Davy's tenure at the Royal Institution. The dissociation of chemistry from radical politics was achieved through the influence of Davy's upper-class, female-audience at the Institution. Davy's audience wanted chivalry, therefore Davy made his chemistry chivalrous. To borrow from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's (1772-1834) assessment of his friend in 1804, Davy was ""more and more determined to mould himself upon the age in order to make the age mould itself upon him.""",Quantifying the presence of evidential value and selective reporting in food-related inhibitory control training: a p-curve analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122177,Health psychology review,2019 06 05,"Meta-analyses suggest inhibitory control training (ICT) may be effective for reducing food intake. However, psychological research has come under scrutiny for lack of reliability. Selective reporting (only reporting significant results) is one factor contributing to the lack of reliability in published research. Therefore, estimates of food-related ICT effects may be inaccurate. We conducted p-curve analyses to assess the presence of selective reporting, evidential value, average effect size, and power in the food-related ICT literature. Extracted p-values were selected from articles included in food-related ICT meta-analyses and an updated literature search. Four p-curve analyses resulted in 'U'-shaped distributions, suggesting evidence for both a true underlying effect and selective reporting in the food-related ICT literature. Robust analyses suggested the evidence for an underlying effect was primarily driven by the smallest p-value. The average effect size from included studies was small (d = 0.04 to 0.25). Average power to detect this effect was also small (7% to 18%). Results suggest no clear support for or against a true effect for food-related ICT. Low average effect size and power across studies suggests estimated effects are likely inflated in published literature. Higher-powered, pre-registered, longitudinal food-related ICT studies are needed to test for the presence and magnitude of ICT effects.",A tension-independent mechanism reduces Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation upon microtubule capture by CENP-E at the kinetochore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122175,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 06 14,"During mitosis, Aurora B kinase is required for forming proper bi-oriented kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Current models suggest that tension exerted between a pair of sister-kinetochores (inter-kinetochore stretch) produces a spatial separation of Aurora B kinase from kinetochore-associated microtubule binding substrates, such as the Knl1-Mis12-Ndc80 (KMN) network, resulting in a decrease of phosphorylation and, thus, an increase of affinity for microtubules. Using Single-Molecule High-Resolution Colocalization (SHREC) microscopy analysis of the kinetochore-associated motor CENP-E, we now show that CENP-E undergoes structural rearrangements prior to and after tension generation at the kinetochore, and displays a bi-modal Gaussian distribution on a pair of bi-oriented sister kinetochores. The conformational change of CENP-E depends on its microtubule-stimulated motor motility and the highly flexible coiled-coil between its motor and kinetochore-binding tail domains. Chemical inhibition of the motor motility or perturbations of the coiled-coil domain of CENP-E increases Aurora B-mediated Ndc80 phosphorylation in a tension-independent manner. Metaphase chromosome misalignment caused by CENP-E inhibition can be rescued by chemical inhibition of Aurora B kinase. Furthermore, a pair of monotelic sister-kinetochores shows asymmetric levels of Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation in mono-polar spindles depending on CENP-E motor activity. These results collectively suggest a tension-independent mechanism to reduce Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of outer kinetochore components in response to microtubule capture by CENP-E."

In this context, restraint and seclusion (R&S) are seen as ""last resort"" strategies for educators to manage youth aggression. The use of R&S is controversial, as they can lead to psychological and physical consequences for both the client and the care provider and have yet to be empirically validated as therapeutic. The objectives of this systematic review are to identify the factors related to R&S use in RTCs for youth and to review the interventions aiming to reduce the use of R&S. The identification of these factors is the first step to gaining a better understanding of the decision-making process leading to the use of R&S and ultimately to reducing the use of these strategies to a minimum. Thus, the present systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, and PsycNET for articles published between 2002 and 2017. Key words used were synonyms of R&S, youth, and RTCs. Thirty-one studies met the inclusion criteria: must report on factors affecting the use of R&S in RTCs, must be conducted in RTCs for youth under the age of 21, and must report on original and empirical data. Factors related to the characteristics of the client, the care provider, and the environment, as well as to the implementation of programs for the reduction of R&S, were found to influence the use of R&S in RTCs.

Serum concentrations of type 1 collagen synthesis (aminoterminal propeptide (PINP)) and degradation markers (carboxyterminal telopeptide (ICTP)) have previously been studied in early and metastatic breast cancer, but no data are available on specific breast cancer subtypes. We assayed 662 preoperative serum samples for PINP and ICTP and 109 postoperative serum samples for ICTP. The results were linked to prospectively collected clinical data and the cases were divided into breast cancer subtypes for survival analyses. The concentrations of both pre- and postoperative ICTP serum levels increased linearly from ductal in situ carcinoma to stage I-II tumors, stage III tumors, and finally to those with concomitant primary metastases (preoperative ICTP, p = 0.009; postoperative ICTP, p = 0.016). High-preoperative ICTP levels were associated with better breast cancer-specific survival in connection with luminal-B-like (HER2-negative) tumors (p = 0.017), which was confirmed in Cox regression analysis (relative risk = 3.127; 95% confidence interval = 1.081-9.049, p = 0.035), when T-class (relative risk = 4.049; 95% confidence interval = 1.263-12.981; p = 0.019) and nodal status (relative risk = 3.896; 95% confidence interval = 1.088-13.959; p = 0.037) were included in the analysis. In patients with triple-negative breast cancer, a high-preoperative ICTP level was a significant predictor of local relapse-free survival in univariate (p = 0.0020) and multivariate analyses (relative risk = 13.04; 95% confidence interval = 1.354-125.5; p = 0.026; for T-class, relative risk = 2.128 and 95% confidence interval = 0.297-15.23; p = 0.452; for N-class, relative risk = 0.332 and 95% confidence interval = 0.033-3.307; p = 0.347). A preoperatively elevated serum ICTP level appears to be an important marker of better prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer and luminal-B-like (HER2-negative) subtypes.",Healthy Recovery: A Pilot Study of a Smoking and Other Health Behavior Change Intervention for People Attending Residential Alcohol and Other Substance Dependence Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122158,Journal of dual diagnosis,2019 05 24,"Objective: It is common for people attending alcohol and other substance dependence treatment to present with multiple unhealthy lifestyle behaviors such as high rates of smoking, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Healthy lifestyle interventions are increasing in importance in the general population, but have been underexamined within alcohol and other substance use populations. The purpose of the current study was to pilot ""Healthy Recovery,"" a group program that primarily aimed to help people attending alcohol or other substance dependence treatment to reduce or quit smoking. The program also encourages participants to increase physical activity and to eat more servings of fruit and vegetables. Methods: The current study was conducted as a non-randomized controlled pilot trial. All participants were attending residential substance dependence treatment provided by the Australian Salvation Army. In addition to treatment as usual, participants in the treatment condition completed Healthy Recovery (n = 50) and participants in the control group completed an online depression program (n = 27). The study examined the health outcomes of participants (i.e., smoking, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and symptom distress) and the feasibility of running the group sessions within the residential facilities. Results: Within-treatment effects demonstrated medium to large positive effects for reductions in smoking and increases in physical activity, servings of fruit, and servings of vegetables for people completing Healthy Recovery. When compared to the control condition, there were medium effects in favor of the Healthy Recovery condition for reductions in smoking and increases in physical activity. There was a small effect for servings of fruit and no effect for servings of vegetables. Conclusions: Results from this study demonstrated that people attending residential substance dependence treatment are willing and capable of engaging in multiple health behavior change interventions.",The professional and personal characteristics of effective psychotherapists: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122157,Psychotherapy research : journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research,2019 05 24,"Objective: Psychotherapists differ notably in the outcomes their patients achieve, and the characteristics that may explain these differences have attracted increasing interest. We systematically review studies on therapist pre-treatment characteristics predicting patient outcomes. Method: Systematic searches on databases for psychotherapy research, clinical psychology, and medical science for the years 2000-2018 identified published research examining therapist characteristics and psychotherapy outcomes. Of 2041 studies, 31 met inclusion criteria. Results: Findings show a few direct effects of therapist intrapersonal variables (e.g., self-relatedness, attachment) and several interaction effects with other constructs (e.g., patient pathology) on outcome. There is little support for the relevance of self-rated social skills. However, more consistent evidence has recently emerged for performance-based measurements of professional interpersonal skills, especially when elicited in challenging situations. Patient outcomes were also predicted by therapists' self-rated professional characteristics, such as their experienced difficulties in practice, coping mechanisms, and attitudes towards therapeutic work, indicating that therapist self-perception also matters, although not always in the direction expected. Conclusions: More effective therapists seem characterized by professionally cultivated interpersonal capacities, which are likely rooted in their personal lives and attachment history. Research guidelines are proposed for moving this field forward (including larger samples, multilevel modeling, and in-depth qualitative work).",Effect of litter aggregation and pooling on detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus in piglet processing fluids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122156,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",2019 05 24,"A sampling technique has been validated to monitor porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 2 (PRRSV-2) using the serosanguinous exudate known as processing fluids (PFs) that accumulate from tissues obtained during tail docking and castration. PFs are an aggregate sample of large numbers of piglets and litters. However, little is known about the effect of litter aggregation on the ability of PCR to correctly classify an aggregated PF sample as positive. We evaluated both the effect of litter aggregation and of PF pooling on PCR detection. We estimated that aggregation of at least 50 litters was possible when a pig with a Ct value of ~22 was present in the sample, and aggregation of up to 40 litters was possible when there was a sample with a Ct value of ~33. Pooling did not affect PCR detection when initial Ct values of 20 and 25 were assessed. However, in litters with initial Ct values of ≥30, the amount of pooling should be reduced. Our results provide producers and practitioners with a general framework to interpret more accurately the results of their PRRSV-2 surveillance programs using PF.",Preparation of nanocellulose and its potential in reinforced composites: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122154,Journal of biomaterials science.

It has a wide spectrum of applications ranging from biomarker discovery to drug response studies. MSI can be adapted to the clinical settings due to its ability to combine mass spectrometry and histological data. Areas covered: The major obstacle to adapt MSI into clinical settings arises from the limited standardization in MSI experiments. We aimed to review the multi-site studies in MSI specifically focusing on reproducibility. Additionally, we emphasized the necessity of quality assessments in MSI for its potential usage in clinical settings. Expert opinion: We discuss how important it is to follow optimized and standardized workflows in MSI and conduct potential quality assessments at important stages in order to adapt MSI into clinical applications.",Evaluation of skin-mounted sensor for head impact measurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122140,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine",2019 06 14,"The requirement to measure the number and severity of head impacts in sports has led to the development of many wearable sensors. The objective of this study was to determine the reliability and accuracy of a wearable head impact sensor: xPatch, X2Biosystems, Inc. The skin-mounted sensor, xPatch, was fixed onto a Hybrid III headform and dropped using an impact test rig. A total of 400 impacts were performed, ranging from 20g to 200g linear acceleration, and impact velocities of 1.2 - 3.9 m/s. During each impact, the peak linear acceleration, angular velocity and angular acceleration were recorded and compared to the reference calibrated data. Impacts were also recorded using a high-speed video camera. The results show that the linear acceleration recorded by the xPatch during frontal and side impacts had errors of up to 24% when compared to the referenced data. The angular velocity and angular acceleration had substantially larger errors of up to 47.5% and 57%, respectively. The location of the impact had a significant effect on the results: if the impact was to the side of the head, the device on that side may have an error of up to 71%, thus highlighting the importance of device location. All impacts were recorded using two separate xPatches and, in certain cases, the difference in angular velocity between the devices was 43%. In conclusion, the xPatch can be useful for identifying impacts and recording linear accelerations during front and side impacts, but the rotational velocity and acceleration data need to be interpreted with caution.",Does Stereotype Threat Deteriorate Academic Performance of High School Students With Learning Disabilities? The Buffering Role of Psychological Disengagement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122139,Journal of learning disabilities,2019 05 24,"The academic underperformance of high school students with learning disabilities may reduce their access to higher education and decrease their employment opportunities. Based on stereotype threat hypothesis, the present study examined the role of stereotype threat in academic performance among adolescents with learning disabilities and the moderating role of psychological disengagement in this relation. In Study 1, 120 students with learning disabilities finished the measures of stereotype threat vulnerability and psychological disengagement, and their academic score at two time points were collected. Results showed that students who are more vulnerable to stereotype threat tend to have a lower academic score at Time 2 even after controlling for academic score at Time 1, and this relation was moderated by psychological disengagement. In Study 2, 62 sophomore students with learning disabilities finished measures of stereotype threat, academic persistence, and psychological disengagement. The results showed that the effect of stereotype threat on academic persistence was significant among students who were of low psychological disengagement, while this effect was not significant among students who were psychologically disengaged in academics. These results emphasize the individual differences of learning disabled students' response to stereotype threat and have significant implications for framing targeted interventions.",Is more emotional clarity always better? An examination of curvilinear and moderated associations between emotional clarity and internalising symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122138,Cognition & emotion,2019 05 24,"Low emotional clarity has been a target for psychological interventions due to its association with increased internalising symptoms. However, theory suggests that very high emotional clarity may also lead to increased symptoms, particularly in combination with high levels of neuroticism. As an initial empirical test of this hypothesis, the present study examined curvilinear associations of emotional clarity with internalising symptoms (i.e. dysphoria, social anxiety, panic, traumatic intrusions) and a moderating role of neuroticism/negative affect in the association across two student samples and two clinical samples (total N = 920). Evidence of curvilinear associations and moderation varied across samples, with some supporting evidence in three samples. Specifically, neuroticism/negative affect moderated the curvilinear association of emotional clarity with traumatic intrusions in Clinical Sample 2 as well as the linear association between emotional clarity and dysphoria in Student Sample 2 and Clinical Sample 1. Simple slope analyses indicated that high emotional clarity was not consistently associated with lower symptoms. Also, the hypothesised quadratic effects of emotional clarity were found in Student Sample 2 and Clinical Sample 1 for panic, and in Clinical Sample 1 for dysphoria. Implications and limitations of these findings for conceptualisations of emotional clarity and current treatments were discussed.",Clinical features and genetic characteristics of two Chinese pedigrees with fatal family insomnia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122137,Prion,2019 05 24,"Background: Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare autosomal-dominant inherited prion disease characterized clinically by severe sleep disorder, motor signs, dysautonomia and abnormal behaviour. FFI is caused by a missense mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene (PRNP). Our study is aimed to explore typical clinical and genetic features of two Chinese pedigrees with FFI and review the related literatures. Methods: Two FFI cases with family histories were recruited in our study. The main clinical features, genetic features and possible pathophysiologic mechanisms of these two FFI cases were analysed. Results: The foremost symptoms seemed to be sleep disturbances and psychosis. Progressive sympathetic symptoms, movement disturbances and memory loss were frequently observed as well. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed a minor slowing without periodic triphasic waves. Polysomnography (PSG) showed reduction in total sleep time and disturbance of sleep-related respiratory. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal obvious abnormality. Genetic analysis disclosed the prion protein gene mutation at codon 178 (D178N), with methionine (Met) homozygosity at the polymorphic position 129 (Met129Met). Conclusions: The major clinical features of Chinese FFI are sleep dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms and sympathetic symptoms.

Stool donors are essential, but difficult to recruit and retain. We aimed to identify factors influencing willingness to donate stool. This multi-center study with a 32-item questionnaire targeted young adults and health care workers via social media and university email lists in Edmonton and Kingston, Canada; London and Nottingham, England; and Indianapolis and Boston, USA. Items included baseline demographics and FMT knowledge and perception. Investigated motivators and deterrents included economic compensation, screening process, time commitment, and stool donation logistics. Logistic regression and linear regression models estimated associations of study variables with self-assessed willingness to donate stool. 802 respondents completed our questionnaire: 387 (48.3%) age 21-30 years, 573 (71.4%) female, 323 (40%) health care workers. Country of residence, age and occupation were not associated with willingness to donate stool. Factors increasing willingness to donate were: already a blood donor (OR 1.64), male, altruism, economic benefit, knowledge of how FMT can help patients (OR 1.32), and positive attitudes towards FMT (OR 1.39). Factors decreasing willingness to donate were: stool collection unpleasant (OR 0.92), screening process invasive (OR 0.92), higher stool donation frequency, negative social perception of stool, and logistics of collection/transporting feces. We conclude that 1) blood donors and males are more willing to consider stool donation; 2) altruism, economic compensation, and positive feedback are motivators; and 3) screening process, high donation frequency, logistics of collection/transporting feces, lack of public awareness, and negative social perception are deterrents. Considering these variables could maximize donor recruitment and retention.",De novo discovery of antibody drugs - great promise demands scrutiny.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122133,mAbs,2019 06 07,"We live in an era of rapidly advancing computing capacity and algorithmic sophistication. ""Big data"" and ""artificial intelligence""find progressively wider use in all spheres of human activity, including healthcare. A diverse array of computational technologies is being applied with increasing frequency to antibody drug research and development (R&D). Their successful applications are met with great interest due to the potential for accelerating and streamlining the antibody R&D process. While this excitement is very likely justified in the long term, it is less likely that the transition from the first use to routine practice will escape challenges that other new technologies had experienced before they began to blossom. This transition typically requires many cycles of iterative learning that rely on the deconstruction of the technology to understand its pitfalls and define vectors for optimization. The study by Vasquez et al. identifies a key obstacle to such learning: the lack of transparency regarding methodology in computational antibody design reports, which has the potential to mislead the community efforts.","Production, characterization, and in vivo half-life extension of polymeric IgA molecules in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122132,mAbs,2019 06 10,"IgA antibodies have broad potential as a novel therapeutic platform based on their superior receptor-mediated cytotoxic activity, potent neutralization of pathogens, and ability to transcytose across mucosal barriers via polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)-mediated transport, compared to traditional IgG-based drugs. However, the transition of IgA into clinical development has been challenged by complex expression and characterization, as well as rapid serum clearance that is thought to be mediated by glycan receptor scavenging of recombinantly produced IgA monomer bearing incompletely sialylated N-linked glycans. Here, we present a comprehensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization of recombinantly produced monomeric, dimeric and polymeric human IgA. We further explore two strategies to overcome the rapid serum clearance of polymeric IgA: removal of all N-linked glycosylation sites creating an aglycosylated polymeric IgA and engineering in FcRn binding with the generation of a polymeric IgG-IgA Fc fusion. While previous reports and the results presented in this study indicate that glycan-mediated clearance plays a major role for monomeric IgA, systemic clearance of polymeric IgA in mice is predominantly controlled by mechanisms other than glycan receptor clearance, such as pIgR-mediated transcytosis. The developed IgA platform now provides the potential to specifically target pIgR expressing tissues, while maintaining low systemic exposure."

Previous studies on internal organ amyloid deposition in AGel amyloidosis have been based on small patient series. Methods: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 25 autopsied individuals (age at death 44.4-88.6 years) with AGel amyloidosis were stained with HE, Congo red and Herovici stains and immunohistochemistry against the low molecular weight gelsolin fraction was performed. The amount of amyloid was estimated semi-quantitatively. Results: AGel-based amyloid deposits were found in the myocardium and cardiac blood vessels in every patient. The deposits were mainly small and co-localized with regions with excess fibrosis in the myocardium. The lungs were positive for amyloid in 79%, renal parenchyma in 54% and renal blood vessels in 71% of the cases. The amount of myocardial, renal and hepatic amyloid correlated with age at death of the patients. Conclusions: We show the constant presence of AGel amyloid in the hearts of patients with AGel amyloidosis. Although the deposits were mainly small, the co-localization of amyloid with fibrosis may amplify the effect of pure amyloid deposition, possibly leading to clinical signs and symptoms.",Clinical Pharmacists in Correctional Facilities: A Literature Review and Future Directions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122114,Journal of correctional health care : the official journal of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care,2019 05 24,"The role of pharmacists has undergone a significant transformation.

Objective: The present investigation aimed to determine the evolution of morphological characteristics of elite paddlers during adolescence and to compare them with the values exhibited by Olympic competitors. Methods: In a longitudinal study, thirteen young elite paddlers (seven boys and six girls) completed a battery of anthropometric tests (heights, weight, girths, lengths, and sum of skinfolds) and on-water performance assessments (200 and 500 m) during three consecutive years. Results: Body mass and upper body sizes significantly change over the years (p < .05), especially in boys. Both male and female paddlers presented significant differences and large effect sizes in muscle mass and skin mass values (η2p > .64) whereas bone mass and fat mass remained stable from the 1st to the 3rd year. Proportionality analysis revealed girths and breadths differences in arm and chest variables as well as large effect sizes in biacromial breadth among all years (η2p > .62; p < .05), particularly in boys. Similarly, significant improvements in 200-m performance times were observed for both sexes. Conclusions: The findings of the current investigation might suggest a tendency towards a leaner and more robust morphological profile of elite paddlers in the transition from young to senior categories. In addition, the presence of superior relative body dimensions from young categories seems to be paramount in the evolution to later successful paddling.",Quantitative parametric maps of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine kinetics in diffuse glioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122112,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2019 05 24,"Quantitative parametric images of O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine kinetics in diffuse gliomas could be used to improve glioma grading, tumour delineation or the assessment of the uptake distribution of this positron emission tomography tracer.

We included plasma input methods (the basis function implementation of the single-tissue compartment model, spectral analysis and Logan graphical analysis) and reference tissue methods (basis function implementations of the simplified reference tissue model, variations of the multilinear reference tissue model and non-invasive Logan graphical analysis) as well as tumour-to-normal ratio maps at three intervals. (Non-invasive) Logan graphical analysis provided volume of distribution maps and distribution volume ratio maps with the lowest level of noise, while the basis function implementations provided the best accuracy. Tumour-to-normal ratio maps provided better results if later interval times were used, i.e. 60-90 min instead of 20-40 min, leading to lower bias (2.9% vs. 10.8%, respectively) and less noise (12.8% vs. 14.4%).",Functional Exercise Improves Mobility Performance in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122111,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 06 05,"Background: Diabetes-related disability occurs in approximately two-thirds of older adults with diabetes and is associated with loss of independence, increased health care resource utilization, and sedentary lifestyle.

Methods: Participants (n = 111; mean age 70.5 [7.1] y; mean body mass index 32.7 [5.9] kg/m2) were randomized to either a moderate-intensity functional circuit training (FCT) plus 10-week home program to optimize physical activity (FCT-PA) primary intervention or one of 2 comparison groups (FCT plus health education [FCT-HE] or flexibility and toning plus health education [FT-HE]). Results: Compared with FT-HE, FCT-PA improvements in comfortable gait speed of 0.1 m/s (P < .05) and 6-minute walk of 80 ft were consistent with estimates of clinically meaningful change. At 20 weeks, controlling for 10-week outcomes, improvements were found between groups for comfortable gait speed (FCT-PA vs FT-HE and FCT-HE vs FT-HE) and 6-minute walk (FCT-PA vs FCT-HE).

This is particularly true when the reconstruction of extensive metastatic bone defect is planned. Modeling complex three-dimensional-printed highly repetitive trabecular-like structures based on finite elements is computationally demanding, while homogenization algorithms offer the advantage of reduced simulation cost and time, allowing an effective evaluation of new personalized design suitable for clinical needs. This article describes and discusses the implementation of a reliable method for the multiscale modeling of trabecular structures by means of asymptotic expansion homogenization. Following the material characterization of the Ti6Al4V alloy obtained by electron beam melting technology, the asymptotic expansion homogenization was applied to two alternative low-density cell-unit designs. Model predictions demonstrated satisfactory agreement with compressive experimental tests and cantilever bending tests performed on both designs (differences lower than 5.5%). The method was extended to a real patient-specific hemipelvis reconstruction, exploiting the capability of the asymptotic expansion homogenization approach in quantitatively describing the effect of cell-unit designs and three-dimensional-printing stack direction (i.e. cell-unit orientation) both on the overall mechanical response of the implant and on the stress distribution. The hemipelvis implant filled with the higher density cell unit demonstrated to be 14% stiffer than using the lower density one, while changing the cell-unit orientation affected the stiffness up to 10%.

But the mechanism is not clearly known. The present study was designed to explore the effect of subtoxic DDT exposure on (1) insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, (2) malondialdehyde (MDA) level and total antioxidant content, (3) activation of redox sensitive kinases (RSKs), and (4) insulin signaling in rat L6 myoblast-derived myotubes. Exposure to 30 mg/L and 60 mg/L of DDT for 18 hours dose dependently decreased glucose uptake and antioxidant content in myotubes and increased MDA levels. The exposures did not alter tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) level as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, despite decreased messenger RNA expression following DDT exposures. Phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases and IκBα, an inhibitory component of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), was increased, suggesting activation of RSKs. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and serine phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) on insulin stimulation decreased in myotubes with exposure to subtoxic concentrations of DDT, but there was no change in tyrosine phosphorylation level of insulin receptors. We conclude that subtoxic DDT exposure impairs insulin signaling and thereby induces insulin resistance in muscle cells. Data show that oxidative stress-induced activation of RSKs is responsible for impairment of insulin signaling on DDT exposure.",Improving psoriasis patients' adherence to topical drugs: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122090,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 06 14,"Background: Poor adherence to topical antipsoriatic drugs limits treatment effectiveness. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how health care providers may improve psoriasis patients' adherence to topical treatment. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was performed for English-language articles in Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, Cinahl, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Results: Ten studies of varying quality were identified. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the adherence-improving potential of interventions by health care providers to support patients showed improvement in adherence to topical treatment. In a prospective study with a pre/postdesign, an individualized, face-to-face consultation reported an improvement in patient-reported adherence to topical treatment over a 9-week period. Based on seven qualitative studies obtaining insights from either patients or health care providers, health care providers may need to address socio-economic factors, health care system factors, and treatment-, patient-, and disease-related factors in interventions that aim to improve the adherence of psoriasis patients to topical antipsoriatic drugs. Conclusion: There is a need to develop better adherence-improving interventions. A good patient-health care provider relationship is considered crucial to adherence and may be an important intervention target. Before interventions to improve adherence to topicals can be recommended for the clinic, the intervention should be tested in high-quality RCTs.",Effects of air pollution on moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122089,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,2019 05 24,"Background: Few studies have evaluated the impact of air pollution levels on the severity of exacerbations. Thus, we compared the relative risks posed by air pollutant levels on moderate and severe exacerbations. Methods: Exacerbation episodes of 618 from 143 adult asthmatics were retrospectively collected between 2005 and 2015 in a tertiary hospital of Korea. Air pollution GPS data for the location closest to each patient's home were obtained from the national ambient monitoring station. The relative impacts of air pollutants on asthma exacerbations were evaluated via a time-trend controlled symmetrical, bidirectional, case-crossover design using conditional logistic regression models on the day of the exacerbation (T-0) and up to 3 days before the exacerbation (T-1-T-3). Results: Overall asthma exacerbation were associated with O3 levels in summer and winter (OR: 1.012[1.003-1.02] and 1.009[1.003-1.016]), SO2 levels in spring and summer (OR: 1.009[1-1.018] and 1.02[1.006-1.035]) and NO2 levels in winter (OR: 1.007[1.003-1.011]). Analyses of the temporal relationship between O3 concentrations and exacerbations demonstrated that 63.2% of episodes in the summer occurred when the O3 concentrations on T-1 were significantly higher than those on control days, while 51% of exacerbation episodes in the winter occurred. Severe and moderate exacerbations were similarly associated with O3 levels in winter (OR: 1.012 [1.003-1.02] vs. 1.01 [0.999-1.021], p > 0.05) and in summer (OR: 1.006 [1.002-1.009] vs. 1.009 [1.003-1.016], p > 0.05). Conclusions: Asthma exacerbations may be associated with the seasonal elevation of O3, SO2 and NO2 levels in summer and winter with the similar relative risk between moderate and severe exacerbations.",Does a parenteral nutrition decision support system for total nutrients improve prescription procedure and neonatal growth?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122088,"The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2019 05 24,"Background and objectives: Parenteral nutrition (PN) is an integral part of the nutritional support of critically ill neonates in the intensive care units (ICU). The evaluation of a decision support system for total nutrients (DSSFTN) is of great importance for clinical practice. This study's aim was to evaluate the impact caused by implementation of a DSSFTN on PN support and neonatal growth. This pilot work was supported by the hospital PN team (PNT) in order to assess possible benefits stemming from the use of DSSFTN. Materials and methods: DSSFTN development is based on the incorporation of pharmaceutical and therapeutic protocols. Thirty-eight neonates were recruited. Inclusion criteria included: patients should (a) be hospitalized in ICU, (b) receive PN support at least for 15 days, (c) have birth weight 550-1600 g. One exclusion criterion was applied: patients should have no inborn error of metabolism. 15 doctors prescribed PN for two groups of neonates. PN was calculated by doctors for Group 1 (19 neonates) and respectively was calculated by the DSSFTN (and checked by doctors) for Group 2 (19 neonates). A questionnaire was completed later by doctors to evaluate DSSFTN. Results: The implementation of DSSFTN led to appropriate composition and administration of PN. Growth was not significantly different between the study groups. Compliance with guidelines was observed. DSSFTN ameliorated intercommunication among doctors. Conclusions: The implementation of DSSFTN enables health professionals to facilitate the complex task of prescribing. It ensures the consistency of PN prescriptions, as it leads to appropriate dosing in all nutrients. DSSFTN provides real-time PN interventions (clinical conditions and enteral amounts are included additionally) and minimizes exposure to human errors.",Mediterranean food pattern vs. Mediterranean diet: a necessary approach?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122086,International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2019 05 24,"""Food pattern"" and ""diet"" sometimes are referred with the same meaning. ""Food pattern"" can be defined by a priori and a posteriori approaches and refers to the characterisation of foods and frequency of consumption within a population combining with various characteristics. ""Diet"" may be represented as an individual way of life and considers the food consumption and others like culture, history, society, economy, sustainability, culinary activities, conviviality, physical activity and rest. Mediterranean diet fits on these two concepts. The question is if we are measuring Mediterranean diet as a whole, or whether we are only measuring one of its parts, neglecting the rest of components. Can this compromise the way we monitor its adherence and evolution, with the possibility of losing the perception of certain aspects? How can we preserve and promote the concept if we do not monitor all the pieces of the puzzle?",Antibiotic prescribing trends among US dermatologists in Medicare from 2013 to 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122085,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 06 10,"Objectives: Antibiotics are commonly used in dermatology for infectious and inflammatory diseases, and dermatologists prescribe the most antibiotics per physician of any specialist in the United States (US). While oral antibiotics are effective for many conditions, adverse effects and increase in resistance are important public health issues. The purpose of this study is to examine trends in oral antibiotic prescription by US dermatologists using Medicare claims. Materials and Methods: Retrospective review using publicly available Medicare Part D prescriber public use files from 2013 to 2016. Results: The number of dermatologists within the Medicare system increased from 10,210 to 10,749. The proportion of prescriptions by dermatologists that were oral antibiotics increased from 10.0% to 10.7% (p = .023). The use of oral antibiotics increased 10.1% (2.9 claims per 1,000 beneficiaries) from 28.7 to 31.6 claims per 1,000 beneficiaries. There were more oral antibiotic prescriptions in the South than in other regions. Doxycycline was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic each year in all regions. Conclusions: Between 2013 and 2016, the number of oral antibiotics prescribed by dermatologists has increased among Medicare patients. Dermatologists must continue to reevaluate antibiotic prescription practices, particularly among the elderly population, in order to provide optimal care to patients.",Changing microRNA Expression during Three-Month Wasp Venom Immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122084,Immunological investigations,2019 05 24,"MicroRNAs are small non-coding molecules playing a significant regulatory role in several allergic diseases. However their role in tolerance induction remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of selected microRNAs during the first three months of wasp venom immunotherapy (VIT). 5 adult patients with a history of severe systemic reactions after stinging by wasps and confirmed sensitization were included. Venous blood samples were collected before VIT, 24 hours after completing its initial phase and after 3 months of the maintenance therapy. A control group was comprised of 5 healthy individuals with no history of allergy. In the blood samples expression of 96 microRNAs was determined with the use of microfluidic cards. In a statistical analysis the expression was compared between the study groups as well as between the pre- and post-VIT samples. Significant differences were found between the patients with wasp venom allergy and the healthy controls in the expression of miR-601 and miR-1201 upregulated in allergic patients at every time point (p = 0.04; p = 0.015, respectively). During VIT profile of microRNA was changing with lower expression of 6 microRNAs (including miR-182, miR-342, miR-375) and higher of 11 microRNAs (including let-7d, miR-34b, miR-143). To conclude, VIT has led to some changes in the expression of microRNA associated with Th2-type inflammation and tolerance induction.",Endoscopic biliary drainage in patients with cholangiocarcinoma - self-expanding metal versus polyethylene stents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122083,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,2019 06 05,"Background: Endoscopic biliary drainage is the standard of care for patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)-induced, obstructive jaundice. Self-expanding metal stents are supposed to be superior to polyethylene stents in terms of reduction of interventions and costs. So far, there are only few real-life data with respect to stent selection and survival in this patient cohort. Methods: In this study, we retrospectively analyzed patients with CCA treated with endoscopic biliary drainage from 2000 to 2015 at Hannover Medical School, Germany. The aim of this study was to analyze whether metal stenting reduces the frequency of interventions and influences survival in a large, real-life cohort. Results: Overall, 422 patients with CCA were included in this study. Indication for endoscopic biliary drainage was most often obstructive jaundice (n = 397; 94.1%). Among these patients, 20 patients (5%) were initially treated with a metal stent and 38 (9.6%) received a metal stent in the subsequent course. Median number of interventions per month was 2.4-fold reduced following metal stenting. Patients first treated with a metal stent had a more advanced tumor stage and a significantly shorter median overall survival (mOS) compared to patients who received a metal stent subsequently (7.5 months vs. 15.2 months; p=.019). There was no difference in mOS for metal vs. polyethylene stenting following a propensity score match for the confounders curative resection and chemotherapy (13.2 vs. 13.7 months, p=.555). Conclusions: Our data confirm that metal stenting reduces the frequency of interventions, but does not influence OS. Metal stenting should be considered specifically in younger patients who are suitable for chemotherapy.",Gut microbiota in ALS: possible role in pathogenesis?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122082,Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2019 05 29,"Introduction: The gut microbiota has important roles in maintaining human health. The microbiota and its metabolic byproducts could play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Areas covered: The authors evaluate the methods of assessing the gut microbiota, and also review how the gut microbiota affects the various physiological functions of the gut. The authors then consider how gut dysbiosis could theoretically affect the pathogenesis of ALS. They present the current evidence regarding the composition of the gut microbiota in ALS and in rodent models of ALS. Finally, the authors review therapies that could improve gut dysbiosis in the context of ALS. Expert opinion: Currently reported studies suggest some instances of gut dysbiosis in ALS patients and mouse models; however, these studies are limited, and more information with well-controlled larger datasets is required to make a definitive judgment about the role of the gut microbiota in ALS pathogenesis. Overall this is an emerging field that is worthy of further investigation. The authors advocate for larger studies using modern metagenomic techniques to address the current knowledge gaps.",Embracing machine learning and digital health technology for precision dermatology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122081,The Journal of dermatological treatment,2019 06 14,"Involvement from the dermatology community in the current revolution in sensors, personal health devices, computing, and machine learning algorithms can enable us to reach the promise of precision medicine in dermatology to deliver the 'right treatment at the right time'. Machine learning combined with digital health technology offers enormous potential to expand access to dermatological services, engage patients in the management of their conditions, and provide tools that enable clinicians to be more effective in their delivery of health care. We offer our framework for how machine learning, rather than replacing dermatologists, will be essential in realizing the promise of precision dermatology."

This study aimed to describe the treatment approaches being used by speech-language pathologists, explore their perspectives of evidence-based practice and identify perceived barriers to implementing empirical research recommendations. Method: An online survey was distributed to speech-language pathologists in Australia and New Zealand. In total, 109 valid surveys were completed by participants who answered a series of multiple choice, yes/no, short answer and Likert-scaled questions. Result: Speech-language pathologists demonstrated a strong preference for eclectic interventions to treat childhood apraxia of speech. When asked to identify the primary treatment approach they used (whether as a stand-alone; or as the primary approach within an eclectic intervention), the most frequently used intervention was the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme. Many speech-language pathologists reported valuing empirical research evidence, despite identifying a range of barriers that impact their ability to implement evidence-based practice in childhood apraxia of speech treatment. Conclusion: Although many speech-language pathologists use the Nuffield Dyspraxia Programme as their primary intervention, most clinicians use it as part of an eclectic/hybrid intervention. The effectiveness of eclectic interventions for childhood apraxia of speech has not been empirically evaluated.",Interpersonal Diffusion of Health Information: Health Information Mavenism among People Age 65 and over in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122068,Health communication,2019 05 24,"Health information mavens are those who provide and share health information with others via interpersonal communication. We investigated the characteristics of health information mavens among Japanese elderly and whether those who share health information with others via interpersonal communication behave more healthily or report better health status compared to their peers. Data come from a cross-sectional analysis of 27,414 participants in the Japanese Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) (mean age = 74 years). Mavenism is associated with being female, younger age, higher educational status, and perceived financial condition, as well as larger social networks, higher social support, and media exposure. A higher mavenism score was associated with healthier dietary, and exercise behaviors, but not associated with smoking or alcohol consumption. Mavens were more likely to have a disease and/or report disease symptoms. Health information mavens have the potential to facilitate word-of-mouth communication among older adults, who tend to be more disadvantaged in terms of health information access compared to younger populations.","Ovulatory Shifts in Sexual Desire But Not Mate Preferences: An LH-Test-Confirmed, Longitudinal Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122067,Evolutionary psychology : an international journal of evolutionary approaches to psychology and behavior,2019 05 24,"The presented data are part of a longitudinal within-subject study designed to examine ovulatory shifts in human sexuality in a diverse German sample using validated questionnaires. The final sample consists of 78 individuals (76 female, 2 agender) who declared to be mainly or exclusively attracted to males. Questionnaires were completed anonymously online at three cycle phases. Following the gold standard, the fertile window was calculated through the reverse cycle day method and confirmed via urinary tests detecting luteinizing hormone. The questionnaire included the Sexual Desire Inventory, Dresdner Body Image Inventory, the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory, and an adjective list to measure mate preferences. One hundred eighty-four questionnaires were included in the data analysis using linear mixed models. Findings support previous research reporting heightened sexual desire and an improved body image during the fertile window. No shifts were found for mate preference or sociosexual orientation, thus adding to a growing body of literature contesting parts of the ovulatory shift hypothesis.",Design Strategies to Improve Emergency Departments' Performance During Mass Casualty Incidents: A Survey of Caregivers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122065,HERD,2019 05 24,To identify effective facility design strategies to improve the performance of healthcare providers and patient flow during mass casualty incidents (MCIs) in emergency departments.,Remote Temperature Monitoring in Patients With Visual Impairment Due to Diabetes Mellitus: A Proposed Improvement to Current Standard of Care for Prevention of Diabetic Foot Ulcers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122064,Journal of diabetes science and technology,2019 05 24,"Two debilitating sequelae of diabetes are foot ulcerations and vision impairing conditions including retinopathy, open-angle glaucoma, and cataracts.

This bias is deemed to be an evolutionary facilitator of communication between cradling and cradled individuals and is believed to be strongly related to hemispheric specialization for complex socio-affective behaviors. Thus, left cradling might facilitate affective interactions in females with typical brain organization, probably due to a right-hemisphere dominance for social attachment. In this study, we investigated cradling-side preferences in 288 young females as a function of their attachment styles to parents and partners. A left-cradling bias was more frequent in participants experiencing positive relationships with their mother and romantic partners. These findings indicate that the left-cradling bias may be associated with high-quality social attachment behaviors in females and, therefore, can be considered as a natural index of socio-emotional attunement between the cradling and cradled individuals.",Return to Yoga Rates Are High After Volar Plating of Distal Radius Fractures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122060,"Hand (New York, N.Y.)",2019 05 24,Yoga is a popular activity involving extreme wrist positioning and extension loading.

Our objective was to implement a quality improvement program to improve compliance with appropriate safe sleep practices in both children's and birthing hospitals. Hospitalists from both settings were recruited to join an Ohio American Academy of Pediatrics collaborative to increase admitted infant safe sleep behaviors. Participants used a standardized tool to audit infants' sleep environments. Each site implemented 3 PDSA (Plan-Do-Study-Act) cycles to improve safe sleep behaviors. A total of 37.0% of infants in children's hospitals were observed to follow the current American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations at baseline; compliance improved to 59.6% at the project's end ( P < .01). Compliance at birthing centers was 59.3% and increased to 72.5% ( P < .01) at the collaborative's conclusion. This study demonstrates that a quality improvement program in different hospital settings can improve safe sleep practices. Infants in birthing centers were more commonly observed in appropriate sleep environments than infants in children's hospitals.,Sexual risk behavior among HIV-infected women in South Africa at 12-months postpartum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122045,AIDS care,2019 06 10,"The postnatal period is a time of increased susceptibility to HIV infection and superinfection for postpartum women, sexual partners, and infants.

Participants were N = 1399 HIV-infected women 6-30 weeks pregnant (M = 18 weeks (SD = 5.75)) assessed during pregnancy and 12-months postpartum. Women were aged an average of 28 (SD = 5.82); 48% reported 10-11 years of education. Older age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.00) and being employed (AOR = 1.51) were associated with greater odds of unprotected sex at 12-month postpartum. Disclosure of HIV status (AOR = 0.64) and greater male involvement during pregnancy (AOR = 0.92) were associated with lower odds of unprotected sex at 12-month postpartum. HIV negative or unknown partner status (AOR = 0.45) and greater depressive symptoms (AOR = 0.97) were associated with lower odds of inconsistent condom use at 12-months postpartum.

Previously, it was reported that milk fermented by Lactobacillus casei CRL431 decreased tumour growth and metastasis in a mouse breast cancer model, through the modulation of the host immune response. The aim of the present work was to analyse the systemic immune response induced by the administration of probiotic fermented milk (PFM) at different stages of cancer development, evaluating cytokines produced by splenocytes stimulated in vitro with 4T1 tumour cells, or its conditioned medium (CM). Groups of healthy mice and mice bearing 4T1 tumour or suffering metastasis after tumour surgery were studied. Results showed that at the early stages, PFM maintained pro-inflammatory response associated to the delay or the inhibition of tumour growth. PFM administration to mice bearing tumour maintained an important inflammatory response; however, in contrast to the milk group, this response was regulated to avoid exacerbation of inflammation. In the metastasis model, the benefits of PFM were associated to avoid the immunosuppression associated to high interleukin-10 levels. In conclusion, as cancer cells induce modifications of the immune response to favour their own growth at each stage of cancer development, PFM administration stimulated different profile of cytokines to respond to these modifications and fight against cancer cells.","Production of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from traditional, starter-free dairy products made of raw milk.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122043,Beneficial microbes,2019 05 24,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid not used in protein synthesis, intervenes in several physiological functions and has both diuretic and calming effects in humans. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains that produce GABA could be exploited for the manufacture of health-promoting GABA-enriched dairy products. In this study, 262 LAB strains isolated from traditional dairy products made from raw milk without starter cultures were screened for GABA production in culture media supplemented with 1% monosodium glutamate (MSG) using an enzymatic (GABase) method. About half of the strains (123) were found to be GABA producers. Of these, 24, among which were 16 Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and three Streptococcus thermophilus strains, produced >1 mM of GABA (range 1.01-2.81 mM) and were selected for further characterisation. GABA production was confirmed in most strains by culturing in 5 mM MSG followed by HPLC quantification. A majority of the strains were confirmed to be GABA producers by this method, although lower production levels were recorded. Using species-specific primers, the gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) was PCR-amplified in all but one of the GABA producers analysed. Amplicons sequences were compared to one another and to those held in databases. Except for one Lactobacillus brevis strain, none of the 24 GABA producers investigated produced toxic biogenic amines, such as tyramine, histamine or cadaverine. They were therefore considered safe. Either alone, in mixtures, or in combination with industrial starter or adjunct cultures, these strains might be useful in the development of health-oriented dairy products.",Probiotic and hepatoprotective activity of lactobacillus isolated from Mongolian camel milk products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122041,Beneficial microbes,2019 05 24,"The improving-intestinal-microbial-balance properties of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are well known. Thus, LAB could play a vital role in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. In the present study, 107 LAB strains were isolated from Mongolian camel milk products and identified to species, then screened for their probiotic properties. As a result, we identified 71 Lactobacillus bacteria belonging to 9 different species, and 36 Lactococcus bacteria belonging to 8 different species. Among them, six strains of LAB with strong tolerance and adhesion ability were further studied for their protective effect on acute liver injury induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/D-galactosamine (D-GalN). These six strains of LAB were fed to mice for 7 weeks, and on the final day of the experiment, LPS/D-GalN were used to induce acute liver injury. After challenging, the degree of liver pathological changes, secretion of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in serum and liver, and the expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 in the liver and intestines were observed and quantified. The results showed that the degree of liver pathological changes in mice fed with the six LAB strains were relieved to varying degrees compared with the LPS/D-GalN-induced model group, and the expressions of AST, ALT, IL-6, and TNF-α factor were also significantly decreased. Moreover, the expression levels of these factors in mice pretreated with Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei WXD5 were significantly decreased compared with other experimental groups. This suggests the probiotic potential and pharmacological value of L. paracasei subsp. paracasei as a liver injury inhibitor in the intervention of inflammation-based liver disease.","Astragalus Polysaccharide Eases G1 Phase-Correlative Bystander Effects through Mediation of TGF-

In this study, APS decreased proliferation and colony rate of bystander cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at G1 phase via extrinsic and intrinsic DNA damage. Regarding mechanism, APS inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway by down-regulating the expression of the key proteins, phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) but not phosphorylated P38 (p-P38), and down-regulating their downstream function protein and molecule, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

Latinos with chronic illness suffer worse health outcomes and poorer quality of care due to various issues occurring in care delivery systems. Latinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to prepare an advance directive (AD) for health-care decision-making that impacts treatment decisions for when EOL is near.

This article reports the results of a service evaluation of a 2-day workshop designed to facilitate improved working between schools and children and young people's mental health services (CYPMHS). Mental health leads from 255 schools, mental health professionals and other key stakeholders all took part in one of 26 two-day workshops across the United Kingdom. The impact on interagency working was examined using changes in pre- and post-survey results, changes in self-reported aspects of interagency working and 10 local reviews of practice. The pre-post questionnaires showed improvements in interagency working (e.g. 55% of school leads reported being in 'monthly' or 'continuous' contact with the National Health Service (NHS) CYPMHS1 at follow-up, compared with 24% at baseline). The group-completed CASCADE framework showed an overall increase in collaborative working, although some areas continued to report significant challenges such as in relation to common outcome measures. The local reviews found positive changes in interagency working, in terms of building relationships, improved communication and sharing good practice. This service evaluation of the workshops found some evidence of improved interagency working between schools and CYPMHS, but more controlled research is needed to consider generalisability and scalability.",Improving Advanced Care Planning through Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Expansion across the United States: Lessons Learned from State-Based Developments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31122034,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,2019 05 24,"The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Paradigm is an effective advance care planning tool.

Meanwhile, a transport mechanism governed by percolation in a low compensated semiconductor gives rise to the reduced conductivity at a low-field regime. Here, in addition to this behavior, we report the anomalous conductivity behavior to transform from a percolative metallic to an insulating phase at the low voltage regime in monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Percolation transport at low source-drain voltage is governed by inhomogeneously distributed potential in strongly interacting monolayer MoS2 with a substrate, distinct from the quantum phase transition in multilayer MoS2. At a high source-drain voltage regime, the insulating phase is transformed further to a metallic phase, exhibiting multiphases of metallic-insulating-metallic transitions in monolayer MoS2.

This soil is mainly composed of illite/montmorillonite interlayer minerals. Previous research has shown that the saline water significantly influences the liquid limit and other physical characteristics of the clays. As the desalination of pore water occurs as a result of freshwater or rainfalls, the physical and mechanical behaviors of the soft marine clays changes, and this can lead to potential hazards for infrastructure. Therefore, it is essential to understand the effects of chemistry variations and to predict the long-term foundation deformations. Based on previous works, the deformation behavior of artificial soils corresponding to a mixture of kaolinite and bentonite (the mass ratios of bentonite were 0%, 5%, 10% and 20%) was further discussed in a ln(1 + e)-logp' system. The permeabilities of the samples mixed with different concentrations of sodium chloride solutions were compared based on oedometer tests. The micro-structures in the samples were investigated by SEM (scanning electronic microscopy) tests. The declining trend of a newly defined volume compression index Ccv and swelling index Csv with pore water salinity and e0/eL was observed when the initial void ratios e0 of the samples were close. The permeability coefficient k and the slopes Ck = e/logk of the mixtures increased with the ionic concentrations. Finally, the changes in volume deformations and permeabilities induced by sodium chloride solution are discussed based on 'suction pressure' and initial void compression at micro-level. This paper proves that the influences of salinity on the mechanical behavior of clays are mainly attributable to the interaction between diffused double layers, and these findings are helpful for improving the constitutive model of soft clays when taking pore water chemistry changes into consideration.",Application of Direct Sonoporation from a Defined Surface Area of the Peritoneum: Evaluation of Transfection Characteristics in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121989,Pharmaceutics,2019 05 24,"In the present study, we developed a sonoporation system, namely ""direct sonoporation"", for transfecting the peritoneum from a defined surface area to avoid systematic side effects. Here, the transfection characteristics are explained because there is less information about direct sonoporation. Naked pDNA and nanobubbles were administered to diffusion cell attached to the visceral and parietal peritoneum from the liver and peritoneal wall surface, respectively. Then, ultrasound was irradiated. Direct sonoporation showed a higher transfection efficacy at the applied peritoneum site from the liver surface while other sites were not detected. Moreover, transgene expression was observed in the peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) at the applied peritoneum site. No abnormality was observed in the inner part of the liver. Although transgene expression of the visceral peritoneum was tenfold higher than that of the parietal peritoneum, transgene expression was observed in the PMCs on both the applied peritoneum sites. These results suggest that direct sonoporation is a site-specific transfection method of the PMCs on the applied peritoneum site without transgene expression at other sites and show little toxicity in the inner tissues at the applied site via cavitation energy. This information is valuable for the development of an intraperitoneal sonoporation device for treatment of peritoneal diseases such as peritoneal fibrosis.","Structure from Motion Multisource Application for Landslide Characterization and Monitoring: The Champlas du Col Case Study, Sestriere, North-Western Italy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121988,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Structure from Motion (SfM) is a powerful tool to provide 3D point clouds from a sequence of images taken from different remote sensing technologies.

The identification is based on the pulsed THz spectroscopy. We follow the spectral intensities together with the use of integral correlation criteria. They use the spectral line dynamics of the THz pulse reflected from the substance under investigation and that of the standard THz signal from database. In order to increase the accuracy and reliability of the identification, we analyze the partial non-overlapping time intervals, containing the main pulse of the reflected THz signal and the sequential sub-pulses. The main pulse is shown to contain information about high absorption frequencies (ν > 2.6 THz) of the mixture components.

Working with residents from the sub-arctic city of Luleå, Sweden, the research examines how the interaction between the built environment and winter season affects people's use of the outdoor environment. The research questions for this study are (1) How do residents perceive the effects of winter on an areas spatial structure and pattern of streets and pathways? and (2) What enablers and barriers impact resident soft mobility choices and use of the public realm in winter? Methods used were mental mapping and photo elicitation exercises. These were used to gain a better understanding of people's perception of soft mobility in winter. The results were analysed to identify how soft mobility is influenced by the winter season. The discussion highlights that at the neighbourhood scale, residents perceive that the winter alters an areas spatial structure and pattern of streets and pathways. It was also seen to reduce ease of understanding of the public realm and townscape. In conclusion, it is argued that new and re-tooled town planning strategies, such as extending blue/ green infrastructure planning to include white space could help better enable all year outdoor activity in winter cities.",Group-1 Grass Pollen Allergens with Near-Identical Sequences Identified in Species of Subtropical Grasses Commonly Found in Southeast Asia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121985,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 24,"Background and objectives: Group-1 grass allergens or beta-expansins (EXPBs) are major allergens from pollen of all grass species. Previous studies showed that they are highly conserved (64-85%) in Pooideae species, which are found mostly in the temperate regions. However, the information about group-1 allergens from common grass species in subtropical areas is still lacking. This study aimed to assess the sequence diversity of group-1 grass pollen allergens in subtropical areas, especially in Southeast Asia. Materials and Methods: Group-1 allergens were cloned from pollen of eight grass species using a single set of primers. Sequences were analyzed and IgE and IgG4 binding regions were compared to the previously reported epitopes in homologous EXPBs. The phylogenetic analysis was used to assess the relationship between sequences of these species and previously characterized EXPBs. Moreover, three-dimensional structure of the EXPB was modeled based on homology to Zea m 1. Results: Sequences from eight grass species were nearly identical. It is conceivable that the primers used for cDNA amplification detected the same isoform in different species. In fact, the deduced amino acid sequences shared 97.79-100% identity with each other and 15/819 polymorphic nucleotide positions were identified. The predicted structure showed that the IgE and IgG4 epitopes and polymorphic residues were located in both domains 1 and 2. The dendrogram presents clustering of class A EXPBs into four groups corresponding to the grass subfamilies. Conclusions: This study identified the allergens with near-identical sequences from different grass species. This isoform could be the major cross-reacting allergenic protein from commonly found grass species.",Detecting Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus and Its Chinese Patent Medicines with a Nucleotide Signature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121984,Genes,2019 05 24,"Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus (Wuweizi) is often adulterated with Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus (Nanwuweizi) in the herbal market. This adulteration is a threat to clinical treatment and safety. In this study, we aimed to develop a nucleotide signature for the identification of Wuweizi and its Chinese patent medicines based on the mini-DNA barcoding technique. We collected 49 samples to obtain internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences and developed a 26-bp nucleotide signature (5'-CGCTTTGCGACGCTCCCCTCCCTCCC-3') on the basis of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site within the ITS2 region that is unique to Wuweizi. Then, using the nucleotide signature, we investigated 27 batches of commercial crude drug samples labeled as Wuweizi and eight batches of Chinese patent medicines containing Wuweizi. Results showed that eight commercial crude drug samples were adulterants and one of the Chinese patent medicines contained adulterants. The nucleotide signature can serve as an effective tool for identifying Wuweizi and its Chinese patent medicines and can thus be used to ensure clinical drug safety.",NDRG2 Sensitizes Myeloid Leukemia to Arsenic Trioxide via GSK3β-NDRG2-PP2A Complex Formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121982,Cells,2019 05 24,"N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) was characterized as a tumor suppressor, inducing anti-metastatic and anti-proliferative effects in several tumor cells. However, NDRG2 functions on anticancer drug sensitivity, and its molecular mechanisms are yet to be fully investigated. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of NDRG2-induced sensitization to As2O3 in the U937 cell line, which is one of the most frequently used cells in the field of resistance to As2O3. NDRG2-overexpressing U937 cells (U937-NDRG2) showed a higher sensitivity to As2O3 than mock control U937 cell (U937-Mock). The higher sensitivity to As2O3 in U937-NDRG2 was associated with Mcl-1 degradation through glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation. Inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β was significantly reduced in U937-NDRG2, and the reduction was diminished by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase inhibitor. NDRG2 mediated the interaction between GSK3β and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), inducing dephosphorylation of GSK3β at S9 by PP2A. Although the C-terminal deletion mutant of NDRG2 (ΔC NDRG2), which could not interact with PP2A, interacted with GSK3β, the mutant failed to dephosphorylate GSK3β at S9 and increased sensitivity to As2O3. Our findings suggest that NDRG2 is a kind of adaptor protein mediating the interaction between GSK3β and PP2A, inducing GSK3β activation through dephosphorylation at S9 by PP2A, which increases sensitivity to As2O3 in U937 cells.",An In-Depth View of the Porcine Trabecular Meshwork Proteome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121981,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 24,"The house swine (Sus scrofa domestica Linnaeus 1758) is an important model organism regarding the study of neurodegenerative diseases, especially ocular neuropathies such as glaucoma. This is due to the high comparability of the porcine and human eye regarding anatomy and molecular features. In the pathogenesis of glaucoma, the trabecular meshwork (TM) forms a key ocular component in terms of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. Thereby, functional TM abnormalities are correlated with distinct proteomic alterations. However, a detailed analysis of the TM proteome has not been realized so far. Since the porcine eye has high potential as a model system to study ocular diseases such as glaucoma, the present study focuses on the in-depth analysis of the porcine TM proteome. By use of a bottom-up (BU) mass spectrometric (MS) platform utilizing electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS) considering database-dependent and peptide de novo sequencing, more than 3000 TM proteins were documented with high confidence (FDR < 1%). A distinct number of proteins with neuronal association were revealed. To the best to our knowledge, many of these protein species have not been reported for TM tissue before such as reelin, centlein and high abundant neuroblast differentiation-associated protein AHNAK (AHNAK). Thereby, AHNAK might play a superordinate role in the TM regarding proposed tissue involvement in barrier function. Also, a high number of secretory proteins could be identified. The generated TM proteomic landscape underlines a multifunctional character of the TM beyond representing a simple drainage system. Finally, the protein catalogue of the porcine TM provides an in-depth view of the TM molecular landscape and will serve as an important reference map in terms of glaucoma research utilizing porcine animal models, porcine TM tissues and/or cultured TM cells."

Priming is a physiological process by which a plant exposed to low doses of biotic or abiotic elicitors activates faster and/or stronger defense responses when subsequently challenged by a stress. In this work, we investigated the impact of MeJA-induced defense responses to mechanical wounding in rice (Oryza sativa). The proteome reprogramming of plants treated with MeJA, wounding or MeJA+wounding has been in-depth analyzed by using a combination of high throughput profiling techniques and bioinformatics tools. Gene Ontology analysis identified protein classes as defense/immunity proteins, hydrolases and oxidoreductases differentially enriched by the three treatments, although with different amplitude. Remarkably, proteins involved in photosynthesis or oxidative stress were significantly affected upon wounding in MeJA-primed plants. Although these identified proteins had been previously shown to play a role in defense responses, our study revealed that they are specifically associated with MeJA-priming. Additionally, we also showed that at the phenotypic level MeJA protects plants from oxidative stress and photosynthetic damage induced by wounding. Taken together, our results add novel insight into the molecular actors and physiological mechanisms orchestrated by MeJA in enhancing rice plants defenses after wounding.",Caregiver Reports of Screen Time Use of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121966,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Screen based media have progressively become an integral part in the daily lives of children and youths with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, research that exclusively pursues the functionality of screen media use of children with ASD is extremely rare. Through a triangulated approach, the present study aims to fill this gap. We conducted 13 interviews with parents of children with ASD and supplemented this interview-study with an online survey including parents of children with ASD (n = 327). Children with ASD mostly used screen media (especially television) for their wellbeing, which is associated with chances and risks. Based on the parental interviews it is suggested that the media usage of children with ASD should be supervised. The results are discussed in terms of their practical implementation.",Expansion and Functional Divergence of Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases in Angiosperms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121965,Genes,2019 05 24,"Inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5PTase), a key enzyme that hydrolyzes the 5` position of the inositol ring, has essential functions in growth, development, and stress responses in plants, yeasts, and animals. However, the evolutionary history and patterns of 5PTases have not been examined systematically. Here, we report a comprehensive molecular evolutionary analysis of the 5PTase gene family and define four groups. These four groups are different from former classifications, which were based on in vitro substrate specificity. Most orthologous groups appear to be conserved as single or low-copy genes in all lineages in Groups II-IV, whereas 5PTase genes in Group I underwent several duplication events in angiosperm, resulting in multiple gene copies. Whole-genome duplication (WGD) was the main mechanism for 5PTase duplications in angiosperm. Plant 5PTases have more members than that of animals, and most plant 5PTase genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. The paralogs have diverged in substrate specificity and expression pattern, showing evidence of selection pressure. Meanwhile, the increase in 5PTases and divergences in sequence, expression, and substrate might have contributed to the divergent functions of 5PTase genes, allowing the angiosperms to successfully adapt to a great number of ecological niches.",Improved Antitumor Efficacy of Combined Vaccine Based on the Induced HUVECs and DC-CT26 Against Colorectal Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121964,Cells,2019 05 24,"Angiogenesis is essential for the development, growth, and metastasis of solid tumors. Vaccination with viable human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) has been used for antitumor angiogenesis. However, the limited immune response induced by HUVECs hinders their clinical application. In the present study, we found that HUVECs induced by a tumor microenvironment using the supernatant of murine CT26 colorectal cancer cells exerted a better antiangiogenic effect than HUVECs themselves. The inhibitory effect on tumor growth in the induced HUVEC group was significantly better than that of the HUVEC group, and the induced HUVEC group showed a strong inhibition in CD31-positive microvessel density in the tumor tissues. Moreover, the level of anti-induced HUVEC membrane protein antibody in mouse serum was profoundly higher in the induced HUVEC group than in the HUVEC group. Based on this, the antitumor effect of a vaccine with a combination of induced HUVECs and dendritic cell-loading CT26 antigen (DC-CT26) was evaluated. Notably, the microvessel density of tumor specimens was significantly lower in the combined vaccine group than in the control groups. Furthermore, the spleen index, the killing effect of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and the concentration of interferon-γ in the serum were enhanced in the combined vaccine group. Based on these results, the combined vaccine targeting both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cells may be an attractive and effective cancer immunotherapy strategy.",Stability of Estimated Premorbid Cognitive Ability over Time after Minor Stroke and Its Relationship with Post-Stroke Cognitive Ability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121963,Brain sciences,2019 05 24,"Considering premorbid or ""peak"" adult intelligence (IQ) is important when examining post-stroke cognition. The stability of estimated premorbid IQ and its relationship to current cognitive ability in stroke is unknown. We investigated changes in estimated premorbid IQ and current cognitive ability up to three years post-stroke. Minor stroke patients (NIHSS < 8) were assessed at one to three months, one and three years' post-stroke. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R) were used to estimate premorbid IQ (NART IQ) and current cognitive ability respectively at each time-point. Baseline demographics, vascular and stroke characteristics were included. Of the 264 patients recruited (mean age 66), 158 (60%), 151 (57%), and 153 (58%) completed cognitive testing at each time-point respectively. NART IQ initially increased (mean difference (MD) = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.54 to 2.13, p < 0.001) before decreasing (MD = -4.269, 95% CI = -5.12 to -3.41, p < 0.001). ACE-R scores initially remained stable (MD = 0.29, 95% CI = -0.49 to 1.07, p > 0.05) before decreasing (MD = -1.05, 95% CI = -2.08 to -0.01, p < 0.05). Adjusting for baseline variables did not change the relationship between NART IQ and ACE-R with time. Increases in NART IQ were associated with more education. For ACE-R, older age was associated with declines, and higher NART IQ and more education was associated with increases. Across 3 years, we observed fluctuations in estimated premorbid IQ and minor changes in current cognitive ability. Future research should aim to identify variables associated with these changes. However, studies of post-stroke cognition should account for premorbid IQ.",TRP Channels as Lower Urinary Tract Sensory Targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121962,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily, including TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV4, TRM4, TRPM8 and TRPA1, are expressed in the lower urinary tract (LUT), not only in neuronal fibers innervating the bladder and urethra, but also in the urothelial and muscular layers of the bladder and urethral walls. In the LUT, TRP channels are mainly involved in nociception and mechanosensory transduction. Animal studies have suggested the therapeutic potential of several TRP channels for the treatment of both bladder over- and underactivity and bladder pain disorders,; however translation of this finding to clinical application has been slow and the involvement of these channels in normal human bladder function, and in various pathologic states have not been established. The development of selective TRP channel agonists and antagonists is ongoing and the use of such agents can be expected to offer new and important information concerning both normal physiological functions and possible therapeutic applications.",Deep CT to MR Synthesis Using Paired and Unpaired Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121961,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a highly important role in radiotherapy treatment planning for the segmentation of tumor volumes and organs. However, the use of MR is limited, owing to its high cost and the increased use of metal implants for patients. This study is aimed towards patients who are contraindicated owing to claustrophobia and cardiac pacemakers, and many scenarios in which only computed tomography (CT) images are available, such as emergencies, situations lacking an MR scanner, and situations in which the cost of obtaining an MR scan is prohibitive. From medical practice, our approach can be adopted as a screening method by radiologists to observe abnormal anatomical lesions in certain diseases that are difficult to diagnose by CT. The proposed approach can estimate an MR image based on a CT image using paired and unpaired training data. In contrast to existing synthetic methods for medical imaging, which depend on sparse pairwise-aligned data or plentiful unpaired data, the proposed approach alleviates the rigid registration of paired training, and overcomes the context-misalignment problem of unpaired training. A generative adversarial network was trained to transform two-dimensional (2D) brain CT image slices into 2D brain MR image slices, combining the adversarial, dual cycle-consistent, and voxel-wise losses. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons against independent paired and unpaired training methods demonstrated the superiority of our approach.",Classification of Processing Damage in Sugar Beet (Beta vulgaris) Seeds by Multispectral Image Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121960,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"The pericarp of monogerm sugar beet seed is rubbed off during processing in order to produce uniformly sized seeds ready for pelleting. This process can lead to mechanical damage, which may cause quality deterioration of the processed seeds. Identification of the mechanical damage and classification of the severity of the injury is important and currently time consuming, as visual inspections by trained analysts are used. This study aimed to find alternative seed quality assessment methods by evaluating a machine vision technique for the classification of five damage types in monogerm sugar beet seeds. Multispectral imaging (MSI) was employed using the VideometerLab3 instrument and instrument software. Statistical analysis of MSI-derived data produced a model, which had an average of 82% accuracy in classification of 200 seeds in the five damage classes. The first class contained seeds with the potential to produce good seedlings and the model was designed to put more limitations on seeds to be classified in this group. The classification accuracy of class one to five was 59, 100, 77, 77 and 89%, respectively. Based on the results we conclude that MSI-based classification of mechanical damage in sugar beet seeds is a potential tool for future seed quality assessment.",Mitophagy in Cancer: A Tale of Adaptation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121959,Cells,2019 05 24,"：In the past years, we have learnt that tumors co-evolve with their microenvironment, and that the active interaction between cancer cells and stromal cells plays a pivotal role in cancer initiation, progression and treatment response. Among the players involved, the pathways regulating mitochondrial functions have been shown to be crucial for both cancer and stromal cells. This is perhaps not surprising, considering that mitochondria in both cancerous and non-cancerous cells are decisive for vital metabolic and bioenergetic functions and to elicit cell death. The central part played by mitochondria also implies the existence of stringent mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, where a specialized autophagy pathway (mitophagy) ensures the selective removal of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria. Although the molecular underpinnings of mitophagy regulation in mammalian cells remain incomplete, it is becoming clear that mitophagy pathways are intricately linked to the metabolic rewiring of cancer cells to support the high bioenergetic demand of the tumor. In this review, after a brief introduction of the main mitophagy regulators operating in mammalian cells, we discuss emerging cell autonomous roles of mitochondria quality control in cancer onset and progression. We also discuss the relevance of mitophagy in the cellular crosstalk with the tumor microenvironment and in anti-cancer therapy responses.",Market-Based Governance in Farm Animal Welfare-A Comparative Analysis of Public and Private Policies in Germany and France.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121958,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 24,"The intensification of livestock production and the focus on economic gains of agricultural policy have resulted in animal welfare related challenges. In many countries the societal concern for the welfare of farmed animals is increasing. Whereas policymakers on the European Union's level and in EU member states have passed specific farm animal protection laws, the existing policies do not always guarantee the welfare of farmed animals. At the same time, the engagement of market actors in the field is increasing. This article explores the development of public and private policies in two countries with very different levels of regulation. By conducting a comparative analysis of public and private policies in Germany and France, the findings illustrate that, although they have different starting points, retailers in both countries are getting increasingly involved in farm animal welfare. In addition, there is evidence that governmental policies are shifting from regulatory to voluntary approaches in cooperation with the private sector. Given that in both countries these dynamics are a very recent development, it remains to be seen whether governmental actors will (re-)assume the lead in the field, whether they will engage in cooperation with private actors, or whether they will leave the task of agricultural restructuring to the market."

Long-adapter single-stranded oligonucleotide (LASSO) probes have shown promise as a tool to clone long DNA fragments. LASSO probes are molecular inversion probes (MIP) engineered with an adapter region of user-defined length, flanked between template-specific probe sequences. Herein, we demonstrate that the adapter length is a key feature of LASSO that influences the efficiency of gene capture and cloning. Furthermore, we applied a model based on Monte Carlo molecular simulation in order to study the relationship between the long-adapter length of LASSO and capture enrichment. Our results suggest that the adapter length is a factor that contributes to the free energy of target-probe interaction, thereby determining the efficiency of capture. The results indicate that LASSOs with extremely long adapters cannot capture the targets well. They also suggest that targets of different lengths may prefer adapters of different lengths.",ACPred: A Computational Tool for the Prediction and Analysis of Anticancer Peptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121946,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have emerged as a new class of therapeutic agent for cancer treatment due to their lower toxicity as well as greater efficacy, selectivity and specificity when compared to conventional small molecule drugs. However, the experimental identification of ACPs still remains a time-consuming and expensive endeavor. Therefore, it is desirable to develop and improve upon existing computational models for predicting and characterizing ACPs. In this study, we present a bioinformatics tool called the ACPred, which is an interpretable tool for the prediction and characterization of the anticancer activities of peptides. ACPred was developed by utilizing powerful machine learning models (support vector machine and random forest) and various classes of peptide features. It was observed by a jackknife cross-validation test that ACPred can achieve an overall accuracy of 95.61% in identifying ACPs. In addition, analysis revealed the following distinguishing characteristics that ACPs possess: (i) hydrophobic residue enhances the cationic properties of α-helical ACPs resulting in better cell penetration; (ii) the amphipathic nature of the α-helical structure plays a crucial role in its mechanism of cytotoxicity; and (iii) the formation of disulfide bridges on β-sheets is vital for structural maintenance which correlates with its ability to kill cancer cells. Finally, for the convenience of experimental scientists, the ACPred web server was established and made freely available online.",Functional Characterization of Date Palm Aquaporin Gene PdPIP1;2 Confers Drought and Salinity Tolerance to Yeast and Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121945,Genes,2019 05 24,"Recent studies on salinity tolerance in date palm revealed the discovery of salt-responsive genes including PdPIP1;2, a highly conserved aquaporin gene in plants, which was functionally characterized in this study to investigate its precise role in drought and salinity tolerance. Immunoblot assay showed a high level of PIP1 protein accumulation only in the leaves of date palm plants when grown under drought, an observation which may imply the involvement of PIP1;2 in CO2 uptake. Heterologous overexpression of PdPIP1;2 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) improved tolerance to salinity and oxidative stress. While, heterologous overexpression of PdPIP1;2 in Arabidopsis had significantly (p < 0.05) increased biomass, chlorophyll content, and root length under drought and salinity. In addition, a significantly (p < 0.05) higher percentage of transgenic plants could be recovered by rewatering after drought stress, indicating the ability of the transgenic plants to maintain water and viability under drought. Transgenic plants under drought and salinity maintained significantly (p < 0.05) higher K+/Na+ ratios than wild type (WT) plants, an observation which may represent an efficient tolerance mechanism controlled by the transgene. Collectively, this study provided an insight on the mechanism by which PdPIP1;2 conferred tolerance to salt and drought stresses in date palm.",The Addition of α-cyclodextrin and γ-cyclodextrin Affect Quality of Dough and Prebaked Bread During Frozen Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121944,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"The effects of the addition of 0-3.0 wt% α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD) on the quality of wheat flour as well as the texture and the aging of prebaked bread were evaluated. The addition of α-CD and γ-CD increased the ability of wheat flour to absorb water and shortened the times of dough formation and stabilization. Amylase activity slightly increased after using 2.0 and 3.0 wt% of α-CD and γ-CD, respectively. Moreover, the addition of α-CD and γ-CD increased the fermentation height and gas retention ability of dough. Dough samples containing 2.0 wt% α-CD and 3.0 wt% γ-CD showed the highest fermentation heights and gas retention volumes, respectively. Dough gas production increased with the addition of γ-CD. Gas production by dough samples containing more than 2.0 wt% α-CD exceeded that by samples in the control group. The results of the texture crumb of bread and specific volume tests revealed that the addition of 2.0 wt% α-CD and 3.0 wt% γ-CD reduced bread hardness and increased bread elasticity, resilience, and specific volume. The optimal α-CD and γ-CD contents were identified as 2.0 wt% and 3.0 wt%, respectively. The addition of 2.0 wt% α-CD and 3.0 wt% γ-CD delayed the aging of prebaked bread and reduced the hardness of prebaked bread during different weeks of storage, which may be due to decreasing the melting enthalpy of starch crystals.

Having ischemic strokes (IS) is one of the risk factors of the AD, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie IS and AD are not well understood. We thus aimed to identify common molecular biomarkers and pathways in IS and AD that can help predict the progression of these diseases and provide clues to important pathological mechanisms. Materials and Methods: We have analyzed the microarray gene expression datasets of IS and AD. To obtain robust results, combinatorial statistical methods were used to analyze the datasets and 26 transcripts (22 unique genes) were identified that were abnormally expressed in both IS and AD. Results: Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that these 26 common dysregulated genes identified several altered molecular pathways: Alcoholism, MAPK signaling, glycine metabolism, serine metabolism, and threonine metabolism. Further protein-protein interactions (PPI) analysis revealed pathway hub proteins PDE9A, GNAO1, DUSP16, NTRK2, PGAM2, MAG, and TXLNA. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional components were then identified, and significant transcription factors (SPIB, SMAD3, and SOX2) found. Conclusions: Protein-drug interaction analysis revealed PDE9A has interaction with drugs caffeine, γ-glutamyl glycine, and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-7H-xanthine. Thus, we identified novel putative links between pathological processes in IS and AD at transcripts levels, and identified possible mechanistic and gene expression links between IS and AD.","New Materials Based on Cationic Porphyrins Conjugated to Chitosan or Titanium Dioxide: Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Efficacy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121942,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 24,"The post-functionalization of 5,10,15-tris(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)-20-(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin tri-iodide, known as a highly efficient photosensitizer (PS) for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), in the presence of 3- or 4-mercaptobenzoic acid, afforded two new tricationic porphyrins with adequate carboxylic pending groups to be immobilized on chitosan or titanium oxide. The structural characterization of the newly obtained materials confirmed the success of the porphyrin immobilization on the solid supports. The photophysical properties and the antimicrobial photodynamic efficacy of the non-immobilized porphyrins and of the new conjugates were evaluated. The results showed that the position of the carboxyl group in the mercapto units or the absence of these substituents in the porphyrin core could modulate the action of the photosensitizer towards the bioluminescent Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacterium. The antimicrobial activity was also influenced by the interaction between the photosensitizer and the type of support (chitosan or titanium dioxide). The new cationic porphyrins and some of the materials were shown to be very stable in PBS and effective in the photoinactivation of E. coli bacterium. The physicochemical properties of TiO2 allowed the interaction of the PS with its surface, increasing the absorption profile of TiO2, which enables the use of visible light, inactivating the bacteria more efficiently than the corresponding PS immobilized on chitosan.",Don't Shut the Stable Door after the Phage Has Bolted-The Importance of Bacteriophage Inactivation in Food Environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121941,Viruses,2019 05 24,"In recent years, a new potential measure against foodborne pathogenic bacteria was rediscovered-bacteriophages. However, despite all their advantages, in connection to their widespread application in the food industry, negative consequences such as an uncontrolled phage spread as well as a development of phage resistant bacteria can occur. These problems are mostly a result of long-term persistence of phages in the food production environment. As this topic has been neglected so far, this article reviews the current knowledge regarding the effectiveness of disinfectant strategies for phage inactivation and removal. For this purpose, the main commercial phage products, as well as their application fields are first discussed in terms of applicable inactivation strategies and legal regulations. Secondly, an overview of the effectiveness of disinfectants for bacteriophage inactivation in general and commercial phages in particular is given. Finally, this review outlines a possible strategy for users of commercial phage products in order to improve the effectiveness of phage inactivation and removal after application.",Relevance of HLA-DQB1*02 Allele in the Genetic Predisposition of Children with Celiac Disease: Additional Cues from a Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121940,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 24,"Background and Objectives: Celiac disease (CD) is a multifactorial immune-mediated disorder, triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically-predisposed subjects carrying MHC-DQ2 and -DQ8 heterodimers, which are encoded by four HLA-DQ allelic variants, overall. This meta-analysis aims at providing further epidemiological support to the predominant relevance of one specific allele, namely HLA-DQB1*02, in the predisposition and genetic risk of CD. Materials and Methods: We performed a search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus, retrieving all publications (case-control study, cross-sectional, and retrospective cohort study) on the association between HLA class II polymorphisms and first-degree relatives (FDRs) of children with CD. After a critical reading of the articles, two investigators independently performed data extraction according to the following inclusion criteria: HLA class II genes, any DQ and DR molecules, and CD diagnosed following the current clinical guidelines. A third participant was consulted for discussion to reach an agreement concerning discrepancies. Results: Our search strategy selected 14 studies as being eligible for inclusion, and those were submitted for data extraction and analysis. These studies were published between 1999 and 2016 and, collectively, enrolled 3063 FDRs. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-, respectively) for CD diagnosis, according to the presence of the HLA-DQ genotype coding a complete MHC-DQ2 and/or MHC-DQ8 molecules, were 1.449 (CI 1.279-1.642) and 0.187 (CI 0.096-0.362), respectively. If only the isolated presence of HLA-DQB1*02 allele is considered, the pooled estimation of LR+ was 1.659 (CI 1.302-2.155) and, importantly, the LR- still showed a very good discriminatory power of 0.195 (CI 0.068-0.558). Conclusions: Through our differential meta-analysis, comparing the presence of the genotype coding the full MHC-DQ2 and/or DQ8 molecules with the isolated presence of HLA-DQB1*02 allelic variant, we found that the LR- of the latter analysis maintained the same value. This observation, along with previous evidences, might be useful to consider potential cost-effective widened screening strategies for CD in children.",Designed DNA-Encoded IL-36 Gamma Acts as a Potent Molecular Adjuvant Enhancing Zika Synthetic DNA Vaccine-Induced Immunity and Protection in a Lethal Challenge Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121939,Vaccines,2019 05 24,"Identification of novel molecular adjuvants which can boost and enhance vaccine-mediated immunity and provide dose-sparing potential against complex infectious diseases and for immunotherapy in cancer is likely to play a critical role in the next generation of vaccines. Given the number of challenging targets for which no or only partial vaccine options exist, adjuvants that can address some of these concerns are in high demand. Here, we report that a designed truncated Interleukin-36 gamma (IL-36 gamma) encoded plasmid can act as a potent adjuvant for several DNA-encoded vaccine targets including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, and Zika in immunization models. We further show that the truncated IL-36 gamma (opt-36γt) plasmid provides improved dose sparing as it boosts immunity to a suboptimal dose of a Zika DNA vaccine, resulting in potent protection against a lethal Zika challenge.",How Does Leader Narcissism Influence Employee Voice: The Attribution of Leader Impression Management and Leader-Member Exchange.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121938,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 24,"Recently, the influence of leader's personality traits on employee behavior has become an emerging research area. Leaders play a crucial role in any organization because team members look up to them for policy and behavioral guidelines. Based on the social exchange theory, this study is focused on the relationship of employee-perceived leader narcissism and employee voice behavior. Through the analysis of 239 questionnaires, we find that leader narcissism has a significant influence on the motivation of leadership impression management. The narcissistic leader uses impression management that is more likely to have self- serving purpose rather than pro-social motivation. This motivation impacts leader-member exchange (LMX) quality which influences employee voice behavior. This study has significant theoretical and practical implications as it is the first study that empirically verifies the stated relationship in this under-researched area."

Different experimental conditions have been compared, varying UV irradiation mode and sensor operating temperature. Results demonstrated that operating the sensor under continuous UV radiation did not improve the response to target gas. The most advantageous condition was obtained when the UV LED irradiated the sensor in regeneration and was turned off during CO detection. In this operating mode, the semiconductor layer showed an apparent ""p-type"" behavior due to the UV irradiation. Overall, the effect was an improvement of the indium oxide response at 100 °C toward low CO concentrations (from 1 to 10 ppm) that showed higher results than in the dark, which is promising to extend the detection of CO with an In2O3-based sensor in the sub-ppm range.",The Effect of Nutrition Intervention with Oral Nutritional Supplements on Pancreatic and Bile Duct Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121926,Nutrients,2019 05 24,"Chemotherapy may negatively affect nutritional status and quality of life (QOL) in pancreatic cancer patients. Our aim was to investigate the beneficial effects of oral nutrition supplements (ONS) on pancreatic and bile duct cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Among patients with progressive pancreatic and bile duct cancer receiving chemotherapy, the ONS group (n = 15) received two packs of ONS daily for 8 weeks while the non-ONS group (n = 19) did not. Anthropometric measures, dietary intake, nutritional status, and quality of life were assessed. ONS significantly increased daily intakes of energy, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids at 8 weeks compared to the baseline. After 8 weeks, fat mass significantly increased in the ONS group. For patients in their first cycle of chemotherapy, body weight, fat-free mass, skeletal muscle mass, body cell mass, and fat mass increased in the ONS group but decreased in the non-ONS group. Fat mass increased in second or higher cycle only in the ONS group. Patient-generated subjective global assessments (PG-SGA) and fatigue scores in the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) improved in the ONS group. ONS might improve nutritional status by increasing fat mass and/or maintaining the body composition of pancreatic and bile duct cancer patients with chemotherapy, especially those in the first cycle, and alleviate fatigue symptoms.",Effects of Different Carbon Sources on Fumonisin Production and FUM Gene Expression by Fusarium proliferatum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121925,Toxins,2019 05 24,"Fusarium proliferatum can infect many crops and then produce fumonisins that are very harmful to humans and animals. Previous study indicates that carbon sources play important roles in regulating the fumonisin biosynthesis. Unfortunately, there is limited information on the effects of carbon starvation in comparison with the carbon sources present in the host of fumonisin production in F. proliferatum. Our results indicated that F. proliferatum cultivated in the Czapek's broth (CB) medium in the absence of sucrose could greatly induce production of fumonisin, while an additional supplementation of sucrose to the culture medium significantly reduced the fumonisin production. Furthermore, cellulose and hemicellulose, and polysaccharide extracted from banana peel, which replaced sucrose as the carbon source, can reduce the production of fumonisin by F. proliferatum. Further work showed that these genes related to the synthesis of fumonisin, such as FUM1 and FUM8, were significantly up-regulated in the culture medium in the absence of sucrose. Consistent with fumonisin production, the expressions of FUM gene cluster and ZFR1 gene decreased after the addition of sucrose. Moreover, these genes were also significantly down-regulated in the presence of cellulose, hemicellulose or polysaccharide extracted from peel. Altogether, our results suggested that fumonisin production was regulated in F. proliferatum in response to different carbon source conditions, and this regulation might be mainly via the transcriptional level. Future work on these expressions of the fumonisin biosynthesis-related genes is needed to further clarify the response under different carbon conditions during the infection of F. proliferatum on banana fruit hosts. The findings in this study will provide a new clue regarding the biological effect of the fumonisin production in response to environmental stress.",The Mutation of Conservative Asp268 Residue in the Peptidoglycan-Associated Domain of the OmpA Protein Affects Multiple Acinetobacter baumannii Virulence Characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121924,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial human pathogen of increasing concern due to its multidrug resistance profile. The outer membrane protein A (OmpA) is an abundant bacterial cell surface component involved in A. baumannii pathogenesis. It has been shown that the C-terminal domain of OmpA is located in the periplasm and non-covalently associates with the peptidoglycan layer via two conserved amino acids, thereby anchoring OmpA to the cell wall. Here, we investigated the role of one of the respective residues, D268 in OmpA of A. baumannii clinical strain Ab169, on its virulence characteristics by complementing the ΔompA mutant with the plasmid-borne ompAD268A allele. We show that while restoring the impaired biofilm formation of the ΔompA strain, the Ab169ompAD268A mutant tended to form bacterial filaments, indicating the abnormalities in cell division. Moreover, the Ab169 OmpA D268-mediated association to peptidoglycan was required for the manifestation of twitching motility, desiccation resistance, serum-induced killing, adhesion to epithelial cells and virulence in a nematode infection model, although it was dispensable for the uptake of β-lactam antibiotics by outer membrane vesicles. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the OmpA C-terminal domain-mediated association to peptidoglycan is critical for a number of virulent properties displayed by A. baumannii outside and within the host.","Prospective Study on the Excretion of Mucous Stools and its Association with Age, Gender, and Feces Output in Captive Giant Pandas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121923,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 24,"The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) has evolved a large number of mucous glands in the intestinal lining to adapt to the digestion of high-fiber foods. However, in captive pandas, excessive mucus might form a mass and then be eliminated, which is often accompanied by discomfort and decreased activity. This event is called 'mucous excretion'. The causes of mucus excretions in captive pandas, however, remain unknown. The aims of this study were to document the occurrence of mucus excretion and to investigate its possible associations with pandas' age, gender, and feces output. Eighteen giant pandas were studied at the Beijing Zoo from April 2003 to June 2017, and a total of 900 occurrences of mucous excretion and 32,856 daily defecation outputs in weight were recorded. The likelihood of mucous excretion occurrence decreased by 11.34% for each 1 kg of fecal output (Z = -4.12, p < 0.0001), while it increased by 5.89% per year of age (Z = 4.02, p < 0.0001). However, individual differences in gender had no significant effect on the mucous occurrence (Z = -0.75, p = 0.4508). A monthly change in mucus occurrence was also found. The mean frequency of mucus occurrence was significantly higher in October. In August, time (month) change showed the biggest negative influence on feces output but the biggest positive influence on mucus excretion (seasonal factors were -2.261 and 0.0126, respectively). Our results documented the occurrence of mucous excretions and confirmed their possible associations with the pandas' age and fecal output based on a 15-year prospective study. This study not only adds to our knowledge of panda physiology but also suggests the need for further studies examining the causes of the excretion of mucous stools in captive pandas. Reducing the incidence of mucous excretion would promote ex situ conservation and enhance panda welfare.","Lower Vitamin D Levels, but Not VDR Polymorphisms, Influence Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Brazilian Population Independently of Obesity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121922,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 24,"Background and Objectives: Vitamin D levels have been associated with a diversity of diseases, including obesity. Vitamin D presents a pleiotropic action, and can regulate insulin secretion and inflammatory responses. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms are involved in the gene expression regulation and have been associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to evaluate the association between the polymorphisms ApaI (rs7975232), BsmI (rs1544410), FokI (rs10735810), and TaqI (rs731236) in the VDR gene in people diagnosed with T2DM, and plasma 25-hydroxivitamin D levels [25(OH)D]. Materials and Methods: A total of 101 T2DM patients and 62 gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) matched non-diabetic controls were included in this study. Molecular analyzes were performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The plasma 25(OH)D levels were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Results: The plasma 25(OH)D levels were lower in T2DM patients (17.2 (16.6) ng/mL) when compared with the control subjects (30.8 (16.2) ng/mL, p < 0.0001), independently of obesity status. We found no difference between genotypic and allelic frequencies of the VDR polymorphisms when comparing the T2DM group and control group (p > 0.05 for all), and did not show any association with plasma 25(OH)D levels. Conclusions: These results suggest that T2DM is associated with lower plasma 25(OH)D levels, which are not related to BMI and VDR gene polymorphisms.",Development of Piezo-Actuated Two-Degree-of-Freedom Fast Tool Servo System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121921,Micromachines,2019 05 24,"Fast tool servo (FTS) machining technology is a promising method for freeform surfaces and machining micro-nanostructure surfaces. However, limited degrees of freedom (DOF) is an inherent drawback of existing FTS technologies. In this paper, a piezo-actuated serial structure FTS system is developed to obtain translational motions along with z and x-axis directions for ultra-precision machining. In addition, the principle of the developed 2-DOF FTS is introduced and explained. A high-rigidity four-bar (HRFB) mechanism is proposed to produce motion along the z-axis direction. Additionally, through a micro-rotation motion around flexible bearing hinges (FBHs), bi-directional motions along the x-axis direction can be produced. The kinematics of the mechanism are described using a matrix-based compliance modeling (MCM) method, and then the static analysis and dynamic analysis are performed using finite element analysis (FEA). Testing experiments were conducted to investigate the actual performance of the developed system. The results show that low coupling, proper travel, and high natural frequency are obtained. Finally, a sinusoidal wavy surface is uniformly generated by the mechanism developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FTS system.",Evolution of the Piscine orthoreovirus Genome Linked to Emergence of Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation in Farmed Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121920,Viruses,2019 05 24,"Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was first diagnosed in Norway in 1999. The disease is caused by Piscine orthoreovirus-1 (PRV-1). The virus is prevalent in farmed Atlantic salmon, but not always associated with disease. Phylogeny and sequence analyses of 31 PRV-1 genomes collected over a 30-year period from fish with or without HSMI, grouped the viral sequences into two main monophylogenetic clusters, one associated with HSMI and the other with low virulent PRV-1 isolates. A PRV-1 strain from Norway sampled in 1988, a decade before the emergence of HSMI, grouped with the low virulent HSMI cluster. The two distinct monophylogenetic clusters were particularly evident for segments S1 and M2. Only a limited number of amino acids were unique to the association with HSMI, and they all located to S1 and M2 encoded proteins. The observed co-evolution of the S1-M2 pair coincided in time with the emergence of HSMI in Norway, and may have evolved through accumulation of mutations and/or segment reassortment. Sequences of S1-M2 suggest selection of the HSMI associated pair, and that this segment pair has remained almost unchanged in Norwegian salmon aquaculture since 1997. PRV-1 strains from the North American Pacific Coast and Faroe Islands have not undergone this evolution, and are more closely related to the PRV-1 precursor strains not associated with clinical HSMI.",NF1 Patients Receiving Breast Cancer Screening: Insights from The Ontario High Risk Breast Screening Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121919,Cancers,2019 05 24,"Neurofibromatosis Type I (NF1) is caused by variants in neurofibromin (NF1). NF1 predisposes to a variety of benign and malignant tumor types, including breast cancer. Women with NF1 <50 years of age possess an up to five-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer compared with the general population. Impaired emotional functioning is reported as a comorbidity that may influence the participation of NF1 patients in regular clinical surveillance despite their increased risk of breast and other cancers. Despite emphasis on breast cancer surveillance in women with NF1, the uptake and feasibility of high-risk screening programs in this population remains unclear. A retrospective chart review between 2014-2018 of female NF1 patients seen at the Elizabeth Raab Neurofibromatosis Clinic (ERNC) in Ontario was conducted to examine the uptake of high-risk breast cancer screening, radiologic findings, and breast cancer characteristics. 61 women with pathogenic variants in NF1 enrolled in the high-risk Ontario breast screening program (HR-OBSP); 95% completed at least one high-risk breast screening modality, and four were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.

Here, we reconstructed the genetic structure and determined the population differentiation of gypsy moths across its distribution range at different times. This information could be used to both improve the prevention and detection of gypsy moths in the field. Using 31 newly designed species-specific primers targeting fragments of 216-1102 bp, we identified 103 full-length cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences from eight fresh samples and 95 L. dispar specimens collected between 1955 and 1996, mainly in China. Combining 103 full-length COI gene sequences with 146 COI gene sequences from Genbank or DNA barcode libraries, we analyzed the genetic differentiation, gene flow and haplotypes between gypsy moth populations in order to reflect the genetic structure and population dynamics of gypsy moths. We discovered 25 previously unknown haplotypes from old gypsy moth specimens. We found that the genetic diversity among gypsy moth populations (collected in the same region at different time points) was relatively high. Furthermore, the genetic structure of Chinese geographical populations (Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Beijing) in different years was distinct. Our results suggested that some gypsy moths in China showed the genetic affinity with European gypsy moths (a sub-species of gypsy moths found mainly in Europe)."

However, previous studies have shown inconsistent results by pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of FAAH in response to inflammation. In this study we used two inhibitors, PF3845 and URB597, together with siRNA knockdown to characterize further the effects of FAAH inhibition in BV2 microglial cells. Treatment with PF3845 suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, and down-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal PGE synthase. PF3845 reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines but had no effect on the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. The anti-inflammatory effects of URB597 were not as potent as those of PF3845. Knockdown of FAAH also suppressed PGE2 production and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Interestingly, FAAH knockdown enhanced expression of anti-inflammatory molecules in both the absence and presence of LPS treatment. The anti-inflammatory effects of FAAH inhibition and knockdown were not affected by the cannabinoid receptor antagonists or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) antagonists. Although inhibition and knockdown of FAAH have potent anti-inflammatory effects and possibly lead to the dynamic change of microglial gene regulation, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated.",Formation of Fe-Te Nanostructures during in Situ Fe Heavy Doping of Bi2Te3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121906,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"To study the in situ doping effect upon monotonically increasing dopant concentration, a Bi2Te3 layer doped with Fe up to ~6.9% along the growth direction was fabricated by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Its resistance versus temperature curve displays a superconductivity transition at about 12.3 K. Detailed structural and chemical analysis via X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) reveal that this layer consists of two types of unexpected Fe-Te nanostructures: one is FeTe thin layer formed near the surface, and the other is FeTe2 nanorod embedded in the Bi2Te3 layer. Based on the results of further electrical and magnetotransport studies, it is likely that the observed superconductivity originates from the interface between the FeTe nanostructure and the neighboring Bi2Te3 layer. We have addressed the formation mechanisms of the observed nanostructures, which is attributed to the strong reaction between Fe and Te atoms during the growth process. The findings of this study also provide an unusual approach to synthesizing nanostructures via heavy doping if the dopant element is strongly reactive with an element in the host matrix.","Understanding Male Caregivers' Emotional, Financial, and Physical Burden in the United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121905,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Men caregivers face caregiving burden, have weak support networks and are less likely to seek out programs which increase their caregiving capabilities and help them cope with this burden. Using the 2011 and 2015 National Study of Caregiving (NSOC) database and hierarchical regressions, we studied the emotional, financial, and physical burden of male caregivers as spouses, sons, and other caregivers by assessing the impact of caregiver characteristics, tasks and resources for each subgroup. We highlighted the importance of using a nationally representative database for men caregivers only and emphasized that these caregivers are not a monolithic group. We found that all caregivers experienced these three burden types, particularly elevated emotional stress, with sons reporting the highest emotional and financial strain levels. Assisting with personal care was the most stressful task and caregivers vastly under-utilized support and training. Our results suggest that burden suppressants included having family and friends help with caregiving, having time to decompress, and feeling appreciated by the care recipient. These findings offer insight for devising future policies that intentionally include relationship and burden type to encourage improved and more caregiving from men while supporting their well-being.",Integrative Analysis of the Wheat PHT1 Gene Family Reveals A Novel Member Involved in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Phosphate Transport and Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121904,Cells,2019 05 24,"Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the main growth-limiting factors for plants. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can significantly promote P uptake. Generally, PHT1 transporters play key roles in plants' P uptake, and thus, PHT1 genes have been investigated in some plants, but the regulation and functions of these genes in wheat (TaPHT1) during AM symbiosis have not been studied in depth. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of TaPHT1 genes was performed, including sequence, phylogeny, cis-elements, expression, subcellular localization and functions, to elucidate their roles in AM-associated phosphate transport and immunity. In total, 35 TaPHT1s were identified in the latest high-quality bread wheat genome, 34 of which were unevenly distributed on 13 chromosomes, and divided into five groups. Sequence analysis indicated that there are 11 types of motif architectures and five types of exon-intron structures in the TaPHT1 family. Duplication mode analysis indicated that the TaPHT1 family has expanded mainly through segmental and tandem duplication events, and that all duplicated gene pairs have been under purifying selection. Transcription analysis of the 35 TaPHT1s revealed that not only known the mycorrhizal-specific genes TaPht-myc, TaPT15-4B (TaPT11) and TaPT19-4D (TaPT10), but also four novel mycorrhizal-specific/inducible genes (TaPT3-2D, TaPT11-4A, TaPT29-6A, and TaPT31-7A) are highly up-regulated in AM wheat roots. Furthermore, the mycorrhizal-specific/inducible genes are significantly induced in wheat roots at different stages of infection by colonizing fungi. Transient Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation expression in onion epidermal cells showed that TaPT29-6A is a membrane-localized protein. In contrast to other AM-specific/inducible PHT1 genes, TaPT29-6A is apparently required for the symbiotic and direct Pi pathway. TaPT29-6A-silenced lines exhibited reduced levels of AM fungal colonization and arbuscules, but increased susceptibility to biotrophic, hemi-biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. In conclusion, TaPT29-6A was not only essential for the AM symbiosis, but also played vital roles in immunity.",Evaluation of the Impacts of a Phone Warning and Advising System for Individuals Vulnerable to Smog. Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial Study in Canada.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121903,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 24,"Smog warning systems are components of adaptation strategies that are adopted by governments around the world to protect their citizens from extreme episodes of air pollution. As part of a growing research stream on the effectiveness of these systems, this article presents the results of a study on the impacts of an automated phone warning and advising system for individuals vulnerable to air pollution. A sample of 1328 individuals were recruited and randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The treatment group received smog warning while the control group did not. Data were collected via three phone surveys, two before and one after issuing the smog warning. The comparison between treatment and control groups indicates that exposure to a smog warning improved information on the occurrence of smog episodes (n = 484, OR = 5.58, p = 0.00), and knowledge on protective behaviors. Furthermore, members of treatment group were more likely to avoid exposure to smog episodes by spending more time inside with the windows closed than usual (n = 474, OR = 2.03, p = 0.00). Members of treatment group who take medication in the form of aerosol pumps also kept these devices on themselves more frequently than those of control group (n= 109, OR = 2.15, p = 0.03). The system however had no discernible effects on the awareness of air pollution risks, reduction of health symptoms related to smog and the use of health system services. The absence of health benefits could be related to the lower actual exposure to air pollution of such vulnerable groups during winter.",Nuclear Phospho-SOD1 Protects DNA from Oxidative Stress Damage in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121901,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 24,"We already demonstrated that in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) patients, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) was present in an aggregated form in the cytoplasmic compartment. Here, we investigated the possible effect of soluble SOD1 decrease and its consequent aggregation. We found an increase in DNA damage in patients PBMCs characterized by a high level of aggregated SOD1, while we found no DNA damage in PBMCs with normal soluble SOD1. We found an activation of ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/Chk2 and ATM and Rad3-related (ATR)/Chk1 DNA damage response pathways, which lead to phosphorylation of SOD1. Moreover, data showed that phosphorylation allows SOD1 to shift from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, protecting DNA from oxidative damage. Such pathway was finally confirmed in our cellular model. Our data lead us to suppose that in a sub-group of patients this physiologic pathway is non-functional, leading to an accumulation of DNA damage that causes the death of particularly susceptible cells, like motor neurons. In conclusion, during oxidative stress SOD1 is phosphorylated by Chk2 leading to its translocation in the nuclear compartment, in which SOD1 protects DNA from oxidative damage. This pathway, inefficient in sALS patients, could represent an innovative therapeutic target.",LOXL1 Is Regulated by Integrin α11 and Promotes Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Tumorigenicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121900,Cancers,2019 05 24,"Integrin α11, a stromal collagen receptor, promotes tumor growth and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is associated with the regulation of collagen stiffness in the tumor stroma. We have previously reported that lysyl oxidase like-1 (LOXL1), a matrix cross-linking enzyme, is down-regulated in integrin α11-deficient mice. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between LOXL1 and integrin α11, and the role of LOXL1 in NSCLC tumorigenicity. Our results show that the expression of LOXL1 and integrin α11 was correlated in three lung adenocarcinoma patient datasets and that integrin α11 indeed regulated LOXL1 expression in stromal cells. Using cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) with either a knockdown or overexpression of LOXL1, we demonstrated a role for LOXL1 in collagen matrix remodeling and collagen fiber alignment in vitro and in vivo in a NSCLC xenograft model. As a consequence of collagen reorganization in NSCLC tumor stroma, we showed that LOXL1 supported tumor growth and progression. Our findings demonstrate that stromal LOXL1, under regulation of integrin α11, is a determinant factor of NSCLC tumorigenesis and may be an interesting target in this disease.",Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Ecklonia cava Extract on Porphyromonas gingivalis Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated Macrophages and a Periodontitis Rat Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121899,Nutrients,2019 05 24,"Ecklonia cava, an edible marine brown alga (Laminariaceae), is a rich source of phlorotannins. This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Ecklonia cava ethanol extract (ECE, dieckol 10.6%, w/w) on Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inflammation in RAW 264.7 cells and in ligature-induced periodontitis in rats. The levels of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 were decreased by more than half on treatment with 100 μg/mL ECE. Downregulated tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 gene expression confirmed the anti-inflammatory properties of ECE. ECE treatment upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression by 6.3-fold and increased HO-1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) signaling decreased nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) translocation. ECE administration (400 mg/kg) significantly reduced gingival index, restricted tooth mobility, and prevented alveolar bone loss (p < 0.05). These beneficial effects were due to decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, IL-1β production, and matrix metalloproteinase expression in gingival tissues. The ratio of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin, a biomarker of periodontitis and osteolysis, was significantly decreased by ECE administration (p < 0.05). Thus, ECE has potential therapeutic effects for the alleviation of periodontal disease.",Advance in the Management of Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121897,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 24,"Coagulopathy commonly occurs in sepsis as a critical host response to infection that can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with an increased mortality. Recent studies have further defined factors responsible for the thromboinflammatory response and intravascular thrombosis, including neutrophil extracellular traps, extracellular vesicles, damage-associated molecular patterns, and endothelial glycocalyx shedding. Diagnosing DIC facilitates sepsis management, and is associated with improved outcomes. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) has proposed criteria for diagnosing overt DIC, these criteria are not suitable for early detection. Accordingly, the ISTH DIC Scientific Standardization Committee has proposed a new category termed ""sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC)"" to facilitate earlier diagnosis of DIC and potentially more rapid interventions in these critically ill patients. Therapy of SIC includes both treatment of the underlying infection and correcting the coagulopathy, with most therapeutic approaches focusing on anticoagulant therapy. Recently, a phase III trial of recombinant thrombomodulin was performed in coagulopathic patients. Although the 28-day mortality was improved by 2.6% (absolute difference), it did not reach statistical significance. However, in patients who met entry criteria for SIC at baseline, the mortality difference was approximately 5% without increased risk of bleeding. In this review, we discuss current advances in managing SIC and DIC.",3D-Organotypic Cultures to Unravel Molecular and Cellular Abnormalities in Atopic Dermatitis and Ichthyosis Vulgaris.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121896,Cells,2019 05 24,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by dry and itchy skin evolving into disseminated skin lesions. AD is believed to result from a primary acquired or a genetically-induced epidermal barrier defect leading to immune hyper-responsiveness. Filaggrin (FLG) is a protein found in the cornified envelope of fully differentiated keratinocytes, referred to as corneocytes. Although FLG null mutations are strongly associated with AD, they are not sufficient to induce the disease. Moreover, most patients with ichthyosis vulgaris (IV), a monogenetic skin disease characterized by FLG homozygous, heterozygous, or compound heterozygous null mutations, display non-inflamed dry and scaly skin. Thus, all causes of epidermal barrier impairment in AD have not yet been identified, including those leading to the Th2-predominant inflammation observed in AD. Three dimensional organotypic cultures have emerged as valuable tools in skin research, replacing animal experimentation in many cases and precluding the need for repeated patient biopsies. Here, we review the results on IV and AD obtained with epidermal or skin equivalents and consider these findings in the context of human in vivo data. Further research utilizing complex models including immune cells and cutaneous innervation will enable finer dissection of the pathogenesis of AD and deepen our knowledge of epidermal biology."

The field experiment was performed in two growing seasons (2013 and 2014) in the southeastern region of Poland. The experiment was conducted as a randomized block design with four replications. To determine the content of the selected nutrients (Si, N, P, K, Mg, and Ca), samples of leaves and roots were collected during harvest. Fertilization treatments applied on the plants' leaves affected the silicon (Si) content in the roots of sugar beet and the total Si uptake. Moreover, foliar fertilization had a significant effect on the P content in the leaves and the N and K contents in the roots. The Si content in the sugar beet leaves and roots ranged from 0.55 to 1.97 g kg-1 dry matter (d. m.) and from 0.49 to 1.59 g kg-1 d. m., respectively. The total Si uptake ranged from 20.3 to 46.7 kg ha-1. Most of the Si content taken up with each fertilization variant was accumulated in the roots.

In the proposed system, four speakers placed at known positions transmit chirp signals according to the time-division multiple access (TDMA) plus frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) transmission scheme. A smartphone receives the signal via a built-in microphone and calculates the time differences of arrival (TDOAs). Using TDOA measurements, the position is estimated by the shrinking-circle method. In particular, to reduce the positioning error in moving conditions, a TDOA correction method based on Doppler shifts is proposed. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated in real-world experiments using a 10.971 m × 5.684 m positioning area. The results of the static-target positioning experiment showed that the TDMA+FDMA transmission scheme has more advantages in improving the update rate of the positioning system than the TDMA-only transmission scheme. The results of the moving-target positioning experiment under three different speeds demonstrated that the positioning errors were reduced by about 10 cm when the Doppler-shift-based TDOA correction method was adopted. This research provides a possible framework for the realization of a TDOA-chirp-based acoustic indoor positioning system with high positioning accuracy and update rate.","Mechanics of the Tricuspid Valve-From Clinical Diagnosis/Treatment, In-Vivo and In-Vitro Investigations, to Patient-Specific Biomechanical Modeling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121881,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Proper tricuspid valve (TV) function is essential to unidirectional blood flow through the right side of the heart. Alterations to the tricuspid valvular components, such as the TV annulus, may lead to functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR), where the valve is unable to prevent undesired backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium during systole. Various treatment options are currently available for FTR; however, research for the tricuspid heart valve, functional tricuspid regurgitation, and the relevant treatment methodologies are limited due to the pervasive expectation among cardiac surgeons and cardiologists that FTR will naturally regress after repair of left-sided heart valve lesions. Recent studies have focused on (i) understanding the function of the TV and the initiation or progression of FTR using both in-vivo and in-vitro methods, (ii) quantifying the biomechanical properties of the tricuspid valve apparatus as well as its surrounding heart tissue, and (iii) performing computational modeling of the TV to provide new insight into its biomechanical and physiological function. This review paper focuses on these advances and summarizes recent research relevant to the TV within the scope of FTR. Moreover, this review also provides future perspectives and extensions critical to enhancing the current understanding of the functioning and remodeling tricuspid valve in both the healthy and pathophysiological states.","Incorporation and Conduction of Protons in Ca, Sr, Ba-Doped BaLaInO4 with Ruddlesden-Popper Structure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121880,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"The new phases BaLa0.9M0.1InO3.95 (M = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) with a Ruddlesden-Popper structure were obtained. It was established that all investigated samples were capable for the water uptake from the gas phase. The ability of water incorporation was due to not only by the presence of oxygen vacancies, but also due to the presence of La-O blocks in the structure. The degree of hydration of the samples was much higher than the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the composition of the samples appear to be BaLaInO3.42(OH)1.16, BaLa0.9Ca0.1InO3.25(OH)1.4, BaLa0.9Sr0.1InO3.03(OH)1.84, BaLa0.9Ba0.1InO2.9(OH)2.1. The degree of hydration increased with an increase in the size of the dopant, i.e., with an increase in the size of the salt blocks. It was proven that doping led to the increase in the oxygen ionic conductivity. The conductivities for doped samples BaLa0.9M0.1InO3.95 were higher than for undoped composition BaLaInO4 at ~1.5 order of magnitude. The increase in the conductivity was mainly attributed to the increase of the carrier concentration as a result of the formation of oxygen vacancies during doping. The proton conductivities of doped samples increased in the order Ca2+-Sr2+-Ba2+ due to an increase in the concentration of protons. It was established that all doped samples demonstrated the dominant proton transport below 450 °C.",Bone Metastasis Phenotype and Growth Undergo Regulation by Micro-Environment Stimuli: Efficacy of Early Therapy with HGF or TGFβ1-Type I Receptor Blockade.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121879,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 24,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) are biological stimuli of the micro-environment which affect bone metastasis phenotype through transcription factors, but their influence on the growth is scarcely known. In a xenograft model prepared with 1833 bone metastatic cells, derived from breast carcinoma cells, we evaluated mice survival and Twist and Snail expression and localization after competitive inhibition of HGF with NK4, or after blockade of TGFβ1-type I receptor (RI) with SB431542: in the latter condition HGF was also measured. To explain the in vivo data, in 1833 cells treated with SB431542 plus TGFβ1 we measured HGF formation and the transduction pathway involved. Altogether, HGF seemed relevant for bone-metastatic growth, being hampered by NK4 treatment, which decreased Twist more than Snail in the metastasis bulk. TGFβ1-RI blockade enhanced HGF in metastasis and adjacent bone marrow, while reducing prevalently Snail expression at the front and bulk of bone metastasis. The HGF accumulation in 1833 cells depended on an auxiliary signaling pathway, triggered by TGFβ1 under SB431542, which interfered in the transcription of HGF activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) downstream of TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1): HGF stimulated Twist transactivation. In conclusion, the impairment of initial outgrowth with NK4 seemed therapeutically promising more than SB431542 chemotherapy; a functional correlation between Twist and Snail in bone metastasis seemed to be influenced by the biological stimuli of the micro-environment, and the targeting of these phenotype biomarkers might inhibit metastasis plasticity and colonization, even if it would be necessary to consider the changes of HGF levels in bone metastases undergoing TGFβ1-RI blockade.",Changes in Child Nutrition in India: A Decomposition Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121878,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 24,Improvements in child health are a key indicator of progress towards the third goal of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

Some decades ago, the idea was born that gap junctional intercellular communication might prevent both the onset and the progression of cancer. Later evidence indicated that, on the contrary, synthesis and the presence of connexins as a prerequisite for gap junctional intercellular communication might promote the occurrence of cancer and metastases. The research history of urinary bladder cancer is a good example of the development of scientific perception.

In this paper, a simulation study is proposed to detect defects in a circular tube material. Firstly, the ultrasonic propagation behavior was analyzed, and a formulation of the Multi-Gaussian beam model (MGB) based on a superposition of Gaussian beams is described. The expression of the acoustic field from a linear phased-array ultrasonic transducer in the condition of a convex interface on the circular tube material is proposed. Secondly, in order to make the tapered probe wedge better fit the curved circular tube material and carry out the ultrasonic inspection of the curved surface, it was necessary to pare the angle probe wedge. Finally, acoustic field simulations in a circular tube were carried out and analyzed. The simulation results indicated that the method of ultrasonic phased-array inspection is feasible in circular tube testing. Tube materials with different curvatures need different array element lengths and widths to get the desired focused beam.",Mesostructural Modeling of Dynamic Modulus and Phase Angle Master Curves of Rubber Modified Asphalt Mixture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121875,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"The main objective of this paper was to develop a mesostructure-based finite element model of rubber modified asphalt mixture to predict both the dynamic modulus master curve and phase angle master curve under a large frequency range. The asphalt mixture is considered as a three-phase material consisting of aggregate, asphalt mortar, and air void. The mesostructure of the asphalt mixture was digitized by a computed tomography (CT) scan and implemented into finite element software. The 2S2P1D model was used to obtain the viscoelastic information of an asphalt mortar under a large range of frequencies and temperatures. The continuous spectrum of the 2S2P1D model was converted to a discrete spectrum and characterized by the generalized Maxwell model for numerical simulation. The Prony series parameters of the generalized Maxwell model and the elastic modulus of the aggregates were inputted into the finite element analysis as material properties. The dynamic modulus tests of a rubber modified asphalt mortar and asphalt mixture were conducted under different temperatures and loading frequencies. The dynamic modulus master curve and phase angle master curve of both asphalt mortar and asphalt mixture were constructed. The frequency of the finite element simulations of the dynamic modulus tests ranged from 10-6 to 104. The dynamic modulus and phase angle of the asphalt mixture was calculated and the master curves were compared with the master curves obtained from the experimental data. Furthermore, the effect of the elastic modulus of aggregates on the master curves was analyzed. Acceptable agreement between dynamic modulus master curves obtained from experimental data and simulation results was achieved. However, large errors between phase angle master curves appeared at low frequencies. A method was proposed to improve the prediction of the phase angle master curve by adjusting the equilibrium modulus of the asphalt mortar.",Endoplasmic Reticulum Detergent-Resistant Membranes Accommodate Hepatitis C Virus Proteins for Viral Assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121874,Cells,2019 05 24,"During Hepatitis C virus (HCV) morphogenesis, the non-structural protein 2 (NS2) brings the envelope proteins 1 and 2 (E1, E2), NS3, and NS5A together to form a complex at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, initiating HCV assembly. The nature of the interactions in this complex is unclear, but replication complex and structural proteins have been shown to be associated with cellular membrane structures called detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). We investigated the role of DRMs in NS2 complex formation, using a lysis buffer combining Triton and n-octyl glucoside, which solubilized both cell membranes and DRMs. When this lysis buffer was used on HCV-infected cells and the resulting lysates were subjected to flotation gradient centrifugation, all viral proteins and DRM-resident proteins were found in soluble protein fractions. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated direct protein-protein interactions between NS2 and E2 and E1 proteins, and an association of NS2 with NS3 through DRMs. The well-folded E1E2 complex and NS5A were not associated, instead interacting separately with the NS2-E1-E2-NS3 complex through less stable DRMs. Core was also associated with NS2 and the E1E2 complex through these unstable DRMs. We suggest that DRMs carrying this NS2-E1-E2-NS3-4A-NS5A-core complex may play a central role in HCV assembly initiation, potentially as an assembly platform."

With a highly regulatory mechanism, called unfolded protein response (UPR), it protects cells from the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Nevertheless, not only does UPR modify improper proteins, but it also degrades proteins that are unable to recover. Three pathways of UPR, namely PERK, IRE-1, and ATF6, have a significant role in regulating stress-induced physiological responses in cells. The dysregulated UPR may be involved in diseases, such as atherosclerosis, heart diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and cancer. Here, we discuss the relation between UPR and cancer, considering several aspects including survival, dormancy, immunosuppression, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer cells. Although several moderate adversities can subject cancer cells to a hostile environment, UPR can ensure their survival. Excessive unfavorable conditions, such as overloading with misfolded proteins and nutrient deprivation, tend to trigger cancer cell death signaling. Regarding dormancy and immunosuppression, cancer cells can survive chemotherapies and acquire drug resistance through dormancy and immunosuppression. Cancer cells can also regulate the downstream of UPR to modulate angiogenesis and promote metastasis. In the end, regulating UPR through different molecular mechanisms may provide promising anticancer treatment options by suppressing cancer proliferation and progression.",Nanomechanical and Material Properties of Fluorine-Doped Tin Oxide Thin Films Prepared by Ultrasonic Spray Pyrolysis: Effects of F-Doping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121861,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) thin films were deposited on glass substrates using ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) at a fixed substrate temperature of 400 °C and various Fluorine/Tin (F/Sn) atomic ratios of 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0. Effects of F/Sn atomic ratios on structural-morphological, compositional, electrical, optical, and nanomechanical properties of the FTO thin films were systematically studied. The FTO films exhibited a tetragonal structure with preferred orientations of (110), (200), and (211), and polycrystalline morphology with spear-like or coconut shell-like particles on the surfaces. The presence of F-doping was confirmed by XPS results with clear F1s peaks, and F-concentration was determined to be 0.7% for F/Sn = 0.1 and 5.1% for F/Sn = 0.5. Moreover, the resistivity of FTO films reduced remarkably from 4.1 mΩcm at F/Sn = 0 to 0.7 mΩcm at F/Sn = 1, primarily due to the corresponding increase of carrier concentration from 2 × 1020 cm-3 to 1.2 × 1021 cm-3. The average optical transmittance of the films prepared at F/Sn of 0-0.5 was over 90%, and it decreased to 84.4% for the film prepared at F/Sn = 1. The hardness (H) and Young's modulus (E) of the FTO films increased when the F/Sn ratios increased from 0 to 0.5, reaching maximum values of H = 12.3 ± 0.4 GPa, E = 131.7 ± 8.0 GPa at F/Sn = 0.5. Meanwhile, the H and E reduced considerably when the F/Sn ratio further increased to 1.0, following the inverse Hall-Petch effect approximately, suggesting that the grain boundary effect played a primary role in manipulating the nanomechanical properties of the FTO films. Furthermore, favorable mechanical properties with large H/Ef and H 3 / E f 2 ratios were found for the FTO film prepared at F/Sn = 0.5, which possessed high crystallinity, large grain size, and compact morphology.",Super-Toughed PLA Blown Film with Enhanced Gas Barrier Property Available for Packaging and Agricultural Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121860,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Polylactic acid (PLA) holds enormous potential as an alternative to the ubiquitous petroleum-based plastics to be used in packaging film and agricultural film. However, the poor viscoelastic behavior and its extremely low melt strength means it fails to meet the requirements in film blowing processing, which is the most efficient film processing method with the lowest costs. Also, the PLA's brittleness and insufficient gas barrier properties also seriously limit PLA's potential application as a common film material. Herein, special stereocomplex (SC) networks were introduced to improve the melt strength and film blowing stability of PLA; polyethylene glycol (PEG) was introduced to improve PLA's toughness and gas barrier properties. Compared with neat poly(l-lactide) acid (PLLA), modified PLA is stable in the film blowing process and its film elongation at break increases more than 18 times and reaches over 250%, and its O2 permeability coefficient decreased by 61%. The resulting film material also has good light transmittance, which has great potential for green packaging applications, such as disposable packaging and agricultural films.",A Modified Holder Pasteurization Method for Donor Human Milk: Preliminary Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121859,Nutrients,2019 05 24,Holder pasteurization (HoP) is the recommended method of pasteurization for donor human milk (DHM).

Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most widely used AM technique due to its ability to manufacture complex and relatively high strength parts from many low-cost materials. Generally, the high strength of the printed parts in FFF is attributed to the research in materials and respective process factors (process variables, physical setup, and ambient temperature). However, these factors have not been rigorously reviewed for analyzing their effects on the strength and ductility of different classes of materials. This review systematically elaborates the relationship between materials and the corresponding process factors. The main focus is on the strength and ductility. A hierarchical approach is used to analyze the materials, process parameters, and void control before identifying existing research gaps and future research directions.",Effect of Dietary Supplementation of Moringa Oleifera on the Production Performance and Fecal Methanogenic Community of Lactating Dairy Cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121857,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 24,"Development of alternative forage resources is of great importance to provide necessary nutrients and minimize greenhouse gas emissions in ruminant production. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of dietary supplementation of Moringa oleifera on the production performance and fecal methanogenic community in dairy cows using methyl-coenzyme M reductase α-subunit gene. Sixty-four cows were allocated to one of four treatments: basal diet without M. oleifera (control) or low (3% w/w, M3), medium (6%, M6), or high (9%, M9) supplementation with M. oleifera. This study demonstrated that different supplementation levels of Moringa oleifera in the diet achieved similar feed intake and milk production, but adding 6% of Moringa oleifera improved milk fat content. Two families, two phyla, three genera, and three species in total were identified among the four treatments. The fecal archaeal community in the control treatment was predominated by Methanobrevibacter (39.1% of the total sequence reads) followed by Methanosphaera and Methanocorpusculum at the genus level. The increased abundance of the Methanosphaera genus and Methanosphaera sp. ISO3-F5 species was induced by secondary metabolites of Moringa oleifera in the diet. Results indicated that Moringa oleifera supplementation not only improved dairy product quality but could also potentially reduce methane emissions.",Prevalence of Coexistent Plantaris Tendon Pathology in Patients with Mid-Portion Achilles Pathology: A Retrospective MRI Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121856,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Co-existence of Plantaris tendinopathy (PT) in patients with mid-Achilles tendinopathy (Mid-AT) is of clinical significance. This study aims to describe the MRI-based pathological characteristics of co-existing PT and Mid-AT. One-hundred MRI studies of patients diagnosed with Mid-AT were retrospectively analysed by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist. Presence or absence of a Plantaris tendon, co-existing PT with Mid-AT, insertional characteristics of Plantaris tendon, and maximum anteroposterior thickness of the tendon in Mid-AT (axial images) were evaluated. When PT co-existed with Mid-AT, the location of the tendon pathologies in relation to calcaneal insertion was assessed (sagittal images) and their association was analysed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and Pearson's correlation coefficient. Plantaris was present in 84 cases (84%), and Mid-AT and PT co-existed in 10 cases (10%). A greater variability in the location of Plantaris pathology (CV = 42%) than Achilles tendinopathy (CV = 42%) was observed. The correlation coefficient also revealed a low and non-significant association between the location of two pathologies when they exist together (r = +0.06; p = 0.88). Clinical evaluation of Achilles tendon pain needs careful consideration into the possible co-existence of Plantaris pathology. The considerable difference observed in the location of PT and Mid-AT suggest possible isolated pathologies and differentials for Achilles tendon pain.",Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Stimulates Pancreatic Islet Autophagy via Inhibition of AMPK-mTOR Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121855,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 24,"Islet autophagy plays a role in glucose/lipid metabolism in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Its antioxidant capacity can be analyzed by different methods both in vitro and in vivo. Caenorhabditis elegans is an in vivo model widely used in ageing research. Until now, available tests analyze functional effects in the worms, so the antioxidant activity of the compound is indirectly monitored. We have developed a simple and a reliable method to quantify internal antioxidant activity in vivo. To validate this method, we analyzed an aqueous green tea extract and two other compounds with a well-known antioxidant activity and without this activity. The results obtained (EC50 green tea = 21.76 ± 1.28 µg/mL; EC50 positive control = 8.50 ± 0.33 µg/mL; negative control EC50 > 500 µg/mL) can help in the design of further in vivo experiments. Thus, our method can be used as a previous screening capable of reducing the gap between in vitro and in vivo assays.",Transcriptome Analysis Shows That IFN-I Treatment and Concurrent SAV3 Infection Enriches MHC-I Antigen Processing and Presentation Pathways in Atlantic Salmon-Derived Macrophage/Dendritic Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121853,Viruses,2019 05 24,"Type I interferons (IFNs) have been shown to play an important role in shaping adaptive immune responses in addition to their antiviral properties in immune cells. To gain insight into the impact of IFN-I-induced pathways involved in early adaptive immune responses, i.e., antigen-presenting pathways, in an Atlantic salmon-derived (Salmo salar L.) macrophage cell line (TO-cells), we used a comparative de novo transcriptome analysis where cells were treated with IFN-I or kept untreated and concurrently infected with salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV3). We found that concurrent treatment of TO-cells with IFN-I and SAV3 infection (SAV3/IFN+) significantly enriched the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) pathway unlike the non-IFN-I treated TO-cells (SAV3/IFN-) that had lower expression levels of MHC-I pathway-related genes. Genes such as the proteasomal activator (PA28) and β-2 microglobulin (β2M) were only differentially expressed in the SAV3/IFN+ cells and not in the SAV3/IFN- cells. MHC-I pathway genes like heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), transporter of antigen associated proteins (TAPs) and tapasin had higher expression levels in the SAV3/IFN+ cells than in the SAV3/IFN- cells. There were no MHC-II pathway-related genes upregulated in SAV3/IFN+-treated cells, and cathepsin S linked to the degradation of endosomal antigens in the MHC-II pathway was downregulated in the SAV3/IFN- cells. Overall, our findings show that concurrent IFN-I treatment of TO-cells and SAV3 infection enriched gene expression linked to the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway. Data presented indicate a role of type I IFNs in strengthening antigen processing and presentation that may facilitate activation particularly of CD8+ T-cell responses following SAV3 infection, while SAV3 infection alone downplayed MHC-II pathways."

Hyaluronan (HA) is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan polymer produced in all vertebrates, and usually present at the high molecular weight (>106 Da). Low molecular weight HA has signaling properties, and fragments ~35 kDa size (HA35) have biological activity in eliciting epithelial β-defensins and tight junction proteins, notably ZO1, important components of innate host defense arsenal of the gut barrier in preclinical models. Safety, tolerability, impact on metabolism, gut permeability, and microbiome composition in healthy human subjects were all evaluated prospectively. Methods. Pharmaceutical grade HA35 (140 mg in water once daily for seven days), was administered orally to 20 healthy subjects (30.7 ± 5.6 years). Demographical, clinical, biochemical laboratory tests, metabolic function and stool microbiome composition were measured on Day 0, 8 and 28. Results. HA35 was tolerated well in all subjects with no serious adverse events in any subjects. No statistical differences in any of the measurements were seen among the study group over the course of the trial. In aggregate there were no changes in demographical, clinical, biochemical laboratory tests, and metabolic function or microbiome composition during the 28-day study. Conclusion. Oral HA35 administration (140 mg/day) is a safe treatment in healthy individuals and does not affect metabolic, inflammatory or microbiome parameters.",Quantifying Cancer Epithelial-Mesenchymal Plasticity and its Association with Stemness and Immune Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121840,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 24,"Cancer cells can acquire a spectrum of stable hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) states during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cells in these hybrid E/M phenotypes often combine epithelial and mesenchymal features and tend to migrate collectively commonly as small clusters. Such collectively migrating cancer cells play a pivotal role in seeding metastases and their presence in cancer patients indicates an adverse prognostic factor. Moreover, cancer cells in hybrid E/M phenotypes tend to be more associated with stemness which endows them with tumor-initiation ability and therapy resistance. Most recently, cells undergoing EMT have been shown to promote immune suppression for better survival. A systematic understanding of the emergence of hybrid E/M phenotypes and the connection of EMT with stemness and immune suppression would contribute to more effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we first discuss recent efforts combining theoretical and experimental approaches to elucidate mechanisms underlying EMT multi-stability (i.e., the existence of multiple stable phenotypes during EMT) and the properties of hybrid E/M phenotypes. Following we discuss non-cell-autonomous regulation of EMT by cell cooperation and extracellular matrix. Afterwards, we discuss various metrics that can be used to quantify EMT spectrum. We further describe possible mechanisms underlying the formation of clusters of circulating tumor cells. Last but not least, we summarize recent systems biology analysis of the role of EMT in the acquisition of stemness and immune suppression.","Endocannabinoid System in Hepatic Glucose Metabolism, Fatty Liver Disease, and Cirrhosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121839,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 24,"There is growing evidence that glucose metabolism in the liver is in part under the control of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) which is also supported by its presence in this organ. The ECS consists of its cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) and enzymes that are responsible for endocannabinoid production and metabolism. ECS is known to be differentially influenced by the hepatic glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, e.g., cannabinoid receptor type 1(CB1) antagonist can improve the glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Interestingly, our own study shows that expression patterns of CBRs are influenced by the light/dark cycle, which is of significant physiological and clinical interest. The ECS system is highly upregulated during chronic liver disease and a growing number of studies suggest a mechanistic and therapeutic impact of ECS on the development of liver fibrosis, especially putting its receptors into focus. An opposing effect of the CBRs was exerted via the CB1 or CB2 receptor stimulation. An activation of CB1 promoted fibrogenesis, while CB2 activation improved antifibrogenic responses. However, underlying mechanisms are not yet clear. In the context of liver diseases, the ECS is considered as a possible mediator, which seems to be involved in the synthesis of fibrotic tissue, increase of intrahepatic vascular resistance and subsequently development of portal hypertension. Portal hypertension is the main event that leads to complications of the disease. The main complication is the development of variceal bleeding and ascites, which have prognostic relevance for the patients. The present review summarizes the current understanding and impact of the ECS on glucose metabolism in the liver, in association with the development of liver cirrhosis and hemodynamics in cirrhosis and its complication, to give perspectives for development of new therapeutic strategies.",Protective Effect of Thymosin β4 against Abdominal Aortic Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Acute Lung Injury in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121838,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 24,"Background and objectives: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) caused by infrarenal abdominal aorta cross-clamping is an important factor in the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury in various distant organs. Materials and Methods: We investigated potential antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effects of thymosin beta 4 (Tβ4) in a rat model of abdominal aortic surgery-induced IR. Tβ4 (10 mg/kg, intravenous (i.v.)) was administered to rats with IR (90-min ischemia, 180-min reperfusion) at two different periods. One group received Tβ4 1 h before ischemia, and the other received 15 min before the reperfusion period. Results: Results were compared to control and non-Tβ4-treated rats with IR. Serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue levels of oxidant parameters were higher, while antioxidant levels were lower in the IR group compared to control. IR also increased inflammatory cytokine levels. Tβ4 reverted these parameters in both Tβ4-treated groups compared to the untreated IR group. Conclusions: Since there is no statistical difference between the prescribed results of both Tβ4-treated groups, our study demonstrates that Tβ4 reduced lung oxidative stress and inflammation following IR and prevented lung tissue injury regardless of timing of administration.",Comparison of Phytochemical Differences of the Pulp of Different Peach [Prunus persica (L.)

Batsch], mature fruit from 33 cultivars was used for the investigation of fruit phenolic phytochemical attributes, including total phenolics, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and procyanidins, as well as the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity in vitro. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity varied significantly among tested peach cultivars and was strongly correlated with total phenolics, total procyanidins, and total flavonoids. Untargeted UPLC-Q-TOF/MS-based metabolomics were used to comprehensively discriminate between peaches with different inhibitory activity on alpha-glucosidase. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) were used for this process. Twenty-three differential compounds were identified between peach cultivars with high and low alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and nine, including procyanidin C1, procyanidin trimer isomer 1, procyanidin trimer isomer 2, procyanidin B1, procyanidin dimer, epicatechin-epicatechin-epicatechin, phloridzin, kaempferol 3-(2'',6''-di-(E)-p-coumarylglucoside), and luteolin 3'-methyl ether 7-malonylglucoside, were identified as marker compounds responsible for the discrimination. Overall, variations in metabolites in peach pulp reflect the diversity in peach germplasm, and these nine compounds are good candidate markers for future genetic breeding of peach fruit with high alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity.",Design and Characterization of Inulin Conjugate for Improved Intracellular and Targeted Delivery of Pyrazinoic Acid to Monocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121836,Pharmaceutics,2019 05 24,"The propensity of monocytes to migrate into sites of mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection and then become infected themselves makes them potential targets for delivery of drugs intracellularly to the tubercle bacilli reservoir. Conventional TB drugs are less effective because of poor intracellular delivery to this bacterial sanctuary. This study highlights the potential of using semicrystalline delta inulin particles that are readily internalised by monocytes for a monocyte-based drug delivery system. Pyrazinoic acid was successfully attached covalently to the delta inulin particles via a labile linker. The formation of new conjugate and amide bond was confirmed using zeta potential, Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1HNMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that no significant change in size after conjugation which is an important parameter for monocyte targeting. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to establish the change in thermal properties. The analysis of in-vitro release demonstrated pH-triggered drug cleavage off the delta inulin particles that followed a first-order kinetic process. The efficient targeting ability of the conjugate for RAW 264.7 monocytic cells was supported by cellular uptake studies. Overall, our finding confirmed that semicrystalline delta inulin particles (MPI) can be modified covalently with drugs and such conjugates allow intracellular drug delivery and uptake into monocytes, making this system potentially useful for the treatment of TB.","Bioassays and Methodologies for Insecticide Tests with Larvae of Trogoderma granarium (Everts), the Khapra Beetle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121835,Insects,2019 05 24,"New insecticide treatment options would be beneficial for control programs for Trogoderma granarium Everts, the khapra beetle, in the United States. Two insecticides were evaluated, the Polyzone® formulation of deltamethrin and a formulation of the insect growth regulator methoprene combined with deltamethrin and the synergist piperonyl butoxide. In the test with Polyzone® deltamethrin, concrete arenas were treated with a low and high rate, and held outside, inside a shed, or inside a lab. Compared to storage in the lab, residue degradation increased slightly in the shed, and then further outside, as evidenced by greater larval survival and adult emergence. Across all environmental treatments, the high rate was more effective than the lower rate. For the combination methoprene product, the effect of food contact with treated surfaces was examined. When treating arenas with food and transferring the food to clean dishes, there was no immediate effect on larval survival, but there was a reduction in survival and emergence to the adult stage after one month. For both tests, larvae apparently often went into diapause after they were introduced onto the treatment arenas. Both treatments could be utilized in management programs if T. granarium infestations are detected.",High HOMA-IR Index in Healthcare Shift Workers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121834,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 24,"Background and objectives: Evidence shows that shift work may be correlated with insulin resistance (IR). Therefore its estimation in clinical and prevention practice is of great significance.

Materials and Methods: A total of 272 healthcare workers (HCWs) were invited to participate in the study within an occupational surveillance framework, 137 were HCSW while 135 were healthcare non-shift workers (HCNSW). Fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR Index were evaluated in each participant and correlated with shift workers. Results: Indicators of glucose metabolism were significantly higher in HCSW p < 0.001, and logistic regression analysis confirmed a significant positive association between increased values of HOMA-IR Index and shift workers (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Shift work could be a risk factor in developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.","A Motivational Perspective on Job Insecurity: Relationships Between Job Insecurity, Intrinsic Motivation, and Performance and Behavioral Outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121833,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 24,"As a result of the global economic recession over the past decade, employees have been exposed to constant threats of job insecurity. Despite having conducted extensive research on job insecurity, scholars have paid little attention to the motivational processes underlying employees' reactions to job insecurity. The purpose of the present study is to examine the relationship between job insecurity, intrinsic motivation, and performance and behavioral outcomes. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), we propose a mediated relationship in which job insecurity decreases intrinsic motivation, which, in turn, undermines job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), and change-oriented OCB. To test our propositions, we collected survey-based data from 152 R&D professionals employed in a South Korean manufacturing company. As predicted, job insecurity was negatively related to intrinsic motivation, which, in turn, had a positive relationship with all three outcomes. Furthermore, job insecurity exerted significant indirect effects on job performance, OCB, and change-oriented OCB through intrinsic motivation. These findings affirm SDT, which posits that motivation, as a key intermediary process, affects employees' reactions to job stressors.",Metabolites of Medicarpin and Their Distributions in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121832,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"Medicarpin is a bioactive pterocarpan that has been attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, its metabolic fate in vivo is still unknown. To clarify its metabolism and the distribution of its metabolites in rats after oral administration, the HPLC-ESI-IT-TOF-MSn technique was used. A total of 165 new metabolites (13 phase I and 152 phase II metabolites) were tentatively identified, and 104, 29, 38, 41, 74, 28, 24, 15, 42, 8, 10, 3, and 17 metabolites were identified in urine, feces, plasma, the colon, intestine, stomach, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, heart, brain, and thymus, respectively. Metabolic reactions included demethylation, hydrogenation, hydroxylation, glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation, glycosylation, and vitamin C conjugation. M1 (medicarpin glucuronide), M5 (vestitol-1'-O-glucuronide) were distributed to 10 organs, and M1 was the most abundant metabolite in seven organs. Moreover, we found that isomerization of medicarpin must occur in vivo. At least 93 metabolites were regarded as potential new compounds by retrieving information from the Scifinder database. This is the first detailed report on the metabolism of ptercarpans in animals, which will help to deepen the understanding of the metabolism characteristics of medicarpin in vivo and provide a solid basis for further studies on the metabolism of other pterocarpans in animals."

This study aimed to investigate the underlying mechanism of ZER against acute liver injury (ALI) in CCl4-induced mice models. ICR mice were pretreated intraperitoneally with ZER for five days, then received a CCl4 injection two hours after the last ZER administration and were sacrificed 24 h later. Examination of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities and the histopathological analysis confirmed the hepatoprotective effect of ZER. Biochemical assays revealed that ZER pretreatment recovered the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), restored the glutathione (GSH) reservoir, and reduced the production of malondialdehyde (MDA), all in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of ZER in vivo reduced the release amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and inhibited the increased protein levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p-p65, and cyclooxygenase (COX-2). Further studies in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Raw264.7 inflammatory cellular models verified that ZER could inhibit inflammation via inactivating the TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway. Thus, our study indicated that ZER exhibited a hepatoprotective effect against ALI through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and the possible mechanism might be mediated by the TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway. Collectively, our studies indicate ZER could be a potential candidate for chemical liver injury treatment.",UHPLC-UV/Vis Quantitative Analysis of Hydroxylated and O-prenylated Coumarins in Pomegranate Seed Extracts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121819,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"A simple and rapid analytical UHPLC methodology with spectrophotometric (UV/Vis) detection, coupled with different extraction procedures, has been perfected to investigate the presence of biologically active O-prenylated umbelliferone derivatives, such as auraptene and umbelliprenin, in pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) seed extracts. Absolute ethanol was the most efficient extraction solvent in terms of yields, after a short ultrasound-assisted. The highest concentration values recorded under these experimental conditions were 1.99 μg/g of dry extract and 6.53 μg/g for auraptene and umbelliprenin, respectively. The parent metabolite umbelliferone was also detected (0.67 μg/g). The extraction and UHPLC analytical methodology set up in the present study proved to be an efficient, powerful, and versatile technique for the simultaneous qualitative analysis and quantification of oxyprenylated coumarins in pomegranate seed extracts.

Insects, such as fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), locusts (Locusta migratoria), stick insects (Baculum extradentatum) or beetles (Tenebrio molitor) are used to assess the effect of different active compounds, as well as to analyse the background and course of certain diseases, including heart disorders. The goal of this study was to assess the influence of secondary metabolites extracted from Solanaceae and Brassicaceae plants: Potato (Solanum tuberosum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) and horseradish (Armoracia rusticana), on T. molitor beetle heart contractility in comparison with pure alkaloids. During the in vivo bioassays, the plants glycoalkaloid extracts and pure substances were injected at the concentration 10-5 M into T. molitor pupa and evoked changes in heart activity. Pure glycoalkaloids caused mainly positive chronotropic effects, dependant on heart activity phase during a 24-h period of recording. Moreover, the substances affected the duration of the heart activity phases. Similarly, to the pure glycoalkaloids, the tested extracts also mainly accelerated the heart rhythm, however S. tuberosum and S. lycopersicum extracts slightly decreased the heart contractions frequency in the last 6 h of the recording. Cardioacceleratory activity of only S. lycopersicum extract was higher than single alkaloids whereas S. tubersoum and S. nigrum extracts were less active when compared to pure alkaloids. The most cardioactive substance was chaconine which strongly stimulated heart action during the whole recording after injection. A. rusticana extract which is composed mainly of glucosinolates did not significantly affect the heart contractions. Obtained results showed that glycoalkaloids were much more active than glucosinolates. However, the extracts depending on the plant species might be more or less active than pure substances.",Transthoracic Impedance Measured with Defibrillator Pads-New Interpretations of Signal Change Induced by Ventilations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121817,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 24,"Compressions during the insufflation phase of ventilations may cause severe pulmonary injury during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Transthoracic impedance (TTI) could be used to evaluate how chest compressions are aligned with ventilations if the insufflation phase could be identified in the TTI waveform without chest compression artifacts. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether and how the insufflation phase could be precisely identified during TTI. We synchronously measured TTI and airway pressure (Paw) in 21 consenting anaesthetised patients, TTI through the defibrillator pads and Paw by connecting the monitor-defibrillator's pressure-line to the endotracheal tube filter. Volume control mode with seventeen different settings were used (5-10 ventilations/setting): Six volumes (150-800 mL) with 12 min-1 frequency, four frequencies (10, 12, 22 and 30 min-1) with 400 mL volume, and seven inspiratory times (0.5-3.5 s ) with 400 mL/10 min-1 volume/frequency. Median time differences (quartile range) between timing of expiration onset in the Paw-line (PawEO) and the TTI peak and TTI maximum downslope were measured. TTI peak and PawEO time difference was 579 (432-723) m s for 12 min-1, independent of volume, with a negative relation to frequency, and it increased linearly with inspiratory time (slope 0.47, R 2 = 0.72). PawEO and TTI maximum downslope time difference was between -69 and 84 m s for any ventilation setting (time aligned). It was independent ( R 2 < 0.01) of volume, frequency and inspiratory time, with global median values of -47 (-153-65) m s , -40 (-168-68) m s and 20 (-93-128) m s , for varying volume, frequency and inspiratory time, respectively. The TTI peak is not aligned with the start of exhalation, but the TTI maximum downslope is. This knowledge could help with identifying the ideal ventilation pattern during CPR.",A Comprehensive Plasma Metabolomics Dataset for a Cohort of Mouse Knockouts within the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121816,Metabolites,2019 05 24,"Mouse knockouts facilitate the study ofgene functions. Often, multiple abnormal phenotypes are induced when a gene is inactivated. The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) has generated thousands of mouse knockouts and catalogued their phenotype data. We have acquired metabolomics data from 220 plasma samples from 30 unique mouse gene knockouts and corresponding wildtype mice from the IMPC. To acquire comprehensive metabolomics data, we have used liquid chromatography (LC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) for detecting polar and lipophilic compounds in an untargeted approach. We have also used targeted methods to measure bile acids, steroids and oxylipins. In addition, we have used gas chromatography GC-TOFMS for measuring primary metabolites. The metabolomics dataset reports 832 unique structurally identified metabolites from 124 chemical classes as determined by ChemRICH software. The GCMS and LCMS raw data files, intermediate and finalized data matrices, R-Scripts, annotation databases, and extracted ion chromatograms are provided in this data descriptor. The dataset can be used for subsequent studies to link genetic variants with molecular mechanisms and phenotypes.",Effect of Different Surface Conditions on Toughness of Vanadis 6 Cold Work Die Steel-A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121815,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"The effects of surface roughness, presence of nitrided diffusion regions, and magnetron sputtering of Cr2N-6Ag thin films on the toughness of Cr-V ledeburitic Vanadis 6 die steel were investigated by using the flexural strength measurement method, which was coupled with careful microstructural investigations and analyses of fractured surfaces. The results undoubtedly show that enhanced surface roughness reduces the material toughness, since the cusps formed on the metallic surface as a result of the machining act as preferential sites for crack nucleation and growth. The presence of nitrided regions on the surface, on the other hand, forms a structural notch there, which has a strong detrimental effect on toughness. Deposition of Cr2N-6Ag thin films has only marginal effect on the steel toughness. Practical recommendations for the designers, heat treaters, and coaters of the tools are thus that they should maintain the surface finish quality of the tools as high as possible, avoid too thick and supersaturated nitrided regions, and that there is almost no risk of tool embrittlement due to physical vapor deposition (PVD) coating.",Data-Driven Analysis of Antimicrobial Resistance in Foodborne Pathogens from Six States within the US.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121814,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 24,"Foodborne pathogens cause thousands of illnesses across the US each year. However, these pathogens gain resistance to the antimicrobials that are commonly used to treat them. Typically, antimicrobial resistance is caused by mechanisms encoded by multiple antimicrobial-resistance genes. These are carried through pathogens found in foods such as meats. It is, thus, important to study the genes that are most related to antimicrobial resistance, the pathogens, and the meats carrying antimicrobial-resistance genes. This information can be further used to correlate the antimicrobial-resistance genes found in humans for improving human health. Therefore, we perform the first multivariate statistical analysis of the antimicrobial-resistance gene data provided in the NCBI Pathogen Detection Isolates Browser database, covering six states that are geographically either in close proximity to one another (i.e., Pennsylvania (PA), Maryland (MD), and New York (NY)) or far (i.e., New Mexico (NM), Minnesota (MN), and California (CA)). Hundreds of multidimensional data points were projected onto a two-dimensional space that was specified by the first and second principal components, which were then categorized with a hierarchical clustering approach. It turns out that aadA, aph(3''), aph(3'')-Ib, aph(6)-I, aph(6)-Id, bla, blaCMY, tet, tet(A), and sul2 constructed the assembly of ten genes that were most commonly involved in antimicrobial resistance in these six states. While geographically close states like PA, MD and NY share more similar antimicrobial-resistance genes, geographically far states like NM, MN, and CA also contain most of these common antimicrobial-resistance genes. One potential reason for this spread of antimicrobial-resistance genes beyond the geographic limitation is that animal meats like chicken and turkey act as the carriers for the nationwide spread of these genes.","Domino Multicomponent Approach for the Synthesis of Functionalized Spiro-Indeno[1,2-b]quinoxaline Heterocyclic Hybrids and Their Antimicrobial Activity, Synergistic Effect and Molecular Docking Simulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121813,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 24,"An expedient synthesis of hitherto unexplored novel hybrid heterocycles comprising dispiropyrrolidine, N-styrylpiperidone and indeno[1,2-b]quinoxaline units has been developed via domino multicomponent 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition strategy employing a new class of azomethine ylide in ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide.

Gut microbiota is mechanistically relevant for a number of disease states and consequently has been incorporated as a key variable in personalised nutrition models within the research context. This paper aims to review the evidence related to the predictive capacity of baseline microbiota for clinical response to dietary intervention in two specific health conditions, namely, obesity and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Clinical trials and larger predictive modelling studies were identified and critically evaluated. The findings reveal inconsistent evidence to support baseline microbiota as an accurate predictor of weight loss or glycaemic response in obesity, or as a predictor of symptom improvement in irritable bowel syndrome, in dietary intervention trials. Despite advancement in quantification methodologies, research in this area remains challenging and larger scale studies are needed until personalised nutrition is realistically achievable and can be translated to clinical practice.",Aspergillus flavus as a Model System to Test the Biological Activity of Botanicals: An Example on Citrullus colocynthis L.

Clinical studies aimed at confirming the chemical and biological bases of pharmacological activity assigned to many plant/herb extracts used in folk medicine often rely on results obtained from laboratory preliminary tests. We investigated the biological activity of some C. colocynthis stem, leaf, and root extracts on the mycotoxigenic and phytopathogenic fungus Aspergillus flavus, testing a possible correlation between the inhibitory effect on aflatoxin biosynthesis, the phytochemical composition of extracts, and their in vitro antioxidant capacities."

With this movement toward bundled reimbursement, it is unknown if a formula adjusting for similar risks in the Medicare population could be applied to PROs in commercially insured and Medicare Advantage populations undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study was performed to compare PROs after TKA in these insurance groups after adjusting for proposed risks. Demographics and clinical data were abstracted from medical records of 302 patients who underwent TKA performed by a single surgeon at a university-based orthopaedic practice during 2013 to 2017. Differences in PROs between commercially insured, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare patients during the 6 months following surgery were evaluated while controlling for demographics, clinical data, and baseline PRO scores. Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients were older (p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities (p = 0.001) than commercial patients. During the first 3 months following TKA, patients in all three groups experienced similar rates of recovery. At 6 months after surgery, outcomes began to diverge by insurance group. Medicare patients reported significantly less ability to perform activities of daily living (78.6 vs. 63.2; p = 0.001), worse physical function (39.6 vs. 44.9; p = 0.003), and more pain interference (57.9 vs. 52.4; p = 0.018) at day 180 than commercially insured patients. There were no statistically significant differences between Medicare Advantage patients and either commercially insured or Medicare patients. Therefore, commercial insurance companies that intend to apply a risk-adjusted equation similar to the CJR algorithm to commercial populations should be cautioned since the postoperative outcomes in this investigation differed after adjusting for the same risk factors that have been proposed for inclusion in the CJR algorithm. Nonetheless, further studies should be performed to ensure that companies participating in bundled reimbursement models have a positive influence on comprehensive health care for patients and providers. This is a level III, retrospective prognostic study.",Patellofemoral Arthroplasty: Short-Term Complications and Risk Factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121631,The journal of knee surgery,2019 05 23,"There is a paucity of literature regarding the short-term readmission, reoperation, and complication rates of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA). The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and risk factors of 30-day postoperative complications in patients undergoing PFA. A retrospective cohort study of subjects who underwent PFA from 2010 to 2015 was performed using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Perioperative outcomes and 30-day postoperative complications were ascertained, and patient demographics and comorbidities were analyzed using linear and binomial logistic regression analyses to determine risk factors for postoperative complications. Among the 1,069 patients identified in the NSQIP database, there was a 30-day readmission rate of 4.3% and a 30-day reoperation rate of 1.5%. The leading complications identified were bleeding requiring transfusion (11.7%), urinary tract infection (0.8%), and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (0.8%). Younger age was a risk factor for superficial wound infection (p = 0.012). Older age was a significant risk factor for longer hospital stays, readmission, bleeding requiring transfusion, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia (p < 0.05 for all). Male sex was a risk factor for longer operation time and DVT (p = 0.001 and p = 0.017, respectively), while female sex was associated with greater incidence of bleeding requiring transfusion (p = 0.049). Elevated body mass index (BMI) was a risk factor for longer hospital stays, greater total operation time, and bleeding requiring transfusion (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). Nonwhite race was a significant risk factor for readmission (p = 0.008). This represents the largest study on early readmissions and the associated risk factors after PFA. PFA 30-day readmission and reoperation rates were <5%. Older age and elevated BMI were both identified as risk factors for adverse perioperative outcomes, including longer operation times, longer hospital stays, and bleeding requiring transfusion.",Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction in Traumatic Patellar Dislocation without Patellar Fixation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121630,The journal of knee surgery,2019 05 23,"Acute traumatic patellar dislocation is a common injury, and spontaneous reduction may occur at the time of injury or may be reduced at the field of the accident by someone. It may be associated with osteochondral fractures and rupture of medial patellar stabilizers leading to recurrent patellar instability. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the outcomes of medial patellofemoral (PF) ligament (MPFL) reconstruction in recurrent traumatic patellar dislocation. Forty-five patients presented with PF instability as a result of traumatic rupture MPFL with normal patellar tracking underwent MPFL reconstruction without patellar fixation hardware through two parallel transpatellar tunnels and one screw in femoral tunnel. All patients were evaluated clinically preoperatively and at a minimum follow-up of 24 months, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Kujala scores were used to assess the clinical results. All patients were available for evaluation at a minimum of 24 months (up to 36 months). The mean age of these patients at the time of surgery was 22.82 years (range: 18-34 years). All patients gave history of trauma of their knees. Mean IKDC scale showed significant improvement as it rose from 47.17 preoperatively to 77.94 postoperatively, and mean Kujala score rose from 53.88 preoperatively to 86.24 postoperatively (p < 0.001). No recurrence of dislocation was recorded. Only three patients had mild atrophy of thigh and one patient had some difficulty in jumping. Reconstruction of MPFL by this method provides good clinical result in the treatment of PF instability by using autologous graft (semitendinosus and gracilis). Less hardware were used with less complications.",Factors Influencing Survivorship in Vasculopathic Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121629,The journal of knee surgery,2019 05 23,"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with peripheral vascular disease has sparsely been studied. This study examined patient and radiographic factors that could affect reoperation free survival in these patients. We retrospectively reviewed TKA procedures performed in patients with nonpalpable pulses on physical examination between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2013. Ninety-two cases met inclusion criteria. Preoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI), date of surgery, sex, age, body mass index (BMI), tourniquet use, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, presence of preoperative calcifications, and follow-up data were obtained. Failure was defined as reoperation. Patients were included if they experienced a failure or had at least 2 years of follow-up. Reoperation free survival was calculated by Kaplan-Meier's analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for patient factors; hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated by Cox's regression analysis. Ninety-two TKAs were included in the study. Mean age was 68.8 years, mean BMI was 32.15, and mean ASA score was 2.44. Tourniquet was used in 78 patients. Mean preoperative ABI was 1.016. Nine patients had calcifications on X-ray prior to surgery. Reoperation free survival was 9.378 years. Patients with a preoperative ABI of below 0.7 had shorter reoperation free survival (ABI <0.7, 6.854 years; ABI >0.7, 9.535 years; p = 0.015). Patients with a preoperative ABI below 0.7 had greater odds of failure and were at higher risk for earlier failure (OR = 6.5, p = 0.027; HR = 1.678, p = 0.045). When corrected for age, sex, and BMI, the HR for patients with a preoperative ABI below 0.7 worsened (HR = 1.913, p = 0.035) compared with those with an ABI above 0.7. The remaining patient factors produced no statistically significant differences in survivorship, odds of failure, or HRs. No patient factors were associated with increased risk of mortality. These results suggest that patients who undergo TKA with an ABI below 0.7 are at increased risk for reoperation and have shorter reoperation free survival.",Isolated Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction Can Be an Effective Procedure in Patellofemoral Instability with Risk Factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121628,The journal of knee surgery,2019 05 23,"Patellofemoral instability is a severe problem in young and active patients. This pathology is influenced by ligamentous, bony, and neuromuscular parameters. The reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) evolved to a primary procedure, but combined procedures were more frequently performed in the past years. However, additional operative procedures are associated with increased morbidity and no absolute indication can be identified in the literature. This study is intended to clarify whether addressing only ligamentous influence factors (MPFL) in chronic patellofemoral instability is sufficient to produce good clinical outcomes, or whether other risk factors influence the results negatively and should also be treated at some point. In 52 patients with chronic patellofemoral instability patellar height according to Caton-Deschamps, trochlear dysplasia according to Dejour, the leg axis, the femoral antetorsion, tibial tubercle (TT)-trochlear groove, and TT-posterior cruciate ligament distance were evaluated. All patients were treated with isolated MPFL reconstruction. After a minimum follow-up period of 24 months (24-36 months), the clinical outcome results were calculated using the scoring system according to Lysholm and Tegner. Correlation between clinical outcome scores and anatomic risk factors were calculated. The analysis was performed using a standard statistical software package (JMP version 12, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The average postoperative Lysholm score increased significantly from 57.23 ± 19.9 to 85.9 ± 17.2 points (p < 0.0001) after isolated MPFL reconstruction. Moreover, the Tegner and Lysholm scores significantly improved both in patients without and with different risk factors postoperative. There were no significant differences in the outcome sores between the groups. Even the degree of trochlear dysplasia (types I-III) did not influence the results. Finally, there was no significant correlation found between all collected risk factors and the postoperative outcome scores. Isolated MPFL reconstruction can be an effective procedure in patients with patellofemoral instability and mild to moderate risk factors."

Objectives We aimed to evaluate the benefit of PST compared to surgical alone (SA) in patients with localized PanNEN. Method We selected patients with stage I-III PanNEN who underwent curative-intent surgical resection in National Cancer Database from 2006 to 2014. Patients who had both PST and surgical resection were matched with patients who received SA by propensity score at 1-to-1 ratio with nearest neighbor method. Results 4,892 patients were included in this study with median age of 60 years. Factors associated with significant more use of PST compared to SA included age<65 years, community medical facilities, grade 3 tumor, tumor in the pancreatic head, T3-4 tumor and N1 tumor. 301 PST patients were matched with 301 SA patients. In the matched cohort, the PST group had significantly shorter overall survival compared to the SA group (median overall both not reached, p = 0.037). This finding was confirmed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression in the original cohort (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.11-1.89, p = 0.006). Subgroup analyses showed that adjuvant therapy was not associated with improved overall survival in grade 1-2 PanNEN (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.31-3.16, p = 0.002). Conclusions PST stratified by grade and neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy compared to surgery alone was not associated with improved overall survival in patients with localized PanNEN. PST for localized PanNEN should be used with caution until prospective data are available.","Morphometric, Densitometric, and Mechanical Properties of Maxillary Teeth in 5-Month-Old Polish Merino Sheep.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121585,"Cells, tissues, organs",2019 05 23,"This study was performed to determine morphological, densitometric, mechanical, and elemental characteristics of maxillary teeth in 5-month-old Polish Merino sheep.

Micro-computed tomography was used to determine the total enamel volume (Evol), volumetric enamel mineral density, total dentine volume (Dvol), volumetric dentine mineral density, and total tooth enamel and dentine volume (EDvol). Compression testing was used to determine the ultimate force of teeth. Microhardness of enamel and dentine was evaluated using Vicker's test. Elemental analysis of enamel and dentine was performed using a scanning electron microscopy technique. Tooth weight, length, Tvol, Evol, Dvol, and EDvol increased consequently from the lowest values for p2, then for p3 and p4, to the highest values obtained for M1 (all p < 0.05). Ultimate force reached the lowest value for p2 compared with the other teeth (p < 0.05). The comparison of left and right teeth did not reveal significant differences for all the evaluated parameters (p > 0.05). Volumetric mineral density, calcium and phosphorus content, and microhardness were higher in enamel than in dentine, while the opposite results were obtained for magnesium and oxygen (all p < 0.05).

However, limited to the technology and material properties, studies are always focused on only one of the issues. Here, a novel strategy for manipulating the relative aspect ratio and arrangement of nickel nanowires (NiNWs) at nanoscale by Halbach array assisted assembly technology is introduced. Head-to-tail nickel nanowire chains as large as hundreds of micrometers are formed as a result of the dipole-dipole interactions of wire-wire. The arrangement of nickel nanowires can be preciously controlled by layer-by-layer deposition. Notably, the alignment create a significant improvement on the optoelectronic performance of nickel nanowire TCFs. The optimized orderly aligned NiNWs TCFs demonstrate super optoelectronic performance (90 Ω sq-1, 86%) than disordered NiNW TCFs (200 Ω sq-1, 80%). Moreover, NiNW-based TCFs exhibit outstanding long-term oxidation stability at 80 °C over 30 d as well as high-temperature oxidization stability even up to 300 °C, that is the most stable metal nanowire-based TCFs in air as far as we know. The low-cost, good optoelectronic performance and excellent oxidation resistance of aligned NiNWs will make them as attractive alternatives to silver nanowires for TCFs application.",Spin-orbit-induced hole spin relaxation in a quantum dot molecule: the effect of <i>s-p</i> coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121571,Journal of physics.

We have combined various microscopy techniques and computed tomography (CT) scanning for the analysis of the basic structure of the plant's stabilization system. Mechanical tests yielded key mechanical parameters and allowed us to assess the mode of failure. The results of the tests were further processed in a finite element method (FEM) analysis. We were able to show that both plants are able to endure high loads irrespective of the different composition of the supporting structure. C. fallax forms many separate branched strands, whereas T. majus forms fewer strands of greater diameter interconnected in the centre of the transition area, forming a bundle of irregular orientation. This results in different ways to dissipate loads on the lamina. In C. fallax we observed the outer strands of the strengthening tissue of under high stress while the inner bundle carries little load. In T. majus the load is distributed more evenly through the juncture in the middle of the transition area.

Design and fabrication innovations for high capacitance density RF capacitors are highly desired for the miniaturization of RFIC chips. However, practical and simple solutions are limited by existing capabilities in three-dimensional (3D) structure construction and the effective configuration of electrodes. We report a unique route to achieve unprecedentedly high capacitance density at a high operating frequency through a capacitor configuration of 3D coil interdigital electrodes using planar semiconductor processing compatible materials and fabrication methods. A systematic mechanical-electrical design principle is demonstrated, and samples show a maximum 21.5 pF capacitance, which is 17.2× larger after rolling up. The corresponding capacitance density is as large as 371 pF/mm2, with resonant frequency of 1.5 GHz. The performance could be improved significantly by simply rolling up more turns with minimal change to the area footprint.",Disordered contacts can localize helical edge electrons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121567,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 06 06,"It is well known that quantum spin Hall (QSH) edge modes being helical are immune to backscattering due to non-magnetic disorder within the sample. Thus, QSH edge modes are non-localized and show a vanishing Hall resistance along with quantized 2-terminal, longitudinal and non-local resistances even in presence of sample disorder. However, this is not the case for contact disorder. This paper shows that when all contacts are disordered in a N-terminal QSH sample, then transport via these helical QSH edge modes can have a significant localization correction. All the resistances in a N-terminal QSH sample deviate from their values derived while neglecting the phase acquired at disordered contacts, and this deviation is called the quantum localization correction. This correction term increases with the increase of disorderedness of contacts but decreases with the increase in number of contacts in a N terminal sample. The presence of inelastic scattering, however, can completely destroy the quantum localization correction.",Enhancement of crossed Andreev reflection in a Kitaev ladder connected to normal metal leads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121566,Journal of physics.

The coupling between the two legs of the ladder when the legs are maintained at a (large) superconducting phase difference, results in the creation of subgap Andreev states. These states in turn are responsible for the enhancement of crossed Andreev reflection (CAR). We find that tuning the different parameters of the system suitably leads to enhancement of CAR signalled by transconductance acquiring the most negative value possible. Furthermore, subgap states cause oscillations of the transconductance as a function of various system parameters such as chemical potential and ladder length, which are seen to be a consequence of Fabry-Pérot resonance.",Monolithic 3D-Printing of embeddable and highly stretchable strain sensors using conductive ionogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121565,Nanotechnology,2019 05 23,"Medical training simulations that utilize 3D-printed, patient-specific tissue models improve practitioner and patient understanding of individualized procedures and capacitate pre-operative, patient-specific rehearsals. The impact of these novel constructs in medical training and pre-procedure rehearsals has been limited, however, by the lack of effectively embedded sensors that detect the location, direction, and amplitude of strains applied by the practitioner on the simulated structures. The monolithic fabrication of strain sensors embedded into lifelike tissue models with customizable orientation and placement could address this limitation. The demonstration of 3D printing of an ionogel as a stretchable, piezoresistive strain sensor embedded in an elastomer is presented as a proof-of-concept of this integrated fabrication for the first time. The significant hysteresis and drift inherent to solid-phase piezoresistive composites and the dimensional instability of low-hysteresis piezoresistive liquids inspired the adoption of a 3D-printable piezoresistive ionogel composed of reduced graphene oxide and an ionic liquid. The shear-thinning rheology of the ionogel obviates the need to fabricate additional structures that define or contain the geometry of the sensing channel. Sensors are printed on and subsequently encapsulated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a thermoset elastomer commonly used for analogue tissue models, to demonstrate seamless fabrication. Strain sensors demonstrate geometry- and strain-dependent gauge factors of 0.54-2.41, a high dynamic strain range of 350% that surpasses the failure strain of most dermal and viscus tissue, low hysteresis (&amp;lt;3.5% degree of hysteresis up to 300% strain) and baseline drift, a single-value response, and excellent fatigue stability (5,000 stretching cycles). In addition, we fabricate sensors with stencil-printed silver/PDMS electrodes in place of wires to highlight the potential of seamless integration with printed electrodes. The compositional tunability of ionic liquid/graphene-based composites and the shear-thinning rheology of this class of conductive gels endows an expansive combination of customized sensor geometry and performance that can be tailored to patient-specific, high-fidelity, monolithically fabricated tissue models.",Manifestation of charge/orbital order and charge transfer in temperature-dependent optical conductivity of single-layered Pr<sub>0.5</sub>Ca<sub>1.5</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub>.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121564,Journal of physics.

A previous experimental study on that system, supported by a simple modelling, has suggested that the charge/orbital ordering play an important role in governing the temperature dependence of optical conductivity of a broad peak around 0.8 eV. In addition, another peak around 3.5 eV, which is less sensitive to temperature, has been attributed to the charge transfer from O-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;p&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; to Mn-e&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;g&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; orbitals. Nevertheless, the theoretical explanation was incomplete as the role of O-&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;p&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; orbitals was not considered in the model.

Our results reveal the charge/orbital-ordering peak in&amp;#13; the region 0.7-1.2 eV, which is blue-shifted with decreasing temperature, and the charge-transfer peak around 3.5 eV, which is less sensitive to temperature. The capability of our model to capture the general prole and temperature dependence of the optical conductivity suggests the validity of our theory.",Tryptophan-related dipeptides in fermented dairy products suppress microglial activation and prevent cognitive decline.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121563,Aging,2019 06 05,"The rapid growth in aging populations has made prevention of age-related memory decline and dementia a high priority. Several epidemiological and clinical studies have concluded that fermented dairy products can help prevent cognitive decline; furthermore, intake of Camembert cheese prevents microglial inflammation and Alzheimer's pathology in mouse models. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the preventive effects of fermented dairy products, we screened peptides from digested milk protein for their potential to regulate the activation of microglia. We identified dipeptides of tryptophan-tyrosine (WY) and tryptophan-methionine that suppressed the microglial inflammatory response and enhanced the phagocytosis of amyloid-β (Aβ). Various fermented dairy products and food materials contain the WY peptide. Orally administered WY peptide was smoothly absorbed into blood, delivered to the brain, and improved the cognitive decline induced by lipopolysaccharide via the suppression of inflammation. Intake of the WY peptide prevented microglial inflammation, hippocampal long-term potential deficit, and memory impairment in aged mice. In an Alzheimer's model using 5×FAD mice, intake of the WY peptide also suppressed microglial inflammation and accumulation of Aβ, which improved cognitive decline. The identified dipeptides regulating microglial activity could potentially be used to prevent cognitive decline and dementia related to inflammation."

To determine the occurrence and distribution of ARGs in artificial agricultural irrigation systems, we designed eight sample sites of farmland drainage in the Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. Results indicated that the distribution of ARGs in sub-drainage canals is influenced by the local urban area, agriculture, and animal husbandry structure. The blaTEM gene was predominant in the water samples (up to 8.98 ARG copies/16S rRNA genes). The average ARG abundance in drainage channel sampling sites was significantly higher than the influent water from the Yellow River, which means that the artificial agricultural irrigation system enhances the abundance of resistance genes in the study area. Moreover, the effluent water of the whole irrigation system presented a lower abundance of ARGs than the influent water. This demonstrates that the Wuliangsuhai watershed ecosystem plays an important role in regulating the abundance of ARGs in the area. In our study, the mobile gene elements correlated with trB, emrD, mexF, and vanC (P < 0.001) in the irrigation system. Additionally, different correlations exist between other special subtypes of ARGs.

In this work, MIL-100(Fe) as a heterogeneous Fenton-like photocatalyst was used for the treatment of formaldehyde-contaminated water. The MIL-100(Fe) was synthesized via a facile solvothermal method and fully characterized using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Based on the results, the formation of highly porous, crystalline, and stable visible light-responsive MIL-100(Fe) was confirmed. The Fenton-like photocatalytic efficiency of the MIL-100(Fe) toward the degradation of formaldehyde was then studied under visible light irradiation. For this purpose, the effect of initial concentration of formaldehyde, photocatalyst dose, H2O2 concentration, solution pH, and contact time on the removal efficiency of the MIL-100(Fe) was investigated using central composite design. The obtained results showed that the removal efficiency of the MIL-100(Fe) is significantly affected by the initial concentration of formaldehyde.

The 16 EPA priority PAHs decreased from 95.23 to 23.41 mg kg-1 over 35 days. Compared with soil without the introduction of this bacterial community, adding the community with RHDα genes significantly decreased soil PAH contents, particularly HMW PAHs. The metabolic rate of PAHs in soil was positively correlated with nidA and nahAc gene contents.

Road-deposited sediments (RDS) accumulate a variety of toxic substances which are transported into nature during hydrologic events, mainly affecting water bodies through stormwater runoff. The aim of this study was to evaluate the RDS metal enrichment ratio between the end of wet season and the middle of the dry season for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in samples from Natal, Brazil. Twenty RDS, drainage system and river sediment samples were collected in the wet and dry seasons using a stainless-steel pan, brush and spatula. In the laboratory, the samples were submitted to acid digestion and heavy metal concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). A consistent RDS enrichment by heavy metals in dry season samples was followed by an increase in the finest particle size fraction (D < 63 μm). Maximum concentrations were 5, ND, 108, 23810, 83, ND, 77 and 150 mg kg-1 for Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, respectively. The RDS enrichment ratio was Cr(1.3 × ), Cu(2.6 × ), Fe(3.3 × ), Mn(1.5 × ), Pb(1.5 × ) and Zn(2.1 × ). The Geo-accumulation Index values showed that RDS were moderately polluted for Cu and slighted polluted for Zn and Pb.

Simultaneously, organisms at each salinity were exposed to either the antimicrobial agent Triclosan (TCS) or the pharmaceutical drug Diclofenac (DIC) at 1 μg/L. Salinity alone and exposure to PPCPs changed mussel's metabolic capacity and oxidative status, but no additive or synergetic effects resulting from the combined exposures were observed. Overall, the metabolic capacity of mussels was decreased when exposed to TCS and DIC under control salinity, which was less pronounced at salinities out of the control level. TCS had a notorious effect over glutathione peroxidase activity while DIC exposure enhanced catalase response. Such defence mechanisms were able to prevent cellular damage but still a clear reduction in GSH/GSSG ratio after PPCPs exposures indicates oxidative stress which could compromise bivalve's performance to further stressing events."

This study aimed to investigate how ocean-climate variability is associated with spatial and temporal changes in benthic larval recruitment of tropical reef assemblages. Recruitment (abundance, richness, and diversity) of benthic invertebrates was monitored for one year on macroalgal beds in four rocky reefs in a marine protected region in the Eastern coast of Brazil, and compared to fluctuations in meteo-oceanographic conditions at multiple temporal scales (days, weeks, and months). Our results revealed that recruitment of benthic invertebrates varies widely (up to 15 orders of magnitude) among sampled reefs and in time, with wave height, wind speed, and sea temperature being significantly related to recruitment variability. We detected strong taxonomic variability in recruitment success and ocean-climate variables, which highlights the complexity of estimating community vulnerability to climate change in benthic communities. Given that macroalgal beds are key to recruitment of some species regionally (4-30 km), the protection of coastal nursery habitats may be critical for marine conservation and species adaptation in a climate change scenario. Considering the projected ocean-climate change in IPCC scenarios, our study suggests that recruitment of marine populations in coastal reefs could be highly sensitive to climate change in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean.","Breast cancer, placenta and pregnancy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121525,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 05 29,"Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies during pregnancy.

In recent years, the hypothesis of a continuum between Schizophrenia (SZ) and Bipolar disorder (BD), postulating a common pathophysiologic mechanism, has been proposed. Although appealing, this unifying hypothesis may be too simplistic when looking at cognitive and affective differences these patients display. In this paper, we aim to test an expanded version of the continuum hypothesis according to which the continuum extends over three clusters: the psychotic, the cognitive, and the affective. We applied an innovative approach known as Source-based Morphometry (SBM) to the structural images of 46 individuals diagnosed with SZ, 46 with BD and 66 healthy controls (HC). We also analyzed the psychological profiles of the three groups using cognitive, affective, and clinical tests. At a neural level, we found evidence for a shared psychotic core in a distributed network involving portions of the medial parietal and temporo-occipital areas, as well as parts of the cerebellum and the middle frontal gyrus. We also found evidence of a cognitive core more compromised in SZ, including alterations in a fronto-parietal circuit, and mild evidence of an affective core more compromised in BD, including portions of the temporal and occipital lobes, cerebellum, and frontal gyrus. Such differences were confirmed by the psychological profiles, with SZ patients more impaired in cognitive tests, while BD in affective ones. On the bases of these results we put forward an expanded view of the continuum hypothesis, according to which a common psychotic core exists between SZ and BD patients complemented by two separate cognitive and affective cores that are both impaired in the two patients' groups, although to different degrees.",24-Epibrassinolide promotes arsenic tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana L. by altering stress responses at biochemical and molecular level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121523,Journal of plant physiology,2019 06 14,"In this study, the effect of 24-Epibrassinolide (EBL) on antioxidant system in Arabidopsis thaliana were investigated under arsenate [As(V)] stress. The enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), total antioxidant status, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and free proline content, as well as the expression levels of SOD isoforms (Cu-ZnSODs, FeSODs and MnSOD), CAT isoforms (CAT1, CAT2 and CAT3), some heat shock proteins (Hsp70-4 and Hsp90-1) and proline biosynthesis (P5CS1 and P5CS2) genes were determined in rosette leaves of eight-week old plants under exposure of 100 and 200 μM As(V) and/or 1 μM EBL treatments for 24 h. Total SOD and CAT enzyme activities increased as a result of 100 μM As(V) + EBL treatments compared to 100 μM As(V) treatment. Total antioxidant and proline levels increased in plants subjected to As(V), and the treatment of EBL together with stress caused further increase. As the MDA level increased in As-treated plants, 100 μM As(V) + EBL treatment decreased MDA level. Transcript levels of CSD1, CSD2, FSD1, FSD2, MSD1 and CAT2 genes increased as a result of combined treatment of EBL and As(V) compared to control and alone stress treatments (except CSD1 gene). Expression level of CSD3, CAT1 and CAT3 genes were downregulated in response to As(V) and/or EBL treatments. EBL application alone and in combination with As(V) elevated the expression level of P5CS1 gene dramatically. Treatment with 100 μM As(V) and EBL increased the transcript level of Hsp70-4 and Hsp90-1 genes in leaves compared to 100 μM As(V) treatment. To our best knowledge, this is the first detailed study to evaluate the improving effect of EBL on antioxidant defense system at biochemical and transcriptional level in A. thaliana plants under As(V) stress.",Involvement of polyamines in sucrose-induced tolerance to atrazine-mediated chemical stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121522,Journal of plant physiology,2019 06 14,"Treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with the PSII-inhibiting herbicide atrazine results in xenobiotic and oxidative stress, developmental arrest, induction of senescence and cell death processes. In contrast, exogenous sucrose supply confers a high level of atrazine stress tolerance, in relation with genome-wide modifications of transcript levels and regulation of genes involved in detoxification, defense and repair. However, the regulation mechanisms related to exogenous sucrose, involved in this sucrose-induced tolerance, are largely unknown. Characterization of these mechanisms was carried out through a combination of transcriptomic, metabolic, functional and mutant analysis under different conditions of atrazine exposure. Exogenous sucrose was found to differentially regulate genes involved in polyamine synthesis. ARGININE DECARBOXYLASE ADC1 and ADC2 paralogues, which encode the rate-limiting enzyme (EC 4.1.1.19) of the first step of polyamine biosynthesis, were strongly upregulated by sucrose treatment in the presence of atrazine. Such regulation occurred concomitantly with significant changes of major polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine). Physiological characterization of a mutant affected in ADC activity and exogenous treatments with sucrose, putrescine, spermidine and spermine further showed that modification of polyamine synthesis and of polyamine levels could play adaptive roles in response to atrazine stress, and that putrescine and spermine had antagonistic effects, especially in the presence of sucrose. This interplay between sucrose, putrescine and spermine is discussed in relation with survival and anti-death mechanisms in the context of chemical stress exposure.",Childhood disclosure of sexual abuse and mental health outcomes in adulthood: Assessing merits of early disclosure and discussion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121521,Child abuse & neglect,2019 06 10,"Empirical research on the impact of early disclosure of child sexual abuse (CSA) on survivor health is limited and mixed. One recent study found that early disclosure may actually be detrimental for abuse cessation and adult symptomatology (Swingle et al., 2016). The current study re-examined the effects of early disclosure and related variables on long-term mental health for men with histories of CSA.",Molecular imaging and therapy of somatostatin receptor positive tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121520,Clinical imaging,2019 05 27,"Somatostatin receptors (SSTR) are upregulated in the cells of origin that define numerous neuroendocrine neoplasms. PET imaging with 68Ga-DOTATATE allows specific targeting of SSTR2A, a single species of SSTR receptor, which is commonly overexpressed in a variety of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, as well as pulmonary carcinoid and head and neck tumors. Due to more specific targeting of SSTR2 as well as lower radiation dose, shorter study length, ability to quantify uptake, and lower cost, 68Ga-DOTATATE has demonstrated superior imaging attributes when compared to 111In-pentetreotide. As with any novel imaging modality, dedicated training, increasing experience and staying up-to-date with scientific publications are required to provide optimal patient care. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of the art in SSTR-targeted molecular imaging and discuss ongoing and future potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",Formation mechanism of organo-chromium (III) complexes from bioreduction of chromium (VI) by Aeromonas hydrophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121519,Environment international,2019 06 10,"Chromium is a common heavy metal widely present in aquatic environments. Cost-effective remediation of chromium-contaminated environment can be realized by microbial reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The genus Aeromonas species is one of such Cr(VI) reducers, whose reduction mechanism remains unrevealed and the main factors governing the Cr(VI) reduction pathways are unknown yet. In this work, the performances and mechanisms of Cr(VI) anaerobic reduction by Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966 were investigated. This strain exhibited excellent Cr(VI) resistance and could utilize a suite of electron donors to support Cr(VI) bioreduction. The Cr(VI) bioreduction processes involved both extracellular (the metal-reducing and respiratory pathway) and intracellular reaction pathways. Adding anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate or humic acid as a mediator substantially enhanced the Cr(VI) bioreduction. The forms and distribution of the Cr(VI) bioreduction products were affected by the medium composition. Soluble organo-Cr(III) complexes were identified as the main Cr(VI) reduction products when basal salts medium was adopted. Given the environmental ubiquity of the genus Aeromonas, the findings in this work may facilitate a better understanding about the transformation behaviors and fates of Cr(VI) in environments and provide useful clues to tune the bioremediation of chromium-contaminated environments.",Removal of perfluoalkyl acids (PFAAs) through fluorochemical industrial and domestic wastewater treatment plants and bioaccumulation in aquatic plants in river and artificial wetland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121518,Environment international,2019 06 10,"The fluorochemical industry has shifted to the production of short chain homologues of perfluoalkyl acids (PFAAs) in recent years. Yet the effective removal of short-chain PFAAs from wastewater is still a major challenge. In this study, the removal efficiencies (RM) of short- and long-chain PFAAs emitted from two fluorochemical industrial parks were evaluated in one industrial and two domestic waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of PFAAs in various emerged and submerged aquatic plants in adjacent river and an artificial wetland were also calculated. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were dominant in the whole area. The source water of the fluorochemical industrial WWTP (F-WWTP) gathered from the facilities in Park 2 contained total PFAAs (∑PFAAs) of 5,784 ng/L. Among the four main technologies, the biological aerated filter, combined with upflow sludge bed processes presented the greatest RM of ∑PFAAs in the F-WWTP, respectively. The source water of the wetland from the river brought ∑PFAAs to 21,579 ng/L, emerged plants showed higher BAF of PFBA and PFBS, while lower BAF of PFOA and PFOS than submerged plants. J. serotinus showed both the highest ∑PFAAs and the highest BAF for short chain PFAAs. With the increasing production capacity, this study provided valuable information for risk assessment and management of PFAA emission from point sources."
