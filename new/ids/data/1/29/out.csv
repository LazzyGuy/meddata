Therefore historian understanding of the catalytic and physicochemical properties is desirable. Owing to this, the biochemical properties of the crude laccases from Achromobacter xylosoxidans HWN16 (Hb9c) and Citrobacter freundii LLJ 16 (Ie1c) were assessed. Furthermore, a hint of the molecular basis for their production from respective organisms was presented. Results showed that both laccases were tolerant, and sometimes had their activities improved by the set of parameters tested. They were active at broad range of temperature (0-90 °C), pH (3-11), and were equally thermo- and pH-stable. Their activities were either improved, or left unabated by cations, detergents, and chloride (5-40%), however, the highlight of the study was their augmented activity, when they were incubated with certain concentrations of fluoride (2-20%), a potent inhibitor. They were depicted to have multiple homologous laccase encoding genes, on molecular evaluation, which may be responsible the conferral of these remarkable qualities they possess. Therefore, the laccases might be beneficial, if employed in formulations for a wide range of environmental and biotechnological applications. Moreover, the molecular machinery of their production be exploited for economical benefits in the immediate future.","Gene isolation, heterologous expression, purification and functional confirmation of sesamin synthase from Sesamum indicum L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016142,"Biotechnology reports (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 10,"Members of Cytochromes P450 super family of enzymes catalyse important biochemical reactions in plants. Some of these reactions are so important that they contribute to enormous chemical diversity seen in plants. Many unique secondary metabolites formed by mediation of these enzymes play key role in plant defence and often contribute to maintenance of human health. In oilseed crop Sesamum indicum, the reaction leading to the formation of clinically important sesamin is catalyzed by a unique methylene-di-oxy bridge forming Cytochrome P450 enzyme sesamin synthase. It is encoded by the gene CYP81Q1. In order to elucidate the structure - function relationship of this enzyme and to apply biotechnological tools for enhancing the production of sesamin in the crop, it was intended to clone and express the enzyme in a heterologous system. In this paper we present our results on synthesis of cDNA, cloning, expression and purification of CYP81Q1 from the developing seeds of sesame crop. Following the same procedure we have also cloned a CYP reductase1 (CPR1) gene (CPR1) to facilitate transfer of electron from NADPH to CYP81Q1 enzyme from the same crop. Functional characterization was performed by expressing the recombinant proteins in E. coli (pET28a/BL21-DE3 codon plus) and its activity was evaluated in vitro by HPLC. We demonstrate that purified CYP81Q1 enzyme, on its own, has limited level of activity in the conversion of pinoresinol to sesamin.

These statistical analyses are simple to conduct and provide valuable information about trends, patterns and thresholds of time-series over time and in relation to potential driver variables.

Here we report an optimised, significantly shorter (one day instead of five) and environmentally friendly procedure for the mg scale isolation of SGP using commercially available egg yolk powder. A single chromatographic step following chloroform/methanol precipitation of proteins and lipids yielded desired approximately 200 mg SGP from 250 g egg yolk powder within a day. •Environmentally friendly procedure for isolation of sialylglycopeptide from Egg yolk powder.•Reduced the protocol from five days down to one.",PCA-based supervised identification of biological soil crusts in multispectral images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016139,MethodsX,2019 04 24,"It was the aim of the method development to classify types of various biological soil crusts (biocrusts) using principle component analysis (PCA) on multispectral images.

The classification approach was based on the hypothesis that biocrust types map specifically in PCA ordination plots, meaning that distinct regions in ordination plots may be assigned specifically to individual biocrust types. Reallocation of the pixels assigned to biocrust types to their respective image coordinates would then yield biocrust classification plots. •Allows manual selection of features or identification of given features in PCA ordination plots.•Fully permits the selection of relevant and omission of irrelevant, as well as identification of unknown classes.•It is not restricted to RGB-NIR multispectral data only, but may be applied to any type of multimodal imaging data."

Prior studies have also examined greenspace and obesity in children, but these have yielded inconsistent results and focused mostly on older children. The purpose of this study was to assess associations between time children spent in greenspace as the primary exposure and our outcomes of interest, including 1) minutes of physical activity, and 2) body mass index (BMI) z-score. Our sample was 102 children ages 3 to 5 years living in Ensenada and Tijuana, Mexico. We fit linear mixed models to estimate associations between greenspace and children's physical activity and BMI z-score. After adjustment for potential confounders, greater time in greenspace was associated with decreased sedentary time (-0.08 min per hour for each additional 30 min in greenspace; 95% CI -0.13, -0.04; p = 0.002) and increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (0.06; 95% CI 0.03, 0.10; p < 0.001). Results were driven primarily by children in Tijuana (-0.22; 95% CI -0.38, -0.06; p = 0.008 for sedentary time and 0.15; 95% CI 0.06, 0.38; p = 0.007 for MVPA).

Importantly, the NH2-MIL-101(Fe)@NTU composite shows significantly enhanced catalytic conversion and selectivity during styrene oxidation. It is mainly due to the hydrophilic MOF nanocrystals readily gathering the hydrophobic reactants styrene and boosting the radical mechanism path after combining the hydrophobic COFs shell.

Here, direct in situ atomic-scale observations to understand the effects of size, surface, and defects in the sublimation process of supported silver nanoparticles upon heating within an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy are conducted. Atomic-scale evidence to sublimation and atomic rearrangement in small Ag nanoparticles during heating is provided, and it is demonstrated that the sublimation-induced stable surfaces in the particles with a size smaller than ≈30 nm are {111} and {100} planes. The role of surface energy and defects in the uniform and nonuniform sublimation pathways at the atomic scale is also revealed, and it is found that the nanoparticles with low surface energy tend to undergo a uniform sublimation pathway, while those with high surface energy or five-fold twin grain boundary proceed via a nonuniform sublimation pathway. Further dynamic analysis unravels a critical size of ≈8 nm for the transformation from linear to nonlinear sublimation rates in the two pathways. These findings demonstrate that the size, shape, and defects are of paramount importance for the sublimation dynamics in the first-order phase transformation, helping to advance the general understanding of many technological applications.",A Multiparameter Pressure-Temperature-Humidity Sensor Based on Mixed Ionic-Electronic Cellulose Aerogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016118,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 04 26,"Pressure (P), temperature (T), and humidity (H) are physical key parameters of great relevance for various applications such as in distributed diagnostics, robotics, electronic skins, functional clothing, and many other Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions. Previous studies on monitoring and recording these three parameters have focused on the integration of three individual single-parameter sensors into an electronic circuit, also comprising dedicated sense amplifiers, signal processing, and communication interfaces. To limit complexity in, e.g., multifunctional IoT systems, and thus reducing the manufacturing costs of such sensing/communication outposts, it is desirable to achieve one single-sensor device that simultaneously or consecutively measures P-T-H without cross-talks in the sensing functionality. Herein, a novel organic mixed ion-electron conducting aerogel is reported, which can sense P-T-H with minimal cross-talk between the measured parameters. The exclusive read-out of the three individual parameters is performed electronically in one single device configuration and is enabled by the use of a novel strategy that combines electronic and ionic Seebeck effect along with mixed ion-electron conduction in an elastic aerogel.

While photocatalytic and electrocatalytic N2 fixation are emerging as hot new areas of fundamental and applied research, serious concerns exist regarding the accuracy of current methods used for ammonia detection and quantification. In most studies, the ammonia yields are low and little consideration is given to the effect of interferants on NH3 quantification. As a result, NH3 yields reported in many works may be exaggerated and erroneous. Herein, the advantages and limitations of the various methods commonly used for NH3 quantification in solution (Nessler's reagent method, indophenol blue method, and ion chromatography method) are systematically explored, placing particular emphasis on the effect of interferants on each quantification method.

However, intravenous administration of MSCs is hampered by cell trapping within the pulmonary capillary networks. Here, it is hypothesized that traditional 2D plastic-adherent cell expansion fails to result in appropriate morphorheological properties required for successful cell circulation. To address this issue, a method to culture MSCs in nonadherent 3D spheroids (mesenspheres) is adapted. The biological properties of mesensphere-cultured MSCs remain identical to conventional 2D cultures. However, morphorheological analyses reveal a smaller size and lower stiffness of mesensphere-derived MSCs compared to plastic-adherent MSCs, measured using real-time deformability cytometry and atomic force microscopy. These properties result in an increased ability to pass through microconstrictions in an ex vivo microcirculation assay. This ability is confirmed in vivo by comparison of cell accumulation in various organ capillary networks after intravenous injection of both types of MSCs in mouse. The findings generally identify cellular morphorheological properties as attractive targets for improving microcirculation and specifically suggest mesensphere culture as a promising approach for optimized MSC-based therapies.",Unveiling Excitonic Dynamics in High-Efficiency Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells to Direct Morphological Optimization for Suppressing Charge Recombination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016115,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 04 26,"Nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs)-based organic solar cells (OSCs) have recently drawn considerable research interests; however, their excitonic dynamics seems quite different than that of fullerene acceptors-based devices and remains to be largely explored.

Despite the small energy offsets, efficient electron/hole transfer between PBBF11 and ITIC is both clearly observed from steady-state photoluminescence and transient absorption spectra and also supported by the measured low exciton binding energy in ITIC. Consequently, the PBBF11:ITIC-based OSCs afford an encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.02%. Although the good miscibility of PBBF11 and ITIC induces a homogenous blend film morphology, it causes severe charge recombination. The fullerene acceptor of PC71BM with varying loading ratios is therefore added to modulate film morphology to effectively reduce the charge recombination. As a result, the optimal OSCs based on PBBF11:ITIC:PC71BM yield a better PCE of 11.4% without any additive or annealing treatment.",Synergetic Functional Nanocomposites Enhance Immunotherapy in Solid Tumors by Remodeling the Immunoenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016114,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 04 26,"Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has demonstrated significant clinical success in various malignant tumors. However, the therapeutic response is limited due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITM). In this study, a functional nanomaterial, layered double hydroxides (LDHs), carrying specific functional miR155 is developed to modulate ITM by synergistically repolarizing tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) to M1 subtype. LDH nanoparticles loaded with miR155 (LDH@155) exhibit superior ability in cellular uptake by murine macrophages, miR escape into the cytoplasm and TAMs specific delivery when introtumoral administration. Meanwhile, upon exposure to LDH@155, TAMs are significantly skewed to M1 subtype, which markedly inhibits myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) formation and stimulates T-lymphocytes to secrete more interferon-γ (IFN-γ) cytokines in vitro. Introtumoral administration of LDH@155 reduces the percentage of TAMs and MDSCs in the tumor and elevates CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, which can promote therapeutic efficiency of α-PD-1 antibody immunotherapy. Furthermore, it is found that LDH@155 significantly decreases the expression level of phosphorylated STAT3 and ERK1/2 and activates NF-κB expression in TAMs, indicating that the STAT3, ERK1/2, and NF-κB signaling pathways may involve in LDH@155-induced macrophage polarization. Overall, the results suggest that LDH@155 nanoparticles may, in the future, function as a promising agent for cancer combinational immunotherapy.",Hierarchical Micro-Nano Sheet Arrays of Nickel-Cobalt Double Hydroxides for High-Rate Ni-Zn Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016113,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2019 04 26,"The rational design of nickel-based cathodes with highly ordered micro-nano hierarchical architectures by a facile process is fantastic but challenging to achieve for high-capacity and high-rate Ni-Zn batteries.

The fabrication process is conducted at room temperature without any need of heating and stirring, and the as-grown nickel-cobalt double hydroxide (NiCo-DH) supported on conductive nickel substrate is endowed with a unique 3D hierarchical architecture of micro-nano sheet arrays, which empower the effective exposure of active materials, easy electrolyte access, fast ion diffusion, and rapid electron transfer. Benefiting from these merits in combination, the NiCo-DH electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 303.6 mAh g-1 and outstanding rate performance (80% retention after 20-fold current increase), which outperforms the electrodes made of single Ni(OH)2 and Co(OH)2, and other similar materials. The NiCo-DH electrode, when employed as the cathode for a Ni-Zn battery, demonstrates a high specific capacity of 329 mAh g-1. Moreover, the NiCo-DH//Zn battery also exhibits high electrochemical energy conversion efficiency, excellent rate capability (62% retention after 30-fold current increase), ultrafast charge characteristics, and strong tolerance to the high-speed conversion reaction."

Our study aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines for UGE and to assess the diagnostic yield of endoscopy in a tertiary care center in South India. Methods The study was conducted as a prospective analytical study. Indications for endoscopy were classified as ""ASGE appropriate"" and ""ASGE inappropriate"". The significance of association of ASGE guidelines and other categorical variables with endoscopic findings were assessed. Results ASGE appropriate indications and inappropriate indications accounted for 85.9% and 14.1% of endoscopies, respectively. The most common appropriate indication was persistent dyspepsia despite adequate proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (28.1%) and the only inappropriate indication for endoscopy was isolated dyspepsia without adequate PPI therapy (14.1%). The diagnostic yield of endoscopy for appropriate indications was 69.5% and for inappropriate indications was 55.1%, the difference was statistically significant (P= 0.003; OR-1.857). The sensitivity and specificity of ASGE guidelines was 88.5% and 19.5%, respectively. Conclusion According to our study, ASGE guidelines may be considered as appropriate guidelines for UGE in our population and these guidelines were followed 85.9% of the times in referring patients for the same. However, the high diagnostic yield even in inappropriate endoscopies indicates the necessity of further studies that might identify other relevant indications for endoscopy, thus avoiding misutilization of resources without missing out on relevant cases.",Outcomes of Inpatient Versus Outpatient Elective Foot and Ankle Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016085,Cureus,2019 04 26,"Background Complications following orthopedic surgeries are undesirable and costly. A potential method to reduce these costs is to perform traditionally inpatient surgical procedures in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes between inpatient and outpatient settings for elective foot and ankle surgeries using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Methods Patients with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes specific to orthopedic foot and ankle surgery were identified from the 2011-2015 American College of Surgeons NSQIP database. Demographics, comorbidities, and complications were compared between patients undergoing inpatient and outpatient procedures. Results Patients receiving inpatient surgery were significantly older and more frequently male. Black patients were significantly more likely to undergo inpatient surgery than outpatient surgery while white patients were significantly more likely to undergo outpatient surgery. Outpatients had a significantly higher mean body mass index (BMI) than inpatients. Smokers were at a significantly greater risk of undergoing inpatient surgery than outpatient surgery. Outpatients had significantly longer operative times, were more likely to receive general anesthesia, had a lower American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class, were more likely to be functionally independent, and were less likely to expire postoperatively. Patients who received surgery as an inpatient were significantly more likely to have comorbidities as compared to outpatients. The overall risk of surgical complications was significant between groups with 8.6% in the inpatient group and 2.0% in the outpatient group. The overall risk of medical complications was 16.9% in the inpatient group and 1.7% in the outpatient group. Similar to the surgical complications, inpatients were significantly more likely to sustain each of the individual medical complications except for stroke/CVA and venous thromboembolism. Conclusions Outpatient management is associated with decreased postoperative complications in select patients. Performing more operations in the outpatient setting in select patients may be beneficial for cost reduction and patient satisfaction.",Evaluation of a Modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills Tool for the Assessment of Pediatric Laceration Repair Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016083,Cureus,2019 04 26,"Introduction The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has developed milestones including procedural skills under the core competency of patient care. Progress in training is expected to be monitored by residency programs. To our knowledge, there exists no tool to evaluate pediatric resident laceration repair performance. Methods The Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills was adapted to evaluate resident laceration repair performance using two components: a global rating scale (GRS) and a checklist. Pediatric and family medicine residents at a tertiary care children's hospital were filmed performing a simulated laceration repair. Videos were evaluated by at least five physicians trained in laceration repair. Concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) were calculated for the GRS and checklist scores. Scores for each resident were compared across levels of training and procedural experience. Spearman's rank order correlations were calculated to compare the checklist and GRS. Results Thirty residents were filmed performing laceration repair procedures. The CCC showed fair concordance across reviewers for the checklist (0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.69) and the GRS (0.53, 95% CI: 0.36-0.67). There was no significant difference in scores by self-reported experience or training level. There was correlation between the median GRS and checklist scores (Spearman ρ = 0.730, p < .001). Conclusions A novel tool to evaluate resident laceration repair performance in a pediatric emergency department showed fair agreement across reviewers. The study tool is not precise enough for summative evaluation; however, it can be used to distinguish between trainees who have and have not attained competence in laceration repair for formative feedback.","Frequency, Awareness, and Symptoms of Chikungunya Among Patients in a Tertiary Care Hospital of Karachi: A Cross-Sectional Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016081,Cureus,2019 04 26,"Background  Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) is an infectious illness spread by the bite of mosquitoes and caused by an arbovirus known as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). This disease has become an epidemic in Karachi and various other cities of Pakistan, affecting a large population, especially those from poor, socioeconomically underdeveloped areas. It is proving to be a severe and alarming cause of debility due to its prolonged detrimental effects on the joints. A significant number of cases are reported daily in different hospitals of Karachi, with Civil Hospital being one of the major tertiary care hospitals. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency and symptoms of chikungunya as well as to assess the participants' awareness about the spread and preventive measures of this disease. Methods This is a cross-sectional study that was carried out in Civil Hospital Karachi by approaching patients in the out-patient department (OPD) and the emergency department with complaints of fever and joint pain. All the data was collected via a pre-coded questionnaire during May-June 2017 by taking prior informed verbal consent and were analyzed through Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 software. Results The age group most affected by this disease was the 21-30 years range, which represented almost a quarter of the cases (n=83, 32.17%). Majority of the respondents (n=214, 82.95%) had heard of the disease, mainly due to their own prior experience with it (n=100, 38.76%). Lethargy (n=219, 84.88%), difficulty in walking (n=213, 82.56%), and headache (n=209, 81.01%) were the major symptoms reported apart from fever (n=258, 100.00%) and arthralgia (n=258, 100.00%). Conclusion CHIKF is proving to be a great threat to people as it impairs their quality of life to a great extent. The recent outbreak of chikungunya has victimized a considerable population of Karachi. This study mainly assessed the severity of the disease and its symptoms as well as the lack of awareness among patients. Proper and effective preventive measures can further help to eradicate this disease on a large scale and prevent future epidemics.",Elastomeric Pain Pumps for Scoliosis Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016070,Cureus,2019 04 26,"Objective  Postoperative pain management following scoliosis surgery has traditionally relied on intravenous opioids. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of elastomeric pain pumps. Methods A retrospective chart review of 81 adolescent patients who underwent scoliosis surgery in a seven-year period was performed. Patients were divided into three groups as the practice changed: (1) patient-controlled analgesia group (12 patients) who used intravenous (IV) opioids with oral opioids; (2) elastomeric pain pump group (28 patients) with the added use of bupivacaine; and (3) multimodal pain pump group (41 patients) with the added use of gabapentin and methocarbamol. Endpoints were analyzed for length of stay in the hospital, infection rate, and gastrointestinal retention. Results The length of stay in the elastomeric pain pump group was 3.1 days shorter than in the patient-controlled analgesia group (P = 0.004). The length of stay in the multimodal group was 3.9 days shorter than in the patient-controlled analgesia group (P = 0.001). The incidence of prolonged postoperative bowel retention decreased significantly from 25% to 18% to 2% (P = 0.03). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of elastomeric pain pumps in conjunction with multimodal pain medication following scoliosis surgery. The use of elastomeric pain pumps was associated with clinically and statistically significant improvements in the postoperative course. The addition of methocarbamol and gabapentin was associated with a trend toward further improvements.",Relationship Between the Shift of the Retinal Artery Associated With Myopia and Ocular Response Analyzer Waveform Parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016069,Translational vision science & technology,2019 04 26,"We have recently reported that the retinal stretch due to myopia is closely related to the peripapillary retinal arteries angle (PRAA) (Yamashita et al., Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci 2013;54:5481-5488).

Stem cell transplantation is the only effective salvage therapy, for which only a limited number of patients are eligible due to age and comorbidity. Combination therapy of venetoclax and azacitidine (5-AZA) seems to be a promising approach in myeloid malignancies, but data from patients with HMA failure are lacking. Furthermore, a considerable concern of combination regimens in elderly AML and MDS patients is the toxicity on the remaining healthy hematopoiesis. Here, we report in vitro data showing the impact of venetoclax and 5-AZA, alone or in combination, in a larger cohort of MDS/sAML patients (n = 21), even after HMA failure (n = 13). We especially focused on the effects on healthy hematopoiesis and the impact on colony forming capacity as a parameter for long-term effects. To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time that venetoclax in combination with capped dose of 5-AZA targets cell malignancies, while sparing healthy hematopoiesis.",Disposable Patterned Electroceutical Dressing (PED-10) Is Safe for Treatment of Open Clinical Chronic Wounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016066,Advances in wound care,2019 04 27,"Objective: To evaluate if patterned electroceutical dressing (PED) is safe for human chronic wounds treatment as reported by wound care providers. Approach: This work reports a pilot feasibility study with the primary objective to determine physically observable effects of PED application on host tissue response from a safety evaluation point of view. For this pilot study, patients receiving a lower extremity amputation with at least one open wound on the part to be amputated were enrolled. Patients were identified through the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) based on inclusion and exclusion criteria through prescreening through the Comprehensive Wound Center's (CWC) Limb Preservation Program and wound physicians and/or providers at OSUWMC. Wounds were treated with the PED before amputation surgery. Results: The intent of the study was to identify if PED was safe for clinical application based on visual observations of adverse or lack of adverse events on skin and wound tissue. The pilot testing performed on a small cohort (N = 8) of patients showed that with engineered voltage regulation of current flow to the open wound, the PED can be used with little to no visually observable adverse effects on chronic human skin wounds. Innovation: The PED was developed as a second-generation tunable electroceutical wound care dressing, which could potentially be used to treat wounds with deeper infections compared with current state of the art that treats wounds with treatment zone limited to the surface near topical application. Conclusion: Technology advances in design and fabrication of electroceutical dressings were leveraged to develop a tunable laboratory prototype that could be used as a disposable low-cost electroceutical wound care dressing on chronic wounds. Design revisions of PED-1 (1 kΩ ballast resistor) circumvented previously observed adverse effects on the skin in the vicinity of an open wound. PED-10 (including a 10 kΩ ballast resistor) was well tolerated in the small cohort of patients (N = 8) on whom it was tested, and the observations reported here warrant a larger study to determine the clinical impact on human wound healing and infection control."

The present in vivo study aimed to compare thoracic (TA) and abdominal (AA) aortic stiffness in the SHRLN (treated 5 weeks with L-NAME), SHR, and normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY). Dynamic properties of TA and AA were measured in the same rats, using echotracking recording of aortic diameter coupled with blood pressure (BP). Measurements were performed first at operating BP and then after BP reduction in hypertensive rats, thus in isobaric conditions. Histological staining and immunohistochemistry were used for structural analysis at both sites. At operating pressure, BP and pulse pressure (PP) were higher in SHRLN compared with SHR. Stiffness index was also increased and distensibility decreased in both TA and AA in SHRLN. At WKY-matched blood pressure, isobaric AA parameters remained specifically altered in SHRLN, whereas TA recovered to values identical to WKYs. Collagen, fibronectin, α5-selectin, and FAK were increased in SHRLN compared with SHR or WKY. Nevertheless, only the strong accumulations of fibronectin and collagen at the AA site in SHRLN were associated with intrinsic stiffening. In conclusion, we confirm that NO restriction associated with hypertension induces a severe pathological phenotype and shows that L-NAME induced stiffening is more pronounced in AA than in TA as a result of greater fibrosis.",Evaluation of Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cell Cytotoxicity of Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator Using Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016039,Journal of ophthalmology,2019 04 26,"The evaluation of drug-induced cytotoxicity is of great importance for the clinical application of pharmaceutical products, and human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have received considerable scrutiny as a cell source for in vitro cytotoxicity testing.

There are many therapies for delaying the progression of vision loss but no curative strategies currently. Stimulating intrinsic neuronal regeneration is a potential approach to therapy in retinal degenerative diseases. In contrast to stem cells, as embryonic/pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal progenitor cell or mesenchymal stem cells, Müller glia provided an endogenous cellular source for regenerative therapy in the retina. Müller glia are a major component of the retina and considerable evidence suggested these cells can be induced to produce the lost neurons in several species. Understanding the specific characteristic of Müller glia to generate lost neurons will inspire an attractive and alternative therapeutic strategy for treating visual impairment with regenerative research. This review briefly provides the different signal transduction mechanisms which are underlying Müller cell-mediated neuroprotection and neuron regeneration and discusses recent advances about regeneration from Müller glia-derived progenitors.",Long-Term Natural Course of Pathologic Myopia in Chinese Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016036,Journal of ophthalmology,2019 04 26,To investigate the natural progression in Chinese patients with pathological myopia (PM) and its associated factors.,Rabies-based vaccine induces potent immune responses against Nipah virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016033,NPJ vaccines,2019 05 15,"Nipah Virus (NiV) is a re-emerging zoonotic pathogen in the genus Henipavirus of the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses. NiV is endemic to Bangladesh and Malaysia and is highly fatal to both livestock and humans (human case fatality rate = 74.5%). Currently, there is no approved vaccine against NiV on the market. The goal of this study was to use a recombinant RABV vector expressing NiV glycoprotein (NiV G) to develop a bivalent candidate vaccine against NiV disease and rabies virus (RABV) disease, which is also a significant health burden in the regions where NiV is endemic. The rabies vector is a well-established vaccine strain that lacks neurovirulence and can stably expresses foreign antigens that are immunogenic in various animal models. Mice inoculated intranasally with the live recombinant RABV/NiV vaccine (NIPARAB) showed no signs of disease. To test the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate, groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single dose of live vaccine particles or two doses of chemically inactivated viral particles. Both vaccination groups showed NiV G-specific seroconversion, and the inactivated (INAC) vaccine group yielded higher titers of NiV G-specific antibodies. Furthermore, cross-reactivity of NiV G-specific immune sera against Hendra virus (HeV), was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) and indirect ELISA against soluble recombinant HeV glycoprotein (HeV G). Both live and killed vaccines induced neutralizing antibodies. These results indicate that NIPARAB may be used as a killed virus vaccine to protect humans against NiV and RABV, and possibly as a preventative measure against HeV as well.",miR-4521-FAM129A axial regulation on ccRCC progression through TIMP-1/MMP2/MMP9 and MDM2/p53/Bcl2/Bax pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016032,Cell death discovery,2019 04 26,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most aggressive RCC subtype with high metastasis, chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance, and poor prognosis. This study attempted to establish the deregulations of miR-4521 and FAM129A together with their correlation to and mechanism of regulation of ccRCC development and progression. FAM129A acted as tumor promotor and miR-4521 acted as a suppressor in ccRCC. As measured in surgical tumorous tissues from ccRCC patients, FAM129A overexpression and miR-4521 deficiency together contributed to ccRCC progression by promoting advances in patients' TNM stage and Fuhrman grade. Both the FAM129A knockdown and miR-4521 overexpression could reduce the in vitro migration and invasion abilities of renal cancer cells 786-O and ACHN, through the TIMP-1/MMP2/MMP9 pathway and could decrease their proliferation by promoting their apoptosis through the MDM2/p53/Bcl2/Bax pathway. By directly targeting the 3'-UTR domain of FAM129A, miR-4521 was negatively correlated with FAM129A/FAM129A levels in ccRCC progression and renal cancer cell malignancies. This work establishes the miR-4521-FAM129A axial regulation mechanism in ccRCC. Micro-4521 deficiency leads to FAM129A/FAM129A upregulation, which synergistically enhances the migration and invasion of renal cancer cells due to the induced decrease of TIMP-1 and increases of MMP2 and MMP9, and increases their growth through escaping apoptosis by suppressing p53 by way of upregulation of induced MDM2. The current work provides new clues to assist fundamental research into the diagnosis and treatment of ccRCC.",Proteomic analysis of human mesenchymal stromal cell secretomes: a systematic comparison of the angiogenic potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016031,NPJ Regenerative medicine,2019 04 26,"Human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) secretomes have shown to influence the microenvironment upon injury, promoting cytoprotection, angiogenesis, and tissue repair. The angiogenic potential is of particular interest for the treatment of ischemic diseases. Interestingly, hMSC secretomes isolated from different tissue sources have shown dissimilarities with respect to their angiogenic profile. This study compares angiogenesis of hMSC secretomes from adipose tissue (hADSCs), bone marrow (hBMSCs), and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (hWJSCs). hMSC secretomes were obtained under xenofree conditions and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). Biological processes related to angiogenesis were found to be enriched in the proteomic profile of hMSC secretomes. hWJSC secretomes revealed a more complete angiogenic network with higher concentrations of angiogenesis related proteins, followed by hBMSC secretomes. hADSC secretomes lacked central angiogenic proteins and expressed most detected proteins to a significantly lower level. In vivo all secretomes induced vascularization of subcutaneously implanted Matrigel plugs in mice. Differences in secretome composition were functionally analyzed with monocyte and endothelial cell (EC) in vitro co-culture experiments using vi-SNE based multidimensional flow cytometry data analysis. Functional responses between hBMSC and hWJSC secretomes were comparable, with significantly higher migration of CD14++ CD16- monocytes and enhanced macrophage differentiation compared with hADSC secretomes. Both secretomes also induced a more profound pro-angiogenic phenotype of ECs. These results suggest hWJSCs secretome as the most potent hMSC source for inflammation-mediated angiogenesis induction, while the potency of hADSC secretomes was lowest. This systematic analysis may have implication on the selection of hMSCs for future clinical studies.",Treat and extend regimen with aflibercept for chronic central retinal vein occlusions: 2 year results of the NEWTON study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016030,International journal of retina and vitreous,2019 04 26,"To determine whether aflibercept (Eylea; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY) could continue to extend the macular edema free interval in patients on a treat and extend (TAE) with non-ischemic central retinal vein occlusions (CRVOs) previously treated with ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) or bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) in the second year.",Prevalence of hypertension and blood pressure profile amongst urban-dwelling adults in Nigeria: a comparative analysis based on recent guideline recommendations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016027,Clinical hypertension,2019 04 26,Hypertension is the major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and prevalence rates are critical to understanding the burden and envisaging health service requirements and resource allocation.

A long-term monitored semi-natural forest site subject to intense combined storm and bark beetle damage beginning in 2005 provided an opportunity to investigate the postdisturbance development of the vegetation community. Previous studies suggest that a shift from Piceaabies to Fagus sylvatica domination was possible.We analyzed pre- and postdisturbance vegetation data to investigate to what extent vascular plant species abundances, diversity, traits, and community composition have changed. We were particularly interested in differences between remaining apparently unaffected areas (potential refugia) and disturbed areas, and in signs of consistent change over time in community composition in response to disturbance that could indicate an impending regime shift.We found that the vegetation community present in the refuge areas has remained substantially intact through the period of disturbance. Nonrefuge areas diverged from the refuges in community composition and showed increased taxonomic and functional diversity. Despite this, and an increase in deciduous tree species (particularly F. sylvatica), P. abies has shown strong postdisturbance regeneration. The refuges may be important in the apparent ongoing recovery of the disturbed areas to a P. abies-dominated state similar to that found predisturbance. This fast recovery is interpreted as evidence of a system resilient to a potential shift to a deciduous-dominated state. Synthesis: Our results show that even powerful combined disturbances in a system with multiple stable states can be insufficient to initiate a regime shift. Resilience of the P. abies-dominated forest community is increased by the survival of refuge areas functioning as a form of ecological memory of the previous ecosystem state. The results also demonstrate the value of data generated by long-term monitoring programs.",Increased snowfall weakens complementarity of summer water use by different plant functional groups.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016003,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Winter snowfall is an important water source for plants during summer in semiarid regions. Snow, rain, soil water, and plant water were sampled for hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes analyses under control and increased snowfall conditions in the temperate steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. Our study showed that the snowfall contribution to plant water uptake continued throughout the growing season and was detectable even in the late growing season. Snowfall versus rainfall accounted for 30% and 70%, respectively, of the water source for plants, on the basis of hydrogen stable isotope signature (δD) analysis, and accounted for 12% and 88%, respectively, on the basis of oxygen stable isotope signature (δ18O) analysis. Water use partitioning between topsoil and subsoil was found among species with different rooting depths. Increased snowfall weakened complementarity of plant water use during summer.

The mitochondrial genome displays clear examples of these reductions, with the ancestral alpha-proteobacterial genome size and gene number having been reduced by orders of magnitude in most descendent modern mitochondrial genomes. Here, we examine patterns of mitochondrial evolution specifically looking at intron size, number, and position across 58 species from 21 genera of lichenized Ascomycete fungi, representing a broad range of fungal diversity and niches. Our results show that the cox1gene always contained the highest number of introns out of all the mitochondrial protein-coding genes, that high intron sequence similarity (>90%) can be maintained between different genera, and that lichens have undergone at least two instances of complete, genome-wide intron loss consistent with evidence for genome streamlining via loss of parasitic, noncoding DNA, in Phlyctis boliviensisand Graphis lineola. Notably, however, lichenized fungi have not only undergone intron loss but in some instances have expanded considerably in size due to intron proliferation (e.g., Alectoria fallacina and Parmotrema neotropicum), even between closely related sister species (e.g., Cladonia). These results shed light on the highly dynamic mitochondrial evolution that is occurring in lichens and suggest that these obligate symbiotic organisms are in some cases undergoing recent, broad-scale genome streamlining via loss of protein-coding genes as well as noncoding, parasitic DNA elements.",Decline in abundance and apparent survival rates of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016001,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Estimates of abundance and survivorship provide quantifiable measures to monitor populations and to define and understand their conservation status. This study investigated changes in abundance and survival rates of fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence in the context of anthropogenic pressures and changing environmental conditions. A long-term data set, consisting of 35 years of photo-identification surveys and comprising more than 5,000 identifications of 507 individuals, formed the basis of this mark-recapture study. Based on model selection using corrected Akaike Information Criterion, the most parsimonious Cormack-Jolly-Seber model included a linear temporal trend in noncalf apparent survival rates with a sharp decline in the last 5 years of the study and a median survival rate of 0.946 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.910-0.967). To account for capture heterogeneity due to divergent patterns of site fidelity, agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to categorize individuals based on their annual and survey site fidelity indices. However, the negative trend in survivorship remained and was corroborated by a significant decline in the estimated super-population size from 335 (95% CI 321-348) individuals in 2004-2010 to 291 (95% CI 270-312) individuals in 2010-2016. Concurrently, a negative trend was estimated in recruitment to the population, supported by a sharp decrease in the number of observed calves. Ship strikes and changes in prey availability are potential drivers of the observed decline in fin whale abundance. The combination of clustering methods with mark-recapture represents a flexible way to investigate the effects of site fidelity on demographic variables and is broadly applicable to other individual-based studies.","Spatial variation in anuran richness, diversity, and abundance across montane wetland habitat in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31016000,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"The spatial distribution of species has long sparked interest among ecologists and biogeographers, increasingly so in studies of species responses to climate change.

We studied elevational trends and species-area relationships among anurans in wetland habitats within Volcanoes National Park (VNP) in Rwanda, part of the biodiverse Albertine Rift region. In VNP, wetlands are key sites for anuran reproduction, and anurans are likely threatened by wetland desiccation which has occurred for the last few decades. Between 2012 and 2017, we sampled anuran communities in ten VNP wetlands located along an elevational gradient of c. 600 m (from 2,546 to 3,188 m a.s.l.) and found at least eight species, including at least two Albertine Rift Endemics. We show that species richness, diversity, and abundance likely decline with a decrease in wetland size and with an increase in elevation, though additional sampling (e.g., at night) might be needed to derive definite conclusions. Larger wetlands at lower elevations contained most species and individuals, which indicates the potential threat of wetland size reduction (through desiccation) for anuran conservation. However, we also found that wetlands differed in species composition and that some species (e.g., Sclerophrys kisoloensis) were likely restricted in distribution to only a few of the smaller wetlands-suggesting that the conservation of each individual wetland should be prioritized, regardless of size. We propose that all wetlands in VNP require additional conservation measures, which should be based on knowledge gathered through long-term monitoring of anuran communities and research on drivers of wetland decline. Only such extended research will allow us to understand the response of anurans in VNP to threats such as climate change and wetland desiccation.",Estimating the energy expenditure of free-ranging polar bears using tri-axial accelerometers: A validation with doubly labeled water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015999,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Measures of energy expenditure can be used to inform animal conservation and management, but methods for measuring the energy expenditure of free-ranging animals have a variety of limitations. Advancements in biologging technologies have enabled the use of dynamic body acceleration derived from accelerometers as a proxy for energy expenditure. Although dynamic body acceleration has been shown to strongly correlate with oxygen consumption in captive animals, it has been validated in only a few studies on free-ranging animals. Here, we use relationships between oxygen consumption and overall dynamic body acceleration in resting and walking polar bears Ursus maritimus and published values for the costs of swimming in polar bears to estimate the total energy expenditure of 6 free-ranging polar bears that were primarily using the sea ice of the Beaufort Sea. Energetic models based on accelerometry were compared to models of energy expenditure on the same individuals derived from doubly labeled water methods. Accelerometer-based estimates of energy expenditure on average predicted total energy expenditure to be 30% less than estimates derived from doubly labeled water. Nevertheless, accelerometer-based measures of energy expenditure strongly correlated (r2 = 0.70) with measures derived from doubly labeled water. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations in dynamic body acceleration as a measure of total energy expenditure while also further supporting its use as a proxy for instantaneous, detailed energy expenditure in free-ranging animals.",Do riparian forest strips in modified forest landscapes aid in conserving bat diversity?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015998,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Agricultural practices lead to losses of natural resources and biodiversity. Maintaining forests alongside streams (riparian forest strips) has been used as a mechanism to minimize the impact of clearing for agriculture on biodiversity. To test the contribution of riparian forest strips to conserve biodiversity in production landscapes, we selected bats as a biodiversity model system and examined two dimensions of diversity: taxonomic and functional. We compared bat diversity and composition in forest, with and without stream habitat, and in narrow forest riparian strips surrounded by areas cleared for agriculture. We tested the hypothesis that riparian forest strips provide potential conservation value by providing habitat and serving as movement corridors for forest bat species. Riparian forest strips maintained 75% of the bat species registered in forested habitats. We found assemblage in sites with riparian forest strips were dominated by a few species with high abundance and included several species with low abundance. Bat species assemblage was more similar between sites with streams than between those sites to forests without stream habitat. These results highlight the importance of stream habitat in predicting presence of bat species. We registered similar number of guilds between forest sites and riparian forest strips sites. Relative to matrix habitats, stream and edge habitats in riparian forest strips sites were functionally more diverse, supporting our hypothesis about the potential conservation value of riparian forest strips. Results from this study suggest that maintaining riparian forest strips within cleared areas for agricultural areas helps conserve the taxonomic and functional diversity of bats. Also, it provides basic data to evaluate the efficacy of maintaining these landscape features for mitigating impacts of agricultural development on biodiversity. However, we caution that riparian forest strips alone are not sufficient for biodiversity maintenance; their value depends on maintenance of larger forest areas in their vicinity.","Pteropus lylei primarily forages in residential areas in Kandal, Cambodia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015997,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Bats are the second most species-rich Mammalian order and provide a wide range of ecologically important and economically significant ecosystem services. Nipah virus is a zoonotic emerging infectious disease for which pteropodid bats have been identified as a natural reservoir. In Cambodia, Nipah virus circulation has been reported in Pteropus lylei, but little is known about the spatial distribution of the species and the associated implications for conservation and public health.We deployed Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 14 P. lylei to study their movements and foraging behavior in Cambodia in 2016. All of the flying foxes were captured from the same roost, and GPS locations were collected for 1 month. The habitats used by each bat were characterized through ground-truthing, and a spatial distribution model was developed of foraging sites.A total of 13,643 valid locations were collected during the study. Our study bats flew approximately 20 km from the roost each night to forage. The maximum distance traveled per night ranged from 6.88-105 km and averaged 28.3 km. Six of the 14 bats visited another roost for at least one night during the study, including one roost located 105 km away.Most foraging locations were in residential areas (53.7%) followed by plantations (26.6%). Our spatial distribution model confirmed that residential areas were the preferred foraging habitat for P. lylei, although our results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of individuals studied. Synthesis and applications: Our findings suggest that the use of residential and agricultural habitats by P. lylei may create opportunities for bats to interact with humans and livestock. They also suggest the importance of anthropogenic habitats for conservation of this vulnerable and ecologically important group in Cambodia. Our mapping of the probability of occurrence of foraging sites will help identification of areas where public awareness should be promoted regarding the ecosystem services provided by flying foxes and potential for disease transmission through indirect contact.",Response diversity in Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages facing climate change: Insights from a multispecific thermotolerance experiment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015996,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Climate change threatens coastal benthic communities on a global scale. However, the potential effects of ongoing warming on mesophotic temperate reefs at the community level remain poorly understood. Investigating how different members of these communities will respond to the future expected environmental conditions is, therefore, key to anticipating their future trajectories and developing specific management and conservation strategies. Here, we examined the responses of some of the main components of the highly diverse Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages to thermal stress. We performed thermotolerance experiments with different temperature treatments (from 26 to 29°C) with 10 species from different phyla (three anthozoans, six sponges and one ascidian) and different structural roles. Overall, we observed species-specific contrasting responses to warming regardless of phyla or growth form. Moreover, the responses ranged from highly resistant species to sensitive species and were mostly in agreement with previous field observations from mass mortality events (MMEs) linked to Mediterranean marine heat waves. Our results unravel the diversity of responses to warming in coralligenous outcrops and suggest the presence of potential winners and losers in the face of climate change. Finally, this study highlights the importance of accounting for species-specific vulnerabilities and response diversity when forecasting the future trajectories of temperate benthic communities in a warming ocean."

We measured these traits on 678 individuals from 22 species captured in 43 ponds in the Atlantic Forest. We used single- and multitrait analyses to decompose trait variability. To explore the action of external and internal filtering on community assembly, we used a variance decomposition approach that compares phenotypic variability at the individual, population, community and regional levels.On average, 33% of trait variability was due to within-species variation. This decomposition varied widely among traits. We found only a reduced effect of external filtering (low variation in the height of the ventral fin within ponds in comparison to the total variation), whereas the internal filtering was stronger than expected. Traits related to the use of different microhabitats through the water column were generally less variable than traits related to swimming ability to escape of predators, with tail traits being highly variable within species.Our study highlights the importance of incorporating both intraspecific and interspecific, trait differences and of focusing on a diversity of traits related to both stabilizing niche and fitness differences in order to better understand how trait variation relates to species coexistence.",Direct and indirect effects of land-use intensification on ant communities in temperate grasslands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015984,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Land-use intensification is a major driver of local species extinction and homogenization. Temperate grasslands, managed at low intensities over centuries harbored a high species diversity, which is increasingly threatened by the management intensification over the last decades. This includes key taxa like ants. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to a decrease in ant abundance and species richness as well as changes in functional community composition are not well understood. We sampled ants on 110 grassland plots in three regions in Germany. The sampled grasslands are used as meadows or pastures, being mown, grazed or fertilized at different intensities. We analyzed the effect of the different aspects of land use on ant species richness, functional trait spaces, and community composition by using a multimodel inference approach and structural equation models. Overall, we found 31 ant species belonging to 8 genera, mostly open habitat specialists. Ant species richness, functional trait space of communities, and abundance of nests decreased with increasing land-use intensity. The land-use practice most harmful to ants was mowing, followed by heavy grazing by cattle. Fertilization did not strongly affect ant species richness. Grazing by sheep increased the ant species richness. The effect of mowing differed between species and was strongly negative for Formica species while Myrmica and common Lasius species were less affected. Rare species occurred mainly in plots managed at low intensity. Our results show that mowing less often or later in the season would retain a higher ant species richness-similarly to most other grassland taxa. The transformation from (sheep) pastures to intensively managed meadows and especially mowing directly affects ants via the destruction of nests and indirectly via loss of grassland heterogeneity (reduced plant species richness) and increased soil moisture by shading of fast-growing plant species.","Genomic, ecological, and morphological approaches to investigating species limits: A case study in modern taxonomy from Tropical Eastern Pacific surgeonfishes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015983,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"A wide variety of species are distinguished by slight color variations. However, molecular analyses have repeatedly demonstrated that coloration does not always correspond to distinct evolutionary histories between closely related groups, suggesting that this trait is labile and can be misleading for species identification. In the present study, we analyze the evolutionary history of sister species of Prionurus surgeonfishes in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), which are distinguished by the presence or absence of dark spots on their body. We examined the species limits in this system using comparative specimen-based approaches, a mitochondrial gene (COI), more than 800 nuclear loci (Ultraconserved Elements), and abiotic niche comparisons. The results indicate there is a complete overlap of meristic counts and morphometric measurements between the two species. Further, we detected multiple individuals with intermediate spotting patterns suggesting that coloration is not diagnostic. Mitochondrial data recovered a single main haplotype shared between the species and all locations resulting in a complete lack of structure (ΦST = 0). Genomic analyses also suggest low levels of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.013), and no alternatively fixed SNPs were detected between the two phenotypes. Furthermore, niche comparisons could not reject niche equivalency or similarity between the species. These results suggest that these two phenotypes are conspecific and widely distributed in the TEP. Here, we recognize Prionurus punctatus Gill 1862 as a junior subjective synonym of P. laticlavius (Valenciennes 1846). The underlying causes of phenotypic variation in this species are unknown. However, this system gives insight into general evolutionary dynamics within the TEP.",Numbers and distribution of the Great Cormorant in Iceland: Limitation at the regional and metapopulation level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015982,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"We studied a metapopulation of great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) in Iceland, using complete aerial censuses of nests in 25 years during 1975-2015. Age composition was estimated in 1998-2014 by ground surveys in September and February. Brood size was estimated from aerial photographs in 2007-2015.Weather, food, breeding habitat, and density were considered as explanatory variables when examining numerical and distributional changes in the cormorant metapopulation.In 1975-1990 total nest numbers changed little, very low numbers about 1992 were followed by an annual increase of 3.5% in 1994-2015. Total nest numbers were positively correlated with estimates of spawning stocks of cod and saithe and inversely related to the subpolar gyre index (SPG-I).During the increase in 1994-2015, average colony size at first increased and then declined. Habitat use also changed: the proportion of nests on small rocky islets (skerries) at first declined, from 69% to 44% in 1995-2003 and then increased again to about 58% in 2012-2014. Habitat changes were probably a response to changed patterns of human disturbance.Breeding density, as nests per km2 sea <20 m deep, was rather uniform among five defined regions in 1975-1996. Thereafter, densities became much higher in two sheltered regions with kelp forests and in one mostly exposed region. A second exposed region remained low and in the third nest numbers declined markedly. Thus, carrying capacity was higher in sheltered regions where cormorant breeding had historically been depressed by human disturbance.Brood size varied little among regions but declined with the years from about 2.5 to 1.8.The proportion of juveniles in September (fecundity) declined in 1998-2015 from over 0.4 to 0.3 and was inversely correlated with year and nest numbers, if outlier years were excluded, suggesting resource limitation. Survival of juvenile cormorants in September-February was estimated at 0.471 ± 0.066 SE. Commercial fish stocks and climate indices were not correlated with the proportion of juveniles.Annual survival of adults (breeding and nonbreeding) was estimated from nest counts and age composition 1999-2014, as 0.850 ± 0.026 SE and showed no trend in 1998-2014.We conclude that the metapopulation of cormorants in Iceland was resource-limited at two levels: fecundity at the regional and winter survival at the total level.",Gene markers for exon capture and phylogenomics in ray-finned fishes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015981,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Gene capture coupled with the next-generation sequencing has become one of the preferred methods of subsampling genomes for phylogenomic studies. Many exon markers have been developed in plants, sharks, frogs, reptiles, fishes, and others, but no universal exon markers have been tested in ray-finned fishes. Here, we identified a suite of ""single-copy"" protein-coding sequence (CDS) markers through comparing eight fish genomes, and tested them empirically in 83 species (33 families and nine orders or higher clades: Acipenseriformes, Lepisosteiformes, Elopomorpha, Osteoglossomorpha, Clupeiformes, Cypriniformes, Gobiaria, Carangaria, and Eupercaria; sensu Betancur et al. 2013). Sorting the markers according to their completeness and phylogenetic decisiveness in taxa tested resulted in a selection of 4,434 markers, which were proven to be useful in reconstructing phylogenies of the ray-finned fishes at different taxonomic levels. We also proposed a strategy of refining baits (probes) design a posteriori based on empirical data. The markers that we have developed may greatly enrich the batteries of exon markers for phylogenomic study in ray-finned fishes.",Spatiotemporal variability in the structure of seagrass meadows and associated macrofaunal assemblages in southwest England (UK): Using citizen science to benchmark ecological pattern.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015980,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Seagrass meadows underpin a variety of ecosystem services and are recognized as globally important habitats and a conservation priority. However, seagrass populations are currently impacted by a range of biotic and abiotic stressors, and many are in decline globally. As such, improved understanding of seagrass populations and their associated faunal assemblages is needed to better detect and predict changes in the structure and functioning of these key habitats. Here, we analyzed a large dataset-collected by recreational scuba divers volunteering on a citizen science project-to examine spatiotemporal patterns in ecological structure and to provide a robust and reliable baseline against which to detect future change. Seagrass (Zostera marina) shoot density and the abundance of associated faunal groups were quantified across 2 years at 19 sites nested within three locations in southwest UK, by collecting in situ quadrat samples (2,518 in total) during 328 dives. Seagrass shoot density and meadow fragmentation was comparable across locations but was highly variable among sites. Faunal abundance and assemblage structure varied between areas with or without seagrass shoots; this pattern was largely consistent between locations and years. Overall, increased seagrass density was related to increased faunal abundance and explained shifts in faunal assemblage structure, although individual faunal groups were affected differently. More broadly, our study shows that well-funded and orchestrated citizen science projects can, to some extent, gather fundamental information needed to benchmark ecological structure in poorly studied nearshore marine habitats.",Availability of food resources and habitat structure shape the individual-resource network of a Neotropical marsupial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015979,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Spatial and temporal variation in networks has been reported in different studies. However, the many effects of habitat structure and food resource availability variation on network structures have remained poorly investigated, especially in individual-based networks. This approach can shed light on individual specialization of resource use and how habitat variations shape trophic interactions.To test hypotheses related to habitat variability on trophic interactions, we investigated seasonal and spatial variation in network structure of four populations of the marsupial Gracilinanus agilis in the highly seasonal tropical savannas of the Brazilian Cerrado.We evaluated such variation with network nestedness and modularity considering both cool-dry and warm-wet seasons, and related such variations with food resource availability and habitat structure (considered in the present study as environmental variation) in four sites of savanna woodland forest.Network analyses showed that modularity (but not nestedness) was consistently lower during the cool-dry season in all G. agilis populations. Our results indicated that nestedness is related to habitat structure, showing that this metric increases in sites with thick and spaced trees. On the other hand, modularity was positively related to diversity of arthropods and abundance of fruits.We propose that the relationship between nestedness and habitat structure is an outcome of individual variation in the vertical space and food resource use by G. agilis in sites with thick and spaced trees. Moreover, individual specialization in resource-rich and population-dense periods possibly increased the network modularity of G. agilis. Therefore, our study reveals that environment variability considering spatial and temporal components is important for shaping network structure of populations.",A practical tool for assessing ecosystem services enhancement and degradation associated with invasive alien species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015977,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Current approaches for assessing the effects of invasive alien species (IAS) are biased toward the negative effects of these species, resulting in an incomplete picture of their real effects. This can result in an inefficient IAS management. We address this issue by describing the INvasive Species Effects Assessment Tool (INSEAT) that enables expert elicitation for rapidly assessing the ecological consequences of IAS using the ecosystem services (ES) framework. INSEAT scores the ecosystem service ""gains and losses"" using a scale that accounted for the magnitude and the reversibility of its effects. We tested INSEAT on 18 IAS in Great Britain. Here, we highlighted four case studies: Harmonia axyridis (Harlequin ladybird), Astacus leptodactylus (Turkish crayfish), Pacifastacus leniusculus (Signal crayfish) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam). The results demonstrated that a collation of different experts' opinions using INSEAT could yield valuable information on the invasive aliens' ecological and social effects. The users can identify certain IAS as ES providers and the trade-offs between the ES provision and loss associated with them. This practical tool can be useful for evidence-based policy and management decisions that consider the potential role of invasive species in delivering human well-being.",Area and distance from mainland affect in different ways richness and phylogenetic diversity of snakes in Atlantic Forest coastal islands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015976,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"The Theory of Island Biogeography posits that ecological and evolutionary processes regulate species richness of isolated areas.

In particular, we assessed the use of host plant species with respect to host cover in the field and host parts used by R. differens, also recording their sex, developmental stages, and colour morph. Ruspolia differens were found on 19 grass and two sedge species and they were observed predominantly (99% of 20,915 observations) on seven grasses (namely, Panicum maximum, Brachiaria ruziziensis, Chloris gayana, Hyparrhenia rufa, Cynodon dactylon, Sporobolus pyramidalis, and Pennisetum purpureum). Ruspolia differens was most frequently observed on the most common grass of each study site but P. maximum, and S. pyramidalis were used more frequently than expected from their cover in the field. Furthermore, R. differens were observed predominantly on inflorescences (97% of feeding observations) and much less frequently on the leaves (3.0%), stems (0.1%), and inflorescence stalks (0.1%) of grasses and sedges. Host use was not independent of sex, developmental stage, or colour morph. Panicum maximum was the preferred host of the youngest nymphs of R. differens. Overall, our findings indicate that a continuous supply of diverse grass resources with inflorescences is necessary for the management and conservation of wild populations of R. differens."

Yet, few studies have considered the effects of pertinent seasonal climate variability on phenology and fitness. Hibernators may be particularly susceptible to changes in seasonal climate since they have a relatively short active season in which to reproduce and gain enough mass to survive the following winter. To understand whether and how seasonal climate variability may be affecting hibernator fitness, we estimated survival from historical (1964-1968) and contemporary (2014-2017) mark-recapture data collected from the same population of Uinta ground squirrels (UGS, Urocitellus armatus), a hibernator endemic to the western United States. Despite a locally warming climate, the phenology of UGS did not change over time, yet season-specific climate variables were important in regulating survival rates. Specifically, older age classes experienced lower survival when winters or the following springs were warm, while juveniles benefited from warmer winter temperatures. Although metabolic costs decrease with decreasing temperature in the hibernacula, arousal costs increase with decreasing temperature. Our results suggest that this trade-off is experienced differently by immature and mature individuals. We also observed an increase in population density during that time period, suggesting resources are less limited today than they used to be. Cheatgrass is now dominating the study site and may provide a better food source to UGS than native plants did historically.",Variable effects on growth and defense traits for plant ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity along elevation gradients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015963,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Along ecological gradients, phenotypic differentiation can arise through natural selection on trait diversity and magnitude, and environment-driven plastic changes. The magnitude of ecotypic differentiation versus phenotypic plasticity can vary depending on the traits under study. Using reciprocal transplant-common gardens along steep elevation gradients, we evaluated patterns of ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity of several growth and defense-related traits for two coexisting but unrelated plant species, Cardamine pratensis and Plantago major. For both species, we observed ecotypic differentiation accompanied by plasticity in growth-related traits. Plants grew faster and produced more biomass when placed at low elevation. In contrast, we observed fixed ecotypic differentiation for defense and resistance traits. Generally, low-elevation ecotypes produced higher chemical defenses regardless of the growing elevation. Yet, some plasticity was observed for specific compounds, such as indole glucosinolates. The results of this study may suggest that ecotypic differentiation in defense traits is maintained by costs of chemical defense production, while plasticity in growth traits is regulated by temperature-driven growth response maximization.",High throughput measure of diversity in cytoplasmic and nuclear traits for unravelling geographic distribution of rosemary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015962,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"In the present work, variability of both cytoplasmic and nuclear microsatellite traits was investigated with the aim of characterizing a set of rosemary germplasm resources (Salvia rosmarinus). Most of the materials were collected in Italy and France. High-resolution melting curves were compared each other computing their Euclidean distances and estimating the differences within their principal component as a measure of genetic diversity. Mantel correlation results combined to linear discriminant analysis allowed examined populations to be divided in four principal groups corresponding to four geographic areas, with few interesting and discussed exceptions. As rosemary propagates by seeds coming from insect mediated pollination, steady wild populations can be expected to be in panmictic equilibrium. Gained results confirmed and extended precedent characterization of rosemary genotypes and are compatible with the distribution of other Mediterranean species, as well as with the presence of a glacial refugium in the north-east area of Sardinia previously described. As the officinal use of this aromatic shrub is spreading, characterization and conservation of wild Mediterranean germplasm is gaining strategic importance. A core collection of 100 genotypes was pointed out as suitable for a cheaper biodiversity ex situ preservation as well as for subsequent metabolic and linkage disequilibrium analyses.",Diet and macronutrient niche of Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) in two regions of Nepal during summer and autumn.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015961,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Relatively little is known about the nutritional ecology of omnivorous Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) in Nepal. We characterized the diet of black bears in two seasons (June-July, ""summer""; and October-November ""autumn"") and two study areas (Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve [DHR]; and Kailash Sacred Landscape [KSL]). We then conducted nutritional analysis of species consumed by black bears in each study area, in combination with nutritional estimates from the literature, to estimate the proportions of macronutrients (i.e., protein [P], lipid [L], and carbohydrate [C]) in the seasonal bear foods and diets, as well as their macronutrient niche breadth. We found that bamboo (Arundinaria spp.) had the highest relative frequency in both study areas and seasons. Ants and termites were found in DHR diets, but not KSL diets. One anthropogenic crop was found in DHR summer diets (Zea mays) and two were found in KSL summer diets (Z. mays; and Kodo millet [Paspalum scrobiculatum]). Other than insects, no animal prey was found in either diet. The proportions of macronutrients in diets (i.e., realized macronutrient niches) were relatively high in carbohydrate for both study areas and seasons: DHRsummer 24.1P:8.7L:67.2C; KSLsummer 16.7P:8.2L:75.1C; DHRautumn 21.1P:10.5L:68.4C; KSHautumn 19.0P:11.0L:70.0C. Macronutrient niche breadth was 3.1 × greater in the DHR than KSL during summer, and 4.0 × greater in the autumn, primarily due to the higher proportion of lipid in ants and termites relative to plant foods. Within-study area differences in niche breadth were greater during summer than autumn; in the KSH the macronutrient breadth was 1.4 × greater in summer, while in the DHR it was 1.1 × greater in summer. Similarity in dietary macronutrient proportions despite differences in foods consumed and niche breadth are suggestive of foraging to reach a preferred macronutrient balance.",Changes in ecosystem services and an analysis of driving factors for China's Natural Forest Conservation Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015960,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"China's Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) is aimed at improving the fragile and unstable ecological environment and has become one of the largest ecological restoration programs in the world because of its enormous investment and effects.

Taking the key state-owned forest areas in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia as the study area, we provide a basic overview of development and construct an evaluation index system and a distributed calculation method for the NFCP to analyze the implications of the NFCP on ecosystem services combined with multi-source data coupling. An evaluation index system for NFCP ecosystem services was constructed. The system includes five ecological service functions and 12 evaluation indices. The trade-off and/or synergistic analysis of ecosystem services were carried out. The regional characteristics and changes in the NFCP ecosystem services were emphasized. Although it has not been implemented for a long time, the NFCP has had a great impact on ecosystem services because it reduces soil and water losses, increases soil fertility, strengthens the forest carbon sink and helped the forest accumulate nutrients and purify the atmosphere. Socioeconomic factors affect the NFCP ecosystem services, such as the implementation area of NFCP, investment amount of NFCP, area ratio of nature reserves, and yield of tree stock volume. Policy drivers of the NFCP, changes in the economic structure and reductions in forest yield are the main factors affecting the change in NFCP ecosystem services. Although the NFCP has positively affected the society, the economy, and the ecological environment, it has also generated some problems, such as the improper management of forest resources, shortage of capital investment, staff transfer, etc. The social and economic problems will be transient with implementation of the NFCP, and the structural changes in forestry and agriculture may eventually benefit the forestry workers and other stakeholders.",The contrasting hidden consequences of parasitism: Effects of a hematophagous nematode (Uncinaria sp.) in the development of a marine mammal swimming behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015959,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"Parasites are an important part of ecosystems, playing a critical role in their equilibrium. However, the consequences of parasitism beyond the direct effects associated with disease and mortality are not completely understood. This gap in knowledge is in part due to the difficulties to isolate the effect of single parasite species on physiological and behavioral traits in natural systems.The South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis)-hookworm (Uncinaria sp.) interaction offers an ideal system to overcome these difficulties and study the behavioral and physiological effects of parasites in their hosts.Hookworms cause stunted growth and anemia in pinniped pups, which could affect early life active behaviors such as swimming. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of hookworms (Uncinariasp.) on the development of swimming capabilities in A. australis through physiological and ethological analyses.Higher parasite burden was associated with reduced growth rates and lower blood hemoglobin concentrations, whereas scaled body mass and blood hemoglobin levels had an important positive effect on the water activity of the pups. However, antihookworm treatment did not affect the level of water activity of the pups, and pups with high hookworm burden increased their time budget in water. This was probably related to lower maternal attendance in heavily parasitized pups, leaving these pups more time to perform water activities. Therefore, pups with heavy hookworm burden, despite having decreased growth rates and blood hemoglobin concentrations, compensated for their handicap in physiological traits related to swimming by spending more time in the water.This work offers new insights to understand the contrasting effects of parasites on aquatic organisms, and the compensatory mechanisms employed by infected animals to avoid the worst consequences of parasitism.",The latitudinal herbivory hypothesis revisited: To be part is to be whole.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015958,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"As the big data accumulation in ecology picks up pace, we now have the opportunity to test several macroecological hypotheses, such as the latitudinal herbivory hypothesis (LHH) dated from the 1990s. The LHH proposes that plant-herbivore interactions decrease as latitude increases, that is, from lower latitudinal areas (i.e., the equator) to higher latitudinal areas (i.e., the poles). This hypothesis has been challenged in recent years. In this study, we used the greatest volume dataset of leaf herbivory from the study of Zhang et al. (Journal of Ecology, 104, 2016, 1089) to test the LHH at a global scale, based on a quantile regression model. We found that the mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and potential net primary production were heterogeneously correlated with herbivory at different quantiles or variable intervals. Although the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the global-scale trends are in accordance with the expected latitudinal variation, the Southern Hemisphere (SH) was found to exhibit inverse trends. The latitude has a negative effect on plant-herbivore interactions in the NH and on a global scale; leaf herbivory decreased more at a given latitude in higher latitudinal areas, which is attributed to harsher survival conditions in these areas. The uniformity of leaf herbivory variability along the climate and latitude gradient in the NH and on a global scale motivates that the loosening of this herbivory variability in the SH is not significant enough to dismiss the prevalence of the LHH, a testable macroecology hypothesis.","Worldwide insect declines: An important message, but interpret with caution.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015957,Ecology and evolution,2019 04 26,"A recent paper claiming evidence of global insect declines achieved huge media attention, including claims of ""insectaggedon"" and a ""collapse of nature.""

However, limited empirical data has examined the characteristics of chiropractors managing patients with low back-related leg pain (LBRLP). Our objective is to describe the prevalence, profile and practice characteristics of Australian chiropractors who often treat LBRLP, compared to those who do not often treat LBRLP.",Effect of Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in Pulmonary Inflammation in Asthma Induced by House Dust Mite (HDM): Dosimetry Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015955,International journal of inflammation,2019 04 26,"Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation in the airways. Several models have been proposed for the discovery of new therapies. Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is relatively new and effective, very low cost, with no side effects. However, there is still no consensus on the optimal dose to be used. In this sense, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the best dose in an experimental model of asthma induced by House Dust Mite (HDM). Balb/c mice received administration of 100 ug/animal HDM and LLLT applications (diode laser: 660 nm, 100 mW and four different energies 1J, 3J, 5J, and 7.5J) for 16 days. After 24 hours, we studied inflammatory, functional, and structural parameters. The results showed that LBI was able to modulate the pulmonary inflammation observed by reducing the number of cells in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) as well as reducing the percentage of neutrophils, eosinophils and T lymphocytes. On the other hand, LLLT increased the level of IL-10 and reduced levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 in BALF. LLLT was able to reduce the production of mucus, peribronchial eosinophils, collagen deposition, bronchoconstriction index, and bronchial and muscular thickening in the airways. We concluded that the use of LLLT in the treatment of chronic inflammation of the airways attenuated the inflammatory process and functional and structural parameters. We emphasize, in general, that the 1J and 3J laser presented better results. Thus, photobiomodulation may be considered a promising tool for the treatment of chronic pulmonary allergic inflammation observed in asthma."

This is even more important for spin crossover (SCO) systems, in which the spin transition is extremely sensitive to size reduction effects. These bi-stable materials have great potential for the development of nanotechnological applications provided their intrinsic properties can be successfully implemented in nanometric films, amenable to the fabrication of functional nanodevices. Here we report the fabrication of crystalline ultrathin films (<1-43 nm) of two-dimensional Hofmann-type coordination polymers by using an improved layer-by-layer strategy and a close examination of their SCO properties at the nanoscale. X-ray absorption spectroscopy data in combination with extensive atomic force microscopy analysis reveal critical dependence of the SCO transition on the number of layers and the microstructure of the films. This originates from the formation of segregated nanocrystals in early stages of the growth process that coalesce into a continuous film with an increasing number of growth cycles for an overall behaviour reminiscent of the bulk. As a result, the completeness of the high spin/low spin transition is dramatically hindered for films of less than 15 layers revealing serious limitations to the ultimate thickness that might be representative of the performance of the bulk when processing SCO materials as ultrathin films. This unprecedented exploration of the particularities of the growth of SCO thin films at the nanoscale should encourage researchers to put a spotlight on these issues when contemplating their integration into devices.",Copper-free dual labeling of DNA by triazines and cyclopropenes as minimal orthogonal and bioorthogonal functions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015943,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Two different and small functions for inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reactions were applied for dual labeling of DNA: the 1,2,4-triazine was attached to the 5-position of 2'-deoxyuridine triphosphate, and the 1-methylcyclopropene to the 7-position of 7-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate. These two modified nucleotides were sequence-selectively incorporated into oligonucleotides by DNA polymerases. These products were labeled by two different fluorescent dyes using postsynthetic reactions that are not only bioorthogonal in general, but also mutually orthogonal.",Organogelating and narcissistic self-sorting behaviour of non-preorganized oligoamides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015942,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Several series of structurally flexible, non-preorganized oligoamides with carboxylic acid, hydride, N-propargyl amide and N-propyl amide end groups were synthesized and characterized. They were found to be strong organogelators for aromatic solvents. Both the number and density of the amide units, and the nature of the end group were found to influence the gel strength as well as the kinetics of gel formation. Oligomers with a higher number and density of amide units were found to form stronger gels. Rather unexpectedly, a slight change of the end group could significantly affect the enthalpy and entropy of formation of the resulting self-assembly. Oligomers with the N-propargyl amide end group were found to be kinetically trapped in the melted state, which devoid them of forming crystalline zone upon cooling. On the other hand, the corresponding saturated N-propyl amide analog did not show the same effect. Upon mixing of these oligomers, narcissistic self-sorting could be observed in both the wet gel and xerogel states if (i) the difference in the number of amide units is greater than one or (ii) the amide unit densities are different. A semi-quantitative assessment of the extent of self-sorting could be achieved by constructing the corresponding phase diagram of the mixed gel systems. It is concluded that narcissistic self-sorting does not just prevail in mixtures making up of structurally different molecules, but appears to be fairly general even in mixtures of structurally similar molecular homologs.",Modular genetic design of multi-domain functional amyloids: insights into self-assembly and functional properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015941,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Engineering functional amyloids through a modular genetic strategy represents new opportunities for creating multifunctional molecular materials with tailored structures and performance. Despite important advances, how fusion modules affect the self-assembly and functional properties of amyloids remains elusive. Here, using Escherichia coli curli as a model system, we systematically studied the effect of flanking domains on the structures, assembly kinetics and functions of amyloids. The designed amyloids were composed of E. coli biofilm protein CsgA (as amyloidogenic cores) and one or two flanking domains, consisting of chitin-binding domains (CBDs) from Bacillus circulans chitinase, and/or mussel foot proteins (Mfps). Incorporation of fusion domains did not disrupt the typical β-sheet structures, but indeed affected assembly rate, morphology, and stiffness of resultant fibrils. Consequently, the CsgA-fusion fibrils, particularly those containing three domains, were much shorter than the CsgA-only fibrils. Furthermore, the stiffness of the resultant fibrils was heavily affected by the structural feature of fusion domains, with β-sheet-containing domains tending to increase the Young's modulus while random coil domains decreasing the Young's modulus. In addition, fibrils containing CBD domains showed higher chitin-binding activity compared to their CBD-free counterparts. The CBD-CsgA-Mfp3 construct exhibited significantly lower binding activity than Mfp5-CsgA-CBD due to inappropriate folding of the CBD domain in the former construct, in agreement with results based upon molecular dynamics modeling. Our study provides new insights into the assembly and functional properties of designer amyloid proteins with increasing complex domain structures and lays the foundation for the future design of functional amyloid-based structures and molecular materials.",Controlling nanoemulsion surface chemistry with poly(2-oxazoline) amphiphiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015940,Chemical science,2019 04 27,"Emulsions are dynamic materials that have been extensively employed within pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries. However, their use beyond conventional applications has been hindered by difficulties in surface functionalization, and an inability to selectively control physicochemical properties. Here, we employ custom poly(2-oxazoline) block copolymers to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate that poly(2-oxazoline) copolymers can effectively stabilize nanoscale droplets of hydrocarbon and perfluorocarbon in water. The controlled living polymerization of poly(2-oxazoline)s allows for the incorporation of chemical handles into the surfactants such that covalent modification of the emulsion surface can be performed. Through post-emulsion modification of these new surfactants, we are able to access nanoemulsions with modified surface chemistries, yet consistent sizes. By decoupling size and surface charge, we explore structure-activity relationships involving the cellular uptake of nanoemulsions in both macrophage and non-macrophage cell lines. We conclude that the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of poly(2-oxazoline)-stabilized droplets can be systematically tuned via chemical modification of emulsion surfaces.","Rhodium(iii)-catalyzed diverse [4 + 1] annulation of arenes with 1,3-enynes via sp3/sp2 C-H activation and 1,4-rhodium migration.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015939,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Nitrogen-rich heterocyclic compounds have a profound impact on human health. Despite the numerous synthetic methods, diversified, step-economic, and general synthesis of heterocycles remains limited. C-H bond functionalization catalyzed by rhodium(iii) cyclopentadienyls has proven to be a powerful strategy in the synthesis of diversified heterocycles. Herein we describe rhodium(iii)-catalyzed sp2 and sp3 C-H activation-oxidative annulations between aromatic substrates and 1,3-enynes, where alkenyl-to-allyl 1,4-rhodium(iii) migration enabled the generation of electrophilic rhodium(iii) π-allyls via remote C-H functionalization. Subsequent nucleophilic trapping of these species by various sp2-hybridized N-nucleophiles delivered three classes (external salts, inner salts, and neutral azacycles) of five-membered azacycles bearing a tetrasubstituted saturated carbon center, as a result of [4 + 1] annulation with the alkyne being a one-carbon synthon. All the reactions proceeded under relatively mild conditions with broad substrate scope, high efficiency, and excellent regioselectivity. The synthetic applications of this protocol have also been demonstrated, and experimental studies have been performed to support the proposed mechanism.",A cationic polymethacrylate-copolymer acts as an agonist for β-amyloid and an antagonist for amylin fibrillation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015938,Chemical science,2019 04 27,"In humans, β-amyloid and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, also known as amylin) aggregations are linked to Alzheimer's disease and type-2 diabetes, respectively. There is significant interest in better understanding the aggregation process by using chemical tools. Here, we show the ability of a cationic polymethacrylate-copolymer (PMAQA) to quickly induce a β-hairpin structure and accelerate the formation of amorphous aggregates of β-amyloid-1-40, whereas it constrains the conformational plasticity of amylin for several days and slows down its aggregation at substoichiometric polymer concentrations. NMR experiments and microsecond scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that PMAQA interacts with β-amyloid-1-40 residues spanning regions K16-V24 and A30-V40 followed by β-sheet induction. For amylin, it binds strongly close to the amyloid core domain (NFGAIL) and restrains its structural rearrangement. High-speed atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy experiments show that PMAQA blocks the nucleation and fibrillation of amylin, whereas it induces the formation of amorphous aggregates of β-amyloid-1-40. Thus, the reported study provides a valuable approach to develop polymer-based amyloid inhibitors to suppress the formation of toxic intermediates of β-amyloid-1-40 and amylin.",Annihilator dimers enhance triplet fusion upconversion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015937,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Optical upconversion is a net process by which two low energy photons are converted into one higher energy photon. There is vast potential to exploit upconversion in applications ranging from solar energy and biological imaging to data storage and photocatalysis. Here, we link two upconverting chromophores together to synthesize a series of novel tetracene dimers for use as annihilators. When compared with the monomer annihilator, TIPS-tetracene, the dimers yield a strong enhancement in the triplet fusion process, also known as triplet-triplet annihilation, as demonstrated via a large increase in upconversion efficiency and an order of magnitude reduction of the threshold power for maximum yield. Along with the ongoing rapid improvements to sensitizer materials, the dimerization improvements demonstrated here open the way to a wide variety of emerging upconversion applications.","A2SrMIVS4 (A = Li, Na; MIV = Ge, Sn) concurrently exhibiting wide bandgaps and good nonlinear optical responses as new potential infrared nonlinear optical materials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015936,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Exploration of new nonlinear optical (NLO) materials is of importance for infrared (IR) applications. However, it is an extremely tough challenge to design and synthesize excellent IR NLO materials with optimal performances (e.g., concurrently a large NLO response and wide bandgap). Herein, four new mixed alkali/alkaline earth metal sulfides, A2SrMIVS4 (A = Li, Na; MIV = Ge, Sn), were successfully synthesized by a motif-optimization approach using the classical AgGaS2 as a template. Note that all of them concurrently exhibit wide bandgaps (3.1-3.8 eV) and good NLO responses (0.5-0.8 × AgGaS2) with phase-matching behavior, which satisfy the balance conditions (Eg ≥ 3.0 eV and d

Remarkably, both of Na2SrMIVS4 have the same structure without the structural transformation (Ge to Sn) in the reported related analogues and an interesting cation-dependent structural change is also found in Na2MIISnS4 (MII: Sr, R3c vs. Ba, I4[combining macron]2d). These results verify that the above design strategy of motif-optimization provides a feasible guide for the discovery of new IR NLO candidates and the A-AE-M-S (A = alkali metal; AE = alkaline-earth metal; M = Ga, In, Ge, Sn) system was identified as the preferred system for IR NLO materials.",A catalytic protein-proteomimetic complex: using aromatic oligoamide foldamers as activators of RNase S.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015935,Chemical science,2019 04 27,"Foldamers are abiotic molecules that mimic the ability of bio-macromolecules to adopt well-defined and organised secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure. Such templates have enabled the generation of defined architectures which present structurally defined surfaces that can achieve molecular recognition of diverse and complex targets. Far less explored is whether this mimicry of nature can extend to more advanced functions of biological macromolecules such as the generation and activation of catalytic function. In this work, we adopt a novel replacement strategy whereby a segment of protein structure (the S-peptide from RNase S) is replaced by a foldamer that mimics an α-helix. The resultant prosthetic replacement forms a non-covalent complex with the S-protein leading to restoration of catalytic function, despite the absence of a key catalytic residue. Thus this functional protein-proteomimetic complex provides proof that significant segments of protein can be replaced with non-natural building blocks that may, in turn, confer advantageous properties."

The significance and inadequate mechanistic understanding of C(sp2)-H borylations motivated us to investigate the key catalytic steps and the origin of a directing-group-free regiocontrol in the reaction between aryl amides and B2pin2 (bis(pinacolato)diboron). An Ir(iii)(ubpy)tris(boryl) complex, generated from the pre-catalyst [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 by the action of a bipyridine-urea ligand (ubpy) and B2pin2, is considered as the most likely active catalyst. The meta C-H activation of N,N-dihexylbenzamide is energetically more favorable over the para isomer. The origin of this preference is traced to the presence of a concerted action of noncovalent interactions (NCIs), primarily between the catalyst and the substrate, in the regiocontrolling transition states (TSs). Molecular insights into such TSs revealed that the N-H···O interaction between the tethered urea moiety of the Ir-bound ubpy ligand of the catalyst and the amide carbonyl of the substrate is a critical interaction that helps orient the meta C-H bond nearer to iridium. Other NCIs such as C-H···π between the substrate and the catalyst, C-H···O involving the substrate C-H and the oxygen of the B2pin2 ligand and C-H···N between the substrate and the N atom of the Ir-bound ubpy confirm the significance of such interactions in providing the desirable differential energies between the competing TSs that form the basis of the extent of regioselectivity.",Photocatalytic C-H silylation of heteroarenes by using trialkylhydrosilanes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015923,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"The efficient and selective C-H silylation of heteroarenes, especially the pharmaceutically relevant electron-deficient heteroarenes, represents a great challenge in organic synthesis.

By controlling the composition of this isomorphous series, two cooperative thermally induced SCO events featuring distinct critical temperatures (Tc) and hysteresis widths (ΔTc, memory) can be selected at will. The pristine derivative 100As (x = 0, y = 1) displays a strong cooperative two-step SCO and two reversible structural phase transitions (PTs). The low temperature PTLT and the SCO occur synchronously involving conformational changes of the ligand's n-butyl arms and two different arrangements of the AsF6- anions [T1c = 174 K (ΔT1c = 17 K), T2c = 191 K (ΔT2c = 23 K) (scan rate 2 K min-1)]. The high-temperature PTHT takes place in the high-spin state domain and essentially involves rearrangement of the AsF6- anions [TPTc = 275 K (ΔTPTc = 16 K)]. This behavior strongly contrasts with that of the homologous 100P [x = 0, y = 0] derivative where two separate cooperative one-step SCO can be selected by controlling the kinetics of the coupled PTLT at ambient pressure: (i) one at low temperatures, Tc = 122 K (ΔTc = 9 K), for temperature scan rates (>1 K min-1) (memory channel A) where the structural modifications associated with PTLS are inhibited; (ii) the other centered at Tc = 155 K (ΔTc = 41 K) for slower temperature scan rates ≤0.1 K min-1 (memory channel B). These two SCO regimes of the 100P derivative transform reversibly into the two-step SCO of 100As upon application of hydrostatic pressure (ca. 0.1 GPa) denoting the subtle effect of internal chemical pressure on the SCO behavior. Precise control of AsF6- ↔ PF6- substitution, and hence of the PTLT kinetics, selectively selects the memory channel B of 100P when x = 0 and y ≈ 0.7. Meanwhile, substitution of FeII with ZnII or NiII [x ≈ 0.2, y = 0] favors the low temperature memory channel A at any scan rate. This intriguing interplay between PT, SCO and isomorphous substitution was monitored by single crystal and powder X-ray diffractometries, and magnetic and calorimetric measurements.",Non-stabilized diazoalkane synthesis via the oxidation of free hydrazones by iodosylbenzene and application in in situ MIRC cyclopropanation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015921,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Electron-rich alkyl diazo compounds are powerful reagents in organic synthesis, but the risks associated with their toxicity and instability often limit their uses. Herein we describe an efficient, easy-to-handle and safe batch protocol for the in situ generation and cyclopropanation of these highly reactive non-stabilized diazoalkanes through the oxidation of free hydrazones using iodosylbenzene. Numerous substituted cyclopropanes have been synthesized using this methodology, including various gem-dimethylcyclopropanes of particular interest in medicinal chemistry.",Chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed enantioselective construction of structurally diverse benzothiazolopyrimidines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015920,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"A highly efficient catalytic enantioselective [4+2] cycloaddition was developed between 2-benzothiazolimines and enecarbamates. A wide range of benzothiazolopyrimidines bearing three contiguous stereogenic centers was obtained in high to excellent yields and with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities (d.r. > 98 : 2 and up to >99% ee). Furthermore, this chiral phosphoric acid-catalyzed strategy was scalable and enabled access to a new class of optically pure Lewis base isothiourea derivatives.",Controlling a burn: outer-sphere gating of hydroxylamine oxidation by a distal base in cytochrome P460.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015919,Chemical science,2019 04 27,"Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) use the cytotoxic, energetic molecule hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as a source of reducing equivalents for cellular respiration. Despite disproportionation or violent decomposition being typical outcomes of reactions of NH2OH with iron, AOB and anammox heme P460 proteins including cytochrome (cyt) P460 and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) effect controlled, stepwise oxidation of NH2OH to nitric oxide (NO). Curiously, a recently characterized cyt P460 variant from the AOB Nitrosomonas sp. AL212 is able to form all intermediates of cyt P460 catalysis, but is nevertheless incompetent for NH2OH oxidation. We now show via site-directed mutagenesis, activity assays, spectroscopy, and structural biology that this lack of activity is attributable to the absence of a critical basic glutamate residue in the distal pocket above the heme P460 cofactor. This substitution is the only distinguishing characteristic of a protein that is otherwise effectively structurally and spectroscopically identical to an active variant. This highlights and reinforces a fundamental principal of metalloenzymology: metallocofactor inner-sphere geometric and electronic structures are in many cases insufficient for imbuing reactivity; a precisely defined outer coordination sphere contributed by the polypeptide matrix can be the key differentiator between a metalloenzyme and an unreactive metalloprotein.",Revising the measurement process in the variational quantum eigensolver: is it possible to reduce the number of separately measured operators?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015918,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Current implementations of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) technique for solving the electronic structure problem involve splitting the system qubit Hamiltonian into parts whose elements commute within their single qubit subspaces. The number of such parts rapidly grows with the size of the molecule. This increases the computational cost and can increase uncertainty in the measurement of the energy expectation value because elements from different parts need to be measured independently. To address this problem we introduce a more efficient partitioning of the qubit Hamiltonian using fewer parts that need to be measured separately. The new partitioning scheme is based on two ideas: (1) grouping terms into parts whose eigenstates have a single-qubit product structure, and (2) devising multi-qubit unitary transformations for the Hamiltonian or its parts to produce less entangled operators. The first condition allows the new parts to be measured in the number of involved qubit consequential one-particle measurements. Advantages of the new partitioning scheme resulting in severalfold reduction of separately measured terms are illustrated with regard to the H2 and LiH problems.",Dithiane-directed Rh(iii)-catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp3)-H bonds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015917,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"An oxidant-free Rh(iii)-catalyzed direct amidation of alkyl dithianes via C(sp3)-H bond activation utilizing diverse and robust dioxazolone reagents is reported. The reaction hinges on use of a Cp*Rh(iii) complex in combination with an essential amino-carboxylate additive to generate usefully protected 1,3-aminoaldehyde derivatives. The scalability of the reaction was demonstrated as was a series of downstream product functionalizations, including dithiane deprotection, anion alkylation and reductive desulfurization, highlighting the general applicability of this transformation in the synthesis of novel scaffolds and building blocks.",Synthesis and characterisation of rylene diimide dimers using molecular handcuffs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015916,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"A strategy for positioning, and loosely connecting, molecules in close proximity using mechanically interlocked handcuffs is described. The strategy is demonstrated using rylene diimides, creating dimeric structures in which two components are linked through pillar[5]arene/imidazolium rotaxanes. Investigation of the resulting molecules demonstrates intriguing and new properties that arise from placing these redox active dye molecules together, allowing interactions, whilst allowing the molecules to separate as required. In particular we observe excimer emission from a perylene diimide dimer handcuff and the formation of an unusual radical anion π-dimer upon double reduction of the same molecule. The latter exhibits a unique visible absorption profile for a PDI-based molecule. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by making an unprecedented mixed perylene diimide/naphthalene diimide dimer which also reveals interactions between the two components. Our synthetic strategy facilitates the creation of unusual dimeric structures and allows the investigation of intermolecular interactions and the effects they have on electronic and magnetic properties.",Evaluation of HOCl-generating anticancer agents by an ultrasensitive dual-mode fluorescent probe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015915,Chemical science,2019 04 26,"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays a crucial role in the process of pathogenic oxidative stress. Some powerful anticancer agents, such as elesclomol, specifically induce cancer cell apoptosis by increasing HOCl levels. However, sensitive tools to monitor subtle changes of biological HOCl in vivo are limited. To achieve this, we herein present rationally designed probes C1-C7 through introducing a bioorthogonal dimethylthiocarbamate receptor. All the probes were shown to sensitively and rapidly detect HOCl in the nanomolar/biologically relevant concentration range with fluorescence turn-on observed in their respective optical regions, resulting in a blue-to-red ""fluorescence rainbow"" and providing a broad selection of colors for imaging HOCl in vivo. Remarkably, probe C7 exhibited both a turn-on signal at biologically relevant concentrations (LOD1 = 18 nM) and a ratiometric response at the high risk pathogenic concentrations (LOD2 = 0.47 μM), which gives a higher reliability compared to a single signal and avoids cross-talk caused by the combined use of several probes. C7 was used to monitor the oxidative stress process induced by elesclomol in live cancer cells, and using this probe it was further discovered that an evodiamine derivative was capable of generating cancer-cell HOCl."

PEGylated liposomes are some of the most suitable delivery systems for nucleic acids because of their stability under physiological conditions and prolonged circulation time, compared to conventional and other types of ""stealth"" liposomes. In vitro/in vivo activity of PEGylated liposomes is highly dependent on PEG motif abundance. The process of ""stealth"" coverage formation is a very important parameter for efficient transfection assays and further fate determination of the PEG layer after tissue penetration. In this review, we discuss the latest methods of PEGylated liposome preparation.",Upbeat: Augmented Reality-Guided Dancing for Prosthetic Rehabilitation of Upper Limb Amputees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015903,Journal of healthcare engineering,2019 04 26,"Unsuccessful rehabilitation therapy is a widespread issue amongst modern day amputees. Of the estimated 10 million amputees worldwide, 3 million of whom are upper limb amputees, a large majority are discontent and experience rejection with their current prosthesis during activities of daily living (ADL). Here we introduce Upbeat, an augmented reality (AR) dance game designed to improve rehabilitation therapies in upper limb amputees. In Upbeat, the patient is instructed to follow a virtual dance instructor, performing choreographed dance movements containing hand gestures involved in upper limb rehabilitation therapy. The patient's position is then tracked using a Microsoft Kinect sensor while the hand gestures are analyzed using EMG data collected from a Myo Armband. Additionally, a gamified score is calculated based on how many gestures and movements were correctly performed. Upon completion of the game, a diagnostic summary of the results is shown in the form of a graph summarizing the collected EMG data, as well as with a video displaying an augmented visualization of the patient's upper arm muscle activity during gameplay. By gamifying the rehabilitation process, Upbeat has the potential to improve therapy on upper limb amputees by enabling the start of rehabilitation immediately after trauma, providing personalized feedback which professionals can utilize to accurately assess patient's progress, and increasing patient excitement, therefore increasing patient willingness to complete rehabilitation. This paper is concerned with the description and evaluation of our prototypic implementation of Upbeat that will serve as the basis for conducting clinical studies to evaluate its impact on rehabilitation.","Comparative In Vitro Toxicity Study of Docetaxel and Nanoxel, a Docetaxel-Loaded Micellar Formulation Using Cultured and Blood Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015902,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Nanoxel-PMTM (Nanoxel) is a docetaxel-loaded methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactide) (mPEG-PDLLA). This newly developed and marketed nanoformulation exhibits an improved pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and safety. Although the safety of Nanoxel to docetaxel as well as its bioequivalence must be clinically confirmed, all biological activities have not been examined in in vitro or in vivo studies. Here, the toxicity in a cultured cell system and the effects on blood cells were tested with Nanoxel and docetaxel. The in vitro cytotoxicity of Nanoxel was found to be comparable to or slightly lower than that of docetaxel depending on the concentrations tested or the cell types. Neither docetaxel nor Nanoxel induced erythrocytes hemolysis and produced reactive oxygen species up to 100 μM. However, Nanoxel was able to enhance the aggregatory response of platelets to collagen, whereas docetaxel attenuated such aggregation in a range of 50-100 μM, while thrombin-induced aggregation was not affected by either of them. Docetaxel or Nanoxel did not alter basal level of Ca2+ and 5-hydroxytryptamine-evoked Ca2+ transient in vascular smooth muscle cells. These results suggest that the mPEG-PDLLA micellar formulation alters the toxicological properties of docetaxel, and that extra cautions are needed when evaluating the safety of nanomedicine.",A 90-Day Repeated Oral Dose Toxicity Study of Alismatis Rhizoma Aqueous Extract in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015901,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Alismatis rhizoma (AR), the dried rhizome of Alisma orientale (Sam.) Juzep, is a well-known, traditional medicine that is used for the various biological activities including as a diuretic, to lower cholesterol and as an anti-inflammatory agent. The present study was carried out to investigate the potential toxicity of the Alismatis rhizoma aqueous extract (ARAE) following 90-day repeated oral administration to Sprague-Dawley rats. ARAE was administered orally to male and female rats for 90 days at 0 (control), 500, 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg/day (n = 10 for male and female rats for each dose). Additional recovery groups from the control group and high dose group were observed for a 28-day recovery period. Chromatograms of ARAE detected main compounds with four peaks. Treatment-related effects including an increase in the red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin, total protein, and urine volume were observed in males of the 2,000 mg/kg/day group (p < 0.05). However, the diuretic effect of ARAE was considered, a major cause of hematological and serum biochemical changes. The oral no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of the ARAE was > 2,000 mg/kg/day in both genders, and no target organs were identified.",Toxicological Evaluation of Phytochemical Characterized Aqueous Extract of Wild Dried Lentinus squarrosulus (Mont.) Mushroom in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015900,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Lentinus squarrosulus (Mont.) is an edible wild mushroom with tough fruiting body that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is used in ethnomedicine for the treatment of ulcer, anaemia, cough and fever. Recent studies have demonstrated its anticancer, anti-diabetic and antioxidant properties. However, little or no information is available regarding the bioactive components and toxicological study of wild dried L. squarrosulus. Therefore, this study investigated the bioactive components of aqueous extract of boiled wild dried L. squarrosulus and its toxicological effects in rats. The extract of L. squarrosulus was subjected to GC-MS analysis. The acute toxicity test was performed by oral administration of a single dose of up to 5,000 mg/kg extract of L. squarrosulus. In subacute study, the rats were orally administered extract of L. squarrosulus at the doses of 500, 1,000 and 1,500 mg/kg body weight daily for 14 days. The haematological, lipid profile, liver and kidney function parameters were determined and the histopathology of the liver and kidney were examined. The GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of bioactive compounds; 1-tetradecene, fumaric acid, monochloride, 6-ethyloct-3-yl ester, 9-eicosene, phytol, octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine and 3-trifluoroacetoxypentadecane. In acute toxicity study, neither death nor toxicity sign was recorded. In the sub-acute toxicity study, significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed on creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whilst no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed on packed cell volume, heamoglobin, red blood cell, white blood cell and alkaline phosphatase, in all the tested doses. No histopathological alterations were recorded. Our findings revealed that aqueous extract of L. squarrosulus may have antimicrobial, antinocieptive and antioxidant properties based on the result of GC-MS analysis. Results of the toxicity test showed no deleterious effect at the tested doses, suggesting that L. squarrosulus is safe for consumption at the tested doses.",α-Mangostin and Apigenin Induced Cell Cycle Arrest and Programmed Cell Death in SKOV-3 Ovarian Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015899,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth main cause of pre-senescent death in women. Although chemotherapy is generally an efficient treatment, its side effects and the occurrence of chemotherapeutic resistance have prompted the need for alternative treatments. In this study, α-mangostin and apigenin were evaluated as possible anticancer alternatives to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin, used herein as a positive control. The ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV-3 (ATCC No. HTB77) was used as model ovarian cancer cells, whereas the skin fibroblast line CCD-986Sk (ATCC No. CRL-1947) and lung fibroblast line WI-38 (ATCC No. CCL-75) were used as model untransformed cells. Apigenin and doxorubicin inhibited the growth of SKOV-3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After 72 hr exposure, doxorubicin was mostly toxic to SKOV-3 cells, whereas apigenin was toxic to SKOV-3 cells but not CCD-986Sk and WI-38 cells. α-Mangostin was more toxic to SKOV-3 cells than to CCD-986Sk cells. A lower cell density, cell shrinkage, and more unattached (floating round) cells were observed in all treated SKOV-3 cells, but the greatest effects were observed with α-mangostin. With regard to programmed cell death, apigenin caused early apoptosis within 24 hr, whereas α-mangostin and doxorubicin caused late apoptosis and necrosis after 72 hr of exposure. Caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in α-mangostin-treated SKOV-3 cells after 12 hr of exposure, whereas only caspase-9 activity was significantly increased in apigenin-treated SKOV-3 cells at 24 hr. Both α-mangostin and apigenin arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, but after 24 and 48 hr, respectively. Significant upregulation of BCL2 (apoptosis-associated gene) and COX2 (inflammation-associated gene) transcripts was observed in apigenin- and α-mangostin-treated SKOV-3 cells, respectively. α-Mangostin and apigenin are therefore alternative options for SKOV-3 cell inhibition, with apigenin causing rapid early apoptosis related to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and α-mangostin likely being involved with inflammation.",Simultaneous Determination of Cysteamine and Cystamine in Cosmetics by Ion-Pairing Reversed-Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015898,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Cysteamine has been used in cosmetics as an antioxidant, a hair straightening agent, and a hair waving agent. However, recent studies indicate that cysteamine can act as an allergen to hairdressers. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a simple and effective reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the measurement of cysteamine and its dimer, cystamine. Sodium 1-heptanesulfonate (NaHpSO) was used as an ion-pairing agent to improve chromatographic performance. Separation was performed on a Gemini C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size) using a mobile phase composed of 85:15 (v/v) 4 mM NaHpSO in 0.1% phosphoric acid:acetonitrile. UV absorbance was monitored at 215 nm. The RP-HPLC method developed in this study was validated for specificity, linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantitation, precision, accuracy, and recovery. Cysteamine and cystamine were chromatographically resolved from other reducing agents such as thioglycolic acid and cysteine. Extraction using water and chloroform resulted in the recovery for cysteamine and cystamine ranging from 100.2-102.7% and 90.6-98.7%, respectively. This validated RP-HPLC method would be useful for quality control and monitoring of cysteamine and cystamine in cosmetics.",Effect of Combined Exposure to EDTA and Zinc Pyrithione on Pyrithione Absorption in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015897,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) is a coordination complex of zinc and has been used widely as an anti-dandruff agent in shampoos. Many shampoos contain both ZnPT and EDTA, a chelating agent speculated to increase ZnPT absorption, thereby raising concerns about neurotoxicity. Here, we investigated the effect of EDTA on ZnPT absorption by direct comparison of ZnPT and pyrithione (PT) concentrations in shampoo formulations, and by pharmacokinetic analysis of ZnPT, PT, and 2-methanesulfonylpyridine (MSP), the main ZnPT metabolite, in rat plasma or urine following exposure to shampoo containing ZnPT alone or a combination of ZnPT and EDTA. Approximately 17.3% of ZnPT was converted to PT by the addition of EDTA in the shampoo formulation. Plasma ZnPT and PT concentrations were not measured up to 24 hr after treatment with shampoo containing 1% ZnPT or 1% ZnPT + 2% EDTA in all rats. However, PT amount in 24-hr urine sample, MSP concentration in plasma, and MSP amount in 24-hr urine sample were approximately 4-, 2.6-, and 2.7-fold higher, respectively, in the 1% ZnPT + 2% EDTA shampoo group than in the 1% ZnPT shampoo group. As confirmed by the formulation analysis and in vivo pharmacokinetic analysis, the exposure of ZnPT could be increased by the absorption of PT due to partial dissociation of ZnPT into PT.","Risk Assessment of Triclosan, a Cosmetic Preservative.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015896,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Triclosan (TCS) is an antimicrobial compound used in consumer products. The purpose of current study was to examine toxicology and risk assessment of TCS based on available data. Acute toxicities of oral, transdermal and inhalation routes were low, and phototoxicity and neurotoxicity were not observed. Topical treatment of TCS to animal caused mild irritation. TCS did not induce reproductive and developmental toxicity in rodents. In addition, genotoxicity was not considered based on in vitro and in vivo tests of TCS. It is not classified as a carcinogen in international authorities such as International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). No-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was determined 12 mg/kg bw/day for TCS, based on haematoxicity and reduction of absolute and relative spleen weights in a 104-week oral toxicity study in rats. Percutaneous absorption rate was set as 14%, which was human skin absorption study reported by National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) (2009). The systemic exposure dosage (SED) of TCS has been derived by two scenarios depending on the cosmetics usage of Koreans. The first scenario is the combined use of representative cosmetics and oral care products. The second scenario is the combined use of rinse-off products of cleansing, deodorants, coloring products, and oral care products. SEDs have been calculated as 0.14337 mg/kg bw/day for the first scenario and 0.04733 mg/kg bw/day for the second scenario. As a result, margin of safety (MOS) for the first and second scenarios was estimated to 84 and 253.5, respectively. Based on these results, exposure of TCS contained in rinse-off products, deodorants, and coloring products would not pose a significant health risk when it is used up to 0.3%.",Risk Assessment of Ethylhexyl Dimethyl PABA in Cosmetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015895,Toxicological research,2019 04 26,"Ethylhexyl dimethyl para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is an oily yellow liquid derivative of water-soluble PABA commonly used in sunscreen. Ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA is widely used as an ingredient in many cosmetics at an average concentration of 1.25% (0.5-2.0%) in Korea. Previous studies, including those involving animals, have demonstrated that ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA is toxic to the following four organs: testis, epididymis, spleen, and liver. In addition, experiments using human keratinocytes found that ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA inhibits cell growth and DNA synthesis at low concentrations, and halted the cell cycle of MM96L cells (human melanoma cell line) at the G1 phase. Despite limited clinical data in humans, many studies have confirmed increased mutagenicity of ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA following exposure to sunlight, which suggests that this molecule is likely to contribute to onset of sun-induced cancer despite protecting the skin through absorption of UVB. For risk assessment, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) chosen was 100 mg/kg bw/day in a 4 weeks oral toxicity study. Systemic exposure dosage (SED) was 0.588 mg/kg bw/day for maximum use of ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA in cosmetics. Based on the risk assessment and exposure scenarios conducted in this study, the margin of safety (MOS) was calculated to be 180.18 for a sunscreen containing 8% ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA, which is the maximum level allowed by the relevant domestic authorities."

It is one of the leading causes of disabilities across the globe. Failure to adequately manage chronic pain often results in additional health concerns that may directly contribute to the worsening symptoms of pain. Community pharmacists are an important healthcare resource that contributes to patient care, yet their roles in chronic pain management are often not fully utilised. This review aimed to investigate and explore pharmacist-driven chronic pain educational and medication management interventions in community pharmacies on an international level, and thereby identify if there are potential benefits in modelling and incorporating these interventions in the Australian community. We found a number of studies conducted in Europe and the United States investigated the benefits of pharmacist-driven educational and medication management interventions in the context of chronic pain management. Results demonstrated that there were improvements in the pain scores, depression/anxiety scales and physical functionality in patient groups receiving the pharmacist driven-interventions, thereby highlighting the clinical benefit of these interventions in chronic pain. In conclusion, pharmacists are trustworthy and responsible advocates for medication reviews and patient education. There are currently very limited formal nationally recognised pharmacist-driven intervention programs dedicated to chronic pain management in Australian community pharmacies. International studies have shown that pharmacist-driven chronic pain interventions undertaken in community pharmacies are of benefit with regards to alleviating pain symptoms and adverse events. Furthermore, it is also clear that research around the application of pharmacist-led chronic pain interventions in Australia is lacking. Modelling interventions that have been conducted overseas may be worth exploring in Australia. The implementation of similar intervention programs for Australian pharmacists in community pharmacies may provide enhanced clinical outcomes for patients suffering from chronic pain. The recently implemented Chronic Pain MedsCheck Trial may provide some answers.",Anaemia in heart failure patients: the prevalence of haematinic deficiencies and the role of ACE inhibitors and aspirin doses as risk factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015880,Pharmacy practice,2019 04 26,"Patients with heart failure often have comorbidities that alter the progression of heart failure and impact on prognosis.

We developed a method for rapid and cost-effective quantification of EVs which relies on the fluorescence polarization (FP) detection of lipophilic fluorescein probe, 5-dodecanoylamino fluorescein (C12-FAM). The alkyl tail of C12-FAM is specifically incorporated into the EVs, producing high FP values due to a slow diffusional motion. We quantified EVs derived from two cell lines, HT29 and TCMK1 using the new strategy, with good sensitivity that was at par with the commercial method. The new method involves minimal complexity and hands-on time.

This compound has antitumor effects against various types of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Several pre-clinical studies showed that TQ, through the modulation of different molecular pathways, is able to induce anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in HCC, without signs of toxicity. Moreover, it has been suggested that TQ has hepatoprotective effects by enhancing the tolerability and effectivity of neoadjuvant therapy prior to liver surgery, although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Based on these findings, is assumable that TQ could represent a valuable therapeutic option for patients suffering from HCC.

First, ALP activity assay determined that 200 μg/mL was the optimal concentration of CTP-CM for the following experiments. CTP-CM had no significant effect on the proliferation of hDPSCs as indicated by CCK-8 and FCM analysis. Both the gene and protein (DSPP/DSPP, RUNX2/RUNX2, OCN/OCN, OSX/OSX, OPN/OPN, ALP/ALP, and COL-1/COL-1) expression levels increased in the CTP-CM-induced hDPSC group as compared with those in the control group at day 3 or 7, showing the positive regulation of CTP-CM on the osteo/odontogenic differentiation of hDPSCs.

To infect new species, IAV typically must overcome a number of species barriers to entry, replication, and egress, even while virus replication is counteracted by antiviral host factors and innate immune mechanisms. A number of host factors have been found to regulate the replication of IAV by interacting with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). The host factor PARP1, a poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase, was required for optimal functions of human, swine, and avian influenza RdRP in human 293T cells. In IAV infection, PARP1 was required for efficient synthesis of viral nucleoprotein (NP) in human lung A549 cells. Intriguingly, pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity (PARylation) by 4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide led to a 4-fold increase in RdRP activity, and a 2.3-fold increase in virus titer. Exogenous expression of the natural PARylation inhibitor PARG also enhanced RdRP activity. These data suggest a virus-host interaction dynamic where PARP1 protein itself is required, but cellular PARylation has a distinct suppressive modality, on influenza A viral polymerase activity in human cells.",Metronomic Chemotherapy: A Systematic Review of the Literature and Clinical Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015835,Journal of oncology,2019 04 26,"Metronomic chemotherapy, continuous and dose-dense administration of chemotherapeutic drugs with lowered doses, is being evaluated for substituting, augmenting, or appending conventional maximum tolerated dose regimens, with preclinical and clinical studies for the past few decades.

We compared the relative efficacy and tolerability of currently available HER2-positive neoadjuvant immunotherapy regimens based on systematic searches of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) data. Based on intention-to-treat principle, pathological complete response (pCR), overall serious adverse events (SAEs), and breast-conserving surgery (BCS) rate were analyzed using random-effect, Bayesian network meta-analysis, and standard pairwise meta-analysis. 16 RCTs (3868 patients) were included. Analyzed treatment regimens were as follows: chemotherapy+trastuzumab+pertuzumab (CTP), trastuzumab emtansine+pertuzumab (MP), chemotherapy+trastuzumab (CT), chemotherapy+pertuzumab (CP), trastuzumab+pertuzumab (TP), chemotherapy+trastuzumab+lapatinib (CTL), and chemotherapy+lapatinib (CL), and chemotherapy (C) alone. We found that, for the chance of achieving pCR, CTP was ranked first (SUCRA: 97%), followed by CTL, MP, and CT (SUCRA: 80%, 75%, and 55%, resp.). MP provided the safest regimen (SUCRA: 97%), then TP, C, and TPC (SUCRA: 82%, 76%, and 47%, resp.). CTL proved the most toxic therapy (SUCRA: 7%). No significant difference between neoadjuvant regimens was identified for BCS. Hormone receptor status did not impact ORs for pCR in any regimen. In conclusion, our findings support CTP as the optimum neoadjuvant regimen for HER2-positive breast cancer, with the best pCR and acceptable toxicity compared with CT.

Preclinical and epidemiological evidence suggest higher green leafy vegetable (GLV) consumption may mitigate these risks. Determining the relationship between dietary habits and expected health outcomes is needed. Methods. The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used to assess perceived CC susceptibility and severity, and related dietary benefits, barriers, and motivators. RM and GLV consumption were quantified using select DHQII items (n=15) capturing the previous 30 days' intake. A 34-item Qualtrics survey was provided to a convenience sample of 1,075 adults residing throughout the US Confirmatory factor analysis measured fitness with HBM, and Cronbach's alpha assessed subscale reliability. A subsample (n=47) completed a 2-week follow-up for test-retest reliability. Independent sample t-tests were used to compare RM and GLV intake and DHCCBS responses between genders. Individual barrier questions and RM and GLV consumption were compared using ANOVA for each gender; post hoc analyses between barrier question responses were assessed with Bonferroni correction. Results were considered significant with a p value of less than 0.05. Results. 990 US adults (52.7% female, 79.1% white, 50.8% aged 35+ years) completed valid surveys. Factor analysis with varimax rotation validated the construct of HBM subscales; only one question had a loading less than 0.745. Subscale Cronbach's alphas ranged within 0.478-0.845. Overall test-retest reliability was acceptable (r=0.697, p=5.22x10-8). Participant BMI was (mean±SD) 26.7±6.6 kg/m2. Participants consumed (median, IQR) 2.3, 0.9-4.7 cooked cup equivalents GLV/week and 12.2, 5.8-21.5 ounces RM/week. Over half of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ""I can't imagine never eating red meat,"" while less than one eighth of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with the statement ""I don't like the taste of green leafy vegetables."" Conclusion. The DHCCBS is a valid instrument for measuring health beliefs related to red meat, green leafy vegetables, and perceived colon cancer risk. Additionally, these findings suggest increasing GLV may be more feasible than reducing RM for CC risk reduction in meat eaters."

We advance the idea that integrating surveillance would be helpful in characterizing and understanding the populations, locations, risk behaviours and other drivers that contribute to STBBI syndemics. The creation of matched or linked data systems that would allow routine reporting of integrated data is challenged by the technical barriers of integrating data silos as well as by the privacy and ethical considerations of merging sensitive individual-level data. Lessons can be learned from jurisdictions where an improved understanding of syndemics, through integrated STBBI surveillance, has led to more efficient and effective operational, program and policy decisions. Emerging enablers include the development of data standards and guidelines, investment in resources to overcome technical challenges and community engagement to support the ethical and non-stigmatizing use of integrated data.

Previously recommended treatments are ineffective against many of the gonorrhea strains circulating today. The current recommendation for combination therapy is now being threatened by globally emerging and increasingly resistant strains. It is important that coordinated efforts be made now to ensure these new global strains do not become established in Canada. Otherwise, we will be faced with the possibility of persistent GC infection which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and chronic pelvic pain in women; and epididymitis in men. The presence of GC can also increase the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. There are a number of reasons why we are facing this public health threat. GC infection is often asymptomatic and it is highly transmissible. People may hesitate to seek testing (or to offer testing). Treatment is complex: recommendations vary by site of infection and risk of resistance. Sexual contact during travel is an important source of imported emerging resistant global strains. The new screening and diagnostic Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is excellent but has decreased the number of cultures being done and therefore our capacity to track AMR-GC. There are four key actions that clinicians and front-line public health professionals can take to stem the increase in rates of GC and drug resistant GC. First, normalize and increase GC screening based on risk factors and emphasize the need for safer sex practices. NAAT is useful for screening, but culture is still needed for extra-genital sites. Second, conduct pretravel counselling and include a travel history as part of the risk assessment. Third, use culture along with NAAT to establish the diagnosis and follow up for test-of-cure. Finally, refer to the most current Canadian Guidelines on Sexually Transmitted Infections or provincial/territorial recommendations on combination therapies for patients and their contacts as recommendations may have changed in response to evolving AMR-GC trends.","Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae in Canada, 2012-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015818,Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,2019 04 26,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae have acquired resistance to many antimicrobials, including third generation cephalosporins and azithromycin, which are the current gonococcal combination therapy recommended by the Canadian Guidelines on Sexually Transmitted Infections.",Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness: Antiviral strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015817,Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,2019 04 26,"Antiviral medications are the only influenza-specific pharmaceutical intervention that can be used to mitigate the impact of a pandemic until a vaccine becomes available.

The present study was conducted to investigate the diversity, composition, and function of both entire and potentially active archaeal communities within Pacific deep-sea sediments. For this purpose, sediment samples were taken along the 180° meridian of the central Pacific Ocean. Community composition and diversity were assessed by Illumina tag sequencing targeting archaeal 16S rRNA genes and transcripts. Archaeal communities were dominated by Candidatus Nitrosopumilus (Thaumarchaeota) and other members of the Nitrosopumilaceae (Thaumarchaeota), but higher relative abundances of the Marine Group II (Euryarchaeota) were observed in the active compared to the entire archaeal community. The composition of the entire and the active archaeal communities was strongly linked to primary production (chlorophyll content), explaining more than 40% of the variance. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation of the entire archaeal community composition to latitude and silicic acid content, while the active community was significantly correlated with primary production and ferric oxide content. We predicted functional profiles from 16S rRNA data to assess archaeal community functions. Latitude was significantly correlated with functional profiles of the entire community, whereas those of the active community were significantly correlated with nitrate and chlorophyll content. The results of the present study provide first insights into benthic archaeal communities in the Pacific Ocean and environmental conditions shaping their diversity, distribution, and function. Additionally, they might serve as a template for further studies investigating archaea colonizing deep-sea sediments.","Association of Genetic Variants of RANK, RANKL, and OPG with Ankylosing Spondylitis Clinical Features in Taiwanese.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015798,Mediators of inflammation,2019 04 26,"Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to spinal ankylosis. The receptor activator of the nuclear factor-kappa (RANK), RANK ligand, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) (RANK/RANKL/OPG) pathway plays critical roles in bone metabolism and the immune system. The current study was aimed at investigating whether six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the RANK, RANKL, and OPG genes essential for bone homeostasis are associated with AS. Genotype distributions, allele and haplotype frequencies, were compared between 1120 AS patients and 1435 healthy controls and among AS patients with stratification by syndesmophyte formation, onset age, and HLA-B27 positivity. We found that RANKL SNPs were associated with AS syndesmophyte formation. Notably, the RANKL SNP haplotype rs7984870C/rs9533155G/rs9525641C was negatively associated with AS susceptibility and appeared to protect against syndesmophyte formation in AS. Functionally, RANKL promoter SNPs (rs9525641 C/T and rs9533155 G/C) affected DNA-protein complex formation and promoter activity in promoter reporter analyses. The OPG SNP haplotype rs2073618G/rs3102735T was significantly associated with HLA-B27 negativity in AS patients. Furthermore, AS patients with syndesmophyte formation had significantly lower levels of soluble RANKL levels than those without syndesmophyte formation. Our data suggested a role for RANKL in AS susceptibility and severity.","Association between Irisin, hs-CRP, and Metabolic Status in Children and Adolescents with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015797,Mediators of inflammation,2019 04 26,"Proinflammatory cytokines and the novel myokine irisin, a cleavage product of FNDC5, have been found to play a role in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Irisin has been shown to increase browning of adipose tissue, thermogenesis, energy expenditure, and insulin sensitivity, yet its association with inflammatory markers is still limited. Circulating irisin has been found to be increased in obesity, while in adult subjects with T2DM decreased levels have been found. However, data establishing the association of circulating irisin in children and adolescents with T2DM has not been described in the literature. The objective of this study was to determine irisin plasma concentration and its association with metabolic and adiposity markers and with hs-CRP, a surrogate marker of inflammation used in clinical practice, in a pediatric population with T2DM. A cross-sample of 40 Mexican children and adolescents aged 7-17 were recruited, 20 diagnosed with T2DM and 20 healthy controls. Plasma irisin levels were found to be lower in the T2DM group compared with controls, which could be attributed to a reduced PGC-1α activity in muscle tissue with a consequent decrease in FNDC5 and irisin expression. Irisin concentration was found to be positively correlated with HDL-c, LDL-c, and total cholesterol, while negatively correlated with BMI, waist circumference, and triglycerides. However, after multiple regression analysis, only HDL-c correlation remained significant. hs-CRP was higher in the T2DM group and positively associated with adiposity markers, unfavorable lipid profile, insulin levels, and HOMA-IR, but no association with irisin was found. Given the favorable metabolic effects attributed to irisin, the low plasma levels found in children and adolescents with T2DM could exacerbate the inflammatory and metabolic imbalances and the intrinsic cardiovascular risk of this disease. We propose an ""irisin-proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory axis"" to explain the role of irisin as a metabolic regulator in obesity and T2DM.",PPAR-γ Activation Exerts an Anti-inflammatory Effect by Suppressing the NLRP3 Inflammasome in Spinal Cord-Derived Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015796,Mediators of inflammation,2019 04 26,"Persistent inflammation disrupts functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) activation promotes functional recovery in SCI rats by inhibiting inflammatory cascades and increasing neuronal survival. We sought to clarify the relationship between PPAR-γ activation and NACHT, LRR and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome suppression, and the role of NF-κB in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in neurons. In SCI rats, we found that rosiglitazone (PPAR-γ agonist) inhibited the expression of caspase-1. In in vitro neurons, G3335 (PPAR-γ antagonist) reversed the rosiglitazone-induced inhibition of caspase-1, interleukin 1 (IL-1β), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Rosiglitazone inhibited the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-6. However, the activator of NLRP3 could counteract this inhibition induced by PPAR-γ activation. NF-κB did not participate in the process of rosiglitazone-induced inhibition of NLRP3. Consistent with our in vitro results, we verified that locomotor recovery of SCI rats in vivo was regulated via PPAR-γ, NLRP3, and NF-κB. These results suggest that PPAR-γ activation exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome-but not NF-κB-in neurons and that PPAR-γ activation is a promising therapeutic target for SCI.",FTY720 Effects on Inflammation and Liver Damage in a Rat Model of Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015795,Mediators of inflammation,2019 04 26,"Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) produces systemic inflammation with the potential for causing organ failure in tissues peripheral to the initial site of injury.

T cell subsets in obese adipose tissue are skewed towards Th1- and Th17-associated phenotypes and their secreted cytokines contribute to obesity-associated inflammation. Our lab recently identified a novel, myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cell subset that modulates T cell activity. The current study sought to determine how these myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cells are altered in the adipose tissue and peripheral blood of preobese mice and how this population modulates T cell activity. C57BL/6 mice were fed with a diet high in milkfat (60%·kcal, HFD) ad libitum until a 20% increase in total body weight was reached, and myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cells and CD4+ T cells in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), mammary gland-associated adipose tissue (MGAT), and peripheral blood (PB) were phenotypically analyzed. Also analyzed was whether mediators from MGAT-primed myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cells stimulate normal CD4+ T cell cytokine production. A higher percentage of myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cells expressed the activation markers MHC II and CD80 in both VAT and MGAT of preobese mice. CD4+ T cells were preferentially skewed towards Th1- and Th17-associated phenotypes in the adipose tissue and periphery of preobese mice. In vitro, MGAT from HFD-fed mice triggered myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cells to induce CD4+ T cell IFN-γ and TNF-α production. Taken together, this study shows that myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cells express markers of immune activation and suggests that they play an immune modulatory role in the adipose tissue of preobese mice.",CatbNet: A Multi Network Analyzer for Comparing and Analyzing the Topology of Biological Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015793,Current genomics,2019 04 26,"Complexity and dynamicity of biological events is a reason to use comprehen-sive and holistic approaches to deal with their difficulty.

A review of the recently published book of Beinhundner (2017) has further revealed that one of the specimens mistakenly figured as Lophorrhinadonckieri Bourgoin, 1913 in that work is most likely the female of this new species. Analysis of the diagnostic characters of the genus Lophorrhina Westwood, 1842 shows that the new species differs in several key areas. In particular, the clypeal armature is virtually identical in both sexes, the male protibiae are not typically elongate and narrow as in all the members of Lophorrhina, but are remarkably more robust, laterally expanded and with a tridentate margin in both sexes, even though the third tooth in the female and the second and third teeth in the male are virtually obsolete. The general body shape in the new species is also more globose and lacks the typical deplanate and apically tapering elytra of the Lophorrhina males. These and other characters are, in our view, sufficient to justify the erection of a new genus, Lophorrhinidesgen. n., to accommodate the new species, here described as L.muelleraesp. n. The new genus is presumably a mountain specialist, as both known specimens were collected in the southern highlands of Tanzania, at Manow and Rungwe respectively.","Molecular and morphological evidence for the identity of two nominal species of Astegopteryx (Hemiptera, Aphididae, Hormaphidinae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015776,ZooKeys,2019 05 04,"The morphology of many insect species is usually influenced by environmental factors and therefore high phenotypic variation exists even within a species.

Astegopteryxbambusae and A.bambucifoliae are currently regarded as two closely related aphid species with similar bamboo hosts and overlapping distributions in the oriental region. However, in practice it is hard to distinguish between them. By incorporating molecular data from four mitochondrial and nuclear genes as well as morphological information from an extensive collection of live specimens, the present study indicates that A.bambucifoliae is a junior synonym of A.bambusae. The data also indicate that large-scale geographic patterns of population differentiation may exist within this species.","On the clawed lobsters of the genus Nephropsis Wood-Mason, 1872 recently collected from deep-sea cruises off Taiwan and the South China Sea (Crustacea, Decapoda, Nephropidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015775,ZooKeys,2019 04 26,"Recent deep-sea cruises using Taiwanese research vessels off Taiwan and in the South China Sea yielded seven species of the clawed lobster genus Nephropsis Wood-Mason, 1872.

There have been no previous quantitative analyses, particularly using a geometric morphometric approach based on a large sample of data, to shed light on the morphological diversity and evolution of Lucanidae. Thoracic adaptation and ecological differentiation are intimately related, and the pronotum bears important muscles and supports the locomotion of prothoracic legs. The elytron is an autapomorphy of the Coleoptera. To reconstruct and visualize the patterns of evolutionary diversification and phylogenetic history of shape change, an ancestral groundplan can be reconstructed by mapping geometric morphometric data onto a phylogenetic tree. In this study, the morphologies of the pronotum and elytron in 1303 stag beetles (Lucanidae), including approximately 99.2% of all globally described species, were examined, thus revealing several aspects of morphological diversity and evolution. First, on the basis of geometric morphometric analysis, we found significant morphological differences in the pronotum or elytron between any two Lucanidae subfamilies. And we subsequently reconstructed the ancestral groundplans of the two structures in stag beetles and compared them with those of extant species (through cladistic and geometric morphometric methods). The ancestral groundplan of Lucanidae was found to be most similar to extant Nicagini in both the pronotum and elytron, according to Mahalanobis distances. Furthermore, we analyzed species richness and morphological diversity of stag beetles and the relationships between them and found that the two parameters were not always correlated. Aesalinae was found to be the most diverse subfamily in both the pronotum and elytron, despite its poor species richness, and the diversity of the pronotum or elytron was not superior in Lucaninae, despite its high species richness. Our study provides insights into the morphological variations and evolutionary history of the pronotum and elytron in four subfamilies of stag beetles, and it illuminates the relationship between morphological diversity and species richness. Intriguingly, our analysis indicates that morphological diversity and species richness are not always correlated. These findings may stimulate further studies in this field.","Discovery of Neonrosellavitiata (Darwin) and Newmanellaspinosus Chan & Cheang (Balanomorpha, Tetraclitidae) from the Andaman Sea, eastern Indian Ocean.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015773,ZooKeys,2019 04 26,"In this present study, distantly related acorn barnacle species in the subfamily Newmanellinae (Cirripedia, Thoracica, Tetraclitidae), including Neonrosellavitiata (Darwin, 1854) and Newmanellaspinosus Chan & Cheang, 2016, were discovered in the Andaman Sea of Thailand.

The following were measured before and 6 months post-BT: forced expiratory volume in 1.0 s (FEV1), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, blood eosinophil counts (Eosi), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score, and preventive medication use. At baseline, the mean post-bronchodilator FEV1 was 80.9% of the predicted value (range 45.6-115.7%). All patients were being treated with moderate- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2 agonists. The AQLQ improved from 4.26±1.67 at baseline to 5.59±0.94 at 6 months post-BT (p<0.05). The %FEV1, FeNO, IgE, and Eosi did not change significantly between baseline and 6 months post-BT. No severe complications were reported. BT was effective for non-allergic and non-eosinophilic in 3 patients, and allergic or eosinophilic in 4 patients. Their AQLQ improved by > 0.5 points post-BT. For both allergic and eosinophilic asthmatics following mepolizumab, BT was not useful. BT was effective for non-allergic and non-eosinophilic or allergic asthmatics, but insufficient for both allergic and eosinophilic following mepolizumab.",Collagen XVIII Deposition in the Basement Membrane Zone beneath the Newly Forming Epidermis during Wound Healing in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015748,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 24,"The basement membrane (BM) is composed of various extracellular molecules and regulates tissue regeneration and maintenance. Here, we demonstrate that collagen XVIII was spatiotemporally expressed in the BM during skin wound healing in a mouse excisional wound-splinting model. Re-epithelialization was detected at days 3 and 6 post-wounding. The ultrastructure of epidermal BM was discontinuous at day 3, whereas on day 6 a continuous BM was observed in the region proximal to the wound edge. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that collagen XVIII was deposited in the BM zone beneath newly forming epidermis in day 3 and 6 wounds. Laminin-332, known to be the earliest BM component appearing in wounds, was colocalized with collagen XVIII in the epidermal BM zone at days 3 and 6. The deposition of α1(IV) collagen and nidogen-1 in the epidermal BM zone occurred later than that of collagen XVIII. We also observed the short isoform of collagen XVIII in the epidermal BM zone at day 3 post-wounding. Collectively, our results suggested that collagen XVIII plays a role in the formation of the dermal-epidermal junction during re-epithelialization, and that it is the short isoform that is involved in the early phase of re-epithelialization.",Thyroid Function Decline and Diet in Female High School Long-distance Runners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015747,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 24,"We aimed to clarify the state of thyroid function in female high school long-distance runners. We evaluated the associations between thyroid function and menstrual condition, bone mineral density (BMD), nutritious status, and body composition. The subjects' height and weight were measured, along with fat percentage, fat mass, muscle mass, and BMD with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. A nutrition and dietary survey measured the subjects' intake of energy and nutrients based on meals provided at the subjects' dorm for 3 days in July of 2016 and 2017. Blood parameters including thyroid hormone and estradiol were measured. Most of the subjects (81.3%) were underweight (body mass index <18.5). The thyroid hormone free T3 value was decreased, but TSH was not increased and was similar to that observed in individuals with anorexia nervosa. In our subjects, thyroid hormone was associated with BMD and nutritional intake. To improve the menstruation abnormality of female athletes and to increase their bone density, the athletes' weight should be managed by proper nutrient intake and the maintenance of their thyroid function.","Unintentional Injury Deaths among Children: A Descriptive Study Using Medico-legal Documents in Okayama Prefecture, Japan (2001-2015).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015746,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 24,"According to the World Health Organization's World Report, approx. 950,000 children and young people < 18 years old die from an injury each year, and unintentional injury deaths account for a large portion of these cases. Here we used medico-legal documents to epidemiologically analyze the cases of unintentional injury deaths among children < 5 years old in Okayama Prefecture, Japan from 2001 to 2015. Age, sex, manner/cause of death, and various circumstances of the incident were investigated. There were 73 unintentional injury deaths during the study period. Drowning (n=29), suffocation (n=24), and transport accidents (n=13) were the major categories of unintentional injury deaths. Twenty-two cases (30.1%) were autopsied. Differences in the characteristics of the unintentional injury deaths by age were observed. Information which cannot be obtained from Vital Statistics was available from medico-legal documents, and detailed characteristics of unintentional injury deaths among children < 5 years old were elucidated. Investigating medico-legal information is one of the meaningful measures for the prevention of unintentional injury deaths among children in Japan.",Clinicopathological Features and Outcomes of Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection for Superficial Cancer of the Pharynx.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015745,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 24,"The efficacy and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for superficial cancer of the pharynx are still unclear. To identify clinicopathological features of superficial pharyngeal cancer, and the efficacy and safety of ESD, we retrospectively assessed 70 pharyngeal cancers in 59 patients who underwent ESD. Of these patients, 61.0% and 50.8% had a history of esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer, respectively. The median tumor size was 15 mm, and 75.7% of the lesions were located at the piriform sinus. The en bloc resection rate was 94.9%. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 8 cases, but there was no treatment-related death. The lateral margin was positive for neoplasm in 3 lesions (4.3%) and inconclusive in 27 lesions (38.6%), but no local recurrence was observed. Cervical lymph node metastasis was observed in 6 patients, and was successfully treated by cervical lymph node dissection. The three-year overall survival rate was 91.5% (95%CI: 76.6-97.3%) and the cause-specific survival rate was 97.6% (95%CI: 84.9-99.7%). In conclusion, ESD for superficial pharyngeal cancer was safe and effective. ""Resect and watch"" is probably a feasible and rational strategy for treatment of patients with superficial pharyngeal cancer.",Factors Affecting the Absorption of Midazolam to the Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Circuit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015744,Acta medica Okayama,2019 04 24,"Sedatives are administered during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy to ensure patient safety, reduce the metabolic rate and correct the oxygen supply-demand balance. However, the concentrations of sedatives can be decreased due to absorption into the circuit. This study examined factors affecting the absorption of a commonly used sedative, midazolam (MDZ). Using multiple ex vivo simulation models, three factors that may influence MDZ levels in the ECMO circuit were examined: polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing in the circuit, use of a membrane oxygenator in the circuit, and heparin coating of the circuit. We also assessed changes in drug concentration when MDZ was re-injected in a circuit. The MDZ level decreased to approximately 60% of the initial concentration in simulated circuits within the first 30 minutes. The strongest factor in this phenomenon was contact with the PVC tubing. Membrane oxygenator use tended to increase MDZ loss, whereas heparin circuit coating had no influence on MDZ absorption. Similar results were obtained when a second dose of MDZ was injected to the second-use circuits."

Here, we report the development of an automated and portable medicines-on-demand device that enables consistent, small-scale GMP manufacturing of therapeutic-grade biologics on a timescale of hours. The device couples the in vitro translation of target proteins from ribosomal DNA, using extracts from reconstituted lyophilized Chinese hamster ovary cells, with the continuous purification of the proteins. We used the device to reproducibly manufacture His-tagged granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, erythropoietin, glucose-binding protein and diphtheria toxoid DT5.

There was an increase in the density of metabolically active sessile cells up to 72 h of biofilm formation on polystyrene and glass surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis revealed that in the early stage of biofilm formation, yeast cells adhered to the abiotic surface as a monolayer. After 12 h, extracellular fibrils were observed projecting from C. gattii cells, connecting the yeast cells to each other and to the abiotic surface; mature biofilm consisted of a dense network of cells deeply encased in an extracellular polymeric matrix. These features were also observed in biofilms formed on polyvinyl chloride and silicone catheter surfaces. We used RNA-Seq-based transcriptome analysis to identify changes in gene expression associated with C. gattii biofilm at 48 h compared to the free-floating planktonic cells. Differential expression analysis showed that 97 and 224 transcripts were up-regulated and down-regulated in biofilm, respectively. Among the biological processes, the highest enriched term showed that the transcripts were associated with cellular metabolic processes, macromolecule biosynthetic processes and translation.",Artificial intelligence in healthcare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015651,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 24,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually changing medical practice.

However, the interaction between the pathophysiology of diseased tissue and individual therapeutic agents can be complex, and can vary across tissue types and across subjects. Here, we show that the combination of mathematical modelling, high-resolution optical imaging of intact and optically cleared tumour tissue from animal models, and in vivo imaging of vascular perfusion predicts the heterogeneous uptake, by large tissue samples, of specific therapeutic agents, as well as their spatiotemporal distribution. In particular, by using murine models of colorectal cancer and glioma, we report and validate predictions of steady-state blood flow and intravascular and interstitial fluid pressure in tumours, of the spatially heterogeneous uptake of chelated gadolinium by tumours, and of the effect of a vascular disrupting agent on tumour vasculature.",Development and validation of a deep-learning algorithm for the detection of polyps during colonoscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015647,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 24,"The detection and removal of precancerous polyps via colonoscopy is the gold standard for the prevention of colon cancer. However, the detection rate of adenomatous polyps can vary significantly among endoscopists. Here, we show that a machine-learning algorithm can detect polyps in clinical colonoscopies, in real time and with high sensitivity and specificity. We developed the deep-learning algorithm by using data from 1,290 patients, and validated it on newly collected 27,113 colonoscopy images from 1,138 patients with at least one detected polyp (per-image-sensitivity, 94.38%; per-image-specificity, 95.92%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.984), on a public database of 612 polyp-containing images (per-image-sensitivity, 88.24%), on 138 colonoscopy videos with histologically confirmed polyps (per-image-sensitivity of 91.64%; per-polyp-sensitivity, 100%), and on 54 unaltered full-range colonoscopy videos without polyps (per-image-specificity, 95.40%). By using a multi-threaded processing system, the algorithm can process at least 25 frames per second with a latency of 76.80 ± 5.60 ms in real-time video analysis. The software may aid endoscopists while performing colonoscopies, and help assess differences in polyp and adenoma detection performance among endoscopists.",Galectins in prostate and bladder cancer: tumorigenic roles and clinical opportunities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015643,Nature reviews. Urology,2019 04 24,"Advanced prostate and bladder cancer are two outstanding unmet medical needs for urological oncologists. The high prevalence of these tumours, lack of effective biomarkers and limited effective treatment options highlight the importance of basic research in these diseases. Galectins are a family of β-galactoside-binding proteins that are frequently altered (upregulated or downregulated) in a wide range of tumours and have roles in different stages of tumour development and progression, including immune evasion. In particular, altered expression levels of different members of the galectin family have been reported in prostate and bladder cancers, which, together with the aberrant glycosylation patterns found in tumour cells and the constituent cell types of the tumour microenvironment, can result in malignant transformation and tumour progression. Understanding the roles of galectin family proteins in the development and progression of prostate and bladder cancer could yield key insights to inform the clinical management of these diseases.",Combined local immunostimulatory radioisotope therapy and systemic immune checkpoint blockade imparts potent antitumour responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015634,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 24,"Radiation therapy for cancer can lead to off-target toxicity and can be ineffective against hypoxic solid tumours and distant metastases. Here, we show that intratumoral injection, in mouse and rabbit xenografts and in patient-derived mouse xenografts, of a sodium alginate formulation containing catalase (Cat) labelled with the therapeutic 131I radioisotope enables long-term relief of tumour hypoxia and complete tumour elimination at low radioactivity doses. On injection, the soluble polysaccharide rapidly transforms into a hydrogel in the presence of endogenous Ca2+, fixing 131I-Cat within the tumours. We also show that local radiotherapy with a formulation that includes the immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotide combined with systemic checkpoint-blockade therapy using an anti-CTLA-4 antibody leads to metastasis inhibition and protection against tumour rechallenge. The local therapy, which uses only biocompatible components, might enable new strategies for local tumour treatments that can be combined with systemic therapeutic responses, for the inhibition of tumour metastasis and the prevention of tumour recurrence in patients with advanced-stage cancer.",TLR7/8-agonist-loaded nanoparticles promote the polarization of tumour-associated macrophages to enhance cancer immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015631,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 24,"Tumour-associated macrophages are abundant in many cancers, and often display an immune-suppressive M2-like phenotype that fosters tumour growth and promotes resistance to therapy. Yet, macrophages are highly plastic and can also acquire an anti-tumorigenic M1-like phenotype. Here, we show that R848, an agonist of the toll-like receptors TLR7 and TLR8 identified in a morphometric-based screen, is a potent driver of the M1 phenotype in vitro and that R848-loaded β-cyclodextrin nanoparticles (CDNP-R848) lead to efficient drug delivery to tumour-associated macrophages in vivo. As a monotherapy, the administration of CDNP-R848 in multiple tumour models in mice altered the functional orientation of the tumour immune microenvironment towards an M1 phenotype, leading to controlled tumour growth and protecting the animals against tumour rechallenge. When used in combination with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1, we observed improved immunotherapy response rates, including in a tumour model resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Our findings demonstrate the ability of rationally engineered drug-nanoparticle combinations to efficiently modulate tumour-associated macrophages for cancer immunotherapy.",Low-dose X-ray radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy via nanoscale metal-organic frameworks enhances checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015630,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 24,"Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy relies on energized cytotoxic T cells attacking tumour tissue systemically. However, for many cancers, the reliance on T cell infiltration leads to low response rates. Conversely, radiotherapy has served as a powerful therapy for local tumours over the past 100 years, yet is rarely sufficient to cause systemic tumour rejection. Here, we describe a treatment strategy that combines nanoscale metal-organic framework (nMOF)-enabled radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for both local and systemic tumour elimination. In mouse models of breast and colorectal cancer, intratumorally injected nMOFs treated with low doses of X-ray irradiation led to the eradication of local tumours and, when loaded with an inhibitor of the immune checkpoint molecule indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, the irradiated nMOFs led to consistent abscopal responses that rejected distal tumours. By combining the advantages of local radiotherapy and systemic tumour rejection via synergistic X-ray-induced in situ vaccination and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibition, nMOFs may overcome some of the limitations of checkpoint blockade in cancer treatment.",Conjugation of haematopoietic stem cells and platelets decorated with anti-PD-1 antibodies augments anti-leukaemia efficacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015615,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 24,"Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia who relapse following therapy have few treatment options and face poor outcomes. Immune checkpoint inhibition, for example, by antibody-mediated programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade, is a potent therapeutic modality that improves treatment outcomes in acute myeloid leukaemia. Here, we show that systemically delivered blood platelets decorated with anti-PD-1 antibodies (aPD-1) and conjugated to haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) suppress the growth and recurrence of leukaemia in mice. Following intravenous injection into mice bearing leukaemia cells, the HSC-platelet-aPD-1 conjugate migrated to the bone marrow and locally released aPD-1, significantly enhancing anti-leukaemia immune responses, and increasing the number of active T cells, production of cytokines and chemokines, and survival time of the mice. This cellular conjugate also promoted resistance to re-challenge with leukaemia cells. Taking advantage of the homing capability of HSCs and in situ activation of platelets for the enhanced delivery of a checkpoint inhibitor, this cellular combination-mediated drug delivery strategy can significantly augment the therapeutic efficacy of checkpoint blockade."

The present study focuses on Al0.7CoCrFeNi, a lamellar dual-phase (fcc + B2) precipitation-strengthenable eutectic high entropy alloy. This alloy exhibits an fcc + B2 (B2 with bcc nano-precipitates) microstructure resulting in a combination of the soft and ductile fcc phase together with hard B2 phase. Low temperature annealing leads to the precipitation of ordered L12 intermetallic precipitates within the fcc resulting in enhanced strength. The strengthening contribution due to fine scale L12 is modeled using Orowan dislocation bowing and by-pass mechanism. The alloy was tested under quasi-static (strain-rate = 10-3 s-1) tensile loading and dynamic (strain-rate = 103 s-1) compressive loading. Due to the fine lamellar microstructure with a large number of fcc-bcc interfaces, the alloy show relatively high flow-stresses, ~1400 MPa under quasi-static loading and in excess of 1800 MPa under dynamic loading. Interestingly, the coherent nano-scale L12 precipitate caused a significant rise in the yield strength, without affecting the strain rate sensitivity (SRS) significantly. These lamellar structures had higher work hardening due to their capability for easily storing higher dislocation densities. The back-stresses from the coherent L12 precipitate were insufficient to cause improvement in twin nucleation, owing to elevated twinning stress under quasi-static testing. However, under dynamic testing high density of twins were observed.",Habitat-dependent composition of bacterial and fungal communities in biological soil crusts from Oman.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015576,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) occur within drylands throughout the world, covering ~12% of the global terrestrial soil surface. Their occurrence in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula has rarely been reported and their spatial distribution, diversity, and microbial composition remained largely unexplored. We investigated biocrusts at six different locations in the coastal and central deserts of Oman. The biocrust types were characterized, and the bacterial and fungal community compositions of biocrusts and uncrusted soils were analysed by amplicon sequencing. The results were interpreted based on the environmental parameters of the different sites. Whereas at lowland sites, mainly cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts were observed, both cyanobacteria- and lichen-dominated biocrusts occurred at mountain sites. The majority of bacterial sequences (32-83% of total sequences) belonged to Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, whereas fungal sequences belonged to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Chytridiomycota (>95%). With biocrust development, a notable increase in cyanobacterial and decrease in actinobacterial proportions was observed for cyanobacteria-dominated crusts. In coastal areas, where salinity is high, biocrusts were replaced by a unique marine mat-like microbial community, dominated by halotolerant taxa. Redundancy analysis revealed a significant contribution of soil texture, cover type, carbon content, and elevation to the variations in bacterial and fungal communities. Multivariate analysis placed microbial communities in significantly separated clusters based on their carbon content, elevation and electrical conductivity. We conclude that Oman hosts a variety of cyanobacteria- and lichen-dominated crusts with their bacterial and fungal communities being largely dictated by soil properties and environmental parameters.",Endogenous interaction profiling identifies DDX5 as an oncogenic coactivator of transcription factor Fra-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015574,Oncogene,2019 04 24,"Fra-1, a member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family, is overexpressed in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and plays crucial roles in tumor growth. Here we report the identification of 118 proteins interacting with endogenous chromatin-bound Fra-1 in TNBC cells, highlighting DDX5 as the most enriched Fra-1-interacting protein. DDX5, a previously unrecognized protein in the Fra-1 transcriptional network, shows extensive overlap with Fra-1 cistrome and transcriptome that are highly associated with the TNBC cell growth. We provide evidence that DDX5 expression enhances Fra-1 transcriptional activity and potentiates Fra-1-driven cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that the DDX5 target gene signature predicts poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. DDX5 protein level was higher in triple-negative basal-like tumors than in non-basal-like tumors, including luminal A, luminal B, and HER2-enriched subtypes. Collectively, by combining proteomic and genomic approaches we reveal a role for DDX5 as a regulatory protein of Fra-1 signaling and suggest DDX5 as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.",Topographic controls of soil organic carbon on soil-mantled landscapes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015573,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Large uncertainties in global carbon (C) budgets stem from soil carbon estimates and associated challenges in distributing soil organic carbon (SOC) at local to landscape scales owing to lack of information on soil thickness and controls on SOC storage. Here we show that 94% of the fine-scale variation in total profile SOC within a 1.8 km2 semi-arid catchment in Idaho, U.S.A. can be explained as a function of aspect and hillslope curvature when the entire vertical dimension of SOC is measured and fine-resolution (3 m) digital elevation models are utilized. Catchment SOC stocks below 0.3 m depth based on our SOC-curvature model account for >50% of the total SOC indicating substantial underestimation of stocks if sampled at shallower depths. A rapid assessment method introduced here also allows for accurate catchment-wide total SOC inventory estimation with a minimum of one soil pit and topographic data if spatial distribution of total profile SOC is not required. Comparison of multiple datasets shows generality in linear SOC-curvature and -soil thickness relationships at multiple scales. We conclude that mechanisms driving variations in carbon storage in hillslope catchment soils vary spatially at relatively small scales and can be described in a deterministic fashion given adequate topographic data.",Al atomistic surface modulation on colloidal gradient quantum dots for high-brightness and stable light-emitting devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015572,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Quantum-dot (QD) light-emitting devices (QLEDs) have been attracting considerable attention owing to the unique properties of process, which can control the emission wavelength by controlling the particle size, narrow emission bandwidth, and high brightness. Although there have been rapid advances in terms of luminance and efficiency improvements, the long-term device stability is limited by the low chemical stability and photostability of the QDs against moisture and air. In this study, we report a simple method, which can for enhance the long-term stability of QLEDs against oxidation by inserting Al into the shells of CdSe/ZnS QDs. The Al coated on the ZnS shell of QDs act as a protective layer with Al2O3 owing to photo-oxidation, which can prevents the photodegradation of QD with prolonged irradiation and stabilize the device during a long-term operation. The QLEDs fabricated using CdSe/ZnS/Al QDs exhibited a maximum luminance of 57,580 cd/m2 and current efficiency of 5.8 cd/A, which are significantly more than 1.6 times greater than that of CdSe/ZnS QDs. Moreover, the lifetimes of the CdSe/ZnS/Al-QD-based QLEDs were significantly improved owing to the self-passivation at the QD surfaces.",Revisiting Fragmentation Reactions of Protonated α-Amino Acids by High-Resolution Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry with Collision-Induced Dissociation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015571,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Fragmentation reactions of protonated α-amino acids (AAs) were studied previously using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of unit mass resolution.

In the present study, we examined the fragmentation patterns of 19 AAs using high-resolution electrospray ionization MS/MS (HR-ESI-MS/MS) with collision-induced dissociation (CID). Isobaric fragmentation products from protonated Met and Trp were resolved and identified for the first time. Previously unreported fragmentation products from protonated Met, Cys, Gln, Arg, and Lys were observed. Additionally, the chemical identity of a fragmentation product from protonated Trp that was incorrectly annotated in previous investigations was corrected. All previously unreported fragmentation products and reactions were verified by pseudo MS3 experiments and/or MS/MS analyses of deuterated AAs.

In the present study, we investigated whether AS-1 had attenuating effects on hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy, and whether this process was mediated by the regulation of miRNA-143. To induce the hypertrophic response in vitro, cardiomyocytes were stimulated with Ang II for 24hs. AS-1 administration strongly attenuated Ang II-induced hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes. Chronical infusion of Ang II via implanted osmotic mini-pump induced increased blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. AS-1 administration attenuated hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy by, at least in part, inhibin of MAPK signaling. We observed, for the first time, upregulated expression of miRNA-143 in Ang II-induced cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of miRNA-143 significantly reduced the Ang II-induced hypertrophic responses. Importantly, AS-1 administration diminished the Ang II-induced upregulation of miRNA-143. Overexpression of miRNA-143 abolished the attenuating effects of AS-1 on Ang II-induced hypertrophic response of cardiomyocytes. Additionally, AS-1 administration abrogates Ang II-induced nuclear translocation of p50 NF-κB subunit in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Application of NF-κB inhibitor significantly suppressed Ang II-induced upregulation of miRNA-143. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which AS-1 attenuates Ang II-induced hypertrophic response through downregulation miRNA-143 expression in a NF-κB-dependent manner.",Semisynthetic aurones inhibit tubulin polymerization at the colchicine-binding site and repress PC-3 tumor xenografts in nude mice and myc-induced T-ALL in zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015569,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Structure-activity relationships (SAR) in the aurone pharmacophore identified heterocyclic variants of the (Z)-2-benzylidene-6-hydroxybenzofuran-3(2H)-one scaffold that possessed low nanomolar in vitro potency in cell proliferation assays using various cancer cell lines, in vivo potency in prostate cancer PC-3 xenograft and zebrafish models, selectivity for the colchicine-binding site on tubulin, and absence of appreciable toxicity. Among the leading, biologically active analogs were (Z)-2-((2-((1-ethyl-5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl)methylene)-3-oxo-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-6-yl)oxy)acetonitrile (5a) and (Z)-6-((2,6-dichlorobenzyl)oxy)-2-(pyridin-4-ylmethylene)benzofuran-3(2H)-one (5b) that inhibited in vitro PC-3 prostate cancer cell proliferation with IC50 values below 100 nM. A xenograft study in nude mice using 10 mg/kg of 5a had no effect on mice weight, and aurone 5a did not inhibit, as desired, the human ether-à-go-go-related (hERG) potassium channel. Cell cycle arrest data, comparisons of the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by aurones and known antineoplastic agents, and in vitro inhibition of tubulin polymerization indicated that aurone 5a disrupted tubulin dynamics. Based on molecular docking and confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry studies, aurone 5a targets the colchicine-binding site on tubulin. In addition to solid tumors, aurones 5a and 5b strongly inhibited in vitro a panel of human leukemia cancer cell lines and the in vivo myc-induced T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in a zebrafish model.",Iron deficiency disrupts embryonic haematopoiesis but not the endothelial to haematopoietic transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015568,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"In this study, we aimed to explore how cellular iron status affects embryonic haematopoiesis. For this purpose, we used a model of mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation into embryonic haematopoietic progenitors. We modulated the iron status by adding either the iron chelator Deferoxamine (DFO) for iron deficiency, or ferric ammonium citrate for iron excess, and followed the emergence of developing haematopoietic progenitors. Interestingly, we found that iron deficiency did not block the endothelial to haematopoietic transition, the first step of haematopoiesis. However, it did reduce the proliferation, survival and clonogenic capacity of haematopoietic progenitors. Surprisingly, iron deficiency affected erythro-myeloid progenitors significantly more than the primitive erythroid ones. Erythro-myeloid progenitors expressed less transferrin-receptor on the cell surface and had less labile iron compared to primitive erythroid progenitors, which could reduce their capacity to compete for scarce iron and survive iron deficiency. In conclusion, we show that iron deficiency could disturb haematopoiesis at an early embryonic stage by compromising more severely the survival, proliferation and differentiation of definitive haematopoietic progenitors compared to restricted erythroid progenitors.",Atlas of RNA sequencing profiles for normal human tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015567,Scientific data,2019 05 14,"Comprehensive analysis of molecular pathology requires a collection of reference samples representing normal tissues from healthy donors. For the available limited collections of normal tissues from postmortal donors, there is a problem of data incompatibility, as different datasets generated using different experimental platforms often cannot be merged in a single panel. Here, we constructed and deposited the gene expression database of normal human tissues based on uniformly screened original sequencing data. In total, 142 solid tissue samples representing 20 organs were taken from post-mortal human healthy donors of different age killed in road accidents no later than 36 hours after death. Blood samples were taken from 17 healthy volunteers. We then compared them with the 758 transcriptomic profiles taken from the other databases. We found that overall 463 biosamples showed tissue-specific rather than platform- or database-specific clustering and could be aggregated in a single database termed Oncobox Atlas of Normal Tissue Expression (ANTE). Our data will be useful to all those working with the analysis of human gene expression."

Root lignin is a key driver of root decomposition, which in turn is a fundamental component of the terrestrial carbon cycle and increasingly in the focus of ecologists and global climate change research. However, measuring lignin content is labor-intensive and therefore not well-suited to handle the large sample sizes of most ecological studies. To overcome this bottleneck, we explored the applicability of high-throughput near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements to predict fine root lignin content. 2. We measured fine root lignin content in 73 plots of a field biodiversity experiment containing a pool of 60 grassland species using the Acetylbromid (AcBr) method. To predict lignin content, we established NIRS calibration and prediction models based on partial least square regression (PLSR) resulting in moderate prediction accuracies (RPD = 1.96, R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 3.79). 3. In a second step, we combined PLSR with spectral variable selection. This considerably improved model performance (RPD = 2.67, R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 2.78) and enabled us to identify chemically meaningful wavelength regions for lignin prediction. 4. We identified 38 case studies in a literature survey and quantified median model performance parameters from these studies as a benchmark for our results. Our results show that the combination Acetylbromid extracted lignin and NIR spectroscopy is well suited for the rapid analysis of root lignin contents in herbaceous plant species even if the amount of sample is limited.",Functional Printing of Conductive Silver-Nanowire Photopolymer Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015552,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"We investigated the fabrication and functional behaviour of conductive silver-nanowire-polymer composites for prospective use in printing applications. Silver-nanowires with an aspect ratio of up to 1000 were synthesized using the polyol route and embedded in a UV-curable and printable polymer matrix. Sheet resistances in the composites down to 13 Ω/sq at an optical transmission of about 90% were accomplished. The silver-nanowire composite morphology and network structure was investigated by electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, profilometry, ellipsometry as well as surface sensitive X-ray scattering. By implementing different printing applications, we demonstrate that our silver nanowires can be used in different polymer composites. On the one hand, we used a tough composite for a 2D-printed film as top contact on a solar cell. On the other hand, a flexible composite was applied for a 3D-printed flexible capacitor.",A 3.8 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of a small protein bound to an imaging scaffold.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015551,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Proteins smaller than about 50 kDa are currently too small to be imaged at high resolution by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), leaving most protein molecules in the cell beyond the reach of this powerful structural technique. Here we use a designed protein scaffold to bind and symmetrically display 12 copies of a small 26 kDa protein, green fluorescent protein (GFP). We show that the bound cargo protein is held rigidly enough to visualize it at a resolution of 3.8 Å by cryo-EM, where specific structural features of the protein are visible. The designed scaffold is modular and can be modified through modest changes in its amino acid sequence to bind and display diverse proteins for imaging, thus providing a general method to break through the lower size limitation in cryo-EM.",Optical intrinsic signal imaging with optogenetics reveals functional cortico-cortical connectivity at the columnar level in living macaques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015550,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Despite extensive research on primate cognitive function, understanding how anatomical connectivity at a neural circuit level relates to information transformation across different cortical areas remains primitive. New technology is needed to visualize inter-areal anatomical connectivity in living monkeys and to tie this directly to neurophysiological function. Here, we developed a novel method to investigate this structure-function relationship, by combining optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) with optogenetic stimulation in living monkeys (opto-OISI). The method involves expressing channelrhodophsin-2 in one area (source) followed by optical imaging of optogenetic activations in the other area (target). We successfully demonstrated the potential of the method with interhemispheric columnar projection patterns between V1/V2 border regions. Unlike the combination of optogenetics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (opto-fMRI), opto-OISI has the advantage of enabling us to detect responses of small clusters of neurons, even if the clusters are sparsely distributed. We suggest that opto-OISI can be a powerful approach to understanding cognitive function at the neural circuit level, directly linking inter-areal circuitry to fine-scale structure and function.",Polysaccharides from Trifolium repens L. extracted by different methods and extraction condition optimization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015549,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Four different extraction methods, including hot water extraction (HWE), ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE), enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE) and ultrasonic-enzyme-assisted extraction (UEAE), were applied to extract polysaccharides from Trifolium repens L. (TRPs). In addition, response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to optimize the extraction conditions of TRPs. The results showed that different extraction methods had significant effects on the extraction yields and antioxidant activities of TRPs. TRPs extracted by the EAE method (10.57%) and UEAE method (10.62%) had significantly higher extraction yields than TRPs extracted by the HWE method (8.35%) and UAE method (9.43%) (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the extraction yields of the EAE method and UEAE method (P > 0.05). TRPs extracted by the EAE method had a higher content of uronic acid and exhibited better antioxidant capacities. Therefore, EAE was selected as the optimal extraction method to extract TRPs. The optimal extraction conditions of EAE to extract TPRs were liquid-solid ratio 30 mL/g, enzymolysis time 87 min, enzyme-complex dosage 1.6% and pH 6, leading to a TRPs yield of 13.15%.",Exergy valorization of a water electrolyzer and CO2 hydrogenation tandem system for hydrogen and methane production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015548,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"In this work, we introduce a water electrolysis and CO2 hydrogenation tandem system which focuses on methane generation. The concept consists of a water electrolyzer thermally coupled to a CO2 hydrogenation reactor, where the power required to generate hydrogen comes from renewable energy. A thermodynamic analysis of the tandem system was carried out. Our analysis exposes that it is possible to increase the exergy efficiency of the water electrolyzer and CO2 hydrogenation system by thermal coupling, where the thermal energy required to split water into H2 and O2 during the electrolysis process is compensated by the heat generated during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Here, the conditions at which high exergy efficiency can be achieved were identified.",Correlative 3D Imaging and Microfluidic Modelling of Human Pulmonary Lymphatics using Immunohistochemistry and High-resolution μCT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015547,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Lung lymphatics maintain fluid homoeostasis by providing a drainage system that returns fluid, cells and metabolites to the circulatory system. The 3D structure of the human pulmonary lymphatic network is essential to lung function, but it is poorly characterised. Image-based 3D mathematical modelling of pulmonary lymphatic microfluidics has been limited by the lack of accurate and representative image geometries. This is due to the microstructural similarity of the lymphatics to the blood vessel network, the lack of lymphatic-specific biomarkers, the technical limitations associated with image resolution in 3D, and sectioning artefacts present in 2D techniques. We present a method that combines lymphatic specific (D240 antibody) immunohistochemistry (IHC), optimised high-resolution X-ray microfocus computed tomography (μCT) and finite-element mathematical modelling to assess the function of human peripheral lung tissue. The initial results identify lymphatic heterogeneity within and between lung tissue. Lymphatic vessel volume fraction and fractal dimension significantly decreases away from the lung pleural surface (p < 0.001, n = 25 and p < 0.01, n = 20, respectively). Microfluidic modelling successfully shows that in lung tissue the fluid derived from the blood vessels drains through the interstitium into the lymphatic vessel network and this drainage is different in the subpleural space compared to the intralobular space. When comparing lung tissue from health and disease, human pulmonary lymphatics were significantly different across five morphometric measures used in this study (p ≤ 0.0001). This proof of principle study establishes a new engineering technology and workflow for further studies of pulmonary lymphatics and demonstrates for the first time the combination of correlative μCT and IHC to enable 3D mathematical modelling of human lung microfluidics at micrometre resolution.",A novel retroviral vector system to analyze expression from mRNA with retained introns using fluorescent proteins and flow cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015546,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"The ability to overcome cellular restrictions that exist for the export and translation of mRNAs with retained introns is a requirement for the replication of retroviruses and also for the expression of many mRNA isoforms transcribed from cellular genes. In some cases, RNA structures have been identified in the mRNA that directly interact with cellular factors to promote the export and expression of isoforms with retained introns. In other cases, a viral protein is also required to act as an adapter. In this report we describe a novel vector system that allows measurement of the ability of cis- and trans-acting factors to promote the export and translation of mRNAs with retained introns. One reporter vector used in this system is derived from an HIV proviral clone engineered to express two different fluorescent proteins from spliced and unspliced transcripts. The ratio of fluorescent signals is a measurement of the efficiency of export and translation. A second vector utilizes a third fluorescent protein to measure the expression of viral export proteins that interact with some of the export elements. Both vectors can be packaged into viral particles and be used to transduce cells, allowing expression at physiological levels from the integrated vector.",Genome-wide patterns of population structure and association mapping of nut-related traits in Persian walnut populations from Iran using the Axiom J. regia 700K SNP array.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015545,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Persian plateau (including Iran) is considered as one of the primary centers of origin of walnut. Sampling walnut trees originating from this arena and exploiting the capabilities of next-generation sequencing (NGS) can provide new insights into the degree of genetic variation across the walnut genome. The present study aimed to explore the population structure and genomic variation of an Iranian collection of Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) and identify loci underlying the variation in nut and kernel related traits using the new Axiom J. regia 700K SNP genotyping array. We genotyped a diversity panel including 95 walnut genotypes from eight Iranian provinces with a variety of climate zones. A majority of the SNPs (323,273, 53.03%) fell into the ""Poly High Resolution"" class of polymorphisms, which includes the highest quality variants. Genetic structure assessment, using several approaches, divided the Iranian walnut panel into four principal clusters, reflecting their geographic partitioning. We observed high genetic variation across all of the populations (HO = 0.34 and HE = 0.38). The overall level of genetic differentiation among populations was moderate (FST = 0.07). However, the Semnan population showed high divergence from the other Iranian populations (on average FST = 0.12), most likely due to its geographical isolation. Based on parentage analysis, the level of relatedness was very low among the Iranian walnuts examined, reflecting the geographical distance between the Iranian provinces considered in our study. Finally, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS), identifying 55 SNPs significantly associated with nut and kernel-related traits. In conclusion, by applying the novel Axiom J. regia 700K SNP array we uncovered new unexplored genetic diversity and identified significant marker-trait associations for nut-related traits in Persian walnut that will be useful for future breeding programs in Iran and other countries.",A novel wireless brain stimulation device for long-term use in freely moving mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015544,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used in clinical settings for many years despite a paucity of knowledge related to the anatomical and functional substrates that lead to benefits and/or side-effects in various disease contexts. In order to maximize the potential of this approach in humans, a better understanding of its mechanisms of action is absolutely necessary. However, the existing micro-stimulators available for pre-clinical models, are limited by the lack of relevant small size devices. This absence prevents sustained chronic stimulation and real time monitoring of animals during stimulation, parameters that are critical for comparison to clinical findings. We therefore sought to develop and refine a novel small wireless micro-stimulator as a means by which to study consequent behavioural to molecular changes in experimental animals. Building on previous work from our group, we refined our implantable micro-stimulator prototype, to be easily combined with intravital 2-photon imaging. Using our prototype we were able to replicate the well described clinical benefits on motor impairment in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease in addition to capturing microglia dynamics live during stimulation. We believe this new device represents a useful tool for performing pre-clinical studies as well as dissecting brain circuitry and function."

To date, little is known about the processes by which CKD worsens ischemic stroke. This work aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanism associated with ischemic stroke severity in an in vivo model of CKD. CKD was induced through right kidney cortical electrocautery in 8-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice followed by left total nephrectomy. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was performed 6 weeks after left nephrectomy. Twenty-four hours after tMCAO, the infarct volumes were significantly wider in CKD than in SHAM mice. CKD mice displayed decreased neuroscore, impaired ability to remain on rotarod device, weaker muscular strength and decreased prehensile score. Apoptosis, neuronal loss, glial cells recruitment and microglia/macrophages M1 signature genes CD32, CD86, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP1 and iNOS were significantly increased within ischemic lesions of CKD mice. This effect was associated with decreased AMP kinase phosphorylation and increased activation of the NFΚB pathway. Pharmacological targeting of AMP kinase activity, which is known to block microglia/macrophages M1 polarization, appears promising to improve stroke recovery in CKD.",Iroquois transcription factor irx2a is required for multiciliated and transporter cell fate decisions during zebrafish pronephros development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015532,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"The genetic regulation of nephron patterning during kidney organogenesis remains poorly understood. Nephron tubules in zebrafish are composed of segment populations that have unique absorptive and secretory roles, as well as multiciliated cells (MCCs) that govern fluid flow. Here, we report that the transcription factor iroquois 2a (irx2a) is requisite for zebrafish nephrogenesis. irx2a transcripts localized to the developing pronephros and maturing MCCs, and loss of function altered formation of two segment populations and reduced MCC number. Interestingly, irx2a deficient embryos had reduced expression of an essential MCC gene ets variant 5a (etv5a), and were rescued by etv5a overexpression, supporting the conclusion that etv5a acts downstream of irx2a to control MCC ontogeny. Finally, we found that retinoic acid (RA) signaling affects the irx2a expression domain in renal progenitors, positioning irx2a downstream of RA. In sum, this work reveals new roles for irx2a during nephrogenesis, identifying irx2a as a crucial connection between RA signaling, segmentation, and the control of etv5a mediated MCC formation. Further investigation of the genetic players involved in these events will enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways that govern renal development, which can be used help create therapeutics to treat congenital and acquired kidney diseases.",Psychological Sleep Interventions for Migraine and Tension-Type Headache: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015531,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Disordered sleep, poor sleep quality, and insufficient or excessive sleep duration are known triggers of primary and secondary headaches. Given this, it is plausible that improving sleep will subsequently reduce headache activity. We report a systematic review of the literature, examining studies utilising psychological sleep interventions for the treatment of migraine and tension-type headache. PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central were searched, using terms pertaining to psychological sleep interventions and headaches. Meta-analysis was performed for two outcome measures; headache frequency, and headache intensity. 103 studies were retrieved, of which 55 were duplicates. After completing reviews, three studies were retained. An additional eligible study was published after the initial search, and was found via monthly update searches, resulting in a total of four included studies. The effects of psychological sleep interventions (and in one study, combined with drug therapy) significantly reduced headache frequency and headache intensity. Three studies improved various sleep outcomes such as duration, efficiency, and excessive sleepiness. Psychological sleep interventions improve headache frequency and sleep, however there is conflicting evidence for the effect on headache intensity between studies. Limitations include the small number of studies conducted to date. Despite this, the notable improvements in headaches and sleep achieved after psychological sleep interventions indicates further research on this promising topic is warranted.",Body mass index in young men and risk of inflammatory bowel disease through adult life: A population-based Danish cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015530,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Body mass index (BMI) is associated with increased future risk of inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) particularly Crohn's disease(CD), where associations with high and low BMI have been observed.

A total of 377,957 men born during 1939-1959, with BMI measured at draft boards at mean age 19, were followed from 1977, or time of examination, to end of 2015. Risk of IBD was assessed using Cox regression. During 13 million person-years of follow-up, 1,523 developed CD and 3,323 UC. Using normal weight as reference, for CD the following HRs were observed: BMI < 18.5, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12-1.62, BMI 25-29.9; 0.83; 95% CI, 0.68-1.02. and BMI > 30 1.20; 95% CI, 0.75-1.90). The increased risk of CD in underweight was maintained up until age 60 not explained by known effects of smoking. For UC, minor inverse associations were observed. Restricted cubic splines revealed a U-shape association between BMI and CD, but not UC. Low BMI of men entering adult life is associated with an increased incidence of CD and UC up to 40 years later.",Multifunctional CRISPR-Cas9 with engineered immunosilenced human T cell epitopes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015529,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"The CRISPR-Cas9 system has raised hopes for developing personalized gene therapies for complex diseases. Its application for genetic and epigenetic therapies in humans raises concerns over immunogenicity of the bacterially derived Cas9 protein.

We also report pre-existing human CD8+T cell immunity in the majority of healthy individuals screened. We identify two immunodominant SpCas9 T cell epitopes for HLA-A*02:01 using an enhanced prediction algorithm that incorporates T cell receptor contact residue hydrophobicity and HLA binding and evaluated them by T cell assays using healthy donor PBMCs. In a proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate that Cas9 protein can be modified to eliminate immunodominant epitopes through targeted mutation while preserving its function and specificity.

Earlier studies have focused on a limited number of genes involved in color determination; however, the complete set of trait determinants are still not well known. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify and characterize intricate interactions between genes that cause complex coat color variation in Changthangi Pashmina goats, producer of finest and costly commercial animal fiber. We systematically identified differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs from black, brown and white Pashmina goat skin samples by using RNA-sequencing technique. A pairwise comparison of black, white and brown skin samples yielded 2479 significantly dysregulated genes (2422 mRNA and 57 lncRNAs). Differentially expressed genes were enriched in melanin biosynthesis, melanocyte differentiation, developmental pigmentation, melanosome transport activities GO terms.

For the sake of exploring novel medical applications, both antibiotics were loaded into magnesium aluminium layer double hydroxide (Mg-Al)/LDH nanocomposite through the co-precipitation method. The synthesized materials were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, particle size analysis, FESEM and HRTEM. Acute toxicological studies were conducted using median lethal dose LD50, where a total number of 98 rats (200-150 gm) of both sexes were used. An experimental wound was aseptically incised on the anterior-dorsal side of each rat, while 98% of pure medical ethanol was used for ulcer induction. Acute toxicity, wound closure rate, healing percentages, ulcer index, protective rate and histopathological studies were investigated. Antibiotic Nanocomposites has significantly prevented ulcer formation and improved wound healing process to take shorter time than that of the typical processes, when compared with that of same drugs in microscale systems or commercial standard drugs. These results were confirmed by the histopathological findings. By converting it into the Nanoform, which is extremely important, especially with commonly used antibiotics, novel pharmacological properties were acquired from the antibiotics. The safe uses of DOX/LDH and AMOX/LDH Nanocomposites in this study were approved for biomedical applications.",Binding studies of a putative C. pseudotuberculosis target protein from Vitamin B12 Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015525,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor for various metabolic reactions important in living organisms. The Vitamin B12 biosynthesis is restricted to prokaryotes, which means, all eukaryotic organisms must acquire this molecule through diet. This study presents the investigation of Vitamin B12 metabolism and the characterization of precorrin-4 C(11)-methyltransferase (CobM), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of Vitamin B12 in Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. The analysis of the C. pseudotuberculosis genome identified two Vitamin B12-dependent pathways, which can be strongly affected by a disrupted vitamin metabolism. Molecular dynamics, circular dichroism, and NMR-STD experiments identified regions in CobM that undergo conformational changes after s-adenosyl-L-methionine binding to promote the interaction of precorrin-4, a Vitamin B12 precursor. The binding of s-adenosyl-L-methionine was examined along with the competitive binding of adenine, dATP, and suramin. Based on fluorescence spectroscopy experiments the dissociation constant for the four ligands and the target protein could be determined; SAM (1.4 ± 0.7 µM), adenine (17.8 ± 1.5 µM), dATP (15.8 ± 2.0 µM), and Suramin (6.3 ± 1.1 µM). The results provide rich information for future investigations of potential drug targets within the C. pseudotuberculosis's Vitamin B12 metabolism and related pathways to reduce the pathogen's virulence in its hosts.",Visual Performance in Eyes Undergoing Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Keratoplasty for Advanced Keratoconus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015524,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"This study was aimed to compare visual performance in eyes having femtosecond laser-assisted keratoplasty (FLAK) for grade 4 keratoconus and keratoconic eyes according to the Amsler-Krumeich classification. We comprised 15 eyes of 15 patients undergoing FLAK for grade 4 keratoconus and 69 of 69 keratoconic patients (grade 1; 26 eyes, 2; 17 eyes, 3; 10 eyes, and 4; 16 eyes), and compared best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), corneal astigmatism (CA), corneal densitometry (CD), and corneal higher-order aberrations (CHOAs) using the Scheimpflug rotating camera. BSCVA in the post-FLAK group was significantly better than that in grade 3 or 4 group, but not than that in grade 1 or 2 group. CA was significantly lower than that in grade 3 or 4 group, but not than that in grade 1 or 2 group. CD was significantly higher than that in grade 1, 2, and 3 group, and significantly lower than that in grade 4 group. CHOAs were significantly lower than that in grade 3 or 4 group, but not than that in grade 1 or 2 group.

The main cause of death is not the primary tumor, but instead the spread of tumor cells to distant sites. The aim of the present study was to examine a new method for the detection of cancer cells in aqueous medium using bioimpedance spectroscopy assisted with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP's) exposure to a constant magnetic field. The spectroscopic patterns were identified for three breast cancer cell lines. Each BC cell line represents a different pathologic stage: the early stage (MCF-7), invasive phase (MDA-MB-231) and metastasis (SK-BR-3). For this purpose, bioimpedance measurements were carried out at a certain frequency range with the aid of nanoprobes, consisting of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coupled to a monoclonal antibody. The antibody was specific for the predominant cell surface protein for each cell line, which was identified by using RT-qPCR and flow cytometry. Accordingly, EpCAM corresponds to MCF-7, MUC-1 to MDA-MB-231, and HER-2 to SK-BR-3. Despite their low concentrations, BC cells could be detected by impedance spectroscopy. Hence, this methodology should permit the monitoring of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and therefore help to prevent recurrences and metastatic processes during BC treatment."

One of the major processes contributing to the development of CM is an excess of host inflammatory cytokines. Recently K+ signaling has emerged as an important mediator of the inflammatory response to infection; we therefore investigated whether mice carrying an ENU induced activation of the electroneutral K+ channel KCC1 had an altered response to Plasmodium berghei. Here we show that Kcc1M935K/M935K mice are protected from the development of experimental cerebral malaria, and that this protection is associated with an increased CD4+ and TNFa response. This is the first description of a K+ channel affecting the development of experimental cerebral malaria.",Egocentrically-stable discriminative stimulus-based spatial navigation in mice: implementation and comparison with allocentric cues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015510,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Animals are capable of using visual cues to find the correct route during navigation. These visual cues, which contain spatial information on the direction towards the goal point, are perceived either allocentrically or egocentrically. In this study, we examined how navigating with these two types of visual cues affects the learning processes of rodents. To present egocentrically-stable spatial cues, we devised a head-mounted device that provided discriminative orientation cues that indicated the correct choice at a fork within a double Y-maze. For allocentrically-stable spatial cues, LEDs serving as external route-mark cues were attached to the walls of the double Y-maze and illuminated to indicate the correct pathway. To rule out the possibility of the mice using extra-maze cues, we rotated the entire maze and used different start and goal sites for every trial. Our results revealed that mice using egocentric cues and external route-mark cues both showed a sigmoidal learning process for spatial navigation and that external route mark-based learning, surprisingly, learned faster than egocentric stimulus-based learning in egocentric space.",Mesenchymal Stem Cells Increase Alveolar Differentiation in Lung Progenitor Organoid Cultures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015509,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Lung epithelial cell damage and dysfunctional repair play a role in the development of lung disease. Effective repair likely requires the normal functioning of alveolar stem/progenitor cells. For example, we have shown in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) protect against hyperoxic lung injury at least in part by increasing the number of Epcam+ Sca-1+ distal lung epithelial cells. These cells are capable of differentiating into both small airway (CCSP+) and alveolar (SPC+) epithelial cells in three-dimensional (3D) organoid cultures. To further understand the interactions between MSC and distal lung epithelial cells, we added MSC to lung progenitor 3D cultures. MSC stimulated Epcam+ Sca-1+ derived organoid formation, increased alveolar differentiation and decreased self-renewal. MSC-conditioned media was sufficient to promote alveolar organoid formation, demonstrating that soluble factors secreted by MSC are likely responsible for the response. This work provides strong evidence of a direct effect of MSC-secreted factors on lung progenitor cell differentiation.",CNspector: a web-based tool for visualisation and clinical diagnosis of copy number variation from next generation sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015508,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Next Generation Sequencing is now routinely used in the practice of diagnostic pathology to detect clinically relevant somatic and germline sequence variations in patient samples. However, clinical assessment of copy number variations (CNVs) and large-scale structural variations (SVs) is still challenging. While tools exist to estimate both, their results are typically presented separately in tables or static plots which can be difficult to read and are unable to show the context needed for clinical interpretation and reporting. We have addressed this problem with CNspector, a multi-scale interactive browser that shows CNVs in the context of other relevant genomic features to enable fast and effective clinical reporting. We illustrate the utility of CNspector at different genomic scales across a variety of sample types in a range of case studies. We show how CNspector can be used for diagnosis and reporting of exon-level deletions, focal gene-level amplifications, chromosome and chromosome arm level amplifications/deletions and in complex genomic rearrangements. CNspector is a web-based clinical variant browser tailored to the clinical application of next generation sequencing for CNV assessment. We have demonstrated the utility of this interactive software in typical applications across a range of tissue types and disease contexts encountered in the context of diagnostic pathology.

However, a limited number of studies have reported on the association between clinicopathologic features and thyroid dysfunction in patients with NS. We retrospectively studied 317 patients who had been definitively diagnosed with NS. The NS patients with thyroid dysfunction showed higher urine protein, creatinine and lipid levels and lower albumin and hemoglobin than those with normal thyroid function, with no significant differences of pathological types. After dividing thyroid dysfunction groups into five subgroups, interestingly, membranous nephropathy was the most common pathologic type, both in normal thyroid group and in subclinical hypothyroidism group (40.4% and 46.7%, respectively), followed by minimal change disease (28.1% and 21.7%, respectively); while in the hypothyroid, low T3, and low T3T4 groups minimal change disease is now the leading type (48.8%, 33.3% and 38.6%, respectively). High levels of urinary protein, creatinine, cholesterol, and platelets were independent risk factors predicting thyroid dysfunction, while higher albumin and hemoglobin were protective factors. We demonstrated that the type of renal pathology was different among NS patients in different thyroid dysfunction subgroups. Interpretation of the interactions between thyroid and renal function is a challenge for clinicians involved in the treatment of patients with NS.",Characterizing pre-transplant and post-transplant kidney rejection risk by B cell immune repertoire sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015506,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"Studying immune repertoire in the context of organ transplant provides important information on how adaptive immunity may contribute and modulate graft rejection. Here we characterize the peripheral blood immune repertoire of individuals before and after kidney transplant using B cell receptor sequencing in a longitudinal clinical study. Individuals who develop rejection after transplantation have a more diverse immune repertoire before transplant, suggesting a predisposition for post-transplant rejection risk. Additionally, over 2 years of follow-up, patients who develop rejection demonstrate a specific set of expanded clones that persist after the rejection. While there is an overall reduction of peripheral B cell diversity, likely due to increased general immunosuppression exposure in this cohort, the detection of specific IGHV gene usage across all rejecting patients supports that a common pool of immunogenic antigens may drive post-transplant rejection. Our findings may have clinical implications for the prediction and clinical management of kidney transplant rejection.",Particle velocity controls phase transitions in contagion dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015505,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Interactions often require the proximity between particles. The movement of particles, thus, drives the change of the neighbors which are located in their proximity, leading to a sequence of interactions. In pathogenic contagion, infections occur through proximal interactions, but at the same time, the movement facilitates the co-location of different strains. We analyze how the particle velocity impacts on the phase transitions on the contagion process of both a single infection and two cooperative infections. First, we identify an optimal velocity (close to half of the interaction range normalized by the recovery time) associated with the largest epidemic threshold, such that decreasing the velocity below the optimal value leads to larger outbreaks. Second, in the cooperative case, the system displays a continuous transition for low velocities, which becomes discontinuous for velocities of the order of three times the optimal velocity. Finally, we describe these characteristic regimes and explain the mechanisms driving the dynamics.",Insights into protein sequencing with an α-Hemolysin nanopore by atomistic simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015503,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Single molecule protein sequencing would represent a disruptive burst in proteomic research with important biomedical impacts. Due to their success in DNA sequencing, nanopore based devices have been recently proposed as possible tools for the sequencing of peptide chains. One of the open questions in nanopore protein sequencing concerns the ability of such devices to provide different signals for all the 20 standard amino acids. Here, using equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we estimated the pore clogging in α-Hemolysin nanopore associated to 20 different homopeptides, one for each standard amino acid. Our results show that pore clogging is affected by amino acid volume, hydrophobicity and net charge. The equilibrium estimations are also supported by non-equilibrium runs for calculating the current blockades for selected homopeptides. Finally, we discuss the possibility to modify the α-Hemolysin nanopore, cutting a portion of the barrel region close to the trans side, to reduce spurious signals and, hence, to enhance the sensitivity of the nanopore.",Attenuation of radiation toxicity by the phosphine resistance factor dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015501,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Phosphine gas is an excellent fumigant for disinfesting stored grain of insect pests, but heavy reliance on phosphine has led to resistance in grain pests that threatens its efficacy. Phosphine-resistance was previously reported to be mediated by the enzyme DLD. Here we explore the relationship between phosphine toxicity and genotoxic treatments with the goal of understanding how phosphine works. Specifically, we utilized mutant lines either sensitive or resistant to phosphine, gamma irradiation or UV exposure. The phosphine-resistance mutation in the enzyme of energy metabolism, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase exhibited cross-resistance to UV and ionizing radiation. Two radiation-sensitive mutants that are defective in DNA repair as well as a mutant that is defective in the activation of the DAF-16 stress response transcription factor all exhibit sensitivity to phosphine that exceeds the sensitivity of the wild type control. A radiation resistance mutation in cep-1, the p53 orthologue, that is deficient in double strand break repair of DNA and is also deficient in apoptosis causes radiation-resistance results but sensitivity toward phosphine.","Mice lacking Casp1, Ifngr and Nos2 genes exhibit altered depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour, and gut microbiome composition.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015500,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Converging evidence supports the involvement of pro-inflammatory pathways and the gut microbiome in major depressive disorder (MDD). Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that decreasing pro-inflammatory signaling may provide clinical benefit in MDD. In this study, we used the chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm to assess whether mice lacking the pro-inflammatory caspase 1, interferon gamma-receptor, and nitric oxide synthase (Casp1, Ifngr, Nos2)-/- present altered depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour at baseline and in response to CUS. In comparison to wild-type (wt) mice, (Casp1, Ifngr, Nos2)-/- mice displayed decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviour, and increased hedonic-like behaviour and locomotor activity at baseline, and resistance to developing anhedonic-like behaviour and a heightened emotional state following stress. Plasma levels of ACTH and CORT did not differ between the triple knockout and wt mice following stress. The faecal microbiome of (Casp1, Ifngr, Nos2)-/- mice differed from that of wt mice at baseline and displayed reduced changes in response to chronic stress. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous deficit in multiple pro-inflammatory pathways has antidepressant-like effects at baseline, and confers resilience to stress-induced anhedonic-like behaviour. Moreover, accompanying changes in the gut microbiome composition suggest that CASP1, IFNGR and NOS2 play a role in maintaining microbiome homeostasis."

Surface adenosine receptors trigger cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation in neutrophils, and this mechanism has been proposed to regulate NETosis in some contexts. Here we report that selective agonism of the adenosine A2A receptor (CGS21680) suppresses aPL Ab-mediated NETosis in protein kinase A-dependent fashion. CGS21680 also reduces thrombosis in the inferior vena cavae of both control mice and mice administered aPL Abs. The antithrombotic medication dipyridamole is known to potentiate adenosine signaling by increasing extracellular concentrations of adenosine and interfering with the breakdown of cAMP. Like CGS21680, dipyridamole suppresses aPL Ab-mediated NETosis via the adenosine A2A receptor and mitigates venous thrombosis in mice. In summary, these data suggest an anti-inflammatory therapeutic paradigm in APS, which may extend to thrombotic disease in the general population.",Gestational exposure to an epidemiologically defined mixture of phthalates leads to gonadal dysfunction in mouse offspring of both sexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015488,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"The increasing concern for the reproductive toxicity of abundantly used phthalates requires reliable tools for exposure risk assessment to mixtures of chemicals, based on real life human exposure and disorder-associated epidemiological evidence. We herein used a mixture of four phthalate monoesters (33% mono-butyl phthalate, 16% mono-benzyl phthalate, 21% mono-ethyl hexyl phthalate, and 30% mono-isononyl phthalate), detected in 1st trimester urine of 194 pregnant women and identified as bad actors for a shorter anogenital distance (AGD) in their baby boys. Mice were treated with 0, 0.26, 2.6 and 13 mg/kg/d of the mixture, corresponding to 0x, 10x, 100x, 500x levels detected in the pregnant women. Adverse outcomes detected in the reproductive system of the offspring in pre-puberty and adulthood included reduced AGD index and gonadal weight, changes in gonadal histology and altered expression of key regulators of gonadal growth and steroidogenesis. Most aberrations were apparent in both sexes, though more pronounced in males, and exhibited a non-monotonic pattern. The phthalate mixture directly affected expression of steroidogenesis as demonstrated in a relevant in vitro model. The detected adversities at exposures close to the levels detected in pregnant women, raise concern on the existing safety limits for early-life human exposures and emphasizes the need for re-evaluation of the exposure risk.",A concept for single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging via orthogonally polarized excitation lattices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015487,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"The deconvolution of widefield fluorescence images provides only guesses of spatial frequency information along the optical axis due to the so called missing cone in the optical transfer function. Retaining the single-shot imaging speed of deconvolution microscopy while gaining access to missing cone information is thus highly desirable for microscopy of volumetric samples. Here, we present a concept that superimposes two orthogonally polarized excitation lattices with a phase-shift of p between them. In conjunction with a non-iterative image reconstruction algorithm this permits the restoration of missing cone information. We show how fluorescence anisotropy could be used as a method to encode and decode the patterns simultaneously and develop a rigorous theoretical framework for the method. Through in-silico experiments and imaging of fixed biological cells on a structured illumination microscope that emulates the proposed setup we validate the feasibility of the method.",RUNX3 regulates cell cycle-dependent chromatin dynamics by functioning as a pioneer factor of the restriction-point.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015486,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"The cellular decision regarding whether to undergo proliferation or death is made at the restriction (R)-point, which is disrupted in nearly all tumors. The identity of the molecular mechanisms that govern the R-point decision is one of the fundamental issues in cell biology. We found that early after mitogenic stimulation, RUNX3 binds to its target loci, where it opens chromatin structure by sequential recruitment of Trithorax group proteins and cell-cycle regulators to drive cells to the R-point. Soon after, RUNX3 closes these loci by recruiting Polycomb repressor complexes, causing the cell to pass through the R-point toward S phase. If the RAS signal is constitutively activated, RUNX3 inhibits cell cycle progression by maintaining R-point-associated genes in an open structure. Our results identify RUNX3 as a pioneer factor for the R-point and reveal the molecular mechanisms by which appropriate chromatin modifiers are selectively recruited to target loci for appropriate R-point decisions.",Complex effects of atmospheric parameters on acute cardiovascular diseases and major cardiovascular risk factors: data from the CardiometeorologySM study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015485,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Several studies have examined the cardiovascular effects of atmospheric parameters as separate factors; however, few have investigated atmospheric parameters' joint effects. We aim to explore the joint effects of atmospheric parameters on acute cardiovascular diseases (ACVDs) and on major cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs). We correlated all ACVD admissions with major CRFs and local atmospheric conditions during a 5-year study period. A seasonal variation was detected in a higher incidence rate during cold atmospheric conditions. There were significant incidence relative ratios, including: 1.140 (95% CI [1.020, 1.283]) for daily temperature change (≥5 °C); 0.991 (95% CI [0.988, 0.994]) for average daily temperature; and 1.290 (95% CI [1.090, 1.599]) for the interaction of daily temperature change (≥5 °C) with humidity change (≥40%). We observed a significant association between the atmospheric parameters' joint effects and hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and previous ACVDs. Patients with diabetes had the highest significant incidence relative ratio at 2.429 (95% CI [1.088, 5.424]) for humidity-temperature interactions. Thus, the atmospheric parameters' joint effects play an important role as minor CRFs. These unfavourable atmospheric situations are predicted to increase the number of ACVDs mainly.

In this work, the capacity of tea waste and tea waste hybrids as inexpensive sorbents for uranium removal from water solutions was investigated. Composites of graphene oxide (GO) and tea waste (TW) exhibited a promising adsorption performance for uranium from aqueous solutions. The composites GOTW and magnetic rGO/Fe3O4/TW show high adsorption capacities (Qm (TW) = 91.72 mg/g, Qm (GOTW) = 111.61 mg/g and Qm (rGO/Fe3O4/TW) = 104.95 mg/g) and removal rates (~99%) for U(VI). The equilibrium sorption of the adsorbents fitted well to the Langmuir model, and the sorption rate fitted well to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that sorption was spontaneous and favourable. The prepared adsorbents were used for the removal of uranium from real water samples as well. The results revealed that GOTW and rGO/Fe3O4/TW can be used to remediate nuclear industrial effluent as a potential adsorbent.","2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin abolishes circadian regulation of hepatic metabolic activity in mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015483,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation is reported to alter the hepatic expression of circadian clock regulators, however the impact on clock-controlled metabolism has not been thoroughly investigated. This study examines the effects of AhR activation on hepatic transcriptome and metabolome rhythmicity in male C57BL/6 mice orally gavaged with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) every 4 days for 28 days. TCDD diminished the rhythmicity of several core clock regulators (e.g. Arntl, Clock, Nr1d1, Per1, Cry1, Nfil3) in a dose-dependent manner, involving either a ≥ 3.3-fold suppression in amplitude or complete loss of oscillation. Accordingly, protein levels (ARNTL, REV-ERBα, NFIL3) and genomic binding (ARNTL) of select regulators were reduced and arrhythmic following treatment. As a result, the oscillating expression of 99.6% of 5,636 clock-controlled hepatic genes was abolished including genes associated with the metabolism of lipids, glucose/glycogen, and heme. For example, TCDD flattened expression of the rate-limiting enzymes in both gluconeogenesis (Pck1) and glycogenesis (Gys2), consistent with the depletion and loss of rhythmicity in hepatic glycogen levels. Examination of polar hepatic extracts by untargeted mass spectrometry revealed that virtually all oscillating metabolites lost rhythmicity following treatment. Collectively, these results suggest TCDD disrupted circadian regulation of hepatic metabolism, altering metabolic efficiency and energy storage.",Identification of Prolyl isomerase Pin1 as a novel positive regulator of YAP/TAZ in breast cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015482,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"The Hippo signalling pathway plays very important roles in tumorigenesis, metastasis, organ size control, and drug resistance. Although, it has been shown that the two major components of Hippo pathway, YAP and TAZ, play very crucial role in tumorigenesis and drug resistance, the exact molecular mechanisms are still unknown. Recently, we have shown that the prolyl isomerase Pin1 regulates the activity of Hippo pathway through interaction with Hippo component LATS kinase. Thus we asked if Pin1 is also able to interact with other Hippo pathway components. Therefore, in order to investigate whether Pin1 can interacts with other components of the Hippo pathway, we performed GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays and have identified two Hippo components YAP and TAZ oncoproteins as novel binding partner of Pin1. We found that Pin1 interacts with YAP/TAZ in a phosphorylation-independent manner and WW domain of Pin1 is necessary for this interaction. Moreover, by using real time qRT-PCR, Cycloheximide chase, luciferase reporter, cell viability and soft agar assays, we have shown that Pin1 increases the tumorigenic and drug-resistant activity of YAP/TAZ through stabilization of YAP/TAZ at protein levels. Together, we have identified Pin1 as a novel positive regulator of YAP/TAZ in tumorigenesis and drug resistance of breast cancer cells. These findings will provide a significant contribution for targeting the Pin1-YAP/TAZ signaling for the successful treatment of tumorigenesis and drug resistance of breast and other cancers in the future.",Enhanced early-life nutrition upregulates cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression and Sertoli cell maturation in testes of pre-pubertal Holstein bulls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015481,Scientific reports,2019 05 05,"Well-fed prepuberal Holstein bulls had larger testes, earlier puberty, higher LH, testosterone and IGF-1, earlier and more proliferating and differentiating Sertoli cells, and greater sperm production potential.

The divergent growth via thiol-maleimide Michael coupling allows precise arrangements of the 0- and 1-bits in the uniform dendrimers. A protocol for calculating the storage capacity of non-linear binary digital dendrimer is established based on data matrix barcode, generated by the tandem mass spectrometry decoding and encryption.

Here we analyze the radiocarbon record of Iberia to reconstruct long-term changes in population levels and test different models of demographic growth during the Last Glacial-Interglacial transition. Our best fitting demographic model is composed of three phases. First, we document a regime of exponential population increase during the Late Glacial warming period (c.16.6-12.9 kya). Second, we identify a phase of sustained population contraction and stagnation, beginning with the cold episode of the Younger Dryas and continuing through the first half of the Early Holocene (12.9-10.2 kya). Finally, we report a third phase of density-dependent logistic growth (10.2-8 kya), with rapid population increase followed by stabilization. Our results support a population bottleneck hypothesis during the Last Glacial-Interglacial transition, providing a demographic context to interpret major shifts of prehistoric genetic groups in south-west Europe.",Impaired cortico-striatal excitatory transmission triggers epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015467,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"STXBP1 and SCN2A gene mutations are observed in patients with epilepsies, although the circuit basis remains elusive. Here, we show that mice with haplodeficiency for these genes exhibit absence seizures with spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) initiated by reduced cortical excitatory transmission into the striatum. Mice deficient for Stxbp1 or Scn2a in cortico-striatal but not cortico-thalamic neurons reproduce SWDs. In Stxbp1 haplodeficient mice, there is a reduction in excitatory transmission from the neocortex to striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). FSI activity transiently decreases at SWD onset, and pharmacological potentiation of AMPA receptors in the striatum but not in the thalamus suppresses SWDs. Furthermore, in wild-type mice, pharmacological inhibition of cortico-striatal FSI excitatory transmission triggers absence and convulsive seizures in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that impaired cortico-striatal excitatory transmission is a plausible mechanism that triggers epilepsy in Stxbp1 and Scn2a haplodeficient mice.",Conductivity and lithiophilicity gradients guide lithium deposition to mitigate short circuits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015466,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Lithium metal anodes hold great promise to enable high-energy battery systems. However, lithium dendrites at the interface between anode and separator pose risks of short circuits and fire, impeding the safe application. In contrast to conventional approaches of suppressing dendrites, here we show a deposition-regulating strategy by electrically passivating the top of a porous nickel scaffold and chemically activating the bottom of the scaffold to form conductivity/lithiophilicity gradients, whereby lithium is guided to deposit preferentially at the bottom of the anode, safely away from the separator. The resulting lithium anodes significantly reduce the probability of dendrite-induced short circuits. Crucially, excellent properties are also demonstrated at extremely high capacity (up to 40 mAh cm-2), high current density, and/or low temperatures (down to -15 °C), which readily induce dendrite shorts in particular. This facile and viable deposition-regulating strategy provides an approach to preferentially deposit lithium in safer positions, enabling a promising anode for next-generation lithium batteries.",YAP-independent mechanotransduction drives breast cancer progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015465,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Increased tissue stiffness is a driver of breast cancer progression. The transcriptional regulator YAP is considered a universal mechanotransducer, based largely on 2D culture studies. However, the role of YAP during in vivo breast cancer remains unclear. Here, we find that mechanotransduction occurs independently of YAP in breast cancer patient samples and mechanically tunable 3D cultures. Mechanistically, the lack of YAP activity in 3D culture and in vivo is associated with the absence of stress fibers and an order of magnitude decrease in nuclear cross-sectional area relative to 2D culture. This work highlights the context-dependent role of YAP in mechanotransduction, and establishes that YAP does not mediate mechanotransduction in breast cancer.",An inner activation gate controls TMEM16F phospholipid scrambling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015464,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Transmembrane protein 16F (TMEM16F) is an enigmatic Ca2+-activated phospholipid scramblase (CaPLSase) that passively transports phospholipids down their chemical gradients and mediates blood coagulation, bone development and viral infection. Despite recent advances in the structure and function understanding of TMEM16 proteins, how mammalian TMEM16 CaPLSases open and close, or gate their phospholipid permeation pathways remains unclear. Here we identify an inner activation gate, which is established by three hydrophobic residues, F518, Y563 and I612, in the middle of the phospholipid permeation pathway of TMEM16F-CaPLSase. Disrupting the inner gate profoundly alters TMEM16F phospholipid permeation. Lysine substitutions of F518 and Y563 even lead to constitutively active CaPLSases that bypass Ca2+-dependent activation. Strikingly, an analogous lysine mutation to TMEM16F-F518 in TMEM16A (L543K) is sufficient to confer CaPLSase activity to the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel (CaCC). The identification of an inner activation gate can help elucidate the gating and permeation mechanism of TMEM16 CaPLSases and channels.",Metabolic profiling of cancer cells reveals genome-wide crosstalk between transcriptional regulators and metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015463,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Transcriptional reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer. However, systematic approaches to study the role of transcriptional regulators (TRs) in mediating cancer metabolic rewiring are missing. Here, we chart a genome-scale map of TR-metabolite associations in human cells using a combined computational-experimental framework for large-scale metabolic profiling of adherent cell lines. By integrating intracellular metabolic profiles of 54 cancer cell lines with transcriptomic and proteomic data, we unraveled a large space of associations between TRs and metabolic pathways. We found a global regulatory signature coordinating glucose- and one-carbon metabolism, suggesting that regulation of carbon metabolism in cancer may be more diverse and flexible than previously appreciated. Here, we demonstrate how this TR-metabolite map can serve as a resource to predict TRs potentially responsible for metabolic transformation in patient-derived tumor samples, opening new opportunities in understanding disease etiology, selecting therapeutic treatments and in designing modulators of cancer-related TRs.",Sex-specific and pleiotropic effects underlying kidney function identified from GWAS meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015462,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health burden currently affecting 10-15% of adults worldwide. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a marker of kidney function is commonly used to diagnose CKD. We analyze eGFR data from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and Michigan Genomics Initiative and perform a GWAS meta-analysis with public summary statistics, more than doubling the sample size of previous meta-analyses. We identify 147 loci (53 novel) associated with eGFR, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, kidney development, cellular signaling, metabolism, and solute transport. Additionally, sex-stratified analysis identifies one locus with more significant effects in women than men. Using genetic risk scores constructed from these eGFR meta-analysis results, we show that associated variants are generally predictive of CKD with only modest improvements in detection compared with other known clinical risk factors. Collectively, these results yield additional insight into the genetic factors underlying kidney function and progression to CKD.",Meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies in neonates reveals widespread differential DNA methylation associated with birthweight.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015461,Nature communications,2019 06 10,"Birthweight is associated with health outcomes across the life course, DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism. In this meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of 8,825 neonates from 24 birth cohorts in the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium, we find that DNA methylation in neonatal blood is associated with birthweight at 914 sites, with a difference in birthweight ranging from -183 to 178 grams per 10% increase in methylation (PBonferroni < 1.06 x 10-7). In additional analyses in 7,278 participants, <1.3% of birthweight-associated differential methylation is also observed in childhood and adolescence, but not adulthood. Birthweight-related CpGs overlap with some Bonferroni-significant CpGs that were previously reported to be related to maternal smoking (55/914, p = 6.12 x 10-74) and BMI in pregnancy (3/914, p = 1.13x10-3), but not with those related to folate levels in pregnancy. Whether the associations that we observe are causal or explained by confounding or fetal growth influencing DNA methylation (i.e. reverse causality) requires further research.",Multi-level chirality in liquid crystals formed by achiral molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015460,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Complex materials often exhibit a hierarchical structure with an intriguing mechanism responsible for the 'propagation' of order from the molecular to the nano- or micro-scale level. In particular, the chirality of biological molecules such as nucleic acids and amino acids is responsible for the helical structure of DNA and proteins, which in turn leads to the lack of mirror symmetry of macro-bio-objects. To fully understand mechanisms of cross-level order transfer there is an intensive search for simpler artificial structures exhibiting hierarchical arrangement. Here we present complex systems built of achiral molecules that show four levels of structural chirality: layer chirality, helicity of a basic repeating unit, mesoscopic helix and helical filaments. The structures are identified by a combination of hard and soft x-ray diffraction measurements, optical studies and theoretical modelling. Similarly to many biological systems, the studied materials exhibit a coupling between chirality at different levels.",Unraveling the dislocation core structure at a van der Waals gap in bismuth telluride.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015459,Nature communications,2019 04 29,"Tetradymite-structured chalcogenides such as bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) are of significant interest for thermoelectric energy conversion and as topological insulators. Dislocations play a critical role during synthesis and processing of such materials and can strongly affect their functional properties. The dislocations between quintuple layers present special interest since their core structure is controlled by the van der Waals interactions between the layers. In this work, using atomic-resolution electron microscopy, we resolve the basal dislocation core structure in Bi2Te3, quantifying the disregistry of the atomic planes across the core. We show that, despite the existence of a stable stacking fault in the basal plane gamma surface, the dislocation core spreading is mainly due to the weak bonding between the layers, which leads to a small energy penalty for layer sliding parallel to the van der Waals gap. Calculations within a semidiscrete variational Peierls-Nabarro model informed by first-principles calculations support our experimental findings."

Here a comprehensive phase-field model is developed to investigate the electric, thermal, and mechanical effects in the breakdown process of polymer-based dielectrics. High-throughput simulations are performed for the P(VDF-HFP)-based nanocomposites filled with nanoparticles of different properties. Machine learning is conducted on the database from the high-throughput simulations to produce an analytical expression for the breakdown strength, which is verified by targeted experimental measurements and can be used to semiquantitatively predict the breakdown strength of the P(VDF-HFP)-based nanocomposites. The present work provides fundamental insights to the breakdown mechanisms of polymer nanocomposite dielectrics and establishes a powerful theoretical framework of materials design for optimizing their breakdown strength and thus maximizing their energy storage by screening suitable nanofillers.

Although Vpx is phosphorylated, it remains unclear whether such phosphorylation indeed regulates its activity toward SAMHD1. Here we identify the PIM family of serine/threonine protein kinases as the factors responsible for the phosphorylation of Vpx and the promotion of Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 counteraction. Integrated proteomics and subsequent functional analysis reveal that PIM family kinases, PIM1 and PIM3, phosphorylate HIV-2 Vpx at Ser13 and stabilize the interaction of Vpx with SAMHD1 thereby promoting ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of SAMHD1. Inhibition of the PIM kinases promotes the antiviral activity of SAMHD1, ultimately reducing viral replication. Our results highlight a new mode of virus-host cell interaction in which host PIM kinases facilitate promotion of viral infectivity by counteracting the host antiviral system, and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy involving restoration of SAMHD1-mediated antiviral response.",Multi-metal electrohydrodynamic redox 3D printing at the submicron scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015443,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"An extensive range of metals can be dissolved and re-deposited in liquid solvents using electrochemistry.

On-the-fly switching and mixing of two metals printed from a single multichannel nozzle facilitates a chemical feature size of <400 nm with a spatial resolution of 250 nm at printing speeds of up to 10 voxels per second.

Here, the as-prepared Co-MMPG, a Co(II) metal-metalloporphyrin gel, maintains enough conformational flexibility and features a binding pocket formed from the co-facial arrangement of the porphyrin rings, as elucidated through the combined studies of solid-state NMR and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The cooperativity between two Co(II) sites within the defined nanospace pocket facilitates the binding of different substrates with a favourable geometry thereby rendering Co-MMPG with excellent performance in the context of synergistic catalysis, especially for the kinetic control stereoselective reactions.

For efficient generation of free charge carriers, the donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugation has been adopted for two-dimensional (2D) COFs recently. In the 2D D-A COFs, photoexcitation would generate a polaron pair, which is a precursor to free charge carriers and has lower binding energy than an exciton. Although the character of the primary excitation species is a key factor in determining optoelectronic properties of a material, excited-state dynamics leading to the creation of a polaron pair have not been investigated yet. Here, we investigate the dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers in 2D D-A COFs by combining femtosecond optical spectroscopy and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulation. From this investigation, we elucidate that the polaron pair is formed through ultrafast intra-layer hole transfer coupled with coherent vibrations of the 2D lattice, suggesting a mechanism of phonon-assisted charge transfer.",Current forest carbon fixation fuels stream CO2 emissions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015439,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Stream CO2 emissions contribute significantly to atmospheric climate forcing.

Here, via an extensive radiocarbon (14C) characterisation of CO2 and DOC in stream water and its groundwater sources in an old-growth boreal forest, we demonstrate that the 14C-CO2 is consistently in tune with the current atmospheric 14C-CO2 level and shows little association with the 14C-DOC in the same waters. Our findings thus indicate that stream CO2 emissions act as a shortcut that returns CO2 recently fixed by the forest vegetation to the atmosphere. Our results expose a positive feedback mechanism within the C budget of forested catchments, where stream CO2 emissions will be highly sensitive to changes in forest C allocation patterns associated with climate and land-use changes.",BRD9 defines a SWI/SNF sub-complex and constitutes a specific vulnerability in malignant rhabdoid tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015438,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9) is a recently identified subunit of SWI/SNF(BAF) chromatin remodeling complexes, yet its function is poorly understood. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we show that BRD9 is a specific vulnerability in pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumors (RTs), which are driven by inactivation of the SMARCB1 subunit of SWI/SNF. We find that BRD9 exists in a unique SWI/SNF sub-complex that lacks SMARCB1, which has been considered a core subunit. While SMARCB1-containing SWI/SNF complexes are bound preferentially at enhancers, we show that BRD9-containing complexes exist at both promoters and enhancers. Mechanistically, we show that SMARCB1 loss causes increased BRD9 incorporation into SWI/SNF thus providing insight into BRD9 vulnerability in RTs. Underlying the dependency, while its bromodomain is dispensable, the DUF3512 domain of BRD9 is essential for SWI/SNF integrity in the absence of SMARCB1. Collectively, our results reveal a BRD9-containing SWI/SNF subcomplex is required for the survival of SMARCB1-mutant RTs.",Acceleration of dolomitization by zinc in saline waters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015437,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) plays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Yet, the chemical mechanisms that catalyze its formation remain an enigma. Here, using batch reactor experiments, we demonstrate an unexpected acceleration of dolomite formation by zinc in saline fluids, reflecting a not uncommon spatial association of dolomite with Mississippi Valley-type ores. The acceleration correlates with dissolved zinc concentration, irrespective of the zinc source tested (ZnCl2 and ZnO). Moreover, the addition of dissolved zinc counteracts the inhibiting effect of dissolved sulfate on dolomite formation. Integration with previous studies enables us to develop an understanding of the dolomitization pathway. Our findings suggest that the fluids' high ionic strength and zinc complexation facilitate magnesium ion dehydration, resulting in a dramatic decrease in induction time. This study establishes a previously unrecognized role of zinc in dolomite formation, and may help explain the changes in dolomite abundance through geological time.",Model states for a class of chiral topological order interfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015436,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Interfaces between topologically distinct phases of matter reveal a remarkably rich phenomenology.

A proteomic screen using the WD40 domain of ATG16L1 (WDD) identified A20 as a WDD-interacting protein. Loss of A20 and Atg16l1 in mouse intestinal epithelium induces spontaneous IBD-like pathology, as characterized by severe inflammation and increased intestinal epithelial cell death in both small and large intestine. Mechanistically, absence of A20 promotes Atg16l1 accumulation, while elimination of Atg16l1 or expression of WDD-deficient Atg16l1 stabilizes A20.

We have tested STREAM on several synthetic and real datasets generated with different single-cell technologies. We further demonstrate its utility for understanding myoblast differentiation and disentangling known heterogeneity in hematopoiesis for different organisms. STREAM is an open-source software package.",Promotion of growth factor signaling as a critical function of β-catenin during HCC progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015417,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. β-catenin is widely thought to be a major oncogene in HCC based on the frequency of mutations associated with aberrant Wnt signaling in HCC patients. Challenging this model, our data reveal that β-catenin nuclear accumulation is restricted to the late stage of the disease. Until then, β-catenin is primarily located at the plasma membrane in complex with multiple cadherin family members where it drives tumor cell survival by enhancing the signaling of growth factor receptors such as EGFR. Therefore, our study reveals the evolving nature of β-catenin in HCC to establish it as a compound tumor promoter during the progression of the disease.",Enhanced future changes in wet and dry extremes over Africa at convection-permitting scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015416,Nature communications,2019 04 29,"African society is particularly vulnerable to climate change. The representation of convection in climate models has so far restricted our ability to accurately simulate African weather extremes, limiting climate change predictions. Here we show results from climate change experiments with a convection-permitting (4.5 km grid-spacing) model, for the first time over an Africa-wide domain (CP4A). The model realistically captures hourly rainfall characteristics, unlike coarser resolution models. CP4A shows greater future increases in extreme 3-hourly precipitation compared to a convection-parameterised 25 km model (R25). CP4A also shows future increases in dry spell length during the wet season over western and central Africa, weaker or not apparent in R25. These differences relate to the more realistic representation of convection in CP4A, and its response to increasing atmospheric moisture and stability. We conclude that, with the more accurate representation of convection, projected changes in both wet and dry extremes over Africa may be more severe.",Excessive miR-25-3p maturation via N6-methyladenosine stimulated by cigarette smoke promotes pancreatic cancer progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015415,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is an important mechanism in miRNA processing and maturation, but the role of its aberrant regulation in human diseases remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that oncogenic primary microRNA-25 (miR-25) in pancreatic duct epithelial cells can be excessively maturated by cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) via enhanced m6A modification that is mediated by NF-κB associated protein (NKAP). This modification is catalyzed by overexpressed methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) due to hypomethylation of the METTL3 promoter also caused by CSC. Mature miR-25, miR-25-3p, suppresses PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 2 (PHLPP2), resulting in the activation of oncogenic AKT-p70S6K signaling, which provokes malignant phenotypes of pancreatic cancer cells. High levels of miR-25-3p are detected in smokers and in pancreatic cancers tissues that are correlated with poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. These results collectively indicate that cigarette smoke-induced miR-25-3p excessive maturation via m6A modification promotes the development and progression of pancreatic cancer."

It is unknown whether microsomal (m) prostaglandin (PG) E synthase (S)-1, a target downstream of COX, regulates myocardial (M) ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, a key determinant of heart failure. Here we report that COX-1 and mPGES-1 mediate production of substantial amounts of PGE2 and confer cardiac protection in MI/R. Deletion of mPges-1 impairs cardiac microvascular perfusion and increases inflammatory cell infiltration in mouse MI/R. Consistently, mPges-1 deletion depresses the arteriolar dilatory response to I/R in vivo and to acetylcholine ex vivo, and enhances leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction, which is mediated via PGE receptor-4 (EP4). Furthermore, endothelium-restricted Ep4 deletion impairs microcirculation, and exacerbates MI/R injury, irrespective of EP4 agonism. Treatment with misoprostol, a clinically available PGE analogue, improves microcirculation and reduces MI/R injury. Thus, mPGES-1, a key microcirculation protector, constrains MI/R injury and this beneficial effect is partially mediated via endothelial EP4.",Microscopic study of the Halperin-Laughlin interface through matrix product states.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015403,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Interfaces between topologically distinct phases of matter reveal a remarkably rich phenomenology. We study the experimentally relevant interface between a Laughlin phase at filling factor ν = 1/3 and a Halperin 332 phase at filling factor ν = 2/5. Based on our recent construction of chiral topological interfaces (Nat. Commun. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09168-z ; 2019), we study a family of model wavefunctions that captures both the bulk and interface properties. These model wavefunctions are built within the matrix product state framework. The validity of our approach is substantiated through extensive comparisons with exact diagonalization studies. We probe previously unreachable features of the low energy physics of the transition. We provide, amongst other things, the characterization of the interface gapless mode and the identification of the spin and charge excitations in the many-body spectrum. The methods and tools presented are applicable to a broad range of topological interfaces.",Bacterial chemotaxis in a microfluidic T-maze reveals strong phenotypic heterogeneity in chemotactic sensitivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015402,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Many microorganisms have evolved chemotactic strategies to exploit the microscale heterogeneity that frequently characterizes microbial habitats. Chemotaxis has been primarily studied as an average characteristic of a population, with little regard for variability among individuals. Here, we adopt a classic tool from animal ecology - the T-maze - and implement it at the microscale by using microfluidics to expose bacteria to a sequence of decisions, each consisting of migration up or down a chemical gradient. Single-cell observations of clonal Escherichia coli in the maze, coupled with a mathematical model, reveal that strong heterogeneity in the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient exists even within clonal populations of bacteria. A comparison of different potential sources of heterogeneity reveals that heterogeneity in the T-maze originates primarily from the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient, arising from a distribution of pathway gains. This heterogeneity may have a functional role, for example in the context of migratory bet-hedging strategies.",Genome-wide association study of medication-use and associated disease in the UK Biobank.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015401,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of medication use may contribute to understanding of disease etiology, could generate new leads relevant for drug discovery and can be used to quantify future risk of medication taking. Here, we conduct GWASs of self-reported medication use from 23 medication categories in approximately 320,000 individuals from the UK Biobank. A total of 505 independent genetic loci that meet stringent criteria (P < 10-8/23) for statistical significance are identified. We investigate the implications of these GWAS findings in relation to biological mechanism, potential drug target identification and genetic risk stratification of disease. Amongst the medication-associated genes are 16 known therapeutic-effect target genes for medications from 9 categories. Two of the medication classes studied are for disorders that have not previously been subject to large GWAS (hypothyroidism and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease).",Corrupted coordination of epigenetic modifications leads to diverging chromatin states and transcriptional heterogeneity in CLL.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015400,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Cancer evolution is fueled by epigenetic as well as genetic diversity. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), intra-tumoral DNA methylation (DNAme) heterogeneity empowers evolution. Here, to comprehensively study the epigenetic dimension of cancer evolution, we integrate DNAme analysis with histone modification mapping and single cell analyses of RNA expression and DNAme in 22 primary CLL and 13 healthy donor B lymphocyte samples. Our data reveal corrupted coherence across different layers of the CLL epigenome. This manifests in decreased mutual information across epigenetic modifications and gene expression attributed to cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Disrupted epigenetic-transcriptional coordination in CLL is also reflected in the dysregulation of the transcriptional output as a function of the combinatorial chromatin states, including incomplete Polycomb-mediated gene silencing. Notably, we observe unexpected co-mapping of typically mutually exclusive activating and repressing histone modifications, suggestive of intra-tumoral epigenetic diversity. Thus, CLL epigenetic diversification leads to decreased coordination across layers of epigenetic information, likely reflecting an admixture of cells with diverging cellular identities.",Sr[Li2Al2O2N2]:Eu2+-A high performance red phosphor to brighten the future.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015399,Nature communications,2019 05 01,"Innovative materials for phosphor converted white light-emitting diodes are in high demand owing to the huge potential of the light-emitting diode technology to reduce energy consumption worldwide. As the primary blue diode is already highly optimized, the conversion phosphors are of crucial importance for any further improvements. We report on the discovery of the high performance red phosphor Sr[Li2Al2O2N2]:Eu2+ meeting all requirements for a phosphor's optical properties. It combines the optimal spectral position for a red phosphor, as defined in the 2016 Research & Development-plan of the United States government, with an exceptionally small spectral full width at half maximum and excellent thermal stability. A white mid-power phosphor-converted light-emitting diode prototype utilising Sr[Li2Al2O2N2]:Eu2+ shows an increase of 16% in luminous efficacy compared to currently available commercial high colour-rendering phosphor-converted light-emitting diodes, while retaining excellent high colour rendition.

The hairy-like organelle, cilium, is present in most types of vertebrate cells, and plays important roles in various biological processes. However, it is unclear whether and how cilia regulate HSPC development in vertebrates. Here, we show that cilia-specific genes, involved in primary cilia formation and function, are required for HSPC development, especially in hemogenic endothelium (HE) specification in zebrafish embryos. Blocking primary cilia formation or function by genetic or chemical manipulations impairs HSPC development. Mechanistically, we uncover that primary cilia in endothelial cells transduce Notch signal to the earliest HE for proper HSPC specification during embryogenesis. Altogether, our findings reveal a pivotal role of endothelial primary cilia in HSPC development, and may shed lights into in vitro directed differentiation of HSPCs.",Immunostimulatory nanomedicines synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to eradicate colorectal tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015397,Nature communications,2019 05 08,"Nanoparticles can potentially stimulate tumour microenvironments to elicit antitumour immunity. Herein, we demonstrate effective immunotherapy of colorectal cancer via systemic delivery of an immunostimulatory chemotherapeutic combination in nanoscale coordination polymer (NCP) core-shell particles. Oxaliplatin and dihydroartemesinin have contrasting physicochemical properties but strong synergy in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and anticancer activity. The combined ROS generation is harnessed for immune activation to synergize with an anti-PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of murine colorectal cancer tumours. The favourable biodistribution and tumour uptake of NCPs and the absence of peripheral neuropathy allow for repeated dosing to afford 100% tumour eradication. The involvement of innate and adaptive immune systems elicit strong and long lasting antitumour immunity which prevents tumour formation when cured mice are challenged with cancer cells. The intrinsically biodegradable, well tolerated, and systemically available immunostimulatory NCP promises to enter clinical testing as an immunotherapy against colorectal cancer.",Glutamate spillover in C. elegans triggers repetitive behavior through presynaptic activation of MGL-2/mGluR5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015396,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, and impaired glutamate clearance following synaptic release promotes spillover, inducing extra-synaptic signaling. The effects of glutamate spillover on animal behavior and its neural correlates are poorly understood. We developed a glutamate spillover model in Caenorhabditis elegans by inactivating the conserved glial glutamate transporter GLT-1. GLT-1 loss drives aberrant repetitive locomotory reversal behavior through uncontrolled oscillatory release of glutamate onto AVA, a major interneuron governing reversals. Repetitive glutamate release and reversal behavior require the glutamate receptor MGL-2/mGluR5, expressed in RIM and other interneurons presynaptic to AVA. mgl-2 loss blocks oscillations and repetitive behavior; while RIM activation is sufficient to induce repetitive reversals in glt-1 mutants. Repetitive AVA firing and reversals require EGL-30/Gαq, an mGluR5 effector. Our studies reveal that cyclic autocrine presynaptic activation drives repetitive reversals following glutamate spillover. That mammalian GLT1 and mGluR5 are implicated in pathological motor repetition suggests a common mechanism controlling repetitive behaviors.",Structural insight into YcbB-mediated beta-lactam resistance in Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015395,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"The bacterial cell wall plays a crucial role in viability and is an important drug target. In Escherichia coli, the peptidoglycan crosslinking reaction to form the cell wall is primarily carried out by penicillin-binding proteins that catalyse D,D-transpeptidase activity. However, an alternate crosslinking mechanism involving the L,D-transpeptidase YcbB can lead to bypass of D,D-transpeptidation and beta-lactam resistance. Here, we show that the crystallographic structure of YcbB consists of a conserved L,D-transpeptidase catalytic domain decorated with a subdomain on the dynamic substrate capping loop, peptidoglycan-binding and large scaffolding domains. Meropenem acylation of YcbB gives insight into the mode of inhibition by carbapenems, the singular antibiotic class with significant activity against L,D-transpeptidases. We also report the structure of PBP5-meropenem to compare interactions mediating inhibition. Additionally, we probe the interaction network of this pathway and assay beta-lactam resistance in vivo. Our results provide structural insights into the mechanism of action and the inhibition of L,D-transpeptidation, and into YcbB-mediated antibiotic resistance."

The core histones bind to DNA to form the nucleosome, the recurring structural unit of chromatin. The linker histone binds to the nucleosome to form the next structural unit of chromatin, the chromatosome, which occurs dominantly in metazoans. Linker histones also play an essential role in condensing chromatin to form higher order structures. Unlike the core histones in the formation of the nucleosome, the role of linker histone in the formation of the chromatosome and high-order chromatin structure is not well understood. Nevertheless, exciting progress in the structural studies of chromatosomes and nucleosome arrays condensed by linker histones has been made in the last several years.

Specialized histones, known as histone variants, incorporate into chromatin to replace their canonical counterparts and represent an important layer of regulation to diversify the structural characteristics and functional outputs of chromatin. MacroH2A is an unusual histone variant with a bulky C-terminal non-histone domain that distinguishes it from all other histones. It is a critical player in stabilizing differentiated cell identity by posing as a barrier to somatic cell reprogramming toward pluripotency and acts as a tumor suppressor in a wide range of cancers. MacroH2A histones are generally regarded as repressive variants that are enriched at the inactive X chromosome (Xi) and broad domains across autosomal chromatin. Recent studies have shed light on to how macroH2A influences transcriptional outputs within distinct genomic contexts and revealed new intriguing molecular functions of macroH2A variants beyond transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of its mysterious chromatin deposition are beginning to be unraveled, facilitating our understanding of its complex regulation of genome function.",The histone chaperoning pathway: from ribosome to nucleosome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015382,Essays in biochemistry,2019 05 13,"Nucleosomes represent the fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic DNA, and comprise eight core histones around which DNA is wrapped in nearly two superhelical turns. Histones do not have the intrinsic ability to form nucleosomes; rather, they require an extensive repertoire of interacting proteins collectively known as 'histone chaperones'. At a fundamental level, it is believed that histone chaperones guide the assembly of nucleosomes through preventing non-productive charge-based aggregates between the basic histones and acidic cellular components. At a broader level, histone chaperones influence almost all aspects of chromatin biology, regulating histone supply and demand, governing histone variant deposition, maintaining functional chromatin domains and being co-factors for histone post-translational modifications, to name a few. In this essay we review recent structural insights into histone-chaperone interactions, explore evidence for the existence of a histone chaperoning 'pathway' and reconcile how such histone-chaperone interactions may function thermodynamically to assemble nucleosomes and maintain chromatin homeostasis.",The nucleosomes that mark centromere location on chromosomes old and new.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015381,Essays in biochemistry,2019 05 13,"Proper segregation of chromosomes is an essential component of cell division. The centromere is the locus at which the kinetochore-the proteinaceous complex that ties chromosomes to microtubules-forms during mitosis and meiosis. Thus, the centromere is critical for equal segregation of chromosomes. The centromere is characterized by both protein and DNA elements: the histone H3 variant CENP-A epigenetically defines the location of the centromere while centromeric DNA sequences are neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere function. Paradoxically, the DNA sequences play a critical role in new centromere formation. In this essay, we discuss the contribution of both epigenetics and genetics at the centromere. Understanding these contributions is vital to efforts to control centromere formation on synthetic/artificial chromosomes and centromere strength on natural ones.",Nucleosome positioning and spacing: from genome-wide maps to single arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015380,Essays in biochemistry,2019 05 13,"The positioning of nucleosomes relative to DNA and their neighboring nucleosomes represents a fundamental layer of chromatin organization. Changes in nucleosome positioning and spacing affect the accessibility of DNA to regulatory factors and the formation of higher order chromatin structures. Sequencing of mononucleosomal fragments allowed mapping nucleosome positions on a genome-wide level in many organisms. This revealed that successions of evenly spaced and well-positioned nucleosomes-so called phased nucleosome arrays-occur at the 5' end of many active genes and in the vicinity of transcription factor and other protein binding sites. Phased arrays arise from the interplay of barrier elements on the DNA, which position adjacent nucleosomes, and the nucleosome spacing activity of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers. A shortcoming of classic mononucleosomal mapping experiments is that they only reveal nucleosome spacing and array regularity at select sites in the genome with well-positioned nucleosomes. However, new technological approaches elucidate nucleosome array structure throughout the genome and with single-cell resolution. In the future, it will be interesting to see whether changes in nucleosome array regularity and spacing contribute to the formation of higher order chromatin structures and the spatial organization of the genome in vivo.",The many length scales of DNA packaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015379,Essays in biochemistry,2019 05 13,"This collection of reviews focuses on the most exciting areas of DNA packaging at the current time.

Mitochondrial protein 18 (Mtp18) is a novel mitochondrial inner membrane protein, shown to involve in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Although Mtp18 is abundant in cardiac muscles, its role in cardiac apoptosis remains elusive. The present study aimed to detect the role of Mtp18 in H2O2-induced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. We studied the effect of Mtp18 in cardiomyocytes by modulating its expression with lentiviral construct of Mtp18-shRNA and Mtp18 c-DNA, respectively. We then analyzed mitochondrial morphological dynamics with MitoTracker Red staining; apoptosis with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) and cell death detection assays; and protein expression with immunoblotting. Here, we observed that Mtp18 could regulate oxidative stress- mediated mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in cardiac myocytes. Mechanistically, we found that Mtp8 induced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis by enhancing dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) accumulation. Conversely, knockdown of Mtp18 interfered with Drp1-associated mitochondrial fission and subsequent activation of apoptosis in both HL-1 cells and primary cardiomyocytes. However, overexpression of Mtp18 alone was not sufficient to execute apoptosis when Drp1 was minimally expressed, suggesting that Mtp18 and Drp1 are interdependent in apoptotic cascade. Together, these data highlight the role of Mtp18 in cardiac apoptosis and provide a novel therapeutic insight to minimize cardiomyocyte loss via targetting mitochondrial dynamics.",Prenatal cold exposure causes hypertension in offspring by hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015358,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",2019 05 10,"Environmental temperature plays a role in the variation of blood pressure. Maternal cold stress could affect the physiological phenotype of the offspring, including blood pressure elevation. In the present study, we found that adult offspring of dams exposed to cold have increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and decreased urine volume and sodium excretion, accompanied by increased heart rate and heart rate variability, secondary to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Renal denervation or adrenergic receptor blockade decreased blood pressure and increased sodium excretion. The increase in peripheral sympathetic nerve activity can be ascribed to the central nervous system because administration of clonidine, a centrally acting α2 adrenergic receptor agonist, lowered blood pressure to a greater degree in the prenatal cold-exposed than control offspring. Moreover, these prenatal cold-exposed offspring had hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) disorder because magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed decreased N-acetylaspartate and increased choline and creatine ratios in the PVN. Additional studies found that prenatal cold exposure impaired the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurons. This led to PVN overactivation that was related to enhanced PVN-angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor expression and function. Microinjection of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan in the PVN lowered blood pressure to a greater extent in prenatal cold-exposed that control offspring. The present study provides evidence for overactive peripheral and central sympathetic nervous systems in the pathogenesis of prenatal cold-induced hypertension.

OBI-3424 has entered clinical testing for hepatocellular carcinoma and castrate-resistant prostate cancer, and it represents a potentially novel treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).Experimental Design: We assessed AKR1C3 expression by RNA-Seq and immunoblotting, and evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of OBI-3424. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of OBI-3424 in mice and nonhuman primates, and assessed the in vivo efficacy of OBI-3424 against a large panel of patient-derived xenografts (PDX).Results: AKR1C3 mRNA expression was significantly higher in primary T-lineage ALL (T-ALL; n = 264) than B-lineage ALL (B-ALL; n = 1,740; P < 0.0001), and OBI-3424 exerted potent cytotoxicity against T-ALL cell lines and PDXs. In vivo, OBI-3424 significantly prolonged the event-free survival (EFS) of nine of nine ALL PDXs by 17.1-77.8 days (treated/control values 2.5-14.0), and disease regression was observed in eight of nine PDXs. A significant reduction (P < 0.0001) in bone marrow infiltration at day 28 was observed in four of six evaluable T-ALL PDXs. The importance of AKR1C3 in the in vivo response to OBI-3424 was verified using a B-ALL PDX that had been lentivirally transduced to stably overexpress AKR1C3. OBI-3424 combined with nelarabine resulted in prolongation of mouse EFS compared with each single agent alone in two T-ALL PDXs.Conclusions: OBI-3424 exerted profound in vivo efficacy against T-ALL PDXs derived predominantly from aggressive and fatal disease, and therefore may represent a novel treatment for aggressive and chemoresistant T-ALL in an AKR1C3 biomarker-driven clinical trial.",Specific Targeting of Somatostatin Receptor Subtype-2 for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015345,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 05 23,"Purpose: Clinically available intraoperative imaging tools to assist surgeons in identifying occult lesions are limited and partially responsible for the high rate of disease recurrence in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Using the established clinical efficacy of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs as a model, we demonstrate the ability of a fluorescent somatostatin analog to selectively target tumors that overexpress somatostatin receptor subtype-2 (SSTR2) and demonstrate utility for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS).Experimental Design: A multimodality chelator (MMC) was used as a ""radioactive linker"" to synthesize the fluorescently labeled somatostatin analog, 67/68Ga-MMC(IR800)-TOC. In vivo studies were performed to determine the pharmacokinetic profile, optimal imaging time point, and specificity for SSTR2-expressing tissues. Meso- and microscopic imaging of resected tissues and frozen sections were also performed to further assess specific binding, and binding to human NETs was examined using surgical biospecimens from patients with pancreatic NETs.Results: Direct labeling with 67Ga/68Ga provided quantitative biodistribution analysis that was in agreement with fluorescence data. Receptor-mediated uptake was observed in vivo and ex vivo at the macro-, meso-, and microscopic scales. Surgical biospecimens from patients with pancreatic NETs also displayed receptor-specific agent binding, allowing clear delineation of tumor boundaries that matched pathology findings.Conclusions: The radioactive utility of the MMC allowed us to validate the binding properties of a novel FGS agent that could have a broad impact on cancer outcomes by equipping surgeons with real-time intraoperative imaging capabilities.","High-throughput Screening of Human Tumor Antigen-specific CD4 T Cells, Including Neoantigen-reactive T Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015344,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 05 30,"Purpose: Characterization of tumor antigen-specific CD4 T-cell responses in healthy donors and malignant melanoma patients using an in vitro amplified T-cell library screening procedure.Patients and Methods: A high-throughput, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-independent approach was used to estimate at unprecedented high sensitivity level precursor frequencies of tumor antigen- and neoantigen-specific CD4 T cells in healthy donors and patients with cancer. Frequency estimation was combined with isolation and functional characterization of identified tumor-reactive CD4 T-cell clones.Results: In healthy donors, we report frequencies of naïve tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-specific CD4 T cells comparable with those of CD4 T cells specific for infectious agents (Tetanus toxoid). Interestingly, we also identified low, but consistent numbers of memory CD4 T cells specific for several TAAs. In patients with melanoma, low frequencies of circulating TAA-specific CD4 T cells were detected that increased after peptide-based immunotherapy. Such antitumor TAA-specific CD4 T-cell responses were also detectable within the tumor-infiltrated tissues. TAA-specific CD4 T cells in patients displayed a highly polyfunctional state, with partial skewing to Type-2 polarization. Finally, we report the applicability of this approach to the detection and amplification of neoantigen-specific CD4 T cells.Conclusions: This simple, noninvasive, high-throughput screening of tumor- and neoantigen-specific CD4 T cells requires little biologic material, is HLA class II independent and allows the concomitant screening for a large number of tumor antigens of interest, including neoantigens. This approach will facilitate the immunomonitoring of preexisting and therapy-induced CD4 T-cell responses, and accelerate the development of CD4 T-cell-based therapies.",Reward prediction error modulates saccade vigor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015343,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 24,"Movement vigor, defined as the reciprocal of the latency from availability of reward to its acquisition, changes with reward magnitude: movements exhibit shorter reaction-time and increased velocity when they are directed toward more rewarding stimuli. This invigoration may be due to release of dopamine before movement onset, which has been shown to be modulated by events that signal reward prediction error (RPE). Here, we generated an RPE event in the milliseconds before movement onset and tested whether there was a relationship between RPE and vigor. Human subjects (both sexes) made saccades toward an image. During execution of the primary saccade, we probabilistically changed the position and content of that image, encouraging a secondary saccade. On some trials, the content of the secondary image was more valuable than the first image, resulting in a positive RPE (+RPE) event that preceded the secondary saccade. On other trials, this content was less valuable (-RPE event). We found that reaction-time of the secondary saccade was affected in an orderly fashion by the magnitude and direction of the preceding RPE event: the most vigorous saccades followed the largest +RPE, whereas the least vigorous saccades followed the largest -RPE. Presence of the secondary saccade indicated that the primary saccade had experienced a movement error, inducing trial-to-trial adaptation. However, this learning from movement error was not modulated by the RPE event. The data suggest that RPE events, which are thought to transiently alter the release of dopamine, modulate the vigor of the ensuing movement.Author summaryDoes dopamine release in response to a stimulus serve to invigorate the ensuing movement? To test this hypothesis, we relied on the fact that RPE is a strong modulator of dopamine. Our innovation was a task in which an RPE event occurred precisely before onset of a stimulus-driven movement. We probabilistically produced a combination of large or small, negative or positive RPE events, and observed that saccade vigor carried a robust signature of the preceding RPE event: high vigor saccades followed +RPE events, while low vigor saccades followed -RPE events. This suggests that in humans, vigor is partly controlled through release of dopamine in the moments before onset of a movement.",Transcriptional regulation of voltage-gated sodium channels contributes to GM-CSF induced pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015342,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 24,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces production of granulocyte and macrophage populations from the hematopoietic progenitor cells; it is one of the most common growth factors in the blood. GM-CSF is also involved in bone cancer pain development by regulating tumor-nerve interactions, remodeling of peripheral nerves and sensitization of damage-sensing (nociceptive) nerves. However, the precise mechanism for GM-CSF-dependent pain is unclear. In this study, we found that GM-CSF is highly expressed in human malignant osteosarcoma. Female Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with bone cancer cells develop mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia but antagonizing GM-CSF in these animals significantly reduced such hypersensitivity. The voltage gated Na+ channels Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 were found to be selectively up-regulated in rat DRG neurons treated with GM-CSF, which resulted in enhanced excitability. GM-CSF activated the Jak2 and Stat3 signaling pathway which promoted the transcription of Nav1.7-1.9 in DRG neurons. Accordingly, targeted knocking down of either Nav1.7-1.9 or Jak2/Stat3 in DRG neurons in vivo alleviated the hyperalgesia in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Our findings describe a novel bone cancer pain mechanism and provide a new insight into the physiological and pathological functions of GM-CSF.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIt has been reported that GM-CSF plays a key role in bone cancer pain, yet the underlying mechanisms involved in GM-CSF-mediated signaling pathway in nociceptors is not fully understood. Here, we showed that GM-CSF promotes bone cancer-associated pain by enhancing excitability of DRG neurons via the Jak2-Stat3-mediated upregulation of expression of nociceptor-specific voltage-gated sodium channels. Our study provides a detailed understanding of the roles that sodium channels and Jak2/Stat3 pathway play in the GM-CSF-mediated bone cancer pain; our data also highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting GM-CSF.",Antagonizing increased miR-135a levels at the chronic stage of experimental TLE reduces spontaneous recurrent seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015341,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 24,"Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (mTLE) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by recurrent seizures. The anti-epileptic drugs currently available to treat mTLE are ineffective in one-third of patients and lack disease-modifying effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs which control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, play a key role in the pathogenesis of mTLE and other epilepsies. Although manipulation of miRNAs at acute stages has been reported to reduce subsequent spontaneous seizures, it is uncertain whether targeting miRNAs at chronic stages of mTLE can also reduce seizures. Furthermore, the functional role and downstream targets of most epilepsy-associated miRNAs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that miR-135a is selectively upregulated within neurons in epileptic brain and report that targeting miR-135a in vivo using antagomirs after onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures can reduce seizure activity at the chronic stage of experimental mTLE in male mice. Further, by using an unbiased approach combining immunoprecipitation and RNA sequencing, we identify several novel neuronal targets of miR-135a, including Mef2a. Mef2 proteins are key regulators of excitatory synapse density. Mef2a and miR-135a show reciprocal expression regulation in human (of both sexes) and experimental TLE, and miR-135a regulates dendritic spine number and type through Mef2. Together, our data show that miR-135a is target for reducing seizure activity in chronic epilepsy, and that deregulation of miR-135a in epilepsy may alter Mef2a expression and thereby affect synaptic function and plasticity.Significance statementmiRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression with roles in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. However, the precise mechanism-of-action and therapeutic potential of most epilepsy-associated miRNAs remain poorly understood. Our study reveals dramatic upregulation of the key neuronal miRNA miR-135a in both experimental and human mTLE. Silencing miR-135a in experimental TLE reduces seizure activity at the spontaneous recurrent seizure stage. These data support the exciting possibility that miRNAs can be targeted to combat seizures after spontaneous seizure activity has been established. Further, by using unbiased approaches novel neuronal targets of miR-135a, including members of the Mef2 protein family, are identified that begin to explain how deregulation of miR-135a may contribute to epilepsy.",NMDA receptor-dependent dynamics of hippocampal place cell ensembles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015340,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 04 24,"The hippocampus is a key brain area to encoding and storing memories. Hippocampal place cells encode the position of an animal in space by firing when the subject is at a specific location in the environment. Therefore, place cells are considered essential to spatial memory and navigation. It has recently been revealed that place cell activity is not constant even in familiar environment, but changes dynamically over time. However, the mechanism behind these changes in activity is not yet fully understood. In this study, the activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons of male mice was tracked during repeated performances of a spatial task in a virtual reality environment. By comparing place cell ensemble representations among repeated performance of the task, the overlap rate of the active place cell population was found to be time dependent but independent of the number of tasks within a fixed time. These findings suggest that place codes change automatically and at a constant speed. Furthermore, the dynamics of place cell activity were found to be suppressed by an NMDA receptor antagonist. In summary, the spontaneously dynamic nature of place cell activity is at least in part regulated by NMDA receptors, and the dynamics may encode temporal information of episodes.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTPlace cell activity in the hippocampal CA1 area is not stable even in familiar environment, but changes dynamically over time. However, the mechanism behind these changes is unknown. Using in vivo calcium imaging, activity of CA1 neurons were tracked during multiple sessions with variable intervals. The overlap rate of the active place cell population was constant regardless of the number of tasks within a fixed time. Furthermore, the dynamics were suppressed by an NMDA receptor antagonist. This NMDA receptor-dependent, continuous change in the place cell activity may encode temporal information of episodes."

We generated new monoclonal antibodies that recognize the Mycobacteriumtuberculosis secreted protein Ag85B and used them to establish and characterize a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to quantitate Ag85B in samples generated in vitro and in vivo We found that nutritional or culture conditions had little impact on the secretion of Ag85B and that there is considerable variation in Ag85B secretion by distinct strains in the M. tuberculosis complex: compared with the commonly used H37Rv strain (lineage 4), Mycobacteriumafricanum (lineage 6) secretes less Ag85B, and two strains from lineage 2 secrete more Ag85B. We also used the ELISA to determine that the rate of secretion of Ag85B is 10- to 100-fold lower than that of proteins secreted by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. ELISA quantitation of Ag85B in lung homogenates of M. tuberculosis H37Rv-infected mice revealed that although Ag85B accumulates in the lungs as the bacterial population expands, the amount of Ag85B per bacterium decreases nearly 10,000-fold at later stages of infection, coincident with the development of T cell responses and arrest of bacterial population growth. These results indicate that bacterial protein secretion in vivo is dynamic and regulated, and quantitation of secreted bacterial proteins can contribute to the understanding of pathogenesis and immunity in tuberculosis and other infections.IMPORTANCE Bacterial protein secretion contributes to host-pathogen interactions, yet the process and consequences of bacterial protein secretion during infection are poorly understood. We developed a sensitive ELISA to quantitate a protein (termed Ag85B) secreted by M. tuberculosis and used it to find that Ag85B secretion occurs with slower kinetics than for proteins secreted by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and that accumulation of Ag85B in the lungs is markedly regulated as a function of the bacterial population density. Our results demonstrate that quantitation of bacterial proteins during infection can reveal novel insights into host-pathogen interactions.",Chlamydia trachomatis Lipopolysaccharide Evades the Canonical and Noncanonical Inflammatory Pathways To Subvert Innate Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015326,mBio,2019 05 01,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infections. C. trachomatis sexually transmitted infections are commonly asymptomatic, implying a pathogenic strategy for the evasion of innate inflammatory immune responses, a paradox as the C. trachomatis outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known potent agonist of inflammatory innate immunity. Here, we studied the ability of chlamydial LPS to activate the proinflammatory canonical and noncanonical inflammasome pathways in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). We show, in comparison to Escherichiacoli LPS, that C. trachomatis LPS-treated BMDM produce significantly less IL-6, TNF, and type I interferon mRNA, indicating that downstream signaling through the canonical TLR4 myddosome and triffosome pathways was blocked. We confirmed this in C. trachomatis LPS-treated BMDM by showing the lack of NF-κB and IRF3 phosphorylation, respectively. Interestingly, C. trachomatis LPS bound CD14 and promoted its endocytosis; however; it did not promote efficient TLR4/MD-2 dimerization or endocytosis, known requirements for myddosome and triffosome signaling pathways. We further found that transfection of BMDM with C. trachomatis LPS did not cause pyroptotic cell ballooning, cytotoxicity, or IL-1β secretion, all characteristic features of noncanonical inflammasome activation. Western blotting confirmed that cytosolic C. trachomatis LPS failed to signal through caspase-11, as shown by the lack of gasdermin D, caspase-1, or IL-1β proteolytic cleavage. We propose that chlamydiae evolved a unique LPS structure as a pathogenic strategy to avoid canonical and noncanonical innate immune signaling and conclude that this strategy might explain the high incidence of asymptomatic infections.IMPORTANCEChlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infections (STI). C. trachomatis STI are commonly asymptomatic, implying a pathogenic strategy for the evasion of innate inflammatory immune responses, a paradox as the C. trachomatis outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known potent agonist of inflammatory innate immunity. Here, we found that C. trachomatis LPS is not capable of engaging the canonical TLR4/MD-2 or noncanonical caspase-11 inflammatory pathways. The inability of C. trachomatis LPS to trigger innate immunity inflammatory pathways is related to its unique fatty acid structure. Evolutionary modification of the LPS structure likely evolved as a pathogenic strategy to silence innate host defense mechanisms. The findings might explain the high incidence of asymptomatic chlamydial genital infection.",The Structural Basis for a Transition State That Regulates Pore Formation in a Bacterial Toxin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015325,mBio,2019 05 01,"The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) genes are present in bacterial species that span terrestrial, vertebrate, and invertebrate niches, which suggests that they have evolved to function under widely different environmental conditions. Using a combination of biophysical and crystallographic approaches, we reveal that the relative stability of an intramolecular interface in the archetype CDC perfringolysin O (PFO) plays a central role in regulating its pore-forming properties. The disruption of this interface allows the formation of the membrane spanning β-barrel pore in all CDCs. We show here that the relative strength of the stabilizing forces at this interface directly impacts the energy barrier posed by the transition state for pore formation, as reflected in the Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) for pore formation. This change directly impacts the kinetics and temperature dependence of pore formation. We further show that the interface structure in a CDC from a terrestrial species enables it to function efficiently across a wide range of temperatures by minimizing changes in the strength of the transition state barrier to pore formation. These studies establish a paradigm that CDCs, and possibly other β-barrel pore-forming proteins/toxins, can evolve significantly different pore-forming properties by altering the stability of this transitional interface, which impacts the kinetic parameters and temperature dependence of pore formation.IMPORTANCE The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are the archetype for the superfamily of oligomeric pore-forming proteins that includes the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) family of immune defense proteins and the stonefish venom toxins (SNTX). The CDC/MACPF/SNTX family exhibits a common protein fold, which forms a membrane-spanning β-barrel pore. We show that changing the relative stability of an extensive intramolecular interface within this fold, which is necessarily disrupted to form the large β-barrel pore, dramatically alters the kinetic and temperature-dependent properties of CDC pore formation. These studies show that the CDCs and other members of the CDC/MACPF/SNTX superfamily have the capacity to significantly alter their pore-forming properties to function under widely different environmental conditions encountered by these species.",The Impact of Anthelmintic Treatment on Human Gut Microbiota Based on Cross-Sectional and Pre- and Postdeworming Comparisons in Western Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015324,mBio,2019 05 01,"Murine studies suggest that the presence of some species of intestinal helminths is associated with changes in host microbiota composition and diversity. However, studies in humans have produced varied conclusions, and the impact appears to vary widely depending on the helminth species present. To demonstrate how molecular approaches to the human gut microbiome can provide insights into the complex interplay among disparate organisms, DNA was extracted from cryopreserved stools collected from residents of 5 rural Kenyan villages prior to and 3 weeks and 3 months following albendazole (ALB) therapy. Samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the presence of 8 species of intestinal parasites and by MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Based on pretreatment results, the presence of neither Ascaris lumbricoides nor Necator americanus infection significantly altered the overall diversity of the microbiota in comparison with age-matched controls. Following ALB therapy and clearance of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), there were significant increases in the proportion of the microbiota made up by Clostridiales (P = 0.0002; average fold change, 0.57) and reductions in the proportion made up by Enterobacteriales (P = 0.0004; average fold change, -0.58). There was a significant posttreatment decrease in Chao1 richness, even among individuals who were uninfected pretreatment, suggesting that antimicrobial effects must be considered in any posttreatment setting. Nevertheless, the helminth-associated changes in Clostridiales and Enterobacteriales suggest that clearance of STH, and of N. americanus in particular, alters the gut microbiota.IMPORTANCE The gut microbiome is an important factor in human health. It is affected by what we eat, what medicines we take, and what infections we acquire. In turn, it affects the way we absorb nutrients and whether we have excessive intestinal inflammation. Intestinal worms may have an important impact on the composition of the gut microbiome. Without a complete understanding of the impact of mass deworming programs on the microbiome, it is impossible to accurately calculate the cost-effectiveness of such public health interventions and to guard against any possible deleterious side effects. Our research examines this question in a ""real-world"" setting, using a longitudinal cohort, in which individuals with and without worm infections are treated with deworming medication and followed up at both three weeks and three months posttreatment. We quantify the impact of roundworms and hookworms on gut microbial composition, suggesting that the impact is small, but that treatment of hookworm infection results in significant changes. This work points to the need for follow-up studies to further examine the impact of hookworm on the gut microbiota and determine the health consequences of the observed changes.",Coordination of Polyploid Chromosome Replication with Cell Size and Growth in a Cyanobacterium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015323,mBio,2019 05 01,"Homologous chromosome number (ploidy) has diversified among bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes over evolution. In bacteria, model organisms such as Escherichia coli possess a single chromosome encoding the entire genome during slow growth. In contrast, other bacteria, including cyanobacteria, maintain multiple copies of individual chromosomes (polyploid). Although a correlation between ploidy level and cell size has been observed in bacteria and eukaryotes, it is poorly understood how replication of multicopy chromosomes is regulated and how ploidy level is adjusted to cell size. In addition, the advantages conferred by polyploidy are largely unknown. Here we show that only one or a few multicopy chromosomes are replicated at once in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus and that this restriction depends on regulation of DnaA activity. Inhibiting the DnaA intrinsic ATPase activity in S. elongatus increased the number of replicating chromosomes and chromosome number per cell but did not affect cell growth. In contrast, when cell growth rate was increased or decreased, DnaA level, DnaA activity, and the number of replicating chromosomes also increased or decreased in parallel, resulting in nearly constant chromosome copy number per unit of cell volume at constant temperature. When chromosome copy number was increased by inhibition of DnaA ATPase activity or reduced culture temperature, cells exhibited greater resistance to UV light. Thus, it is suggested that the stepwise replication of the genome enables cyanobacteria to maintain nearly constant gene copy number per unit of cell volume and that multicopy chromosomes function as backup genetic information to compensate for genomic damage.IMPORTANCE Polyploidy has evolved many times across the kingdom of life. The relationship between cell growth and chromosome replication in bacteria has been studied extensively in monoploid model organisms such as Escherichiacoli but not in polyploid organisms. Our study of the polyploid cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus demonstrates that replicating chromosome number is restricted and regulated by DnaA to maintain a relatively stable gene copy number/cell volume ratio during cell growth. In addition, our results suggest that polyploidy confers resistance to UV, which damages DNA. This compensatory polyploidy is likely necessitated by photosynthesis, which requires sunlight and generates damaging reactive oxygen species, and may also explain how polyploid bacteria can adapt to extreme environments with high risk of DNA damage.",Quantitative Analyses Reveal Novel Roles for N-Glycosylation in a Major Enteric Bacterial Pathogen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015322,mBio,2019 05 01,"In eukaryotes, glycosylation plays a role in proteome stability, protein quality control, and modulating protein function; however, similar studies in bacteria are lacking. Here, we investigate the roles of general protein glycosylation systems in bacteria using the enteropathogen Campylobacter jejuni as a well-defined example. By using a quantitative proteomic strategy, we were able to monitor changes in the C. jejuni proteome when glycosylation is disrupted. We demonstrate that in C. jejuni, N-glycosylation is essential to maintain proteome stability and protein quality control. These findings guided us to investigate the role of N-glycosylation in modulating bacterial cellular activities. In glycosylation-deficient C. jejuni, the multidrug efflux pump and electron transport pathways were significantly impaired. We demonstrate that in vivo, fully glycosylation-deficient C. jejuni bacteria were unable to colonize its natural avian host. These results provide the first evidence of a link between proteome stability and complex functions via a bacterial general glycosylation system.IMPORTANCE Advances in genomics and mass spectrometry have revealed several types of glycosylation systems in bacteria. However, why bacterial proteins are modified remains poorly defined. Here, we investigated the role of general N-linked glycosylation in a major food poisoning bacterium, Campylobacter jejuni The aim of this study is to delineate the direct and indirect effects caused by disrupting this posttranslational modification. To achieve this, we employed a quantitative proteomic strategy to monitor alterations in the C. jejuni proteome. Our quantitative proteomic results linked general protein N-glycosylation to maintaining proteome stability. Functional analyses revealed novel roles for bacterial N-glycosylation in modulating multidrug efflux pump, enhancing nitrate reduction activity, and promoting host-microbe interaction. This work provides insights on the importance of general glycosylation in proteins in maintaining bacterial physiology, thus expanding our knowledge of the emergence of posttranslational modification in bacteria.",PARP Inhibitor Efficacy Depends on CD8+ T-cell Recruitment via Intratumoral STING Pathway Activation in BRCA-Deficient Models of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015319,Cancer discovery,2019 06 10,"Combinatorial clinical trials of PARP inhibitors with immunotherapies are ongoing, yet the immunomodulatory effects of PARP inhibition have been incompletely studied. Here, we sought to dissect the mechanisms underlying PARP inhibitor-induced changes in the tumor microenvironment of BRCA1-deficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We demonstrate that the PARP inhibitor olaparib induces CD8+ T-cell infiltration and activation in vivo, and that CD8+ T-cell depletion severely compromises antitumor efficacy. Olaparib-induced T-cell recruitment is mediated through activation of the cGAS/STING pathway in tumor cells with paracrine activation of dendritic cells and is more pronounced in HR-deficient compared with HR-proficient TNBC cells and in vivo models. CRISPR-mediated knockout of STING in cancer cells prevents proinflammatory signaling and is sufficient to abolish olaparib-induced T-cell infiltration in vivo. These findings elucidate an additional mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors and provide a rationale for combining PARP inhibition with immunotherapies for the treatment of TNBC. SIGNIFICANCE: This work demonstrates cross-talk between PARP inhibition and the tumor microenvironment related to STING/TBK1/IRF3 pathway activation in cancer cells that governs CD8+ T-cell recruitment and antitumor efficacy. The data provide insight into the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors in BRCA-associated breast cancer.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 681.","Randomised prospective study of using intraoperative, intraincisional and intraperitoneal ropivacaine for the early discharge of post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients as a day case in a cost-effective way in government setup of low-income and middle-income countries: Opening new horizons.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015318,Postgraduate medical journal,2019 05 06,Pain is the main reason for staying overnight at hospital after an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"Beliefs About Advanced Cancer Curability in Older Patients, Their Caregivers, and Oncologists.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015317,The oncologist,2019 04 24,Ensuring older patients with advanced cancer and their oncologists have similar beliefs about curability is important.

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess Haitian schoolteachers' attitudes and knowledge on oral health prior to and after attending an oral health educational intervention as well as their perceptions and experiences of receiving and implementing oral health education in a Haitian classroom setting.Methods: This mixed methods study used a quantitative, quasi-experimental, one-group pre/post-test design, before and after a 3-day oral health educational training in Borel, Haiti. A validated pre-and post-test questionnaire measured changes in oral health knowledge and attitudes. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was used to analyze information gathered during focus groups, using a semi-structured interview guide, to explore schoolteachers' perceptions and experiences regarding the training intervention and the six-week implementation of the oral health curriculum.Results: A purposeful sample of nine Haitian primary schoolteachers (n=9) consented to participate in the study. Oral health knowledge and attitude mean scores of the participants demonstrated improvement from pre-test (70%) to post-test (78%) scores. Qualitative findings revealed two major themes; confidence and empowerment, and improved oral health knowledge and hygiene behavior.Conclusion: Quantitative results from this study confirmed that training Haitian schoolteachers to integrate oral health education in the classroom can be an effective method for improving schoolteachers' personal oral health knowledge and attitudes. Findings also revealed a positive outlook on the training intervention and the application of an oral health education curriculum in the classroom. Results from this study provide a foundational knowledge for future oral health education trainings in underdeveloped countries with limited resources.",Nonmedical Use of Prescription Stimulants in Dental Hygiene Programs: Guidelines for prevention strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015304,Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,2019 04 24,"Nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (NPS), drugs frequently prescribed to treat Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is defined as the use of medications without a prescription or in a way that is inconsistent with a medical diagnosis. These pharmaceuticals are frequently prescribed to increase attentiveness, decrease distractibility, and improve daily functioning in individuals diagnosed with ADHD. While medically prescribed stimulants, including amphetamine, methylphenidate, and dextroamphetamine, have been shown to be safe and effective for improving the symptoms of ADHD, they have also been classified by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as schedule II, due to their high potential for abuse. With the increased matriculation of college students diagnosed with ADHD, the number of stimulants available on college campuses has risen substantially; and misuse of NPS is becoming a serious issue amongst college-aged students, including those in health care professions. The most commonly reported reasons for NPS use among college students is to improve alertness and concentration while studying and to enhance overall academic achievement. Borrowing, sharing and selling prescription stimulants between peers and friends are the common routes for NPS diversion. Academic performance expectations in dental hygiene education programs can create a highly stressful environment increasing the susceptibility of dental hygiene students to NPS misuse. Dental hygiene education programs should promote an awareness of the ethical, legal and overall health harms of nonmedical use of prescription stimulants.","Interprofessional Education in Dental Hygiene: Attitudes, barriers and practices of program faculty.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015303,Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,2019 04 24,"Purpose: Interprofessional education (IPE) experiences are an essential component in preparing dental hygiene students to participate in future interprofessional (IP) collaborations to support comprehensive patient care. The purpose of this study was to determine the attitudes, barriers and IPE practices in a national sample of dental hygiene faculty.Methods: A 25-item, researcher-designed, electronic survey was sent to 1,800 dental hygiene faculty members to determine attitudes, collaboration and practices involving interprofessional education (IPE). Descriptive statistics, Mann Whitney U and the Kruksal Wallis Test of Independent Samples were used to analyze and compare data.Results: The response rate was 22% (n=449). Results suggest faculty have positive attitudes toward IPE and most faculty (73%) incorporated IPE in their programs; however, time constraints were reported as the greatest barrier to IPE participation. A majority (85%) of respondents indicated a desire for greater emphasis on IPE in the curricula. Ethics (37%) was ranked as the most important IPE competency and teamwork the least (19%). Respondents from bachelor's degree programs were more likely to agree that learning with students in other health professions helps students become more effective members of a healthcare team than those from associate's degree programs (p = 0.025). Additionally, respondents from bachelor's degree programs were less likely to agree that clinical problem solving can only be learned when students are taught within their individual schools than those from associate degree programs (p = 0.022).Conclusion: Most of the dental hygiene faculty surveyed considered IPE important, incorporated it into student experiences, and wanted greater curricular emphasis on IPE. Time and institutional support may limit expansion of IPE activities and more collaboration amongst program faculty may be needed.",Collaborative Educational Experiences of Dental Hygiene and Audiology Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015302,Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,2019 04 24,"Purpose: An innovative, collaborative interprofessional experience for dental hygiene and audiology students that included hearing assessments and a class lecture/discussion session was developed and implemented at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the objectives were met for the initial educational experience and to identify areas for improvement.Methods: Audiology students, under faculty supervision, provided hearing screenings for 33 senior dental hygiene (DH) students and 4 graduate (DHE) students. In a subsequent didactic session for the DH and DHE students, an audiology doctoral student presented on the following topics: overview of the audiology profession, interprofessional collaboration with audiologists, principles of noise-induced hearing loss, protective measures for hearing health, and techniques for communicating with patients with hearing loss. Class discussion followed the lecture presentation. Surveys on the screening and education session were completed by the students and changes in their perception of knowledge were assessed.Results: Nearly half (49%) of the students indicated that this was their first hearing assessment. The vast majority (97-100%) agreed or strongly agreed that the experience was well-organized, contained important information for dental practice, and increased their understanding of the importance of collaboration and their comfort level in working with audiologists. Nearly all of the students (94%) recommended this experience be included in future curriculum. Significant changes were reported in students' knowledge of hearing assessments, noise induced hearing loss, and communication with patients with hearing loss (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, p < 0.05).Conclusion: The educational objectives of this initial interprofessional collaborative experience were met. Participants reported that the didactic and experiential education was a valuable learning experience and it increased their knowledge about the audiology profession and hearing health for themselves and their patients.",Medicago TERPENE SYNTHASE 10 is involved in defense against an oomycete root pathogen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015300,Plant physiology,2019 04 24,"In nature, plants interact with numerous beneficial or pathogenic soil-borne microorganisms. Plants have developed various defense strategies to expel pathogenic microbes, some of which function soon after pathogen infection. We used Medicago (Medicago truncatula) and its oomycete pathogen Aphanomyces euteiches to elucidate early responses of the infected root. A. euteiches causes root rot disease in legumes and is a limiting factor in legume production. Transcript profiling of seedlings and adult plant roots inoculated with A. euteiches zoospores for 2 hours revealed specific upregulation of a gene encoding a putative sesquiterpene synthase (Medicago TERPENE SYNTHASE 10; MtTPS10) in both developmental stages. MtTPS10 was specifically expressed in roots upon oomycete infection. Heterologous expression of MtTPS10 in yeast led to production of a blend of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene alcohols, with nuclear magnetic resonance identifying a major peak corresponding to himalachol. Moreover, plants carrying a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) retrotransposon Tnt1 insertion in MtTPS10 lacked the emission of sesquiterpenes upon A. euteiches infection, supporting the assumption that the identified gene encodes a multiproduct sesquiterpene synthase. Mttps10 plants and plants with reduced MtTPS10 transcript levels created by expression of an MtTPS10-amiRNA in roots were more susceptible to A. euteiches infection than the corresponding wild-type plants and roots transformed with the empty vector, respectively. Sesquiterpenes produced by expression of MtTPS10 in yeast also inhibited mycelial growth and A. euteiches zoospore germination. These data suggest that sesquiterpene production in roots by MtTPS10 plays a previously unrecognized role in the defense response of Medicago against A. euteiches.",Modeling protein destiny in developing fruit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015299,Plant physiology,2019 04 30,"Protein synthesis and degradation are essential processes that regulate cell status. Because labeling in bulky organs, such as fruits, is difficult, we developed a modeling approach to study protein turnover at the global scale in developing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit. Quantitative data were collected for transcripts and proteins during fruit development. Clustering analysis showed smaller changes in protein abundance compared to mRNA abundance. Furthermore, protein and transcript abundance were poorly correlated, and the coefficient of correlation decreased during fruit development and ripening, with transcript levels decreasing more than protein levels. A mathematical model with one ordinary differential equation was used to estimate translation (kt) and degradation (kd) rate constants for almost 2,400 detected transcript-protein pairs and was satisfactorily fitted for over a thousand pairs. The model predicted median values of about 2 min for the translation of a protein, and a protein lifetime of approximately 11 days. The constants were validated and inspected for biological relevance. Proteins involved in protein synthesis had higher kt and kd values, indicating that the protein machinery is particularly flexible. Our model also predicts that protein concentration is more strongly affected by the rate of translation than that of degradation.",Hes1 attenuates type I IFN responses via VEGF-C and WDFY1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015298,The Journal of experimental medicine,2019 06 11,"Induction of type I interferons (IFNs) is critical for eliciting competent immune responses, especially antiviral immunity. However, uncontrolled IFN production contributes to pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We found that transcription factor Hes1 suppressed production of type I IFNs and expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Functionally, Hes1-deficient mice displayed a heightened IFN signature in vivo, mounted enhanced resistance against encephalomyocarditis virus infection, and showed signs of exacerbated experimental lupus nephritis. Mechanistically, Hes1 did not suppress IFNs via direct transcriptional repression of IFN-encoding genes. Instead, Hes1 attenuated activation of TLR upstream signaling by inhibition of an adaptor molecule, WDFY1. Genome-wide assessment of Hes1 occupancy revealed that suppression of WDFY1 was secondary to direct binding and thus enhancement of expression of VEGF-C by Hes1, making Vegfc a rare example of an Hes1 positively regulated gene. In summary, these results identified Hes1 as a homeostatic negative regulator of type I IFNs for the maintenance of immune balance in the context of antiviral immunity and autoimmune diseases.",Lamin B1 loss promotes lung cancer development and metastasis by epigenetic derepression of RET.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015297,The Journal of experimental medicine,2019 06 11,"Although abnormal nuclear structure is an important criterion for cancer diagnostics, remarkably little is known about its relationship to tumor development. Here we report that loss of lamin B1, a determinant of nuclear architecture, plays a key role in lung cancer. We found that lamin B1 levels were reduced in lung cancer patients. Lamin B1 silencing in lung epithelial cells promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, tumor growth, and metastasis. Mechanistically, we show that lamin B1 recruits the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to alter the H3K27me3 landscape and repress genes involved in cell migration and signaling. In particular, epigenetic derepression of the RET proto-oncogene by loss of PRC2 recruitment, and activation of the RET/p38 signaling axis, play a crucial role in mediating the malignant phenotype upon lamin B1 disruption. Importantly, loss of a single lamin B1 allele induced spontaneous lung tumor formation and RET activation. Thus, lamin B1 acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer, linking aberrant nuclear structure and epigenetic patterning with malignancy.",In silico learning of tumor evolution through mutational time series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015295,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"Cancer arises through the accumulation of somatic mutations over time. Understanding the sequence of mutation occurrence during cancer progression can assist early and accurate diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. Here we employ long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a class of recurrent neural network, to learn the evolution of a tumor through an ordered sequence of mutations. We demonstrate the capacity of LSTMs to learn complex dynamics of the mutational time series governing tumor progression, allowing accurate prediction of the mutational burden and the occurrence of mutations in the sequence. Using the probabilities learned by the LSTM, we simulate mutational data and show that the simulation results are statistically indistinguishable from the empirical data. We identify passenger mutations that are significantly associated with established cancer drivers in the sequence and demonstrate that the genes carrying these mutations are substantially enriched in interactions with the corresponding driver genes. Breaking the network into modules consisting of driver genes and their interactors, we show that these interactions are associated with poor patient prognosis, thus likely conferring growth advantage for tumor progression. Thus, application of LSTM provides for prediction of numerous additional conditional drivers and reveals hitherto unknown aspects of cancer evolution.",Variation in sequence dynamics improves maintenance of stereotyped behavior in an example from bird song.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015294,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 12,"Performing a stereotyped behavior successfully over time requires both maintaining performance quality and adapting efficiently to environmental or physical changes affecting performance. The bird song system is a paradigmatic example of learning a stereotyped behavior and therefore is a good place to study the interaction of these two goals. Through a model of bird song learning, we show how instability in neural representation of stable behavior confers advantages for adaptation and maintenance with minimal cost to performance quality. A precise, temporally sparse sequence from the premotor nucleus HVC is crucial to the performance of song in songbirds. We find that learning in the presence of sequence variations facilitates rapid relearning after shifts in the target song or muscle structure and results in decreased error with neuron loss. This robustness is due to the prevention of the buildup of correlations in the learned connectivity. In the absence of sequence variations, these correlations grow, due to the relatively low dimensionality of the exploratory variation in comparison with the number of plastic synapses. Our results suggest one would expect to see variability in neural systems executing stereotyped behaviors, and this variability is an advantageous feature rather than a challenge to overcome."

Reduction in IKr causes long QT syndrome, which can lead to fatal arrhythmias triggered by stress. One potential link between stress and hERG function is protein kinase C (PKC) activation; however, seemingly conflicting results regarding PKC regulation of hERG have been reported. We investigated the effects of PKC activation using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on hERG channels expressed in human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK293) cells and IKr in isolated neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Acute activation of PKC by PMA (30 nM, 30 minutes) reduced both hERG current (IhERG) and IKr Chronic activation of PKC by PMA (30 nM, 16 hours) increased IKr in cardiomyocytes and the expression level of hERG proteins; however, chronic (30 nM, 16 hours) PMA treatment decreased IhERG, which became larger than untreated control IhERG after PMA removal for 4 hours. Deletion of amino acid residues 2-354 (Δ2-354 hERG) or 1-136 of the N terminus (ΔN 136 hERG) abolished acute PMA (30 nM, 30 minutes)-mediated IhERG reduction. In contrast to wild-type hERG channels, chronic activation of PKC by PMA (30 nM, 16 hours) increased both Δ2-354 hERG and ΔN136 hERG expression levels and currents. The increase in hERG protein was associated with PKC-induced phosphorylation (inhibition) of Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates hERG degradation. We conclude that PKC regulates hERG in a balanced manner, increasing expression through inhibiting Nedd4-2 while decreasing current through targeting a site(s) within the N terminus.",Brain Circuitry for Arousal from Apnea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015281,Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology,2019 04 24,"We wanted to understand the brain circuitry that awakens the individual when there is elevated CO2 or low O2 (e.g., during sleep apnea or asphyxia). The sensory signals for high CO2 and low O2 all converge on the parabrachial nucleus (PB) of the pons, which contains neurons that project to the forebrain. So, we first deleted the vesicular glutamate transporter 2, necessary to load glutamate into synaptic vesicles, from neurons in the PB, and showed that this prevents awakening to high CO2 or low O2 We then showed that PB neurons that express calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) show cFos staining during high CO2 Using CGRP-Cre-ER mice, we expressed the inhibitory opsin archaerhodopsin just in the PBCGRP neurons. Photoinhibition of the PBCGRP neurons effectively prevented awakening to high CO2, as did photoinhibition of their terminals in the basal forebrain, amygdala, and lateral hypothalamus. The PBCGRP neurons are a key mediator of the wakening response to apnea.",Mutating chikungunya virus non-structural protein produces potent live-attenuated vaccine candidate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015278,EMBO molecular medicine,2019 06 11,"Currently, there are no commercially available live-attenuated vaccines against chikungunya virus (CHIKV).

R532H mutation in nsP1 caused reduced infectivity in mouse tail fibroblasts but an enhanced type-I IFN response compared to WT-CHIKV Adult mice infected with this nsP-mutant exhibited a mild joint phenotype with low-level viremia that rapidly cleared. Mechanistically, ingenuity pathway analyses revealed a tilt in the anti-inflammatory IL-10 versus pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-18 balance during CHIKV nsP-mutant infection that modified acute antiviral and cell signaling canonical pathways. Challenging CHIKV nsP-mutant-infected mice with WT-CHIKV or the closely related O'nyong-nyong virus resulted in no detectable viremia, observable joint inflammation, or damage. Challenged mice showed high antibody titers with efficient neutralizing capacity, indicative of immunological memory.

Inflammasomes function as intracellular sensors of both microbial pathogens and foreign as well as host-derived danger signals. Upon activation, they induce an innate immune response by secreting the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, and additionally by inducing pyroptosis, a lytic cell death mode that releases additional inflammatory mediators. Microglia are the prominent innate immune cells in the brain for inflammasome activation. However, additional CNS-resident cell types including astrocytes and neurons, as well as infiltrating myeloid cells from the periphery, express and activate inflammasomes. In this review, we will discuss current understanding of the role of inflammasomes in common degenerative diseases of the brain and highlight inflammasome-targeted strategies that may potentially treat these diseases.",Rest Evaluation for Active Concussion Treatment (ReAct) Protocol: a prospective cohort study of levels of physical and cognitive rest after youth sports-related concussion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015276,BMJ open,2019 06 10,"Although current guidelines for the early clinical management of sports-related concussion (SRC) call for a gradual return-to-activity, the optimal level of rest needed to promote recovery remains unknown.

Recently, an arginine to proline substitution (R1673P) in the S4 voltage-sensing helix of the fourth membrane-bound repeat of CaV2.1 was linked to a severe neurological disorder characterized by generalized hypotonia, ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and global developmental delay. The R1673P mutation was proposed to cause a gain of function in CaV2.1 leading to neuronal Ca2+ toxicity based on the ability of the mutant channel to rescue the photoreceptor response in CaV2.1-deficient Drosophila cacophony larvae. Here, we show that the corresponding mutation in rat CaV2.1 (R1624P) causes a profound loss of channel function; voltage-clamp analysis of tsA-201 cells expressing this mutant channel revealed an ∼25-mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. This alteration in activation implies that a significant fraction of CaV2.1 channels resident in presynaptic terminals are unlikely to open in response to an action potential, thereby increasing the probability of synaptic failure at both NMJs and central synapses. Indeed, the mutant channel supported only minimal Ca2+ flux in response to an action potential-like waveform. Application of GV-58, a compound previously shown to stabilize the open state of wild-type CaV2.1 channels, partially restored Ca2+ current by shifting mutant activation to more hyperpolarizing potentials and slowing deactivation. Consequently, GV-58 also rescued a portion of Ca2+ flux during action potential-like stimuli. Thus, our data raise the possibility that therapeutic agents that increase channel open probability or prolong action potential duration may be effective in combatting this and other severe neurodevelopmental disorders caused by loss-of-function mutations in CaV2.1.",Types of Erythropoietin-Stimulating Agents and Mortality among Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015255,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2019 06 01,"Despite the widespread use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) to treat anemia in patients undergoing hemodialysis, the relative mortality risks associated with use of different types of ESAs are unknown.",The Pluripotency Regulator PRDM14 Requires Hematopoietic Regulator CBFA2T3 to Initiate Leukemia in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015254,Molecular cancer research : MCR,2019 06 04,"PR domain-containing 14 (Prdm14) is a pluripotency regulator central to embryonic stem cell identity and primordial germ cell specification.

Here, we demonstrate mechanistic insight into PRDM14-driven leukemias in vivo Mass spectrometry revealed novel PRDM14-protein interactions including histone H1, RNA-binding proteins, and the master hematopoietic regulator CBFA2T3. In mouse leukemic cells, CBFA2T3 and PRDM14 associate independently of the related ETO family member CBFA2T2, PRDM14's primary protein partner in pluripotent cells. CBFA2T3 plays crucial roles in HSC self-renewal and lineage commitment, and participates in oncogenic translocations in acute myeloid leukemia. These results suggest a model whereby PRDM14 recruits CBFA2T3 to DNA, leading to gene misregulation causing progenitor cell expansion and lineage perturbations preceding T-ALL development. Strikingly, Prdm14-induced T-ALL does not occur in mice deficient for Cbfa2t3, demonstrating that Cbfa2t3 is required for leukemogenesis. Moreover, T-ALL develops in Cbfa2t3 heterozygotes with a significantly longer latency, suggesting that PRDM14-associated T-ALL is sensitive to Cbfa2t3 levels. Our study highlights how an oncogenic protein uses a native protein in progenitor cells to initiate leukemia, providing insight into PRDM14-driven oncogenesis in other cell types.Implications: The pluripotency regulator PRDM14 requires the master hematopoietic regulator CBFA2T3 to initiate leukemia in progenitor cells, demonstrating an oncogenic role for CBFA2T3 and providing an avenue for targeting cancer-initiating cells.",StarD5: an ER stress protein regulates plasma membrane and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015253,Journal of lipid research,2019 06 02,"How plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol is controlled is poorly understood. Ablation of the gene encoding the ER stress steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer domain (StarD)5 leads to a decrease in PM cholesterol content, a decrease in cholesterol efflux, and an increase in intracellular neutral lipid accumulation in macrophages, the major cell type that expresses StarD5. ER stress increases StarD5 expression in mouse hepatocytes, which results in an increase in accessible PM cholesterol in WT but not in StarD5-/- hepatocytes. StarD5-/- mice store higher levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, which leads to altered expression of cholesterol-regulated genes. In vitro, a recombinant GST-StarD5 protein transfers cholesterol between synthetic liposomes. StarD5 overexpression leads to a marked increase in PM cholesterol. Phasor analysis of 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy data revealed an increase in PM fluidity in StarD5-/- macrophages. Taken together, these studies show that StarD5 is a stress-responsive protein that regulates PM cholesterol and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.",Adhesional small bowel obstruction related to stapling device from previous laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015251,BMJ case reports,2019 04 24,"Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is common surgical presenting problem, accounting for roughly 15 000 laparotomies per year in the UK.

The common causes for SBO post-TAPP include inadequate closure, port-site herniation and adhesions. Here, we present a case of adhesional SBO related to stapling device from previous laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and review alternative methods for mesh fixation. This case reports a rare but life-threatening complication from a commonly performed day case procedure and highlights importance of adequate surgical technique when inserting foreign bodies intra-abdominally.

The initial treatment included intravenous antibiotics, emergency debridement of necrotic tissue and admission to intensive care. Group A streptococcus was cultured from the debrided tissue. The patient developed decompensated liver failure and life-threatening haematemesis. Liver screening detected hepatitis C positive serology, the only risk factor for which was an old tattoo.

In addition, bone transformation in giant cell tumour may occur in different phases. With conventional X-rays, CT scans or MRIs, it may be challenging to distinguish among different phases of bone transformation, normal bone, soft tissue disease and bone disease (benign vs malignant lesions) and changes in multiple organs such as lung, liver and lymph nodes unless every lesion is biopsied, which is not practical. Molecular imaging with different isotopes (Tc-99m phosphonate, 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-d-glucose and sodium fluoride-18) may help to better characterise the disease. We hypothesised that molecular imaging could offer qualitative and quantitative characterisation of all stages of bone formation, destruction, reactivity or neoplasia in a patient with giant cell tumour of the bone, and we present the first case of molecular imaging where bone formation was seen in multiple soft tissues, such as lungs, muscles, lymph nodes and liver.",Methylation of C/EBPα by PRMT1 Inhibits Its Tumor-Suppressive Function in Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015230,Cancer research,2019 06 04,"C/EBPα is an essential transcription factor involved in regulating the expression or function of certain cell-cycle regulators, including in breast cancer cells. Although protein arginine methyltransferases have been shown to play oncogenic roles in a variety of cancers, little is known about the role of arginine methylation in regulating the antiproliferation activity of C/EBPα. Here, we report that the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is overexpressed in human breast cancer and that elevated PRMT1 correlates with cancer malignancy. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that knockdown of PRMT1 in breast cancer cells is accompanied by a decrease in the expression of pro-proliferative genes, including cyclin D1. Furthermore, tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry identified PRMT1 as a component of the C/EBPα complex. C/EBPα associated with and was methylated by PRMT1 at three arginine residues (R35, R156, and R165). PRMT1-dependent methylation of C/EBPα promoted the expression of cyclin D1 by blocking the interaction between C/EBPα and its corepressor HDAC3, which resulted in rapid growth of tumor cells during the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Inhibition of PRMT1 significantly impeded the growth of cancer cells from patients with triple-negative breast cancer. This evidence that PRMT1 mediates C/EBPα methylation sheds light on a novel pathway and potential therapeutic target in breast cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides novel mechanistic insight of the role of the arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 in breast cancer pathogenesis.",Positron Emission Tomography Detects In Vivo Expression of Disialoganglioside GD2 in Mouse Models of Primary and Metastatic Osteosarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015228,Cancer research,2019 06 16,"The cell membrane glycolipid GD2 is expressed by multiple solid tumors, including 88% of osteosarcomas and 98% of neuroblastomas. However, osteosarcomas are highly heterogeneous, with many tumors exhibiting GD2 expression on <50% of the individual cells, while some tumors are essentially GD2-negative. Anti-GD2 immunotherapy is the current standard of care for high-risk neuroblastoma, but its application to recurrent osteosarcomas, for which no effective therapies exist, has been extremely limited. This is, in part, because the standard assays to measure GD2 expression in these heterogeneous tumors are not quantitative and are subject to tissue availability and sampling bias. To address these limitations, we evaluated a novel, sensitive radiotracer [64Cu]Cu-Bn-NOTA-hu14.18K322A to detect GD2 expression in osteosarcomas (six patient-derived xenografts and one cell line) in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Tumor uptake of the radiolabeled, humanized anti-GD2 antibody [64Cu]Cu-Bn-NOTA-hu14.18K322A was 7-fold higher in modestly GD2-expressing osteosarcomas (32% GD2-positive cells) than in a GD2-negative tumor (9.8% vs. 1.3% of the injected dose per cc, respectively). This radiotracer also identified lesions as small as 29 mm3 in a 34% GD2-positive model of metastatic osteosarcoma of the lung. Radiolabeled antibody accumulation in patient-derived xenografts correlated with GD2 expression as measured by flow cytometry (Pearson r = 0.88, P = 0.01), distinguishing moderately GD2-expressing osteosarcomas (32%-69% GD2-positive cells) from high GD2 expressors (>99%, P < 0.05). These results support the utility of GD2 imaging with PET to measure GD2 expression in osteosarcoma and thus maximize the clinical impact of anti-GD2 immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE: In situ assessment of all GD2-positive osteosarcoma sites with a novel PET radiotracer could significantly impact anti-GD2 immunotherapy patient selection and enable noninvasive probing of correlations between target expression and therapeutic response.",MicroRNA-92 expression in CD133+ melanoma stem cells regulates immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment via integrin-dependent activation of TGF-β.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015227,Cancer research,2019 05 08,"In addition to being refractory to treatment, melanoma cancer stem cells (CSC) are known to suppress host anti-tumor immunity, the underlying mechanisms of which need further elucidation. In this study, we established a novel role for microRNA-92 (miR-92) and its associated gene networks in immunosuppression. CSCs were isolated from the B16-F10 murine melanoma cell line based on expression of the putative CSC marker CD133 (Prominin-1). CD133+ cells were functionally distinct from CD133- cells and showed increased proliferation in vitro and enhanced tumorigenesis in vivo. CD133+ CSCs also exhibited a greater capacity to recruit immunosuppressive cell types during tumor formation, including FoxP3+ Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and M2 macrophages. Using microarray technology, we identified several miRs that were significantly downregulated in CD133+ cells compared to CD133- cells, including miR-92. Decreased expression of miR-92 in CSCs led to higher expression of target molecules integrin αV and α5 subunits, which in turn enhanced TGF-β activation as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of SMAD2. CD133+ cells transfected with miR-92a mimic and injected in vivo showed significantly decreased tumor burden, which was associated with reduced immunosuppressive phenotype intratumorally. Using the TCGA database of melanoma patients, we also noted a positive correlation between integrin α5 and TGF-β1 expression levels and an inverse association between miR-92 expression and integrin alpha subunit expression. Collectively, the current study suggests that a miR-92-driven signaling axis involving integrin activation of TGF-β in CSCs promotes enhanced tumorigenesis through induction of intratumoral immunosuppression.",Statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: modelling guidelines and patient preferences based on an Irish cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015226,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,2019 06 10,Changes in clinical guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have widened eligibility for statin therapy.,GPs' and practice staff's views of a telephone first approach to demand management: a qualitative study in primary care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015225,The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,2019 05 03,"To better manage patient demand, some general practices have implemented a 'telephone first' approach in which all patients seeking a face-to-face appointment first have to speak to a GP on the telephone.

SCD is associated with sustained hemolytic anemia, vasoocclusion, ischemia-reperfusion injury, oxidative tissue damage, inflammatory cell activation, and systemic endothelial dysfunction. The transcription factor Nrf2 coordinates the expression of a wide variety of genes encoding antioxidant, detoxification, and metabolic enzymes. Nrf2 participates in suppressing proinflammatory cytokines and organ protection in SCD. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which Nrf2 ameliorates SCD pathology or how some cells respond to Nrf2 stimuli to alleviate SCD pathology. Here, we asked whether monocytes/granulocytes and/or endothelial cells are particularly critical in alleviating the pathology of SCD. By targeting these cells with a Cre recombinase system, we generated SCD::Keap1F/F::LysM-Cre and Tie1-Cre mice with constitutive Nrf2 activation in monocytes/granulocytes and endothelial cells, respectively. Analyses of SCD::Keap1F/F::LysM-Cre and SCD::Keap1F/F::Tie1-Cre mice revealed significantly reduced inflammation, along with decreased white blood cell counts and lower Tnfα and Il1β expression in the lungs. Notably, SCD::Keap1F/F::LysM-Cre mice exhibited reduced heme distribution in the liver, consistent with a decrease in the damaged areas. Vascular function in SCD::Keap1F/F::Tie1-Cre mice was significantly improved, with a 50% decrease in vascular leakage and low expression of the adhesion molecules Vcam1 and P-selectin. Thus, Nrf2 activation in monocytes/granulocytes and endothelial cells contributes differentially and cooperatively to the improvement of SCD pathology.",Engineering nanomolar peptide ligands that differentially modulate EphA2 receptor signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015204,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 01,"The EPH receptor A2 (EphA2) tyrosine kinase plays an important role in a plethora of biological and disease processes, ranging from angiogenesis and cancer to inflammation and parasitic infections. EphA2 is therefore considered an important drug target. Two short peptides previously identified by phage display, named YSA and SWL, are widely used as EphA2-targeting agents owing to their high specificity for this receptor. However, these peptides have only modest (micromolar) potency. Lack of structural information on the binding interactions of YSA and SWL with the extracellular EphA2 ligand-binding domain (LBD) has for many years precluded structure-guided improvements. We now report the high-resolution (1.53-2.20 Å) crystal structures of the YSA peptide and several of its improved derivatives in complex with the EphA2 LBD, disclosing that YSA targets the ephrin-binding pocket of EphA2 and mimics binding features of the ephrin-A ligands. The structural information obtained enabled iterative peptide modifications conferring low nanomolar potency. Furthermore, contacts observed in the crystal structures shed light on how C-terminal features can convert YSA derivatives from antagonists to agonists that likely bivalently interact with two EphA2 molecules to promote receptor oligomerization, autophosphorylation, and downstream signaling. Consistent with this model, quantitative FRET measurements in live cells revealed that the peptide agonists promote the formation of EphA2 oligomeric assemblies. Our findings now enable rational strategies to differentially modify EphA2 signaling toward desired outcomes by using appropriately engineered peptides. Such peptides could be used as research tools to interrogate EphA2 function and to develop pharmacological leads.",Analysis of Heritability and Genetic Architecture of Pancreatic Cancer: A PanC4 Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015203,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2019 06 11,"Background: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the United States. The currently identified common susceptibility loci account for a small fraction of estimated heritability. We sought to estimate overall heritability of pancreatic cancer and partition the heritability by variant frequencies and functional annotations.Methods: Analysis using the genome-based restricted maximum likelihood method (GREML) was conducted on Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4) genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 3,568 pancreatic cancer cases and 3,363 controls of European Ancestry.Results: Applying linkage disequilibrium- and minor allele frequency-stratified GREML (GREML-LDMS) method to imputed GWAS data, we estimated the overall heritability of pancreatic cancer to be 21.2% (SE = 4.8%). Across the functional groups (intronic, intergenic, coding, and regulatory variants), intronic variants account for most of the estimated heritability (12.4%). Previously identified GWAS loci explained 4.1% of the total phenotypic variation of pancreatic cancer. Mutations in hereditary pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes are present in 4% to 10% of patients with pancreatic cancer, yet our GREML-LDMS results suggested these regions explain only 0.4% of total phenotypic variance for pancreatic cancer.Conclusions: Although higher than previous studies, our estimated 21.2% overall heritability may still be downwardly biased due to the inherent limitation that the contribution of rare variants in genes with a substantive overall impact on disease are not captured when applying these commonly used methods to imputed GWAS data.Impact: Our work demonstrated the importance of rare and common variants in pancreatic cancer risk.",Repurposing EGFR Inhibitor Utility in Colorectal Cancer in Mutant APC and TP53 Subpopulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015202,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2019 06 11,"Background: EGFR is a major therapeutic target for colorectal cancer. Currently, extended RAS/RAF testing identifies only nonresponders to EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi). We aimed to develop a mutation signature that further refines drug-sensitive subpopulations to improve EGFRi outcomes.Methods: A prespecified, 203-gene expression signature score measuring cetuximab sensitivity (CTX-S) was validated with two independent clinical trial datasets of cetuximab-treated patients with colorectal cancer (n = 44 and n = 80) as well as an in vitro dataset of 147 cell lines. The CTX-S score was then used to decipher mutated genes that predict EGFRi sensitivity. The predictive value of the identified mutation signature was further validated by additional independent datasets.Results: Here, we report the discovery of a 2-gene (APC+TP53) mutation signature that was useful in identifying EGFRi-sensitive colorectal cancer subpopulations. Mutant APC+TP53 tumors were more predominant in left- versus right-sided colorectal cancers (52% vs. 21%, P = 0.0004), in microsatellite stable (MSS) versus microsatellite instable (MSI) cases (47% vs. 2%, P < 0.0001), and in the consensus molecular subtype 2 versus others (75% vs. 37%, P < 0.0001). Moreover, mutant APC+TP53 tumors had favorable outcomes in two cetuximab-treated patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) datasets (P = 0.0277, n = 52; P = 0.0008, n = 98).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the APC and TP53 combination mutation may account for the laterality of EGFRi sensitivity and provide a rationale for refining treated populations. The results also suggest addition of APC+TP53 sequencing to extended RAS/RAF testing that may directly increase the response rates of EGFRi therapy in selected patients.Impact: These findings, if further validated through clinical trials, could also expand the utility of EGFRi therapies that are currently underutilized.",Predictive Value of HPV Testing in Self-collected and Clinician-Collected Samples Compared with Cytology in Detecting High-grade Cervical Lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015201,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",2019 06 11,"Background: Self-sampling has become an attractive proposition now that human papillomavirus (HPV) primary testing is being incorporated into cervical cancer screening programs worldwide.

The purpose of the current study was to gather further preclinical evidence supporting progestins as cancer chemopreventives by demonstrating progestin-activation of surrogate endpoint biomarkers pertinent to cancer prevention in the genital tract of women at increased risk of ovarian cancer. There were 64 women enrolled in a multi-institutional randomized trial who chose to undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) and to receive the progestin levonorgestrel or placebo for 4 to 6 weeks prior to undergoing BSO. The ovarian and fallopian tube epithelia (FTE) were compared immunohistochemically for effects of levonorgestrel on apoptosis (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included TGFβ isoform expression, proliferation, and karyometric features of nuclear abnormality. In both the ovary and fallopian tube, levonorgestrel did not confer significant changes in apoptosis or expression of the TGFβ1, 2, or 3 isoforms. In the ovarian epithelium, treatment with levonorgestrel significantly decreased the proliferation index. The mean ovarian Ki-67 value in the placebo arm was 2.027 per 100 cells versus 0.775 per 100 cells in the levonorgestrel arm (two-sided P value via Mann-Whitney U test = 0.0114). The karyometric signature of nuclei in both the ovarian and FTE deviated significantly from normal controls (women at average risk of ovarian cancer), but was significantly less abnormal in women treated with levonorgestrel. These karyometric data further support the idea that progestins may clear genetically abnormal cells and act as chemopreventive agents against ovarian and fallopian tube cancer.",Little Evidence of Antagonistic Selection in the Evolutionary Strata of Fungal Mating-Type Chromosomes (Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015196,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 13,"Recombination suppression on sex chromosomes often extends in a stepwise manner, generating evolutionary strata of differentiation between sex chromosomes. Sexual antagonism is a widely accepted explanation for evolutionary strata, postulating that sets of genes beneficial in only one sex are successively linked to the sex-determining locus. The anther-smut fungus Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae has mating-type chromosomes with evolutionary strata, only some of which link mating-type genes. Male and female roles are non-existent in this fungus, but mating-type antagonistic selection can also generate evolutionary strata, although the life cycle of the fungus suggests it should be restricted to few traits. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mating-type antagonism may have triggered recombination suppression beyond mating-type genes in M. lychnidis-dioicae by searching for footprints of antagonistic selection in evolutionary strata not linking mating-type loci. We found that these evolutionary strata (i) were not enriched in genes upregulated in the haploid phase, where cells are of alternative mating types, (ii) carried no gene differentially expressed between mating types, and (iii) carried no genes displaying footprints of specialization in terms of protein sequences (dN/dS) between mating types after recommended filtering. Without filtering, eleven genes showed signs of positive selection in the strata not linking mating-type genes, which constituted an enrichment compared to autosomes, but their functions were not obviously involved in antagonistic selection. Thus, we found no strong evidence that antagonistic selection has contributed to extending recombination suppression beyond mating-type genes. Alternative hypotheses should therefore be explored to improve our understanding of the sex-related chromosome evolution.",A Novel QTL in Durum Wheat for Resistance to the Wheat Stem Sawfly Associated with Early Expression of Stem Solidness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015195,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 13,"The wheat stem sawfly (WSS) (Cephus cinctus Norton) is a major yield-reducing pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Varieties with pith-filled, or solid, stems provide a measure of resistance by inhibiting larval survival inside the stem. Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) has resistance to the wheat stem sawfly even in the absence of known genes for stem solidness. To determine the genetic basis of resistance in durum wheat, a susceptible durum wheat, PI 41353, was identified from among 1,211 landrace accessions from around the world screened in WSS-infested sites. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of 105 individuals was developed from a cross of PI 41353 with a typically resistant variety, Pierce. The RIL were screened in a total of three WSS-infested locations in Montana over a two year period. A genetic map was constructed with 2,867 SNP-based markers. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified six QTL associated with resistance. An allele from resistant cultivar Pierce at a QTL on chromosome 3A, Qss.msub-3AL, caused a 25% reduction in stem cutting. Assessment of near-isogenic lines that varied for alleles at Qss.msub-3AL showed that the Pierce allele was also associated with higher stem solidness as measured early in stem development, which is a critical stage for WSS oviposition and larval development. Stem solidness of Pierce and other resistant durum wheat lines largely disappeared later in plant development. Results suggest a genetic mechanism for WSS resistance observed in durum wheat, and provide an additional source of WSS resistance for hexaploid bread wheat."

Drugs and drug resistance,2019 06 07,"Giardia duodenalis is an ubiquitous parasitic pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Failures in drug therapy are commonly due to poor patient compliance as a result of the need for repeated administration, off target drug effects and increasing parasite drug resistance. In this study the in vitro efficacy and selectivity of the aminoguanidine compound robenidine and 2 structural analogues against Giardia were determined. After 5 h exposure to each compound the IC50 was as low as 0.2 μM with corresponding MLCs as low as 2.8 μM. This is in contrast to metronidazole which required 24 h to exhibit inhibitory activity. A modified adherence assay, developed for this study, demonstrated that three of the compounds inhibited in vitro adherence of the parasite.

Drugs and drug resistance,2019 06 07,"Infections with parasitic nematodes are among the most significant of the neglected tropical diseases affecting about a billion people living mainly in tropical regions with low economic activity. The most effective current strategy to control nematode infections involves large scale treatment programs with anthelmintic drugs. This strategy is at risk from the emergence of drug resistant parasites. Parasitic nematodes also affect livestock, which are treated with the same limited group of anthelmintic drugs. Livestock parasites resistant to single drugs, and even multi-drug resistant parasites, are appearing in many areas. There is therefore a pressing need for new anthelmintic drugs. Here we use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model for parasitic nematodes and demonstrate that sinefungin, a competitive inhibitor of methyltransferases, causes a delay in development and reduced fecundity, and inhibits spliced leader trans-splicing. Spliced leader trans-splicing is an essential step in gene expression that does not occur in the hosts of parasitic nematodes, and is therefore a potential target for new anthelmintic drugs. We have exploited the ability of sinefungin to inhibit spliced leader trans-splicing to adapt a green fluorescent protein based reporter gene assay that monitors spliced leader trans-splicing for high-throughput screening for new anthelmintic compounds. We have established a protocol for robust high-throughput screening, combining mechanical dispensing of living C. elegans into 384- or 1536- well plates with addition of compounds using an acoustic liquid dispenser, and the detection of the inhibition of SL trans-splicing using a microplate reader. We have tested this protocol in a first pilot screen and envisage that this assay will be a valuable tool in the search for new anthelmintic drugs.","Clinical series of Parkinson's disease in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: Retrospective chart review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015149,Journal of the neurological sciences,2019 06 09,There is limited data on Parkinson's disease (PD) in South Africa.,Hyperglycemia induces mechanical hyperalgesia and depolarization of the resting membrane potential of primary nociceptive neurons: Role of ATP-sensitive potassium channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015148,Journal of the neurological sciences,2019 06 09,"Cumulating data suggests that ion channel alterations in nociceptive neurons might be involved in the development of diabetic painful neuropathy.

High glucose concentrations depolarized cultured nociceptive neurons and depolarization was blocked by the K+ATP opener, diazoxide or by insulin. Glucose injection at the rat dorsal root ganglia (L5) resulted in acute mechanical hyperalgesia that was blocked by diazoxide. Mannitol injection indicates that osmolarity changes are not responsible for glucose effect. Therefore, this study suggests that K+ATP channels expressed in peripheral sensory neurons might be involved in the development of diabetic painful neuropathy. Since sulfonylureas, that act by blocking K+ATP are used for diabetes treatment, it is important to evaluate the possible side effects of such drugs at primary sensory neurons.",Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation rescues cerebromicrovascular endothelial function and neurovascular coupling responses and improves cognitive function in aged mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015147,Redox biology,2019 06 10,"Adjustment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to neuronal activity via neurovascular coupling (NVC) has an essential role in maintenance of healthy cognitive function. In aging increased oxidative stress and cerebromicrovascular endothelial dysfunction impair NVC, contributing to cognitive decline. There is increasing evidence showing that a decrease in NAD+ availability with age plays a critical role in a range of age-related cellular impairments but its role in impaired NVC responses remains unexplored. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that restoring NAD+ concentration may exert beneficial effects on NVC responses in aging. To test this hypothesis 24-month-old C57BL/6 mice were treated with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a key NAD+ intermediate, for 2 weeks. NVC was assessed by measuring CBF responses (laser Doppler flowmetry) evoked by contralateral whisker stimulation. We found that NVC responses were significantly impaired in aged mice. NMN supplementation rescued NVC responses by increasing endothelial NO-mediated vasodilation, which was associated with significantly improved spatial working memory and gait coordination. These findings are paralleled by the sirtuin-dependent protective effects of NMN on mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial bioenergetics in cultured cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells derived from aged animals. Thus, a decrease in NAD+ availability contributes to age-related cerebromicrovascular dysfunction, exacerbating cognitive decline. The cerebromicrovascular protective effects of NMN highlight the preventive and therapeutic potential of NAD+ intermediates as effective interventions in patients at risk for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI)."

Increasing municipal water demands and droughts are straining agricultural water supplies. Therefore, alternative solutions to agricultural water crises are urgently needed, including the use of nontraditional water sources such as advanced treated wastewater or reclaimed water, brackish water, return flows, and effluent from produce processing facilities. However, it is critical to ensure that such usage does not compromise soil, crop, and public health. Here, we characterized five different nontraditional water types (n = 357 samples) for the presence of pharmaceuticals, herbicides, and disinfectants using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry based method (UPLC-MS/MS). We then evaluated whether the levels of these contaminants were influenced by season. The highest level of herbicides (atrazine) was detected in untreated pond water (median concentration 135.9 ng/L). Reclaimed water had the highest levels of antibiotics and stimulants including azithromycin (215 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (232.1 ng/L), and caffeine (89.4 ng/L). Produce processing plant water also tended to have high levels of atrazine (102.7 ng/L) and ciprofloxacin (80.1 ng/L). In addition, we observed seasonal variability across water types, with the highest atrazine concentrations observed during summer months, while the highest median azithromycin concentrations were observed in reclaimed water during the winter season. Further studies are needed to evaluate if economically feasible on-farm water treatment technologies can effectively remove such contaminants from nontraditional irrigation water sources.",Deformation behavior of porous PHBV scaffold in compression: A finite element analysis study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015108,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 07,"Macroscopic mechanical properties of porous PHBV bone TE scaffolds have been well studied. However, their mechanical behavior at microscopic level has yet to be explored. In this study, the micro-mechanical behavior of a PHBV bone scaffold under compression was investigated using a numerical method that combines micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) and finite element analysis (FEA). It was found that the use of a linear-elastic model resulted in an overestimation of the stiffness of the scaffold, whereas a more realistic estimation of the scaffold's deformation behavior was obtained by utilizing a bilinear material model. The onset of plastic deformation occurred in the very early stage of loading resulting in significantly reduced stiffness of the scaffold. The non-uniform and arbitrary microstructure of the scaffold led to a heterogeneous stress distribution within the porous construct, which was subjected to a mixture of compressive and tensile stresses. Nevertheless, the resultant stress contours showed that the scaffold experienced primarily elastic deformation when it was loaded up to 0.003 strain, while localized plastic deformation occurred at sharp corners and necked regions of the micro-struts. The scaffold expanded slightly in the horizontal direction as it was compressed and the change in geometries of pores within the scaffold was insignificant. The proposed method provides a valuable tool to study the localized mechanical behavior of bone scaffolds in micrometer scale with arbitrary porous architecture. This approach could prove highly useful for guiding the fabrication of scaffolds that have anatomy specific mechanical properties and porous architecture.",Family planning in Pakistan: A site of resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015107,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 05 13,"As the population of Pakistan has increased beyond 200 million, it is evident that the country's family planning program has been unable to sufficiently expand contraceptive use. To understand the obstacles, researchers have tended to focus on service delivery failures, 'cultural' barriers and varying political support. However, a small body of literature documents citizen's suspicions of an ulterior motive underlying Pakistan's family planning program. Often dismissed as unfounded conspiracies, a gap in our knowledge is the role these beliefs might be playing in the failure of the program. Using a critical ethnographic approach, we conduced 242 observations of daily life, 109 informal and 197 in-depth interviews with 41 women and 35 men living in a village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Data were collected between September 2013 and April 2015 and analysed using latent content analysis. Our respondents viewed Western support for family planning as confirmation of their suspicions of the program's hidden agenda. Western military intervention in the region complicated their beliefs about the potential altruistic nature of foreign support for the family planning program. Awareness of rampant corruption among Pakistani government officials had fractured their trust in the state while contributing to the notion that the government was complicit with foreign interference. These considerations coupled with the fact that the priorities of Pakistani Family Planning program did not align with the reality of their lives contributed to the skepticism of family planning. For our respondents, resisting family planning and its ideology was a means to resist the perceived violence inflicted by the West and the complicity of the Pakistani government. These findings signal how geopolitics influence the use of family planning services. By demonstrating the importance of embedding perceptions of family planning programs in their local and global contexts, these findings suggest potential areas for future research in the field.",Dual drug loaded liposome bearing apigenin and 5-Fluorouracil for synergistic therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015105,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"Multidrug-based combinatorial therapeutic regiments which target multiple pathways simultaneously are being utilized as a therapeutic strategy of choice due to reduction in toxicity profile and enhancement of therapeutic index of the individual drugs. 5-Fluorouracil is a clinically approved drug which has limited response rate in the realm of colorectal cancer amelioration, hence our study aims to improve its efficacy by aiming the simultaneous delivery of 5-Flurouracil and apigenin which is naturally occurring flavone abundantly present in fruit and vegetables through a single liposome to combat and control colorectal cancer effectively in-vitro and in-vivo. The liposomal nanocarrier bearing the anti-tumorigenic agent apigenin was designed in this study in order to improve the bioavailability of the flavone while at the same time achieve combinatorial drug regime with 5- Fluorouracil. This study reports the synthesis and production of a relatively robust dual drug-loaded liposomal formulation by modified thin film hydration method which substantially entraps both the drugs. Even though there have been reports of the combinatorial regimen involving apigenin and 5-Flurouracil our study reports the optimal molar ratio for effective synergistic therapeutic application of this drug combination to alleviate colorectal cancer. The cytotoxicity and cellular effects of individual, combinatorial free drugs and their liposomal counterparts tested against two human colon cancer cell lines revealed significantly higher cytotoxicity of the dual-drug liposomes. The dual-drug liposomes demonstrated enhanced inhibition of angiogenesis, better reduction in cell proliferation and increased apoptotic potential. Cell signaling studies indicating a significant upregulation of pAMPK and activity against downstream targets by dual drug liposomes suggested its role in the reversal of Warburg effect. The formulation was tested in a preclinical setting in nude mice tumor xenograft model and was found to have greater anti-neoplastic and anti-tumorigenic effect. The study indicated that the increased chemotherapeutic potential in vivo was due to the passive targeting achieved by the liposomal drug loaded nano-carrier and the synergistic effect of apigenin in 5-Fluorouracil treatment offers a new attractive alternative to enhance the therapeutic potency of drugs and paves way for potential clinical applications.",Recent advances in neuroepigenetic editing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015104,Current opinion in neurobiology,2019 06 11,"A wealth of studies in the mammalian nervous system indicate the role of epigenetic gene regulation in both basic neurobiological function and disease. However, the relationship between epigenetic regulation and neuropathology is largely correlational due to the presence of mixed cell populations within brain regions and the genome-wide effects of classical approaches to manipulate the epigenome. Locus-specific epigenetic editing allows direct epigenetic regulation of specific genes to elucidate the direct causal relationship between epigenetic modifications and transcription. This review discusses some of the latest innovations in the efficacy and flexibility in this approach that hold promise for neurobiological application.","1,2,4-Triazole-quinoline/quinolone hybrids as potential anti-bacterial agents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015103,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 11,"Bacterial infections, caused predominately by Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, are proliferation of harmful strains of bacteria on or inside the body.

We confronted the same olive cultivar from two different location in Spain: Freila, in the Granada province, with low annual precipitation, and Grazalema, in the Cadiz province, with high annual precipitation, and subjected them to five weeks of severe drought stress. We found distinctive physiological and developmental adaptations among the two provenances. Thus, trees from Freila subjected to drought stress exhibited increasing root dry weights and decreasing leaf numbers and relative stem heights. On the other hand, the treatment with drought in Grazalema trees reduced their leaf chlorophyll contents, but increased their relative stem diameter and their root hydraulic conductivity. The physiological responses of Freila tree roots to drought were linked to different molecular adaptations that involved the regulation of genes related to transcription factors induced by ABA, auxin and ethylene signaling, as well as, the action of a predicted membrane intrinsic protein (MIP). On the other hand, the responses of Grazalema trees were related with different root genes related to oxidation-reduction, ATP synthesis, transduction and posttranslational regulation, with a special mention to the cytokinins signaling through the transcript predicted as a histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein. Our results show that olive trees adapted to dry environments will adjust their growth and water uptake capacity through transcription factors regulation, and this will influence the different physiological responses to drought stress.",Hydraulic recovery from xylem embolism in excised branches of twelve woody species: Relationships with parenchyma cells and non-structural carbohydrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015090,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 05 17,"Embolism repair ability has been documented in numerous species. Although the actual mechanism driving this phenomenon is still debated, experimental findings suggest that non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) stored in wood parenchyma would provide the osmotic forces to drive the refilling of embolized conduits. We selected 12 broadleaved species differing in vulnerability to xylem embolism (P50) and amount of wood parenchyma in order to check direct evidence about the possible link(s) between parenchyma cells abundance, NSC availability and species-specific capacity to reverse xylem embolism. Branches were dehydrated until ∼50% loss of hydraulic conductivity was recorded (PLC ∼50%). Hydraulic recovery (ΔPLC) and NSC content was, then, assessed after 1h of rehydration. Species showed a different ability to recover their hydraulic conductivity from PLC∼50%. Removing the bark in the species showing hydraulic recovery inhibited the embolism reversal. Strong correlations between the ΔPLC and: a) the amount of parenchyma cells (mainly driven by the pith area), b) the consumption of soluble NSC have been recorded. Our results support the hypothesis that refilling of embolized vessels is mediated by the mobilization of soluble NSC and it is mainly recorded in species with a higher percentage of parenchyma cells that may be important in the hydraulic recovery mechanism as a source of carbohydrates and/or as a source of water.",An apple (Malus domestica) NAC transcription factor enhances drought tolerance in transgenic apple plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015089,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 05 17,"Plant NAC proteins constitute one of the largest transcription factor families. They play pivotal functions during responses to various abiotic stresses. However, knowledge on roles of NAC proteins in abiotic stress tolerance as well as corresponding mechanisms has not been fully studied in perennial woody plants, including domesticated apple (Malus domestica). In the present study, we characterized the role of apple MdNAC1 transcription factor in response to drought stress. Apple plants overexpressing MdNAC1 gene exhibited promoted tolerance to drought stress, as evident by reduced water loss and electrolyte leakage in leaves, and maintenance of photosynthesis and photosynthetic pigments content under drought conditions. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly lower for transgenic apple lines than those for nontransgenic plants under drought conditions. This was accompanied by higher activities of several antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), as well as increased expression of the associated genes in transgenic lines. Together, our results indicate that overexpression of the apple MdNAC1 gene enhances drought stress tolerance in apple plants by promoting higher photosynthesis and activities of ROS-scavenging enzymes.","Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015088,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 05 17,"The chloroplast is an important organelle that performs photosynthesis as well as biosynthesis and storage of many metabolites. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are key enzymes in protein synthesis. However, the relationship between chloroplast development and aaRSs still remains unclear. In this study, we isolated a rice albino 1 (ra1) mutant through methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis of rice japonica cultivar Ningjing 4 (Oryza sativa L.), which displayed albinic leaves in seedling stage due to abnormal chloroplast development. Compared with wild type (WT), ra1 showed significantly decreased levels of chlorophylls (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) in 2-week-old seedlings, which also showed obvious plastidic structural defects including abnormal thylakoid membrane structures and more osmiophilic particles. These defects caused albino phenotypes in seedlings. Map-based cloning revealed that RA1 gene encodes a glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), which was confirmed by genetic complementation and knockout by Crispr/Cas9 technology. Sequence analysis showed that a single base mutation (T to A) occurred in the sixth exon of RA1 and resulted in a change from Isoleucine (Ile) to Lysine (Lys). Real-time PCR analyses showed that RA1 expression levels were constitutive in most tissues, but most abundant in the leaves and stems. By transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, we found that RA1 protein was localized in the chloroplast. Expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthesis and plastid development related genes were disordered in the ra1 mutant. RNA analysis revealed biogenesis of chloroplast rRNAs was abnormal in ra1. Meanwhile, western blotting showed that synthesis of proteins associated with plastid development was significantly repressed. These results suggest that RA1 is involved in early chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.",High-flux ultrafiltration membrane with open porous hydrophilic structure using dual pore formers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015087,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"This work investigated the synergistic effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) as dual pore forming agents on the properties and performance of polysulfone (PSf) ultrafiltration membranes. A fixed concentration of PVP and varying concentrations of HP-β-CD were used to prepare the membranes using the phase inversion technique. The results showed that the inclusion of these additives in the dope solution increased its thermodynamic instability and promoted instantaneous demixing. Overall, an increase was observed in the hydrophilicity, open porous structure and mechanical strength of the membranes. Cross-flow filtration tests demonstrated that the pure water permeability of the fabricated membrane was 891 LMH bar-1, about 4.37 times higher than the pristine membrane, while bovine serum albumin (BSA) rejection was relatively constant (about 93%) for all the fabricated membranes. This work proposed that the addition of HP-β-CD and PVP as dual pore formers can produce a viable ultrafiltration membrane with improved water permeability without a middle ground on rejection potential.",Rapid Cr(VI) reduction and immobilization in contaminated soil by mechanochemical treatment with calcium polysulfide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015086,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"Mechanochemical treatment with calcium polysulfide (CPS) was applied to remediate the Cr(VI) contaminated soil. The effects of parameters including milling speed, milling time, ball to powder ratio (BPR) and dosage of CPS were investigated. The effectiveness of mechanical treatment with or without CPS is estimated by analyzing the leachable fraction of Cr(VI). The results show that mechanochemical treatment with CPS can decrease and immobilize Cr in soil more quickly and efficiently with comparison to the case without additive. Under a milling speed of 500 rpm, milling time of 2 h, BPR of 9 and CPS dosage of 3%, the Cr(VI) leaching concentration significantly decreased from 115 mg L-1 to 0.51 mg L-1, much lower than the regulatory limit of 5 mg L-1. Additionally, XPS results demonstrated that Cr(VI) can be converted into Cr(III) during ball milling with CPS. The high Cr(VI) removal and Cr immobilization capacity makes mechanochemical treatment a great potential in field remediation.",Effective mineralization of quinoline and bio-treated coking wastewater by catalytic ozonation using CuFe2O4/Sepiolite catalyst: Efficiency and mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015085,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"In this study, CuFe2O4 nanocomposite loaded on natural sepiolite (CuFe2O4/SEP) was prepared by the citrate sol-gel method. CuFe2O4/SEP was characterized by X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller adsorption analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The CuFe2O4/SEP composite was stable and showed an excellent catalytic activity for ozonation. The efficiency of quinoline mineralization in the catalytic ozonation with CuFe2O4/SEP was 90.3%, and this value was 5.4 times higher than that of the uncatalyzed ozonation (16.8%). The quinoline mineralization followed a pseudo first-order kinetics with all the catalysts. The rate constant for the mineralization of quinoline by ozonation in the presence of CuFe2O4/SEP was 0.0885 min-1, which was 16.7 times higher than that in ozone alone (0.0053 min-1). Radical scavenging tests revealed that hydroxyl radical (OH) and superoxide radical (O2-) were the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the quinoline degradation. In the presence of CuFe2O4/SEP, ozone and hydrogen peroxide were rapidly converted into the ROS. Although neutral and alkaline pH were more beneficial for the quinoline mineralization, CuFe2O4/SEP exhibited significant catalytic activity even under acidic conditions. Meanwhile, five-cycle successive tests suggested that CuFe2O4/SEP was recyclable and hence, stable. Furthermore, the feasibility of the catalytic ozonation for the treatment of biologically treated coking wastewater was evaluated. The catalytic ozonation resulted in 57.81% total organic carbon removal efficiency at 60 min, which was 2.9 times higher than that in the uncatalyzed ozonation (19.99%).",Comparative geochemical evaluation of toxic metals pollution and bacterial communities of industrial effluent tributary and a receiving estuary in Nigeria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015084,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"Toxic metals/metalloid contaminations of estuarine sediments due to compromised tributaries arouse significant interest in studying bacterial community that triggers natural attenuation processes. Geo-accumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (CF), pollution load index (PLI), and Hakanson potential ecological risk index (RI) as a sum of risk factors (Er) were used to quantify toxic metal/metalloid-pollution status of Lagos Lagoon (2W) and 'Iya-Alaro' tributary (4W) sediments in comparison with pristine 'Lekki Conservation Centre' sediment (L1-B). Bacteriology of the ecosystems was based on culture-independent analyses using pyrosequencing. 2W and 4W were extremely contaminated with mercury (Igeo > 7), whereas, cadmium contamination was only observed in 4W. The two ecosystems were polluted with toxic metal based on PLI, where mercury (Er = 2900 and 1900 for 4W and 2W, respectively) posed very high ecological risks. Molecular fingerprinting revealed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Acidobacteria predominately contributed the 20 most abundant genera in the two ecosystems. The 240 and 310 species present in 2W and 4W, respectively, but absent in L1-B, thrive under the metal concentrations in the polluted hydrosphere. Whereas, the 58,000 species missing in 2W and 4W but found in L1-B would serve as indicators for systems impacted with metal eco-toxicity. Despite toxic metal pollution of the ecosystems understudied, bacterial communities play vital roles in self-recovery processes occurring in the hydrosphere.",Effect of metal oxide nanoparticles on amino acids in wheat grains (Triticum aestivum) in a life cycle study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015082,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 15,"Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are now used as additives in pesticides and fungicides and as novel fertilizers in agriculture so there is an urgent need to explore their effects on crop yield and quality in a full life cycle study. In the present study, three widely used NPs (TiO2, Fe2O3 and CuO NPs applied at doses of 50 and 500 mg/kg) were selected to investigate their long-term impact on wheat growth. TiO2 NPs did not affect the growth and development of wheat, but Fe2O3 NPs promoted wheat precocity and CuO NPs inhibited the growth and development of the wheat grains. The Cu content in grains treated with CuO NP increased by 18.84%-30.45% compared with the control. However, the contents of Fe and Zn were both significantly lower in the CuO NP treatments. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the effect of different NPs on the composition of amino acids in wheat grains. Exposure to TiO2 NPs at dose of 500 mg/kg increased the overall amino acid nutrition in the edible portion of wheat. Fe2O3 NPs at both doses increased the contents of cysteine (Cys) and tyrosine (Tyr). The addition of CuO NPs reduced the level of some essential amino acids in wheat grains, isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), threonine (Thr) and histidine (His). Overall, evaluation of the potential impacts of metal-based NPs on the nutritional quality of wheat grains could provide important information for their safe use when incorporated into agrichemicals in sustainable agriculture."

Given the known antidepressant-like effects of incensole and incensole acetate, we herein present that the low dose intraperitoneal administration of incensole derivatives, namely, incensfuran and incensone, showed significant antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Furthermore, these compounds were evaluated for their anxiolytic potential in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and light dark box (LDB) tests and anticonvulsant effects in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure tests. In the EPM test, administration of these compounds led to dose-dependent increases in open arm entries and in the time spent in EPM open arms. Similar results were obtained in the LDB test, wherein compounds these caused significant increases in the number of transitions between lit and dark compartments and the time spent in the lit compartment. The anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM were not reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil, whereas PTZ and bicuculline (BIC) completely abolished the anxiolytic effects, showing the involvement of the non-benzodiazepine binding sites of GABAA receptors. All four compounds induced significantly elevated brain GABA levels, indicating the involvement of a GABAergic mechanism. Additionally, molecular docking was conducted to elucidate the mode of action for the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects of these derivatives.

We evaluated the effects of intranasal OT and AVP compared to placebo control during three double-blinded functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions. Twenty males received a pseudo-randomized order of nasal spray conditions and rated the trustworthiness and dominance of neutral faces. OT increased facial dominance ratings compared to placebo. Neuroimaging results revealed an inverse relationship between brain activation and face ratings for OT compared to placebo in regions involved in processing emotional expressions. Specifically, the right superior temporal gyrus was attenuated as ratings increased and the left precuneus selectively diminished with increasing dominance ratings. Additionally, OT increased functional connectivity between frontoparietal regions and the right amygdala for faces rated as highly dominant, but OT increased connectivity between the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, and bilateral ventral tegmental area (VTA) for faces perceived as highly trustworthy. Overall, OT increased the perception of dominance but did not influence trustworthiness judgments. However, we observed regional neural effects for OT that differed between judgments of trustworthiness and dominance. AVP attenuated left temporoparietal junction activity as face ratings increased, a result consistent with AVP influencing mentalization. AVP also led to increased left amygdala and right VTA connectivity with the putamen, which is consistent with cue-driven, habitual responses.",Cognitive and emotional empathy in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: A replication and extension study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015067,Psychiatry research,2019 05 28,"Impairments of social cognition are defined as core features in the pathology of schizophrenia. In a study by Lehmann and colleagues (2014), patients with schizophrenia have been shown to demonstrate a diminished capacity to understand others' emotions (i.e. cognitive empathy), but a preserved ability to share or feel the emotional states of others (i.e. emotional empathy). Here, we report on an independent replication study investigating cognitive and emotional empathy in 35 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and a matched control group, which 1) confirms that patients demonstrate preserved emotional empathy in self-report and behavioural measurements, and 2) reveals associations between emotional empathy and social anhedonia in patients.","Molecular characterization, expression patterns, and functional analysis of toll-interacting protein (Tollip) in Japanese eel Anguilla japonica.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015066,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 28,"Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) is a key negative regulator of TLR-mediated innate immune responses. The structure and function of Tollip have been well identified in mammals, but the information about Tollip is still limited in teleost fishes. In the present study, the homologue of Tollip was cloned from Japanese eel. It contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 276 amino acids which shared high identities with other homologues from different species. Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequence showed that the AjTollip protein has the typical conserved domains including an N-terminal Target of Myb1 (Tom1) binding domain (TBD), a central conserved 2 (C2) domain, and a C-terminal coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation (CUE) domain. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed a broad expression for AjTollip in a wide range of tissues, with the highest expression in the liver, a relatively high expression in the spleen, kidney, gills, skin and intestine, and a low expression in the heart and muscle. The AjTollip expressions in the liver and kidney were significantly induced following injection with the bacterial mimic LPS, the viral mimic poly I:C, and Aeromonas hydrophila infection. In vitro, the AjTollip transcripts of Japanese eel liver cells were significantly enhanced by the treatment of LPS, poly I:C, CpG-DNA, and PGN or the stimulation of high concentration of Aeromonas hydrophila (1 × 107 cfu/mL and 1 × 108 cfu/mL). Subcellular localization study showed that AjTollip was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm in a condensed state. When AjTollip was co-transfected with AjMyD88 into HEK293 cells, the luciferase activities of NF-κB were significantly decreased compared with that of AjMyD88 single-transfection groups in natural state or under the stimulation of LPS and poly I:C. These results collectively suggested that AjTollip functions as a negative regulator of MyD88-dependent TLR signaling and plays an important role in fish defense against viral and bacterial infections.","Glutaredoxin 1 from big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis): Molecular, transcriptional, and functional evidence in teleost immune responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015065,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 28,"Glutaredoxins (Grx) are redox enzymes conserved in viruses, eukaryotes, and prokaryotes. In this study, we characterized glutaredoxin 1 (HaGrx1) from big-belly seahorse, Hippocampus abdominalis. In-silico analysis showed that HaGrx1 contained the classical glutaredoxin 1 structure with a CSYC thioredoxin active site motif. According to multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction, HaGrx1 presented the highest homology to the Grx1 ortholog from Hippocampus comes. Transcriptional studies demonstrated the ubiquitous distribution of HaGrx1 transcripts in all the seahorse tissues tested. Significant modulation (p < 0.05) of HaGrx1 transcripts were observed in blood upon stimulation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns and live pathogens. The β-hydroxyethyl disulfide reduction assay confirmed the antioxidant activity of recombinant HaGrx1. Further, dehydroascorbate reduction and insulin disulfide reduction assays revealed the oxidoreductase activity of HaGrx1. HaGrx1 utilized 1,4-dithiothreitol, l-cysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol, and reduced l-glutathione as reducing agent with different dehydroascorbate reduction activity levels. Altogether, our results suggested a vital role of HaGrx1 in redox homeostasis as well as the host innate immune defense system.",A developed subunit vaccine based on fiber protein VP56 of grass carp reovirus providing immune protection against grass carp hemorrhagic disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015064,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 28,"Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) is the main viral pathogen that endangers grass carp seriously. Application of vaccine has been considered to be the most effective way to prevent virus infection. VP56 is a protein encoded by gene segment 7 of grass carp reovirus, and is predicted to share homology with fiber protein of mammalian reovirus (MRV). In our study, the immunogenicity of VP56 was evaluated by neutralization test. GCRV was incubated with mouse anti-VP56 antibody, and then was injected into grass carp. Results showed that disease progress and death occurrence was hindered in the experimental group compared with the control group. For further study, the recombinant VP56 protein (rVP56) expressed by pET-32a (+) vector was purified, and was used as subunit vaccine to immunize grass carp. After each fish (15 ± 1.5 g) was injected with 30 μg purified rVP56 intraperitoneally, the immune protective efficacy of recombinant VP56 protein was assessed by a series of immune parameters. The population of red blood cells in immunized fish increased significantly after 5 d post injection (dpi), and reached a peak with (2.98 ± 0.17) × 109/ml at 7 dpi (p < 0.05). The numbers of white blood cells peaked with (8.42 ± 1.01) × 107/ml at 7 dpi (p < 0.05). Additionally, the percentage of monocytes and neutrophils rose to a peak with (9.05 ± 0.92)% and (25.93 ± 2.60)% respectively at 5 dpi (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), whereas lymphocytes reached the highest value of (85.81 ± 2.73) % at 14 dpi (p < 0.01). Serum antibody titer in the vaccinated fish increased significantly and reached a peak at 21 dpi (p < 0.01). The mRNA expression levels of type I interferon (IFN1), major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), Toll-like receptor 22 (TLR22), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were significantly up-regulated in head kidney and spleen (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The GCRV challenge test showed that the relative survival rate in immunized group was 71%-75%. Collectively, the results indicated that rVP56 protein can induce immune protection in grass carp, and can be consider as a candidate vaccine against GCRV infection.",High doses of Francisella noatunensis induces an immune response in Eleginops maclovinus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015063,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 28,"Francisella noatunensis subsp. noatunensis, the etiological agent of Francisellosis, affects a large number of farmed species such as Salmo salar. This species coexists with several native species in the same ecosystem, including Eleginops maclovinus. Our objective was to evaluate the susceptibility, presence of clinical symptoms, and the ability of Eleginops maclovinus to respond to Francisella infection. For this, healthy individuals were inoculated with 1.5 × 101, 1.5 × 105, and 1.5 × 1010 bact/μL of Francisella by intraperitoneal injection, subsequently the fish were sampled on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 post injection (dpi). At the end of the experiment, no mortality, nor internal and external clinical signs were observed, although in the high dose anaemia was detected. Additionally, bacteria were detected in all three doses, however there was replication at day 28 only in the liver in the high dose. Analysis of gene expression by qPCR showed that the spleen generated an immune response against infection from day 1 dpi, however at day 7 dpi most of the genes suffered repressed expression; observing over expression of the genes C3, NLRC3, NLRC5, MHCI, IgM. In contrast, expression in the anterior kidney did not vary significantly during the challenge. IgM quantification showed the production of antibodies in the medium and high doses. This study provides new knowledge about Francisella infection and the long-lasting and specific immune response generated by Eleginops maclovinus. It also demonstrates its susceptibility to Francisellosis where there is a difference in the immune response according to the tissue.",Nonlinearity and amplification in cochlear responses to single and multi-tone stimuli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015062,Hearing research,2019 05 14,"Mechanical displacements of the basilar membrane (BM) and the electrophysiological responses of the auditory outer hair cells (OHCs) are key components of the frequency tuning and cochlear amplification in the mammalian cochlea. In the work presented here, we measured the responses of (1) the extracellular voltage generated by OHCs (VOHC) and (2) displacements within the organ of Corti complex (OCC) to a multi-tone stimulus, and to single tones. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we were able to measure displacements of different layers in the OCC simultaneously, in the base of the gerbil cochlea. We explored the effect of the two types of sound stimuli to the nonlinear behavior of voltage and displacement in two frequency regions: a frequency region below the BM nonlinearity (sub-BF region: f < ∼0.7 BF), and in the best frequency (BF) region. In the sub-BF region, BM motion (XBM) had linear growth for both stimulus types, and the motion in the OHC region (XOHC) was mildly nonlinear for single tones, and relatively strongly nonlinear for multi-tones. Sub-BF, the nonlinear character of VOHC was similar to that of XOHC. In the BF region XBM, VOHC and XOHC all possessed the now-classic nonlinearity of the BF peak. Coupling these observations with previous findings on phasing between OHC force and traveling wave motions, we propose the following framework for cochlear nonlinearity: The BF-region nonlinearity is an amplifying nonlinearity, in which OHC forces input power into the traveling wave, allowing it to travel further apical to the region where it peaks. The sub-BF nonlinearity is a non-amplifying nonlinearity; it represents OHC electromotility, and saturates due to OHC current saturation, but the OHC forces do not possess the proper phasing to feed power into the traveling wave."

Bismuth titanate-based UV filters embedded into mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) represent a new class of inorganic sunscreens, with excellent UVA and UVB shielding properties. In addition, the presence of bismuth ions promotes a self-sealing process, allowing (i) the entrapment of the active phases in the deepest core of the system and (ii) the formation of an external glassy silica layer with a consequent suppression of the photocatalytic activity. In this work, aimed at studying in detail the self-sealing mechanism and accessing the role of bismuth ions in the formation of the system, a series of samples impregnated with a different amount of bismuth were investigated. The self-sealing process already occurs at the lowest content of bismuth and the mechanism is demonstrated to be triggered by the ability of Bi to work as a low-melting point agent for silica. Finally, a sunscreen formulation containing the new UV filter was prepared and the Sun Protection Factor (SPF), the pH and the viscosity were measured, demonstrating the potential of the proposed material for large-scale applications.",How does osteocalcin lacking γ-glutamic groups affect biomimetic apatite formation and what can we say about its structure in mineral-bound form?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015050,Journal of structural biology,2019 05 29,"Non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin function as regulators of the mineralization process in bone.

We analyze the structural features in the protein and mineral-protein interfaces to elicit the unmodified protein's fold inside the mineral and to unveil the species that interact with the mineral surface. The results presented here give clues on the protein's active role in controlling the mineral phases that are formed on hydroxyapatite crystals and its ability to influence the extent of order in these crystals.",Smeared multiscale finite element model for electrophysiology and ionic transport in biological tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015049,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 05 22,"Basic functions of living organisms are governed by the nervous system through bidirectional signals transmitted from the brain to neural networks. These signals are similar to electrical waves. In electrophysiology the goal is to study the electrical properties of biological cells and tissues, and the transmission of signals. From a physics perspective, there exists a field of electrical potential within the living body, the nervous system, extracellular space and cells. Electrophysiological problems can be investigated experimentally and also theoretically by developing appropriate mathematical or computational models. Due to the enormous complexity of biological systems, it would be almost impossible to establish a detailed computational model of the electrical field, even for only a single organ (e.g. heart), including the entirety of cells comprising the neural network. In order to make computational models feasible for practical applications, we here introduce the concept of smeared fields, which represents a generalization of the previously formulated multiscale smeared methodology for mass transport in blood vessels, lymph, and tissue. We demonstrate the accuracy of the smeared finite element computational models for the electric field in numerical examples. The electrical field is further coupled with ionic mass transport within tissue composed of interstitial spaces extracellularly and by cytoplasm and organelles intracellularly. The proposed methodology, which couples electrophysiology and molecular ionic transport, is applicable to a variety of biological systems.",Far-field contributions in multi-electrodes atrial recordings blur distinction between anatomical and functional reentries and may cause imaginary phase singularities - A computational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015048,Computers in biology and medicine,2019 05 22,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and the most important cause of embolic stroke, requiring new technologies for its better understanding and therapies.

However, there is a critical need to determine the accuracy of those mapping systems.

Our previous study identified hyperphosphorylated-tau as a critical toxic mediator in diabetic RGCs synaptic neurodegeneration. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting to tau may appear as a promising strategy to arrest the progression of DR. The glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, including liraglutide, can ameliorate neurodegenerative features in models of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes by decreasing tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain. Liraglutide has also been found to prevent retinal neural apoptosis/loss in diabetic mice. However, whether liraglutide can prevent diabetic synapse degeneration of RGCs, and its neuroprotective role, if any, is due to alleviating retinal tau hyperphosphorylation remain unknown. Here, using a well characterized high-fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetes mouse model, we showed that topical ocular administration of liraglutide reversed hyperphosphorylated tau-triggered RGCs synaptic degeneration in HFD-induced diabetes. The neuroprotective effect of liraglutide on diabetic retinae was abolished when GLP-1R or Akt was inhibited by topically co-administration with a GLP-1R antagonist, exendin-(9-39), or an Akt inhibitor MK2206, respectively. However, knock-down of GSK3β by intravitreal injection of si-GSK3β restored the neuroprotective effects of liraglutide abrogated by Akt inactivation. Thus, our present study demonstrated that liraglutide can arrest hyperphosphorylated tau-triggered retinal neurodegeneration via activation of GLP-1R/Akt/GSK3β signaling. Our results also propose that topical ocular application of liraglutide can be envisaged as a potentially useful strategy for the treatment of retinal tauopathy at the early onset of DR.","DynMat, a network that can learn after learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015043,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,2019 05 28,"To survive in the dynamically-evolving world, we accumulate knowledge and improve our skills based on experience. In the process, gaining new knowledge does not disrupt our vigilance to external stimuli. In other words, our learning process is 'accumulative' and 'online' without interruption. However, despite the recent success, artificial neural networks (ANNs) must be trained offline and suffer catastrophic interference between old and new learning, indicating that ANNs' conventional learning algorithms may not be suitable for building intelligent agents comparable to our brain. In this study, we propose a novel neural network architecture (DynMat) consisting of dual learning systems inspired by the complementary learning system (CLS) theory suggesting that the brain relies on short- and long-term learning systems to learn continuously.

It is worth to point out that, without desiring values of the initial conditions or under the linear growth condition of the controller, the settling time of fixed-time synchronization is estimated.

AHA and SRFA (2-20 mgC L-1) accelerated the phototransformation of both SAL and TBL. For SAL, an inhibiting effect of oxygen on the photodegradation was observed that is fully consistent with the main involvement of excited triplet states of HS (3HS*). On the contrary, oxygen drastically enhanced the photodegradation of TBL showing that 3HS* were negligibly involved in the reaction. The involvement of singlet oxygen was also ruled out because of the low reaction rate constant measured between TBL and singlet oxygen. Quantum calculations were therefore performed to explore whether oxygenated radicals could through addition reactions explain the differences of reactivity of TBL and SAL in oxygen medium. Interestingly, calculations showed that in the presence of oxygen, the addition of phenoxyl on TBL led to the formation of adducts and to the loss of TBL while the same addition reaction on SAL partly regenerated the starting compound and at the end degraded SAL less efficiently. This study is of high relevance to understand the processes involved in SAL and TBL phototransformation and the photoreactivity of HS. Moreover, our findings suggest that TBL might be a promising probe molecule to delineate the role of oxygenated radicals."

Most of these studies have not attempted to map preferred temporal frequency within and across visual areas, nor have they explored in detail, stimuli at gamma frequency, which recent research suggests may have potential clinical utility. In this study, we address this gap by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure response to flickering visual stimuli varying in frequency from 1 to 40 Hz. We apply stimulation in both a block design to examine task response and a steady-state design to examine functional connectivity. We observed distinct activation patterns between 1 Hz and 40 Hz stimuli. We also found that the correlation between medial thalamus and visual cortex was modulated by the temporal frequency. The modulation functions and tuned frequencies are different for the visual activity and thalamo-visual correlations. Using both fMRI activity and connectivity measurements, we show evidence for a temporal frequency specific organization across the human visual system.",Closing eyes during auditory memory retrieval modulates alpha rhythm but does not alter tau rhythm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015026,NeuroImage,2019 05 27,"The alpha power increase that occurs when the eyes are closed is one of the most well-known effects in human electrophysiology. In particular, previous psychological studies have investigated whether eye closure can boost memory performance under certain circumstances, providing contradictory evidence across sensory input modalities. Although alpha power is modulated during different phases of memory and these modulations are correlated with performance, few studies have reported on the relationship between eye closure, memory, and alpha-band power. The present study investigates the influence of eye closure while participants (n = 21) performed an auditory recognition memory task with spoken words during the recording of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Our results showed no evidence for a behavioural effect of eye closure in the performance of the task. In addition, electrophysiological responses to the stimuli showed the expected alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD) 0.5-1 s and a high-alpha/beta event-related synchronization (ERS) 1-2 s after word onset. The data showed the expected memory effect, i.e. remembered words elicited greater 10 Hz ERD than forgotten words in the brain regions typically associated with the language network, suggesting a modulation of tau rhythm. Eye closure modulated alpha rhythm only in posterior-parietal and occipital regions. The lack of interaction and the different localizations found for modulations of tau and classical alpha rhythms suggests that these rhythms play distinct functional roles in memory performance.",Prolonged exposure to highly rhythmic music affects brain dynamics and perception.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015025,Neuropsychologia,2019 06 16,"Rhythmic stimulation is a powerful tool to improve temporal prediction and parsing of the auditory signal. However, for long duration of stimulation, the rhythmic and repetitive aspects of music have often been associated to a trance state. In this study we conceived an auditory monitoring task that allows tracking changes of psychophysical auditory thresholds. Participants performed the task while listening to rhythmically regular and an irregular (scrambled but spectrally identical) music that were presented with an intermittent (short) and continuous (long) type of stimulation. Results show that psychophysical auditory thresholds increase following a Continuous versus Intermittent stimulation and this is accompanied by a reduction of the amplitude of two event-related potentials to target stimuli. These effects are larger with regular music, thus do not simply derive from the duration of stimulation. Interestingly, they seem to be related to a frequency selective neural coupling as well as an increase of network connectivity in the alpha band between frontal and central regions. Our study shows that the idea that rhythmic presentation of sensory stimuli facilitates perception might be limited to short streams, while long, highly regular, repetitive and strongly engaging streams may have an opposite perceptual impact.",Preparatory inhibition: Impact of choice in reaction time tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015024,Neuropsychologia,2019 06 16,"By applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over primary motor cortex (M1) to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in muscles of the contralateral hand during reaction time (RT) tasks, many studies have reported a strong global suppression of motor excitability during action preparation, a phenomenon called preparatory inhibition. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding the role of this broad suppression, with the predominant view that it reflects inhibitory processes assisting action selection. However, this assumption is still a matter of debate. Here, we aimed at directly addressing this idea by comparing MEPs in a task that required subjects to select a finger response within a set of predefined options (choice RT task: left or right index finger abduction) or when subjects simply had to provide the same finger response on every trial, in the absence of choice (simple RT task). Moreover, we minimized any effect that could be associated with other forms of inhibition. In both versions of the task, TMS was applied on both M1 (double-coil protocol) at several time points between the go signal and the left or right index finger response, eliciting MEPs bilaterally in the prime mover (index finger agonist) and in an irrelevant muscle (pinky agonist). Overall, MEP suppression was moderate in this study compared to past research; it was only found for the irrelevant muscle. As such, MEPs in the index agonist were facilitated when elicited in a responding hand (e.g. left MEPs preceding left responses) and remained mostly unchanged in a non-responding hand (e.g. left MEPs preceding right responses). In contrast, MEPs were almost always suppressed in the pinky muscle when elicited in the non-responding hand. This finding contrasts with previous studies where preparatory inhibition usually concerns both relevant and irrelevant muscles. Yet importantly, the suppression was more consistent in the choice than in the simple RT task, supporting the view that preparatory inhibition may assist action selection.",An integrated protocol for targeted mutagenesis with CRISPR-Cas9 system in the pea aphid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015023,Insect biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 06 02,"CRISPR-Cas9 technology is a very efficient functional analysis tool and has been developed in several insects to edit their genome through injection of eggs with guide RNAs targeting coding sequences of genes of interest. However, its implementation in aphids is more challenging. Aphids are major pests of crops worldwide that alternate during their life cycle between clonality and sexual reproduction. The production of eggs after mating of sexual individuals is a single yearly event and is necessarily triggered by a photoperiod decrease. Fertilized eggs then experience an obligate 3-month diapause period before hatching as new clonal colonies. Taking into consideration these particularities, we developed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum a step-by-step protocol of targeted mutagenesis based on the microinjection within fertilized eggs of CRISPR-Cas9 components designed for the editing of a cuticular protein gene (stylin-01). This protocol includes the following steps: i) the photoperiod-triggered induction of sexual morphs (2 months), ii) the mating and egg collection step (2 weeks), iii) egg microinjection and melanization, iv) the 3-month obligate diapause, v) the hatching of new lineages from injected eggs (2 weeks) and vi) the maintenance of stable lineages (2 weeks). Overall, this 7-month long procedure was applied to three different crosses in order to estimate the impact of the choice of the genetic combination on egg production dynamics by females as well as hatching rates after diapause. Mutation rates within eggs before diapause were estimated at 70-80%. The hatching rate of injected eggs following diapause ranged from 1 to 11% depending on the cross and finally a total of 17 stable lineages were obtained and maintained clonally. Out of these, 6 lineages were mutated at the defined sgRNAs target sites within stylin-01 coding sequence, either at the two alleles (2 lineages) or at one allele (4 lineages). The final germline transmission rate of the mutations was thus around 35%. Our protocol of an efficient targeted mutagenesis opens the avenue for functional studies through genome editing in aphids.",Mastering the art of epicardial access in cardiac electrophysiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015022,Heart rhythm,2019 06 04,"Access to the epicardial space is fundamental to several cardiac procedures. While traditional indications include catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias and accessory pathways, novel indications include left atrial appendage occlusion, esophageal protection, mapping and ablation during atrial fibrillation procedures, implantation of epicardial pacing leads, and phrenic nerve displacement to facilitate safe ablation of arrhythmias. Accessing the epicardial space safely is a major challenge requiring intimate knowledge of cardiac anatomy, extensive training, and expertise. Over the past years, multiple technological advances have led to significant improvements in epicardial access safety. Important examples of such advances include CO2 insufflation through the coronary sinus or the right atrial appendage, pressure sensor needle, computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and electroanatomic mapping-guided epicardial access. In addition, we provide special maneuvers to minimize right ventricular perforation.",Prospective insulin-based ophthalmic delivery systems for the treatment of dry eye syndrome and corneal injuries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015020,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2019 05 25,"The presence of insulin (INS) receptors on the ocular surface (OS) and lacrimal gland (LG), and the high prevalence of dry eye syndrome (DES) and corneal lesions in diabetic patients suggest that INS is relevant for OS homeostasis and wound healing. The study aims at developing delivery systems for the topical administration of INS to the OS in order to improve INS local bioavailability and evaluate the influence of the delivery systems on DES in diabetic rats (DM) (n = 05/group). Chitosan microparticles (MP), chitosan/poloxamer gel (GEL) and MP-loaded GEL (GELMP), with or without INS were developed. Formulations were instilled into the eyes of diabetic rats (DM) for 15 days and the tear fluid volume, corneal cells morphology and cornea thickness were assessed and compared with an aqueous dispersion of INS (DISP-INS). All delivery systems had pH of about 6, osmolality suitable for topical application and positive zeta potential. The MPs with or without INS had sizes close to 4 μm, spherical morphology and INS encapsulation efficiency of 77 ± 6%. DISP-INS and GELMP-INS formulations produced tear secretion amounts significantly higher than those receiving formulations containing no INS and similar to healthy animals. Cornea surface impression cytology showed that treatment with INS-delivery systems and not DISP-INS almost normalized cells morphology. Treatment with GELMP-INS increased INS by 2.5 in the LG and eyeball as compared to the groups treated with GEL-INS and MP-INS, while treatment with DISP-INS left no traces of drug in the eye after treatment termination. GEL and GELMP containing INS were also able to normalize the thickness of the corneal epithelia. In conclusion, GELMP-INS normalized tear fluid volume, corneal thickness, protected corneal cells morphology and increased ocular bioavailability of INS, making it a promising treatment strategy for DES and corneal lesions.",The suitability of liposomes for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs - A case study with curcumin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015019,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2019 05 25,"Liposomes are a popular formulation strategy for the delivery of anticancer drugs. While their benefits for formulating hydrophilic anticancer drugs have been clearly shown during the last decades, the suitability of liposomes for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs is questionable. Curcumin is a diphenolic plant compound that is extensively researched for its anticancer properties. It was chosen as a hydrophobic model drug in this study. Due to its low bioavailability, poor solubility and instability in aqueous media it is a highly problematic compound and requires particular formulation techniques. Curcumin liposomes with lipids of different rigidities were comprehensively investigated in respect to their physicochemical properties, their storage and serum stability. In vitro experiments were conducted with common 2D cell models and additionally with multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) as a more sophisticated tool to represent the physiology of avascular solid tumors. Our results indicate that liposomes containing the fluid phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) represent an excellent formulation to enhance the solubility and stability of curcumin. However, in presence of serum or cells, curcumin is rapidly released from the protecting and stabilizing lipid bilayer. Thus, improvement of the in vivo efficacy of curcumin is probably not achieved by using liposomes. Cytotoxicity and uptake experiments showed clearly a reduced effectivity of curcumin liposomes in the 3D cell model in comparison to the 2D model. This not only illustrates the limitations of monolayer cultures in predicting drug and nanocarrier interactions with solid tumors, but also further questions the use of liposomes as a formulation strategy in the treatment of solid tumors with curcumin.",ERP differences in processing canonical and noncanonical finger-numeral configurations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015018,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 15,"Finger-numeral configurations are used to represent numerosities, to count, and to do arithmetic across cultures. Previous research has distinguished between two forms of finger-numeral configurations; finger montring and finger counting. Montring refers to how people raise their fingers to show numerosities to others and usually serves a communicative function. Finger counting is used both for counting and arithmetic, and has a self-directed, facilitative function. In this study we compared the ERP markers for recognition of montring, counting, and noncanonical finger-numeral configurations with adult participants to explore differences in early perceptual and later semantic processing. Montring configurations were recognized faster and more accurately compared to counting and noncanonical. Recognition of montring configurations drew larger attentional resources, marked by higher positivity in the P1/N1 range, and montring and counting showed similar patterns of semantic processing, marked by higher positivity in the P3 range compared to noncanonical, possibly due to strategy differences (memory recall vs. counting). We also found some ERP evidence for participants' finger counting habits affecting their processing of counting configurations. Overall, the results show differences in perceptual and semantic processes involved in extracting numerical information across the three finger-numeral configurations.",Three-dimensional evaluation of labial alveolar bone overlying the maxillary and mandibular incisors in different skeletal classifications of malocclusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31015017,International orthodontics,2019 05 30,"The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in the thickness of the labial bone overlying the maxillary and mandibular incisors in class I, II, and III skeletal classifications using three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomographs (CBCT) technology."

The successful translation of RNAi therapeutics to a clinic setting requires a delivery system that is efficient and simple to upscale. In this study, we devised a simple industrial method to manufacture lipoplex, which includes short hairpin RNA against the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS shRNA) - a key molecule for DNA biosynthesis. An aqueous solution of TS shRNA was gently mixed with either a precursor of cationic liposome (Presome DF-1) or a cationic lipid mixture in an o/w emulsion. This solution was subsequently lyophilized under optimal conditions to obtain either FD-lipoplex-1 or FD-lipoplex-2, respectively. With this method, a lipoplex in activated form was obtained via a simple ""one-step"" hydration with saline. Both forms of FD-lipoplex showed physicochemical properties comparable to those of conventional lipoplex. FD-lipoplexes stably retained TS shRNA within their formulations in the presence of tumor ascites fluid. Intraperitoneal treatment with either FD-lipoplex-1 or FD-lipoplex-2 provided a therapeutic level of efficacy comparable to that of conventional lipoplex in the treatment of a peritoneal disseminated gastric cancer mouse model.

One paradigmatic model of this division is the Drosophila male and female germline stem cell, which provides two model systems not only sharing common features but also having distinct characteristics for studying asymmetric stem cell division in vivo. This asymmetric division is controlled by a combination of extrinsic signaling molecules and intrinsic factors that are either asymmetrically segregated or regulated differentially following division.

Arl proteins belong to the Arf family and are involved in vesicle trafficking and tubulin assembly. This study identified two Arl (Arf-like)-encoding genes, arl1 and arl2, in M. circinelloides and explored their function in morphogenesis, virulence, and antifungal susceptibility. Although Arl1 and Arl2 proteins shared 55% amino acid sequence identity, arl1 and arl2 genes showed distinct transcriptional expression patterns. arl1 was expressed at higher levels than arl2 and induced in mycelia, suggesting a role in morphological transitions. Disruption of the arl1 and arl2 genes led to heterokaryon (Δarl1(+)(-)) and homokaryon (Δarl2) genotypes, respectively. The incapacity to generate homokaryon mutants for arl1 suggested that it is essential for growth of M. circinelloides. Deletion of each gene reduced the expression of the other, suggesting the existence of a positive cross-regulation between them. Thus, deletion of arl2 resulted in a ~60% reduction of arl1 expression, whereas the Δarl1(+)(-) showed ∼90% reduction of arl1 expression. Mutation of arl2 showed no phenotype or a mild phenotype between Δarl1(+)(-) and wild-type (WT), suggesting that all observed phenotypes in both mutant strains corresponded to arl1 low expression. The Δarl1(+)(-) produced a small amount of spores that showed increased sensitivity to dodecyl-sulfate and azoles, suggesting a defect in the cell wall that was further supported by decrease in saccharide content. These defects in the cell wall were possibly originated by abnormal vesicle trafficking since FM4-64 staining of both mutants Δarl1(+)(-) and Δarl2 revealed less well-localized endosomes compared to the WT. Moreover, aberrant vesicle trafficking may be responsible for the secretion of specific virulence-related proteins since cell-free medium from Δarl1(+)(-) were found to increase killing of Caenorhabditis elegans compared to WT."

Mitochondria dysfunction-mediated aberrant telomere length has been implicated in various pathological processes including cholestasis. Herein, we aimed to investigate associations between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, oxidative DNA damage, telomere length, and disease severity in BA patients. mtDNA copy number and relative telomere length (RTL) were assessed using real-time PCR. Circulating 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was measured using ELISA. Our findings showed that BA patients had significantly lower mtDNA copy number and RTL than healthy controls, whereas plasma 8-OHdG levels were significantly elevated in BA patients. mtDNA copy number was remarkably reduced in advanced BA patients. Furthermore, mtDNA copy number was independently associated with age and degree of liver fibrosis in BA patients. Decreased mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with elevated risks of BA, severe fibrosis, jaundice, and hepatic dysfunction. Low mtDNA copy number can be utilized to distinguish patients with poor-outcome from those with good-outcome. Survival curve analysis revealed that low mtDNA copy number was significantly associated with poor survival of BA patients. Interestingly, there was a positive association between mtDNA copy number and plasma 8-OHdG in BA patients, while a negative association of mtDNA copy number with RTL was observed in BA patients. Alternatively, RTL was negatively correlated with plasma 8-OHdG in BA patients. These data demonstrated relationships between leukocytes mtDNA copy number, oxidative stress, telomere length, and clinical parameters in BA patients.

Our results showed that different concentrations of TCDD caused immunotoxic effects through different toxicological mechanisms in both the purified mouse splenic Th cells and the mixed SLC. The low dose exposure to TCDD triggered regulatory effects in the immune system, while the high dose TCDD exposure resulted in severe immune toxicity. Notably, a decline of Treg subset was observed, suggesting an imbalanced immune regulation by TCDD treatment, as well as a possible decrease of TCDD's indirect effects on bystander immune cells.

We further confirmed a significant correlation between urinary CD147/basigin (Bsg) levels and proteinuria in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, the molecular mechanism of podocyte injury involving Bsg is not fully understood. Here, the involvement of Bsg in the pathogenesis of podocyte injury was elucidated. Healthy podocytes rarely express Bsg protein. In two independent mouse models, including adriamycin-induced nephropathy and Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name)-induced endothelial dysfunction, Bsg induction in injured podocytes caused podocyte effacement, which led to development of proteinuria. Bsg silencing in cultured podocytes exposed to transforming growth factor-β suppressed focal adhesion rearrangement and cellular motility via the activation of β1 integrin-focal adhesion kinase-matrix metallopeptidase signaling. In addition, induction of vascular endothelial growth factor and endothelin-1, which are implicated in podocyte-to-endothelial cross-communication, was lower in the supernatants of cultured Bsg-silenced podocytes stimulated with transforming growth factor-β. In this setting, Bsg may be involved in a physiological positive feedback loop that accelerates podocyte cell motility and depolarization. The current study thus suggests that Bsg silencing via suppression of β1 integrin-focal adhesion kinase-matrix metallopeptidase signaling may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the maintenance of podocytes in patients with proteinuric kidney diseases.",Pericytes: Key Players in Spinal Cord Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014955,The American journal of pathology,2019 05 12,"Spinal cord injury results in locomotor impairment attributable to the formation of an inhibitory fibrous scar, which prevents axonal regeneration after trauma. The scarcity of knowledge about the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in scar formation after spinal cord lesion impede the design of effective therapies. Recent studies, by using state-of-the-art technologies, including genetic tracking and blockage of pericytes in combination with optogenetics, reveal that pericyte blockage facilitates axonal regeneration and neuronal integration into the local neural circuitry. Strikingly, a pericyte subset is essential during scarring after spinal cord injury, and its arrest results in motor performance improvement. The arising knowledge from current research will contribute to novel approaches to develop therapies for spinal cord injury. We review novel advances in our understanding of pericyte biology in the spinal cord.",Network Medicine in Pathobiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014954,The American journal of pathology,2019 05 16,"The past decade has witnessed exponential growth in the generation of high-throughput human data across almost all known dimensions of biological systems. The discipline of network medicine has rapidly evolved in parallel, providing an unbiased, comprehensive biological framework through which to interrogate and integrate systematically these large-scale, multi-omic data to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and to design drugs that reflect a deep knowledge of molecular pathobiology. In this review, we discuss the key principles of network medicine and the human disease network and explore the latest applications of network medicine in this multi-omic era. We also highlight the current conceptual and technological challenges, which serve as exciting opportunities by which to improve and expand the network-based applications beyond the artificial boundaries of the current state of human pathobiology.","The innate immune system of kissing bugs, vectors of chagas disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014953,Developmental and comparative immunology,2019 06 02,"Kissing bugs have long served as models to study many aspects of insect physiology. They also serve as vectors for the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that causes Chagas disease in humans. The overall success of insects is due, in part, to their ability to recognize parasites and pathogens as non-self and to eliminate them using their innate immune system. This immune system comprises physical barriers, cellular responses (phagocytosis, nodulation and encapsulation), and humoral factors (antimicrobial peptides and the prophenoloxidase cascade). Trypanosoma cruzi survives solely in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of the vector; if it migrates to the hemocoel it is eliminated. Kissing bugs may not mount a vigorous immune response in the GI tract to avoid eliminating obligate symbiotic microbes on which they rely for survival. Here we describe the current knowledge of innate immunity in kissing bugs and new opportunities using genomic and transcriptomic approaches to study the complex triatomine-trypanosome-microbiome interactions.",Executive function and dietary intake in youth: A systematic review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014952,Appetite,2019 06 08,"Despite increasing evidence that childhood obesity may be related to impairments in executive function, the evidence supporting the relation between executive function (EF) and dietary intake, a key factor linked to obesity, is mixed. Although research from the obesity literature often interprets EF as a factor that may influence dietary intake, there is also evidence that dietary intake may influence EF. Drawing on a developmental perspective, this systematic review examines the literature on the link between executive function (i.e., inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) and dietary intake in youth through the inclusion of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies aimed at altering either dietary intake or EF as a way to influence the other. In total, 5650 studies were screened for eligibility. Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Results indicated that the relation between executive function and dietary intake is equivocal. Although there is some support for a cross-sectional relation between executive function and dietary intake, the lack of longitudinal studies makes it difficult to make conclusions about directionality. Findings from intervention studies do not support the effectiveness of short-term manipulations on dietary intake to change subsequent EF, and few intervention studies exist that explicitly aim to ""train"" EF to change subsequent dietary intake. Furthermore, the wide variety of measures used to assess EF and dietary intake, and the lack of consideration of the role that weight status may play in the relation between EF and dietary intake, make overall interpretation of the literature more difficult. In sum, there is a need for more prospective research examining a variety of ages, domains of EF, and weight statuses, taking into account developmental factors.",Method to assess the mismatch between the measured and nominal parameters of transcranial magnetic stimulation devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014951,Journal of neuroscience methods,2019 05 19,"Small variations in TMS parameters, such as pulse frequency and amplitude may elicit distinct neurophysiological responses.

Mancozeb is a member of the dithiocarbamates group currently in use in the management of fungal diseases of plants. To achieve these aims, mature male White New-Zealand rabbits of 4-5 months old were randomly assigned to four groups of 9 animals each: control, mancozeb only, mancozeb and GSH, and GSH only. This study discovered a significant reduction in serum FSH, LH, testosterone and testicular LDH, ACP, and ALP levels in the groups of mancozeb-treated rabbits compared with control. The mancozeb-treated groups also showed significant losses in sperm viability, along with a significant increase in the number of abnormal sperms. Finally, an upregulation in steroidogenic 3β-HSD enzyme activity was noted in mancozeb-treated rabbits. Histopathological inspection of the testicles established disruption of the germinal epithelium with vacuolization of Leydig cells and reduced spermatogenic cells. GSH co-administration increased serum concentrations of FSH, LH, testosterone, and levels of the testicular enzymes: LDH, ACP, and ALP. Improved steroidogenesis was indicated in this group by a significant improvement in the testicular 3β-HSD enzyme, by a significant increase in sperm viability, and by a significant decrease in the number of abnormal sperms. The findings of this study suggest that mancozeb exposure has anti-spermatogenic and anti-steroidogenic adverse effects in rabbits and administration of GSH may alleviate the reproductive toxicity.","Acute liver injury, acute liver failure and acute on chronic liver failure: A clinical spectrum of poisoning due to Gyromitra esculenta.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014949,Annals of hepatology,2019 05 24,"Gyromitra esculenta, also known as ""false morel"" is one of the most poisonous mushrooms.

For the first time compound 11 was reported for Digitalis genus. The chemotaxonomical significance of these compounds in Plantaginaceae family was evaluated and 3'-O-glucosyl substituted phenylethanoid glycosides 4-8 and 10 were found to be chemotaxonomically important for the family. Cytotoxic activity of the aqueous fraction of the methanolic extract was also tested against HEp-2 (human larynx epidermoid carcinoma) and HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cancer cell lines. The aqueous fraction showed stronger cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells than on HepG2. Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of 1-4, 6, 7 and 9 were tested against HEp-2 and L929 (mouse fibroblast cell) cell lines. Other isolated compounds could not be tested due to their insufficient amount. The results were evaluated in the point of structure-activity relationships. IC50 values against HEp-2 cells were established in a range of 71.9-220 μM.

Due to its potential to allow scanning at lower doses, IR has received a lot of attention in the medical literature and has become a successful commercial product. Its use in cardiovascular CT has been driven in part due to concerns about radiation dose and image quality.

Twenty subjects with cleft palate aged between 7 and 12 years participated in this study. Audio recordings were made of the children reading a passage and singing a common local song, both in the Malay language. The degree of hypernasality was judged through perceptual assessment. Three trained listeners (a speech therapist, a classical singer, and a linguistic expert - all academicians) and two untrained listeners (a cleft volunteer worker and a national high school teacher) assessed the recordings using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability for hypernasality in both speaking and singing were verified using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). A significant reduction in hypernasality was observed during singing as compared to speaking, indicating that hypernasality reduces when a child with cleft palate sings. The act of singing significantly reduces hypernasality. The outcome of this study suggests that children with cleft palate would benefit from singing exercises to ultimately reduce hypernasality. However, future research is needed to objectively measure nasality in singing compared to speaking.",Proteomic analysis of flavokawain C-induced cell death in HCT 116 colon carcinoma cell line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014923,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"Flavokawain C (FKC), a naturally occurring chalcone, has previously been shown to inhibit the growth of colon carcinoma HCT 116 cells through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. However, the possible underlying mechanisms of cell death as a response to FKC treatment remains unclear. In this study, we performed proteomic analysis of HCT 116 cells treated with FKC to identify proteins that change in abundance. This was followed by bioinformatic analysis to predict possible associated molecular targets or pathways involved in the observed effects of FKC. A total of 35 proteins that changed in abundance (17 increased and 18 decreased) were identified through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), these proteins were predicted to be involved in cell death and survival, cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation, protein synthesis, post-translational modification and amino acid metabolism by. Further analysis of the transcript levels of selected proteins using qPCR showed that some of the genes exhibited similar change of profile to that of the proteins'. Our results have provided novel insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying FKC-induced apoptosis or cell death in colon cancer cells.",Who are the minors seeking an abortion for an unplanned pregnancy?

The purpose of this review was to provide an evidence synthesis describing risk of injury in athletic and military populations with and without a history of concussion. Electronic database searches were completed through September 7, 2018 in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS. Peer-reviewed observational studies of any design with participants who were athletes or service members; measured the outcome of any type of injury; and compared injury between those with and without a history of concussion were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Q-Coh II. Twenty-seven articles were included. Seventeen meta-analyses were completed for risk of any injury, risk of concussion, and risk of extremity injury using odds, hazard, and rate ratios. The results indicate significantly increased odds of all injuries (OR = 2.55; 95%CI 1.85,3.52); concussion (OR = 3.73; 95%CI 2.41,5.78); and lower extremity injuries (OR = 1.60; 95%CI 1.32,1.94) in those with a history of concussion compared to those without. Additional analyses reveal this increased risk is apparent when looking at time to event data and rate of injury based on number of exposures. While the reasons for the increased incidence of secondary injury associated with a concussion are not yet understood, there are potentially behavioral attributes and motor control deficits that contribute. It is suggested that research is needed to determine if active therapeutic treatment for disturbances in sensorimotor and neuromotor control after concussion could attenuate the increased risk for injury."

We studied 1655 patients from a tertiary medical center between 1/2013-4/2015 using multivariate regression analysis for demographics, vascular risk factors, admission stroke severity, laboratory tests, echocardiogram results and discharge disposition. Troponin levels were classified as normal <0.04 ng/ml and high >0.04 ng/ml (critical if >0.5 ng/ml). A T2MI was diagnosed by a trending troponin elevation; patients with type I MI, patients with subdural and epidural hematoma, or hemorrhagic metastatic disease and patients younger than 18 years old were excluded. We had 818 patients with ischemic stroke, 306 with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and 169 with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Troponin was elevated (>0.04 ng/ml) in 24.1% of ischemic stroke patients, 27.1% in the ICH group, and in 39% of SAH patients. High initial and peak troponin levels were associated with higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in patients with ischemic stroke (OR 1.04; CI 95%, 1.02-1.07, p = .001) and (OR 1.05; CI 95%, 1.03-1.07, p < .001).

In patients with concurrent MS and CS, the exact cause for worsening of symptoms is often difficult to decipher. In this study, we aimed to review the medical literature on the benefits of surgical decompression surgery in patients with coexisting CS and MS. We systematically reviewed the literature for articles published prior to December 1st, 2018 describing outcomes (improvement of symptoms of radiculopathy, myelopathy, and neck pain) in patients with coexisting MS and CS undergoing cervical decompression surgery. Effect sizes were calculated demonstrating the effect of surgical decompression on improving symptoms. We identified eight articles that satisfied our selection criteria, of which six provided data regarding symptoms after surgery. Our meta-analysis indicates that cervical decompression surgery in patients with coexisting MS and CS is beneficial in improving symptoms of myelopathy (ES 0.74, 95% CI 0.38-1.10, p < 0.0001), radiculopathy (ES 1.29, 95% CI 0.15-2.42, p < 0.001), and neck pain (ES 1.66, 95% CI 1.02-2.31, p < 0.0001). Our meta-analysis indicates that there is paucity of high level of evidence studies regarding the benefit of cervical decompression surgery in patients with concomitant CS and MS. However, the literature suggests that cervical decompression may be beneficial to such patients, providing stabilization or improvement in symptoms of myelopathy, radiculopathy, and neck pain.

The aim of this study was to screen selected red algae, a highly diverse phylogenetic group, for the production of photo-protective molecules. The pigment content and composition (i.e. chlorophyll-a, phycobiliproteins and carotenoids) and the composition of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) were studied in 40 species of red macroalgae collected in Brittany (France), at two distinct periods (i.e. February and July 2017). A high inter-specific variability was demonstrated in terms of pigment content and MAA composition. Twenty-three potential MAAs were detected by HPLC, and six were identified by LC-MS (i.e. shinorine, palythine, asterina-330, porphyra-334, usurijene and palythene). This is the first study to report on the composition of pigments and MAAs in a diverse group of red seaweeds from Brittany, including some species for which the MAA composition has never been studied before. Nevertheless, the results suggested that some species of red algae are more likely to cope with high levels of light radiation since those species such as Bostrychia scorpioides, Porphyra dioica, Gracilaria vermiculophylla and Vertebrata lanosa are living in environments exposed to higher levels of irradiation, and had various MAAs in addition to their photo-protective pigments.",Increased mast cell number is associated with a decrease in beta-cell mass and regeneration in type 2 diabetic rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014904,Acta histochemica,2019 05 20,"The role of mast cells (MCs) in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is not thoroughly studied as much as in T1D. Therefore in the current study we investigated correlation between these cells and various parameters of islets of Langerhans (IOL) in rats which were equally divided (n = 40) into; control and diabetic groups. We detected a significantly increased (p < 0.05) MC count (MCC) in the diabetic IOL compared to the control, together with a noticeable intra-islet seeding of these cells which displayed a tryptase positive immunostaining. A significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between MCC and the % of glucagon cells per islet was detected in DM, unlike mass of the islets, mass of β-cells, and % of β-cells per islet which were negatively correlated with MCC. Similarly, there was a negative correlation between MCC with β-cell proliferation and neogenesis frequency in DM. This highlights the potential association between the increased MC number and the diminished islet`s mass as well as regeneration which may fasten the progression of T2D.",A pore-scale investigation of heavy crude oil trapping and removal during surfactant-enhanced remediation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014903,Journal of contaminant hydrology,2019 05 18,"The presence of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) in the subsurface presents significant challenges for soil and groundwater remediation. In particular, heavy crude oil, coal tar and/or bitumen present unique difficulties for removal and cleanup due to associated high viscosities, low aqueous solubilities, and limited mobility extraction potential. Although surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR) techniques have shown some promise for source removal, overall remediation (mobilization) performance will depend significantly on interfacial effects between the fluid and solid phases. A pore-scale study, implementing synchrotron X-ray microtomography (SXM), was conducted to understand and quantify the trapping and mobilization mechanisms and in-situ emulsification processes of heavy crude oil distributed within increasing complexity (i.e. physical heterogeneity) unconsolidated sands during surfactant flushing events. Pore-scale imaging analyses were conducted to quantify the changes in oil blob morphology before and after surfactant flushing events to assess the primary factors controlling the recovery. Results showed relatively low (10%) net recovery from the homogeneous sand after 5 pore volumes (PVs) of surfactant flushing and may be, in part, due to the more connected ganglia (i.e. single continuous) oil-phase. Such a condition may have limited the surfactant/oil contact resulting in relatively low interfacial activity and correspondingly inefficient oil mobilization and recovery. Negligible net oil recovery was achieved from the mildly-heterogeneous-sand and is likely due to the lower associated permeability of this particular porous medium. Furthermore, the oil-phase distribution within this medium primarily consisted of small disconnected blobs more readily exposed (in contact with) the surfactant solution. For the highly-heterogeneous-sand experiments, an average of 20% heavy-oil recovery resulted after each flushing event (total of ~37% after 5 PVs) and was attributed to more efficient reduction of interfacial tension associated with the increased surfactant-oil contact. The associated higher pH sand/fine‑carbonate system may have aided in maintaining a water-wet porous medium, a condition more conducive to higher oil recovery and displacement efficiency.",Protective effect of urolithin a on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in mice via modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014901,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 06 07,"Limitation of widely used anti-cancer agent cisplatin for a patient is nephrotoxicity.

Urolithin A pretreatment reduced all the above renal damage parameters in a significant way. Urolithin A attenuated cisplatin-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 23 (IL-23), interleukin 18 (IL-18) and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP2).

Particularly, exposure to Cd during puberty versus post-puberty exhibits differing age-dependent effects that require further examination. This study sought to determine if cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), a typical anthocyanin with neuroprotective bioactivity, could protect against Cd-induced sex hormone-disorder in Pubertal male mice. C3G treatment reversed the disruption of hormone levels and increased Gnrh1 gene expression in the hypothalamus. In addition, the levels of gonadotropins, including luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), were reversed by C3G. Interestingly, C3G improved the expression of LH and FSH receptor in the testis in mice exposed to Cd. Furthermore, C3G activated the signaling pathway related to the synthesis of testosterone processing. In conclusion, C3G protected against Cd-induced dysfunction of sex hormone secretion through the regulation of the HPG axis in male mice during puberty. The results of this study suggest that consumption of anthocyanins can be protective against metal-induced male reproductive dysfunction.","Postmortem examination (2016-2017) of weanling and older horses for the presence of select species of endoparasites: Gasterophilus spp., Anoplocephala spp. and Strongylus spp. in specific anatomical sites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014896,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Parasite infections are more quantifiable postmortem than antemortem in horses.

Most of the weanling and older horses submitted to the University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL) for postmortem examination between November 22, 2016 and March 23, 2017 were examined for certain species of internal parasites. The stomach and duodenum from 69 horses were examined for bots (Gasterophilus spp.). Combined data for both Thoroughbred and non-Thoroughbred (16 other than Thoroughbred breeds/mixed breeds) horses revealed that the prevalence of Gasterophilus intestinalis was 19% (n=12) with 2nd instars (x̄ 8.5) and 39% (n=27) with 3rd instars (x̄ 90).

This status means that cattle have a paradoxical existence in India; as they are worshipped and protected, they are able to roam freely among humans, but they are also often left to fend for themselves. The water buffalo represents a significant contributor to the Indian agricultural economy as well as general social development, and are in this way somehow replacing the indigenous cattle. The vast numbers of roaming cattle without clear owners are difficult to look after in terms of veterinary healthcare and appropriate interventions when necessary, and have no regular supply of food. This article describes an investigation of the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis in bovines either roaming the streets or being kept in animal holdings in and around Chandigarh, a city in Northern India, and addresses the zoonotic potential of these protozoan parasites shed from bovines living in close contact with humans. 294 animals of all ages were sampled, and the majority of the positive samples were found from calves. The overall prevalence of Giardia was 8.2% and Cryptosporidium was 2.4%. Non-zoonotic assemblages were predominantly found in the case of the Giardia - positive samples, and in the case of Cryptosporidium, as well as non-zoonotic genotypes, zoonotic subgroups previously described from infected human infections in this area, were identified, indicating that there may be sharing of intestinal parasites in these settings, where cattle live in close contact with humans.",Serosurvey of Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina in cattle in Mongolia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014894,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Mongolia is an agriculturally rich country with large livestock populations that contribute significantly to its national economy. However, the export market for live animals and livestock products is often constrained for various reasons including infectious diseases. Babesia bovis and B. bigemina, which are bovine hemoprotozoan parasites, cause severe forms of clinical babesiosis, in cattle. However, a country-wide survey to determine the exposure rates in various provinces in Mongolia was not conducted to determine the risk for infections with these parasite species. Therefore, we investigated the frequency of antibodies to B. bovis and B. bigemina in cattle reared throughout Mongolia. B. bovis-and B. bigemina-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to screen the serum samples sourced from 1946 cattle in 19 of 21 provinces and a provincial municipality (Ulaanbaatar) in Mongolia. We found 351 (18.0%) samples positive for B. bovis and 435 (22.4%) samples positive for B. bigemina infections. The B. bovis- and B. bigemina-positive rates ranged from 0.8 to 61.5% and 4.0 to 50.6%, respectively, among the surveyed provinces. The positive rates of B. bovis and B. bigemina infections were relatively higher in the provinces located in northernmost, northern, eastern, southeastern, and southern Mongolia. Additionally, the B. bovis- and B. bigemina-positive rates were not significantly different between females (18.2 and 22.2%, respectively) and males (17.2 and 18.8%, respectively) or between the 1-3-year-old (16.2 and 19.4%, respectively) and >3-year-old (17.1 and 20.9%, respectively) age groups. The differential seropositivity for B. bovis and B. bigemina infections among the provinces may reflect the variations in the risk of cattle being infected with these parasite species. The findings of the present study highlight the need for country-wide control measures, including tick control programs, to minimize the rates of B. bovis and B. bigemina infections in Mongolian cattle."

The status of anthelmintic efficacy in Cuba has been virtually unknown due to the lack of equine labelled products. One recent report documented suboptimal efficacy levels of extra-label albendazole products against cyathostomins, but it remains unknown to which extent benzimidazole resistance exists in the population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anthelmintic efficacy of two benzimidazole products labelled for equines, fenbendazole and oxibendazole. A fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) was carried out on 132 horses aged 4 months to 18 years in 14 herds, belonging to six provinces. Ten herds exhibited signs of resistance to at least one of the benzimidazoles (mean FECRT<90%). Overall, oxibendazole exhibited higher efficacy than fenbendazole (p = 0.0062), and higher efficacy levels were found in horses never dewormed before compared to those treated within 3-12 months prior to the study (p = 0.0015). Pre-treatment larval cultures revealed the presence of large strongyles and cyathostomin larvae in all herds, while only cyathostomin larvae were detected post treatment.

We have anecdotal information that Veterinary Feed Directive prescriptions in Kentucky (KY) are written most often for treatment and prevention of BA. However, there are no recent prevalence estimates of this disease in KY. Thus, this study was aimed at determining the seroprevalence of and factors associated with BA in KY. Data were obtained from an active slaughter survey (n = 232) performed between May and July 2013 as well as from reviewing The University of Kentucky Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (UKVDL) records of specimens submitted for BA testing from 2002-2012 (n = 2,573). With competitive ELISA, the apparent prevalence of BA in KY was 10.78% (95% CI: 7.41-15.42%) and 11.58% (95% CI: 10.31-12.98%) for the slaughter survey and laboratory records, respectively. Whereas the estimated true prevalence was 9.44% (95% CI: 5.65-14.48%) and 10.3% (95% CI: 8.92-11.8%), respectively. From the laboratory records, factors associated with positive BA results were age, breed, whether specimens were submitted singularly or as a group, year and quarter of the year the specimens were submitted. The odds of the outcome were 5 times as high when cattle were adults (vs juvenile) and almost 4 times as high when specimens were submitted singularly (vs group). In comparison to Holstein breed, the odds of the outcome were 3.5 and 2.5 times higher in Angus and mixed breeds, respectively. The odds of a diagnosis of BA varied in an undulating pattern by year of sample submission. When compared to 2011, the odds of a diagnosis of BA was approximately 3 times as high in 2005, 2008, and 2009 and approximately 5 times as high in 2004, 2006, and 2012. In comparison to the duration from January to March, the odds of the outcome were almost 20 times as high from July to September but 10 times as high from October to December durations. Counties with specimen submissions for BA testing had a significantly greater cattle population and number of cattle farms than counties without specimen submissions. Future prevention and control measures for BA should target these factors and should be weighted more on counties with higher cattle population. Furthermore, current records from the UKVDL appear sufficient for the surveillance of BA in KY.",Regional report on Angiostrongylus vasorum in Colombia: Genetic similarity to European lineage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014876,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"The canine lungworm Angiostrongylus vasorum is considered neglected in South America and was only sporadically reported in dogs and wildlife.

In total, 609 snails were collected from the departments Antioquia, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo. Angiostrongylus vasorum-infected A. fulica were found in all departments with a total prevalence of 3.9%.

Two T. equiperdum strains and three of the T. evansi strains resulted in 100% mice mortality, while the two T. evansi donkey strains exhibited lower infectivity and mortality. T. equiperdum strains had shorter pre-patent periods (4 days) than the T. evansi strains (4-12 days). In terms of pathogenicity, only the T. evansi horse strain and the two capybara strains produced a significant decrease of the packed cell volume, in haemoglobin concentration and in red blood cell count. In contrast, the T. evansi donkey strains did not show any changes in the hematological parameters. From the seven variables studied, only pre-patent period, day of maximum parasitemia, day of first parasitemia peak and number of parasitemia peaks were statistically significant. Weight decrease was only observed in mice infected with the T. evansi horse strain. T. equiperdum strains showed the highest mice lethality (7% survival by day 8 post-infection) with no change in the hematological parameters. The three T. evansi horse and capybara strains showed 80%, 87% and 97% survival rates, respectively by day 12 post-infection. However, by day 20 post-inoculation all the mice infected with the T. evansi horse strain died, while 53% and 27% capybara strains infected survived. Whereas by day 40 post-infection, 53 and 73% of the mice infected with the T. evansi donkey strains had survived. These results demonstrate striking infectivity and virulence differences between Venezuelan T. evansi and T. equiperdum strains in NMRI mice and open new possibilities to characterize inter and intra-species variations that may contribute to the pathogenicity of these two species.",Molecular detection of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus resistance against deltamethrin in middle Egypt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014874,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"This study was designed to investigate the susceptibility/resistance of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus to commercial deltamethrin 5%.

Fully engorged female ticks were collected from 11 locations in Beni-Suef Governorate, Egypt (Alfashin, Eminelaros, Ehnasia, Smusta, Belifia, Aldiabia, Alhalabia, Beshnna, Alkom, Nasr and Beba). Two concentrations of commercial deltamethrin 5% (200 and 400 ppm) were tested by AIT on R. (B.) annulatus. The mortality of ticks at 400 ppm was higher than 200 ppm which was not reached to 100%. Ehnasia tick population was the least susceptible to deltamethrin while Alfashin population was the most susceptible one. Different deltamethrin concentrations (0.000625, 0.00125, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.010 and 0.020) were used in LPT to evaluate the larval mortality. The highest LC50 appeared in Ehanasia tick population (0.01) with 95% confidence interval (0.005 to 0.01) meanwhile, the lowest LC50 appeared in Alfashin (0.0006) with 95%CI (0.0005 to 0.0007). Thus, it is possible to deduce that one population was considered susceptible; seven populations were resistant level I and three populations were resistant level II. Additionally, PCR revealed that the resistant alleles (R) appeared in two localities (Ehnasia and Aldiabia). It was concluded that at least two tick populations of the investigated locations were of possible resistant to deltamethrin.",Genetic variability within isolates of Sarcocystis species infecting sheep from Egypt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014873,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"In order to explain the exact role of sarcocystosis, principally Sarcocystis tenella, in losses of the Egyptian sheep industry, a precise confirmation about the existence of different Sarcocystis species infecting that economically important animal is needed. Therefore, this work aimed to molecularly identify, as well as illustrate the genetic variability within isolates of Sarcocystis spp. infecting sheep from Egypt. Tissue specimens were collected from sheep slaughtered at 3 Egyptian provinces; Cairo, Dakahlia and Damietta. DNA was isolated from the harvested bradyzoites after peptic digestion for the positive sarcocysts infected specimens, and then PCR amplification using the 18S rRNA gene was carried out. PCR products were subjected to gel electrophoresis. DNA from 600 bp gel bands was purified and sequenced. The revealed sequences were compared to their similarities on Genbank, and analyzed both clusterally and phylogenetically. Two Sarcocystis spp. were identified, the macroscopic cyst forming S. gigantea and the microscopic cyst forming S. tenella. Nine S. tenella sequences were analyzed, resulting in 3 polymorphic sites as well as 3 different haplotypes. Clustering of the nine obtained S. tenella sequences in addition to another 23 S. tenella sequences on Genbank revealed low nucleotide (0.001780) diversity as well as negative value of the Taijma neutral index which are indicators for population expansion. Alignment and Phylogeny results illustrated very close relationship between S. gigantea and S. moulei, a goat specific species which rarely reported in sheep, and in turn proposed the cross transmission of the later species between sheep and goats.","Cats as potential mammalian reservoirs for Rickettsia sp. genotype RF2125 in Bangkok, Thailand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014872,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Rickettsia felis is an obligate intracellular alpha-proteobacteria and the cause of flea-borne spotted fever (FBSF), an emerging zoonosis of global public health importance, for which dogs and cats have been implicated as potential mammalian reservoirs hosts.

Single whole blood samples (n = 432) and where observed, fleas (n = 234), were collected from cats from 53 temple communities in Bangkok. Fleas were morphologically and genetically identified to a species level. Cat blood and fleas were subjected to a spotted fever group (SFG)-specific PCR targeting the partial outer membrane protein B (ompB). Those that were positive, were further characterised using an R. felis-specific nested PCR targeting the partial citrate synthase A (gltA) gene. All fleas were identified as Ctenocephalides felis felis. In total SFG Rickettsiae were detected in the blood of 82/482 (17.01%) cats and 3/234 fleas (1.28%). DNA sequencing of the partial ompB characterised all positive amplicons from cat blood and their fleas as 100% identical to Rickettsia endosymbiont of Ctenocephalides felis orientis isolate (Rickettsia sp. genotype RF2125) and Rickettsia asemboensis (GenBank accession no.

The gltA gene targeting R. felis was successfully amplified from 12/82 PCR-positive cat blood samples and these clustered with 99% bootstrap support with isolates within the Rickettsia sp. genotype RF2125 clade. Cats that were permitted to roam freely inside monasteries were more likely to be infected with R. felis compared with cats confined indoors. The results suggest that cats in Thailand are potential mammalian reservoir hosts for Rickettsia sp. genotype RF2125."

Teals serve as hosts for a wide range of parasite species that can be ""discharged"" at each end of the migration route. Here, we explore for the first time the diversity of trematodes that the Blue-winged Teal may be introducing to -or exporting from- Cuba. We found 15 digenean parasites in 65 sampled teals of which 13 represent first reports for Cuba with one species (Echinostoma revolutum) of zoonotic importance. Overall prevalence was very high (96.92%) whereas Trichobilharzia spp. resulted the most ubiquitous parasite. Highest intensities were recorded for Australapatemon sp. (arriving teals) and Levinseniella amnicolae (departing teals). Altogether, departing teals harboured the highest number of trematode species and abundance. The short development and lifespan, inside migratory birds, of adult stages of trematodes like Trichobilharzia sp., Cotylurus flabelliformis and Microphallus pygmaeus strongly suggest that the occurrence of these trematodes in the departing teals could be related to their long establishment in Cuban ecosystems. In a global scenario where parasitology, particularly wildlife parasitology, is mostly overlooked, there should be an increasing need of gathering information and increasing surveillance of wildlife diseases that might eventually become important for the health of ecosystems and of domestic animals and humans. The present study constitutes the first major attempt to explore trematode infection from S. discors in Cuba under the view of parasite flow via bird migration.","Serological and molecular detection of Leishmania infantum in cats of Northern Sardinia, Italy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014858,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Leishmania infections are endemic in dogs in central and southern regions of Italy while feline leishmaniosis has only been sporadically described in these areas and few studies have been reported on serological and molecular investigation of infections in domestic cats.

There are very few references about the presence of nodules in the stomach. There is scant information about the epidemiology of this disease in wild red foxes in meso-Mediterranean areas. In this work we report on the natural infection of wild red foxes by Spirocerca lupi and the damage produced in the stomach wall in an area where contact with other potential definitive hosts (canids) is very rare. From July 2015 to November 2016, 61 red foxes were sampled. 18.03% of the stomach walls examined had nodules containing Spirocerca lupi adults and eggs. The prevalence of infection was similar for young and adult groups (23.81 and 18.18%; χ2 = 0.25; df = 1; P = 0.6171) and it was higher in females than in males (25.81 versus 10.00%, χ2 = 2.58; df = 1; P = 0.1082). The red fox population in the area seems to be well established judging from their age distribution and the fact that they could be captured all year round. It would appear that in the absence of other main definitive host S. lupi population is able to survive just parasitizing red foxes. Pathologic effects of this parasite on red foxes seems to show some differences related to domestic dogs. These results also indicates as predator control programs can maintain suitable host populations with reduced level of infection.",Molecular analysis of benzimidazole-resistance associated SNPs in Haemonchus contortus populations of Uruguay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014856,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Haemonchus contortus is one of the most important parasite nematodes of small ruminants around the world and causes great economic losses in livestock production. Control of gastrointestinal nematode infections, like haemonchosis, relies mainly on anthelmintic drugs, but its excessive and inappropriate use has caused serious drug resistance issues in many countries, including Uruguay, where sheep production occupies an important place in the country's economy. Benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics have been used for decades to treat sheep against H. contortus infection and resistance to this anthelmintic group has been widely described. Molecularly, BZ resistance in H. contortus has been correlated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the β-tubulin isotype 1 gene at codon 200 and 167 (both TTC to TAC, F167Y and F200Y) and at codon 198 (GAA to GCA, E198A).The aim of this work was to explore the presence of these tubulin SNPs in H. contortus adult worms recovered from sheep abomasa from a slaughterhouse in Uruguay. The mean resistant allelic frequencies at positions F167Y and F200Y were 20.25 and 47.45%, respectively, for worms recovered from naturally infected sheep slaughtered in 2013, while those that were slaughtered in 2014 presented only F200Y SNP with a frequency of 86.89%. Also H. contortus Kirby adult worms (anthelmintic- susceptible McMaster isolate), recovered from artificially infected sheep, were analyzed as reference for comparative purposes This analysis showed susceptible genotype at 167 and 198 position, and a low level of the resistance allele at the 200 position (3.66%). This is the first study for the presence of SNPs in the isotype-1 β-tubulin gene of H. contortus populations in Uruguay, which is consistent with the previous epidemiological studies carried out through the method of fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), thus confirming the serious resistance levels to BZ anthelmintics also in this country.","Genotyping of Toxoplasma gondii Isolated from cat Feces in Songkhla, Southern Thailand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014855,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"The genotype of Toxoplasma gondii has been extensively studied to determine whether its characteristics may influence the course of toxoplasmosis. Recent genotyping studies in South America have found Toxoplasma hybrid isolates or atypical strains which were more virulent and highly diverse than North American and European species. Although, the high seroprevalence of Toxoplasma infection among pregnant women and HIV-infected patients from Songklanagarind Hospital, Songkhla, Southern Thailand has been previously reported, there is no reported study of human genotyping data on T. gondii strains. This is the first genetic typing of T. gondii isolates obtained from naturally infected cats in Thailand. Five chromosomal loci were analyzed by a nested PCR-RFLP technique to determine the genotype of 13 T. gondii isolates from cat feces gathered in the South of Thailand. The PCR-RFLP patterns of SAG1, SAG2-new, SAG3, BTUB and GRA6 markers resulted in five diverse genotypes: the type I (one isolate), type III (two isolates), type II or type III (one isolate), recombinant genotypes (two isolates) and atypical genotypes (two isolates). The presence of unusual genotypes may lead to new virulent traits associated with more severe forms of human Toxoplasma infections. More evaluations are needed before conclusions could be made as to whether the oocysts from cat feces play an important role in the severity of Toxoplasma infections.","Fasciola gigantica cases in ruminants from Samsun Province, Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014854,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Animal fasciolosis occurs every year as an occasional problem in Samsun Province, especially of grazing animals in the Kizilirmak and Yesilirmak Deltas and surrounding areas. On occasions, dead animals or internal organs, including livers, lungs and hearts, are submitted to the Parasitology Department of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Ondokuz Mayis University for diagnostic purposes. Upon diagnosis of fasciolosis, the owners and veterinarians are informed about prevention measures and treatment of the disease. In that context, the livers and gallbladders of one sheep, one cow and two water buffalo, suspected of having died as a result of fasciolosis, were submitted to the parasitology laboratory of the faculty in 2015 and 2016. All organs were examined thoroughly and 38, 1076, 456 and 714. F. gigantica were collected from the sheep, cow and buffaloes' livers and gallbladders, respectively. In addition to these cases, according to information received from animal breeders and some veterinarians, at least 5 sheep and 3 cattle had also died due to fasciolosis in the previous two years. Because of the re-occurrence of F. gigantica cases in recent years, it is pertinent to discuss the past and current situation surrounding this parasite in Turkey.",Proactive treatment of angiotensin receptor antibodies in kidney transplantation with plasma exchange and/or candesartan is safe and associated with excellent graft survival at 4 years: A single centre Australian experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014826,Human immunology,2019 04 24,"High levels of angiotensin receptor antibodies (ATRab) are associated with acute cellular and humoral rejection, vascular occlusion, de novo human leucocyte antigen donor specific antibody (HLA DSA) and poor graft survival in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). Since 2015 we proactively managed patients ""at risk"" (AR) with ATRab >17 U/ml with perioperative plasma exchange (PLEX) and/or angiotensin receptor blockade (ARB). 44 patients were treated with this protocol. 265 KTR with ATRab ≤17 U/ml deemed ""low risk"" (LR) were transplanted under standard conditions. PLEX and ARB were not associated with increased risk of: delayed graft function requiring haemodialysis (HDx), hyperkalaemia >5.5 mmol/l requiring HDx, and the combined clinical end-point of severe hypotension, blood transfusion and re-operation for bleeding.

However, varying histological features are found in NSPs with unknown significance. The aim of this study was to describe the detailed microscopic features of NSP and correlate them with the underlying aetiology. One hundred patients diagnosed with NSP after pleural biopsy were retrospectively evaluated. A benign cause of pleural effusion was attributed. Histological features evaluated were inflammation, fibrosis, vascular proliferation, haemorrhage, fibrin, oedema and mesothelial hyperplasia. A semi-quantitative scoring was applied. Bacterial-caused and autoimmune disease-associated NSPs showed a higher score followed by viral and drug-induced conditions, while pneumothorax and cardiac-induced NSPs showed a lower score (p<0.0001). The degree of fibrosis was higher in bacterial NSP, and the type of fibrosis was cellular in this group (p=0.006). Vascular proliferation differed between groups (p<0.0001), and was higher in bacterial NSP. Histological findings differ significantly between the varying aetiologies of NSP, and this may be used to suggest the cause of the effusion.","Synthesis of potent neuroprotective butenolides based on plant smoke derived 3,4,5-Trimethylfuran-2(5H)-one and 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyrone-2-one.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014820,Phytochemistry,2019 06 16,"Smoke derived karrikinolide and trimethylbutenolide exerted neuroprotective effects against monoamine oxidase and acetylcholinesterase.

One bird survived to release after rehabilitation; seven birds died or were euthanized due to poor prognosis and were necropsied. Necropsy findings were similar and included general pallor of all tissues, particularly the subcutis and lungs, and enlarged liver and spleen. Histopathology revealed multi-organ necrosis, abundant meronts containing merozoites, and intracytoplasmic pigmented haemosporidian parasites in blood cells in one bird. Leucocytozoon lineages lSTOCC16 and BUVIR06 were identified by polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. The systemic Leucocytozoon infections were likely associated with morbidity and mortality in these owls. A second parasite, Haemoproteus lineage hSTVAR01, was also identified in an owl from Louisiana. This is the first identification of Leucocytozoon lineages that have been associated with mortality in young great horned owls.","Efficacy profile of Cypermethrin and Chlorpyrifos based acaricides on Rhipicephalus microplus control on cattle in the rearing phase, naturally infested and exposed to tick fever agents in central Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014808,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 05 13,"The objective of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of two cypermethrin- and chlorpyrifos-based acaricides in controlling Rhipicephalus microplus in a naturally infested bovine herd and in in vitro tests, as well as to monitor the animals for tick fever. Male bovines in the rearing phase were used, with 30 Brangus and 30 Nellore animals naturally infested. The groups were composed as follows: 15 Nellore treated, 15 Nellore control, 15 Brangus treated and 15 Brangus control. Every 18 days, the animals were monitored for tick count, acaricide treatment, weight, blood pack cell volume, and clinical signs. For in vitro tests, the larval packet test, adult immersion test and DNA amplification for tick fever diagnosis were performed. In the first animal treatment period, product 1 (cypermethrin, 15 g + chlorpyrifos, 25 g + citronellal, 1 g) was used; in the second period, product 2 (cypermethrin, 15 g + chlorpyrifos, 30 g + fenthion, 15 g) was used. In Brangus animals, the mean efficacy was 35.1% and 95.8% in the first and second periods, respectively, for the same animals. For Nellore animals, the efficacy in periods one and two was 51% and 97.1%, respectively. The in vitro results showed efficacy above 95% for the two challenged acaricides. The Brangus animals showed a high production of ticks associated with the presence of tick fever agents, which could generate risks for the disease's enzootic stability.",Anaplasma infection prevalence in beef and dairy cattle in the south east region of Botswana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014807,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 05 13,"Infection of cattle by the tick-borne intra-erythrocytic bacteria of the genus Anaplasma occurs worldwide. Nevertheless, prevalence rates in specific regions are still required to inform cattle farming management decisions. A study was carried out to determine Anaplasma infection prevalence in beef and dairy cattle in the south east region of Botswana. Two methods were used: competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (cELISA) and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 429 cattle consisting 207 beef and 222 dairy animals were sampled and tested. The prevalence was 91% and 31% by cELISA and PCR, respectively. A Z test revealed a statistical difference between the point prevalence as determined by cELISA compared to PCR (p=0). There was no statistical difference between the point prevalence of Anaplasma infection as determined by cELISA (p=0.45) between beef and dairy cattle. But there was a significant difference (p=0.001) between the animals by PCR with the prevalence in beef cattle nearly double that in dairy cattle. Individual herd prevalence ranged from 79% to 100% by cELISA, and 0 to 100% by PCR. Though not statistically significant sero-prevalence in both beef and dairy animals tended to be higher in urban/peri-urban areas compared to rural areas. The cELISA mean percentage inhibition (PI) for all cattle was found to be 58.6 (95% CI: 56.8-60.4). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean PI of sera from beef cattle (56.4 (95% CI: 54.1-58.7)) as compared to dairy cattle (60.7 (95%CI: 58.0-63.3)). However, there was a tendency towards statistical significance with beef animals having a lower PI value than dairy animals. Anaplasma infection was endemic in cattle in the south east region of Botswana with similar infection in beef and dairy animals.

A pair of aborted twins was recovered for diagnostic investigation. One of these fetuses and its dam were seropositive for T. gondii. Histological examination of the two fetuses revealed non-suppurative myocarditis and epicarditis, portal hepatitis and multifocal necrotizing encephalitis with protozoal cysts in the brain. T. gondii was detected intralesionally by immunohistochemistry in one fetus and by PCR in both.

Twenty - seven double purpose herds were visited to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in cattle at the Rio de Oro and Aguachica municipalities. Overall, 862 fecal samples were collected in three age groups: <12months, 12-24months and >24months. Stool samples were taken directly from the rectum and refrigerated until processing. For parasite determination, fecal samples were processed using coprological techniques. The parasitic genera were identified by egg or infective larval morphology. The global prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites was 83.2%, being the highest values for Eimeria sp. (77.9%), Strongyloides sp. (10.8%) and Haemonchus sp. (8.5%). Regarding the prevalence by municipalities, there was no statistical association (P>0.05) indicating that the prevalence was similar in the two municipalities. Regarding the results for Eimeria sp., different degrees of positivity were observed, reflecting that there was statistical association (P<0.05) with respect to the age group, suggesting that adult animals may act as infection source for calves. Likewise, there was statistical association (P<0.05) between the prevalence for Strongyloides sp., Haemonchus sp. and Trichostrongylus sp. with respect to the age group. It is concluded that there is a high prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dual-purpose cattle in the municipalities under study, and that it could be controlled by improving the hygienic conditions of the herds, and informing the farmer about parasite control programs.",Seasonal variation in the prevalence of equine tapeworms using coprological diagnosis during a seven-year period in Denmark.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014802,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 05 13,"We investigated the prevalence of equine tapeworms, Anoplocephala spp., in Danish horses during a seven-year period assessed by coprological analysis.

This allowed us to test for possible differences between regions (or soil types) and seasons. For a sub-set of the data (about 1200 observations) age of horses was also known, and it was shown that prevalence was highest in the age group 1-5years and then declined with age. We observed no significant difference in the prevalence of Anoplocephala spp. across the geographic regions suggesting that risk of infection was largely the same irrespective the soil types included in the study. Autumn was the season with highest prevalence. However, seasonality was not very marked, and our results show that egg-producing Anoplocephala spp. are found in Danish horses year-round.",Risk factor analysis associated with Theileria equi infected equines in semi-arid and sub-humid ecological enzootic zones of India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014801,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 05 13,"Equine piroplasmosis is a haemoprtozoan disease of equines and enzootic in tropical and subtropical countries.

Serum samples were collected from a total of 1021 equids that comprised of 792 horses, 168 donkeys and 61 mules and evaluated for T. equi specific antibodies in equine merozoite antigen-2 (EMA-2) based on indirect ELISA. The state with high sero-prevalence rate was Rajasthan (71.40%), followed by Haryana (60.39%) and Gujarat (48.92%). Overall T. equi sero-positivity in equines was 64.44%. Species-wise T. equi sero-prevalence was 66.29%, 51.19% and 91.80% in horses, donkeys and mules respectively. The association and risk factor among age, gender and species in relation with T. equi infection was statistically analyzed at 95% level of significance (p<0.05). A very high T. equi sero-positivity was recorded in 0-1year age group of equines (60%), indicating that this naïve age group contacts with T. equi infected ticks and remains infected throughout its lifetime. The sero-prevalence rate was significantly associated with the species of animal (p<0.05). The risk factor analysis kept mules at higher risk (Odd's ratio; 5.696; 95% confidence interval: 2.25-14.38) of getting infection as compared to horses and donkeys.

Analysis of the variables was based on 2755 epidemiological records of dogs positive and negative for CVL over a three-year period (2009, 2010 and 2011). A dog was considered positive when it presented amastigotes in the cytological examination of lymph node biopsy and/or was seropositive by immunoenzymatic and indirect immunofluorescence assays. CVL positive dogs were observed throughout the town, but significant differences were observed between the sectors analyzed (P<0.0001), with two sectors showing higher positivity. CVL prevalence was 35.9% and was significantly associated with age and breed (P<0.0001). Concerning symptoms, 44.3% of symptomatic dogs were positive for LV (P<0.0001) in an urban area endemic for this zoonosis."

Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) is a key regulator of different types of DNA damage, which is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. The ATR-selective inhibitor VE-822 has proper solubility, potency, and pharmacokinetic properties. In this study, we investigated the anti-leukemic effects of VE-822 alone or combined with Wee1-selective inhibitor AZD1775 in AML cells. Our results showed that VE-822 inhibited AML cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. AZD1775 significantly promoted VE-822-induced inhibition of AML cell proliferation and led to a decreased number of cells in the G2/M phase. VE-822 and AZD1775 decreased the protein levels of ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and M2 (RRM2) subunits, key enzymes in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate, which increased DNA replication stress. VE-822 combined with AZD1775 synergistically induced AML cell apoptosis and led to replication stress and DNA damage in AML cell lines. Our study demonstrated that AZD1775 synergistically promotes VE-822-induced anti-leukemic activity in AML cell lines and provides support for clinical research on VE-822 in combination with AZD1775 for the treatment of AML patients.",Sulodexide Promotes Arterial Relaxation via Endothelium-Dependent Nitric Oxide-Mediated Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014752,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 06 08,"Sulodexide (SDX) is a highly purified glycosaminoglycan with antithrombotic and profibrinolytic properties and reported benefits in thrombotic and atherosclerotic vascular disorders. However, the effects of SDX on vascular function are unclear. We tested whether SDX affects vascular relaxation and examined the potential underlying mechanisms. Isolated segments of male rat abdominal aorta and mesenteric artery were suspended in a tissue bath, and the changes in arterial contraction/relaxation were measured. The α-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine (Phe) (10-9 to 10-5 M) caused concentration-dependent aortic and mesenteric artery contraction that was reduced in tissues pretreated with SDX (1 mg/ml). In aortic and mesenteric arterial segments precontracted with submaximal concentration of Phe (3x10-7 to 6x10-7 M), SDX (0.001 to 1 mg/ml) caused-concentration-dependent relaxation. To test the role of endothelium, SDX-induced relaxation was compared with that of acetylcholine (ACh), a known activator of endothelium-dependent relaxation. In Phe precontracted aorta, ACh relaxation was abolished and SDX relaxation was significantly inhibited by endothelium removal or the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), suggesting a role of NO. In mesenteric artery, ACh relaxation was abolished by endothelium removal, partially blocked by L-NAME, and completely blocked by a mixture of indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and blocker of the PGI2-cAMP pathway, and tetraethylammonium, a blocker of K+ channels and EDHF-dependent hyperpolarization pathway. In comparison, SDX relaxation of mesenteric artery was almost completely inhibited by endothelium removal or NOS inhibitor L-NAME. SDX enhanced vascular relaxation and increased nitrate/nitrite production in response to all ACh concentrations in the aorta, but only to low ACh concentrations (<10-7 M) in mesenteric artery. SDX did not affect aortic or mesenteric artery endothelium-independent relaxation to the NO donor sodium-nitroprusside. Thus, SDX promotes arterial relaxation via a mechanism involving endothelium-dependent NO production; an effect that could enhance vasodilation and decrease vasoconstriction in vascular disorders.",Endoscopic closure of gastrointestinal perforations and fistulas using the Ovesco Over-The-Scope Clip system at a tertiary care hospital center.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014750,Revista de gastroenterologia de Mexico,2019 06 05,"Enteric perforations and fistulas are difficult to manage due to comorbidities, poor nutritional status, and anatomic challenges related to multiple interventions in those patients.

Since the economic, clinical and epidemiological importance of the infection in sheep remains uncertain, this work investigated the seroprevalence of anti-N. caninum antibodies and associated factors in the rapidly expanding flock of Rio de Janeiro state. Blood samples from 388 sheep of 12 farms were collected and sera tested by a commercial Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Seroprevalence at the animal-level was of 6.2% (24/388) and, at the herd-level, 50% (6/12) of the studied farms had at least one seropositive animal. Multivariate analysis detected that occasional veterinary assistance (P < 0.05) was significantly associated to higher seroprevalence, which is also associated to age (P < 0.001) and gender (P < 0.0001). Farmers' investments should focus on making technical assistance more frequent and future studies should assess the association of veterinary assistance with anti-N. caninum antibodies in sheep flocks.","Molecular detection of Cryptosporidium species in street-sampled dog faeces in Ibadan, Nigeria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014737,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Cryptosporidium, an intestinal protozoan parasite that infects a wide range of animals, is shed to the environment through the faeces of infected hosts that include humans and companion animals. Environmental contamination with infective oocysts increases the risk of transmission of this zoonotic pathogen to other susceptible host. In this study, Cryptosporidium was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 18S rRNA gene in 2.5% (5/203) of dog faecal samples randomly collected from 23 streets of Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria. Nucleotide sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene yielded two genotypes, C. parvum and C. muris in three and two samples, respectively. Further amplification of the gp60 gene-coding 60-kDa glycoprotein for subtype determination detected two isolates as C. parvum subtype IIc family. C. parvum subtype IIc is a human-derived pathogen while C. muris has been reported to infect rodents and even humans. The findings of this study suggest that free-ranging urban dogs could act as reservoirs and potential sources of environmental contamination with Cryptosporidium species of public health importance.","Fecal survey of parasites in free-roaming cats in northcentral Oklahoma, United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014736,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Cats can be infected by various intestinal parasites, some that are zoonotic. Although surveys of parasite prevalence in owned and shelter cats have been published, none addressed free-roaming, wild-trapped, domestic cat (Felis catus) populations. An opportunity to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites in wild-trapped, free-roaming cats in northcentral Oklahoma, United States occurred through a trap-neuter-return (TNR) program conducted at Oklahoma State University, Boren Veterinary Medical Hospital, between February 2015 and April 2016. Approximately 1 g to 5 g of feces was collected from 846 free-roaming cats either from cage traps, when available, or rectally using disposable fecal loops and examined by centrifugal fecal flotation tests with 33% zinc sulfate solution. Parasite infections were confirmed by microscopic detection of eggs, cysts, or oocysts and visual detection of proglottids. Approximately 63.9% (541/846) of free-roaming cats were infected by at least one parasite, and 24.9% (211/846) of cats were infected by multiple parasites. The most common intestinal parasite infections detected were: Toxocara cati (44.6%; 377/846), followed by Alaria (13.4%; 113/846), Ancylostoma (11.2%; 95/846), Cystoisospora (9.7%; 82/846), taeniids (7.7%; 65/846), Dipylidium caninum (4.5%; 38/846), Physaloptera (2.2%; 19/846), Eucoleus aerophilus (1.4%; 12/846), Giardia (1.2%; 10/846), and a small (10-12 μm in diameter) Toxoplasma-like oocyst (0.1%; 1/846). A few ectoparasites, Demodex gatoi (0.5%; 4/846) and Cheyletiella (0.1%; 1/846), were also detected by fecal flotation. Our findings indicate that a higher prevalence of parasite infections occurs in free-roaming cats in Oklahoma than in owned cats, and these free-roaming cats contribute to contamination of the environment with several zoonotic parasites. Regional data on the prevalence of parasites in free-roaming cats can aid in the justification for parasite control programs in owned cats since both can share the same environment and supports the current practice of routine broad-spectrum anthelmintic and ectoparasite treatments for owned cats.",Modelling the distribution of Rhipicephalus microplus and R. decoloratus in Zimbabwe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014735,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Species distribution modelling is a very useful tool in vector management. Ticks are vectors of various pathogens which cause serious problems in livestock production in tropical countries. They have a high dispersal potential which is mainly facilitated by the movement of animals from one area to another. In light of the observed geographic expansion of Rhipicephalus microplus in Zimbabwe, we used species distribution modelling techniques to identify areas which may provide suitable habitats for the occurrence of this invasive tick species as well as the autochthonous Rhipicephalus decoloratus. Our results suggest that, despite the geographic expansion of R. microplus, climate will continue to be a limiting factor for the further expansion of this tick species. We expect its distribution to be restricted to the most favourable areas in the eastern and northern parts. The greater part of Zimbabwe is suitable for R. decoloratus, although in areas where R. microplus occurs, displacement of the former by the latter will be expected to occur. A heterogeneous climate, unregulated movement of cattle and episodic droughts are suggested to be possible factors for the continued existence of R. microplus and R. decoloratus in Zimbabwe and the partial displacement.",Factors associated with seroprevalence of bovine anaplasmosis in Texas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014734,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Bovine anaplasmosis (BA), caused by Anaplasma marginale, is an economically important tick-borne disease of cattle in the United States (U.S.) and worldwide. Anecdotally, Veterinary Feed Directive prescriptions in the southeastern U.S. are written mostly for treatment/prevention of BA. However, there are no recent temporal seroprevalence estimates of BA in Texas (TX). Thus, this study was aimed at determining the seroprevalence of and factors associated with BA in TX. Data were obtained from an active slaughter survey (n = 215) performed between August and December 2014 as well as from reviewing Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (TVMDLs) records of specimens submitted for BA testing from January 2002 to June 2012 (n = 15,460). Irrespective of the assay used, the overall apparent seroprevalence of BA in TX between 2002 and 2012 was 15.91% (95% CI: 15.34 - 16.50%) and the yearly increase in seroprevalence followed a significant trend (P < .0001). With cELISA, the apparent seroprevalence of BA was 13.49% (95% CI: 9.56 - 18.7%) and 13.02% (95% CI: 9.74 - 17.18%) for the slaughter survey and TVMDLs records between October and December 2011, respectively. Whereas the estimated true seroprevalence for the same period was 12.35% (95% CI: 8.04 - 18.05%) and 12.78% (95% CI: 9.19 - 17.30%), respectively. Factors associated with positive BA results were age, breed, diagnostic assay used, year and quarter of the year the specimens were submitted. The odds of the outcome were 1.5 times as high when cattle were adults (vs juvenile). In comparison to other breeds, the odds of the outcome were 11.57, 7.16, and 2.5 times higher in Hereford, Angus, and mixed breeds, respectively. When compared to 2003, the odds of the diagnosis of BA was approximately 2 times as high in 2010 but 3 times as high in 2002, 2005, and 2011 and approximately 4 times as high in 2006 and 2007. In comparison to the duration from October to December, the odds of the outcome were approximately 1.5 as high from January to March and from July to September durations. Counties with specimen submissions for BA testing had a significantly greater cattle population (p = .0061) and number of cattle farms (p < .001) than counties without specimen submissions. Subsequent prevention and control measures for BA should target these factors and should prioritize on counties with higher cattle population in the eastern part of TX. Furthermore, TVMDLs records appear sufficient for the surveillance of BA in TX.",Management practices associated with strongylid parasite prevalence on horse farms in rural counties of Kentucky.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014733,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Anthelmintic resistance among cyathostomin parasites is a wide-spread problem. The parasite control guidelines written by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) encourages the preservation of anthelmintic efficacy by reducing treatment frequency, using targeted deworming, and implementing environmental management practices. While there is knowledge regarding parasite management practices of affluent horse farms in the United States, surveys rarely explore the rural and underserved regions. The purpose of this study was to observe the management practices of horse farms in rural regions Kentucky, including working Amish farms, and determine factors associated with strongyle prevalence. A total of 160 horses among 38 owners from 28 different farms were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire survey regarding equine information, farm management, and deworming history was performed with each owner. Fecal samples were collected to determine fecal egg counts, perform coprocultures for subsequent strongyle larvae identification, and Strongylus vulgaris specific PCR. Serum samples were collected for the S. vulgaris antibody specific ELISA. The mean number of deworming treatments given in the last year was 2.1 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.9-2.3 with ivermectin being the most common active used. Statistical analysis showed horses treated within the last three months with a macrocylic lactone (ML) drug had significantly lower egg counts than horses treated with a ML 7-9 months ago (p = .0005). Despite the AAEP recommendations to reduce the overall number of treatments by using a surveillance-based approach and to no longer rotate treatments, only 17 horses reportedly had a fecal sample submitted for a fecal egg count and 65 horses were dewormed in a rotational manner. Horses whose owners utilized an informative deworming source (i.e., veterinarian, internet, magazine, local feed store) also had significantly lower counts (p = .0026). All coprocultures were negative for S. vulgaris while five horses were PCR positive. Interestingly, 95 horses tested ELISA positive for S. vulgaris. The strongyle egg counts of the working Amish horses were not significantly different from the other horses in this study and deworming practices including the use of efficacious drugs and low treatment frequencies were in accordance with the AAEP guidelines. This study was the first to summarize deworming management practices of rural regions in Kentucky, including a working Amish community. Overall, horse owners employed deworming practices recommended by the AAEP, however rotational deworming is still commonly implemented and fecal egg counts are rarely used.","Trypanosoma cruzi infection in naturally infected dogs from an endemic region of Cundinamarca, Colombia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014732,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"The seropositivity and risk factors for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in dogs from a municipality of Cundinamarca, a central state of Colombia were studied. A total of 356 client-owned dogs from urban, peri-urban and rural areas of La Mesa municipality, (Cundinamarca, Colombia) were randomly selected. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture. Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Reactive ELISA sera were processed by indirect immunofluorescence to confirm the presence of anti-T. cruzi antibodies. Chi-square tests were conducted for statistical analysis. Serologic tests for T. cruzi infection showed a prevalence of 29.49% (105/356), the rural area show a highest T. cruzi infection pattern in comparison with the other zone locations. Two triatomine species were found through the study: Panstrongylus geniculatus (53.4%) and Rhodnius colombiensis (46.6%). The prevalence of positive vectors for parasite was of 52.1% (38/73). Additionally, a very close relation between triatomine bugs and dogs in the rural zone (1:3.1) was observed. These results are the first report of natural infection by T. cruzi in domestic dogs in La Mesa municipality. In conclusion, the presence of anti-T. cruzi antibodies in dogs in this area suggest vector transmission. There is a need for active surveillance programs throughout the La Mesa municipality and vector control strategies should also be implemented.",Overview and features of larval developmental sites of biting midges species associated with livestock in Israel with implications to their control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014731,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"The larval developmental sites of Culicoides species were assessed from 1155 samples collected during the years 1969-2003.

The nematode has recently been detected in cattle as well. The distribution of A. sidemi in Russia has not been sufficiently clarified yet. In European part of Russia A. sidemi was formerly registered in sika deer (Cervus nippon) and maral (Cervus elaphus sibiricus) introduced from Asia, and also in aboriginal elks (Alces alces). Taking into consideration the presence of other species of ruminants susceptible to A. sidemi in European Russia, it is necessary to control the spread of this parasite. The specimens of males and females of A. sidemi were found during the autopsies of three naturally infected roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) from Voronezh and Tver regions (European Russia). The species affiliation of the discovered nematodes was determined according to morphological features and confirmed using molecular techniques. The intensity of infection with A. sidemi in two roe deer from Voronezh was 11 and 63 nematodes, and it was 17 nematodes in roe deer from Tver. All of the discovered specimens of A. sidemi were referred to juvenile forms based on features of male bursa morphology and weak development of female reproductive system. In Russia, A. sidemi has not previously been detected in C. capreolus and the present report constitutes the first record of the parasite occurrence in this species of ruminant.","Genotyping of Toxoplasma gondii from pigs in Yucatan, Mexico.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014729,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution. The parasite exhibits strong geographical patterns of strain variation with contrasting high levels of diversity across South America and restricted variation across North America. Little is known about the diversity of strains in the transitional area between the two continents. Here we present data on the prevalance and diversity of Toxoplasma gondii in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, through a study in commercially reared pigs. A survey of 12 farms found evidence of circulating T. gondii DNA in 125 of 632 blood samples (19.8%, CI: 16.7%-23%). In addition, 46 tongue samples were collected from culled animals and 16 of these were positive for T. gondii DNA and 3 were positive in mouse bioassay. PCR-sequencing was used to generate genotyping data from blood and tissue samples. Four loci (SAG1, 2, 3 and GRA6) were reliably amplified and revealed a high diversity among Yucatan strains with evidence of recombination and novel alleles. Sequencing data from the four loci was achieved in eight samples each of which had a different genotype. The predominant allelic type was atypical, in relation to the dominant strain types (I, II, III), the number of allelic variants being 27 (I, II-III, u-1-25), 20 (I, III, u1-18), 6 (I, III, u1-4) and 11 (I, II, u1-9) for the SAG1, SAG2, SAG3 and GRA6 loci respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that T. gondii strains from Yucatan shared alleles with strains originating from both North and South America. Our findings are consistent with data from other regions of Central America and suggest the genetic population structure of the parasite, with significant levels of allelic variation and recombination, constitutes a reservoir from which new strains may emerge. Positive bioassay results (7.5%) indicate that consumption of undercooked pork could be a potential T. gondii infection risk to humans."

The specimen was morphologically identified as a female Dioctophyme renale, measuring 30 cm in length. The wound was cleaned with chlorhexidine solution. The patient was started on cefpodoxime 100 mg orally, once daily for 10 days. The dog had recent history of a mammary tumor on the left chain. After a week, an ultrasound examination confirmed integrity of the kidneys. Herein, we also provide a review on cases of ectopic dioctophymosis in companion animals in the Americas. Such cases are not uncommon, and nematodes may be found in various organs and tissues including the abdominal and thoracic cavities, scrotum, uterus, and mammary glands.",Seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum infections in cattle in Mongolia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014714,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are protozoan parasites that cause huge economic losses in animal industries worldwide. N. caninum can cause abortion storms and high culling rates in cattle, whereas T. gondii infection is a significant concern in both human and animals because it can induce abortion and clinical symptoms in immunocompromised hosts. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii and N. caninum in cattle in Mongolia. Specific antibodies to T. gondii and N. caninum were detected by using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) based on recombinant antigens of dense granule protein 7 of Toxoplasma gondii and surface antigen 1 of Neospora caninum, respectively. A total of 1438 cattle sera from 20 of 21 provinces of Mongolia and the capital city of Ulaanbaatar were tested. Overall, 18.7% and 26.2% of cattle were positive for specific antibodies to T. gondii and N. caninum, respectively. Prevalence rates were higher (T. gondii infection: P < .0001, N. caninum infection: P = .002) in the central region of Mongolia (T. gondii infection: 27.1%, N. caninum infection: 30.8%) compared with western region, suggesting that prevalence rates might be influenced by geographical condition, particularly warmer temperatures around this area in Mongolia. The lowest prevalence rates were observed in the western region of Mongolia (T. gondii: 9%, N. caninum: 20.8%). In addition, the seroprevalence of N. caninum in female animals (27.5%) was significantly higher than that in male animals (20.4%) (P = .018), suggesting an important risk factor of abortion and stillbirth in cattle. The present results showed that T. gondii and N. caninum infections might be a risk for public health and economy of the livestock industry in Mongolia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates high seroprevalences of T. gondii and N. caninum in Mongolia and provides valuable new data for development of control measures against these infections in Mongolia.",Genetic characterisation of Fasciola gigantica from Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014713,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica are the causal agents of the zoonotic food-born disease fascioliasis. Africa is primarily endemic to F. gigantica, although sympatric presence of F. hepatica is known for some countries. The present situation of fascioliasis in western Africa, and Ghana in particular, is still poorly understood, and studies including molecular identification of species and variants are lacking. In this explorative study we genotyped 19 Fasciola isolates obtained by opportunistic sampling in the Upper East and Upper West Regions of Ghana. All isolates were identified as F. gigantica based on a partial sequence of the 28S rRNA (548 bp) gene. In addition, the complete mtDNA nad1 (903 bp) gene was employed to infer intraspecific microvariation among isolates. Six nad1 haplotypes were identified that clustered into two West African haplogroups when compared with previous records from Nigeria. These preliminary data suggest that fascioliasis in Ghana is (at least) mainly caused by F. gigantica, and that transmission may be principally autochthonous. However, the small number of isolates prevents firm conclusions, and this study is intended to stimulate molecular surveys on this neglected disease in a neglected region.","Multiple-resistance to ivermectin and benzimidazole of a Haemonchus contortus population in a sheep flock from mainland France, first report.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014712,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Anthelmintic resistance was explored by fecal egg count reduction test in a sheep flock from the French Pyrenees at the request of the veterinary practitioner after a poor response to anthelmintics was noted. The FECRT confirmed the suspicion with a mean percentage of reduction in egg excretions of 45% (CI 95%: - 40 to 78.5) and 0% (CI95%: - 162 to 49) within the ivermectin and the benzimidazole groups respectively. Haemonchus contortus was shown to be the IVM and BZ resistant species after morphological and molecular characterizations whereas Teladorsagia circumcincta was probably resistant to BZ only. The H. contortus population was still susceptible to moxidectin, closantel and levamisole. As this sheep flock is a transhumant flock, the spread of this multiple-resistant Haemonchus contortus population to the other sheep flocks sharing the same pastures in Pyrenean Mountains is highly likely. From the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report of multi-resistance to ivermectin and benzimidazole of a Haemonchus contortus population in mainland France.","Serological and molecular prevalence of equine piroplasmosis in Western Java, Indonesia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014711,"Veterinary parasitology, regional studies and reports",2019 06 07,"Equine piroplasmosis is an economically significant disease caused by Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, which are tick-borne hemoprotozoan parasites. Infections with these parasite species had never been reported in horses in Indonesia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of T. equi and B. caballi in horses reared in parts of Western Java, Indonesia. Blood samples were collected randomly from 235 horses in four different districts (Bandung, Depok, Tangerang, and Bogor) in Western Java, Indonesia. Thin blood smears prepared from the sampled animals were stained by Giemsa and observed under a light microscope. Serum samples prepared from blood were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on recombinant forms of EMA-2 and BC48 antigens to determine the seroprevalence of T. equi and B. caballi, respectively. DNA samples extracted from the same blood samples were screened by EMA-2 and BC48 gene-based nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assays for T. equi and B. caballi infections, respectively. Of 235 surveyed animals, five (2.1%) and 15 (6.4%) were seropositive for T. equi and B. caballi, respectively, whereas one and four horses were nPCR-positive for T. equi and B. caballi, respectively. All of the surveyed animals were negative for T. equi and B. caballi by microscopy. The T. equi EMA-2 and B. caballi BC48 gene fragments amplified by the nPCR assays were cloned, sequenced, and subjected to bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses. The T. equi EMA-2 gene sequence from an Indonesian horse was identical to sequences from Florida and Washington strains and clustered together with these sequences in phylogeny. On the other hand, four Indonesian BC48 gene sequences shared 99.8-100% identity scores. This present study is the first to report T. equi and B. caballi in horses in Indonesia. Our findings highlight the need for monitoring horses in Indonesia for clinical piroplasmosis caused by T. equi and B. caballi.",Asymmetry of Retinopathy of Prematurity Border in the Telemedicine Approaches to Evaluating Acute-Phase Retinopathy of Prematurity Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014707,Ophthalmology.

All patients suspected of having a metachronous cystadenolymphoma, and who had a minimum follow-up time of 12 months, were studied (n = 26). Data about the growth rate, number of lesions, and symptoms of inflammation were recorded. Mean (range) follow-up was 36 (13-94) months. Metachronous tumours developed in three cases on the ipsilateral side, in 22 cases on the contralateral side, and on both sides in one case. The mean rate of growth /lesion was 15% /year (range: 22%-158%). There were no signs of local inflammation. The extreme variability in the behaviour of metachronous cystadenolymphomas points to the need for an individualised approach, accurate investigation of the sonographic characteristics, and continuous watchful waiting in affected patients.",Conformational changes of antitoxin HigA from Escherichia coli str. K-12 upon binding of its cognate toxin HigB reveal a new regulation mechanism in toxin-antitoxin systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014676,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"HigA functions as the antitoxin in HigB-HigA toxin-antitoxin system. It neutralizes HigB-mediated toxicity by forming a stable toxin-antitoxin complex. Here the crystal structure of isolated HigA from Escherichia coli str. K-12 has been determined to 2.0 Å resolution. The structural differences between HigA and HigA in HigBA complex imply that HigA undergoes drastic conformational changes upon the binding of HigB. The conformational changes are achieved by rigid motions of N-terminal and C-terminal domains of HigA around its central linker domain, which is different from other known forms of regulation patterns in other organisms. As a transcriptional regulator, HigA bind to its operator DNA through the C-terminal HTH motif, in which key residues were identified in this study.",Vaspin prevents myocardial injury in rats model of diabetic cardiomyopathy by enhancing autophagy and inhibiting inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014675,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays an important role in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). It is known that autophagy is related to the activation of inflammasomes during oxidative stress. Visceral adipose tissue-derived serine protease inhibitor (Vaspin), is an adipocytokine that has been shown to exert a protective effect on autophagic activity, but whether and how Vaspin improves myocardial damage in DCM remain unclear. In this study, we explored the role of Vaspin in DCM using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model. Cardiac function, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, myocardial tissue morphology, and mitochondrial morphology in diabetic rats were improved after eight weeks of Vaspin treatment. Vaspin treatment augmented autophagy activation in diabetic rat hearts. Moreover, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was inhibited by Vaspin, followed by a decrease in the cleavage of caspase-1 and maturation of IL-1β and TNF-ɑ. In vitro studies found that the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as well as the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane in H9C2cells induced by high glucose were attenuated by Vaspin. This inhibitory effect of Vaspin on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was due to the protection of autophagy activity and was abolished after the treatment of autophagy inhibitor (3-MA). These results demonstrate that Vaspin alleviates STZ-induced myocardial injury and renders a cardioprotective effect by suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and promoting autophagy.",Protein encapsulation in the hollow space of hemocyanin crystals containing a covalently conjugated ligand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014674,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"Encapsulation of guest molecules into the vacant space of biomacromolecular crystals has been utilized for various purposes including functioning as a protein container to protect against physical stress and structural determination of the guest. Todarodes pacificus hemocyanin (TpHc) is a hollow cylindrical decameric protein complex with an inner space 110 Å in diameter and 160 Å in height. In the crystal, TpHc forms a straw-like bundle and contains one reactive Cys (Cys3246) in the inner domain of each protomer. Here, we conjugated biotin onto Cys3246 of TpHc followed by incubation with streptavidin. The streptavidin was immobilized into the inner space of TpHc due to its interaction with biotin. Moreover, the complex containing TpHc and streptavidin was crystallized under the same conditions used for unmodified TpHc. In order to expand this methodology for a variety of proteins, we conjugated the ligand nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) chelated to a Ni2+ ion (Ni2+-NTA) to TpHc. We found that His-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) was encapsulated into the Ni2+-NTA-conjugated TpHc via the interaction between the His-tag and the Ni2+-NTA group. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the crystal packing of the complex containing TpHc and GFP was identical to that of the unmodified TpHc. Our guest immobilization method is distinct from previous approaches that are dependent on diffusion of the guest into the host crystal. Thus, our findings may accelerate the development of proteinaceous crystal engineering.",The histone demethylase Kdm4 suppresses activation of hepatic stellate cell by inducing MiR-29 transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014673,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"One of the hallmark events during liver fibrosis is the transition of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) into activated myofibroblasts, which are responsible for the production and deposition of pro-fibrogenic proteins. The epigenetic mechanism underlying HSC trans-differentiation is not fully understood. In the present study we investigated the contribution of histone H3K9 demethylase KDM4 in this process. We report that expression levels of KDM4 were down-regulated during HSC activation paralleling the up-regulation of alpha smooth muscle cell actin (Acta2), a marker of mature myofibroblast. Furthermore, HSCs isolated from mice induced to develop liver fibrosis exhibit lowered KDM4 expression compared to the control mice. In accordance, KDM4 depletion with siRNA accelerated HSC activation. Of interest, the loss of KDM4 was mirrored by the repression of miR-29, an antagonist of liver fibrosis, during HSC activation both in vitro and in vivo. KDM4 knockdown resulted in the down-regulation of miR-29 expression. Mechanistically, the sequence-specific transcription factor SREBP2 interacted with KDM4 to activate miR-29 transcription. In conclusion, our data delineate a novel epigenetic mechanism underlying HSC activation. Targeting this axis may yield potential therapeutics against liver fibrosis.",Long non-coding RNA00882 contributes to platelet-derived growth factor-induced proliferation of human fetal airway smooth muscle cells by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling via sponging miR-3619-5p.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014672,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as novel and critical regulators in the pathogenesis of asthma. However, the precise role of lncRNAs in pediatric asthma remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the biological function of lncRNA00882 (LINC00882) in regulating the proliferation of fetal airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells, which play an important role in airway remodeling during asthma development. Herein, we found that LINC00882 expression was significantly up-regulated in ASM cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Functional experiments showed that the knockdown of LINC00882 markedly reduced the proliferation of fetal ASM cells induced by PDGF, while the overexpression of LINC00882 exhibited the opposite effect. Bioinformatics analysis, the luciferase reporter assay and the RNA pull-down assay revealed that LINC00882 directly interacted with microRNA-3619-5p (miR-3619-5p). LINC00882 negatively regulated miR-3619-5p expression in fetal ASM cells. Notably, β-catenin was identified as a target gene of miR-3619-5p. miR-3619-5p overexpression restricted PDGF-induced cell proliferation through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Moreover, miR-3619-5p overexpression significantly attenuated the LINC00882-induced promotion effect on PDGF-induced cell proliferation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in fetal ASM cells. In contrast, miR-3619-5p inhibition significantly reversed the LINC00882 knockdown-mediated inhibitory effect on PDGF-induced cell proliferation and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LINC00882 promotes PDGF-induced cell proliferation of ASM cells by enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling via sponging miR-3619-5p, suggesting a potential role for LINC00882 in airway remodeling in pediatric asthma.",ALOX12 inhibition sensitizes breast cancer to chemotherapy via AMPK activation and inhibition of lipid synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014671,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 19,"Arachidonate lipoxygenase12 (Alox12) and its metabolites 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12S-HETE) have been implicated in influencing tumor transformation and progression. In this study, we have systematically evaluated the expression, function and the downstream effectors of Alox12 in breast cancer using loss- and gain-of-function approaches. We demonstrated that both mRNA and protein levels of Alox12 were significantly increased in multiple breast cancer cell lines compared to normal breast cells. The upregulation of Alox12 expression was also observed in breast cancer tissues and their matched normal breast tissues obtained from patients. Functionally, we demonstrated that Alox12 overexpression was sufficient to stimulate growth in normal breast cells but not breast cancer cells. This also protects breast cancer cell from chemotherapy-induced growth arrest and apoptosis. In contrast, Alox12 depletion inhibited breast cancer growth and survival, and significantly enhanced the chemotherapeutic agents' efficacy. Mechanism studies showed that Alox12 depletion activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase1 (ACC1) enzyme activity and lipid synthesis. The recuse of the effects of Alox12 depletion using Alox12 metabolites 12S-HETE further confirmed that AMPK and its subsequent inhibition of ACC1 activity and lipid synthesis were the downstream signaling of Alox12 inhibition. Our findings highlighted the important role of Alox12 in breast cancer, particularly in response to chemotherapy. Our work also demonstrate that inhibiting Alox12 is a possible alternative therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer."

Currently, neuronal injury and synapse loss have been considered to be main features in the pathophysiology of AD. Thus, modulation of neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth may represent an efficient strategy for the treatment of AD. Based on the isolates from the traditional medicine Andrographis paniculata, a series of andrographolide analogues were prepared and evaluated for the neuroprotection and neurotrophic activity. Two compounds (3 and 12) could effectively inhibit LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression as well as proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, pretreatment with 3 and 12 could protect neurons against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. Further, H2O2- and 6-OHDA induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells were also attenuated by the novel 12. Our next study indicated that compounds 1, 4 and 10 promoted NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, with 10 the most potent. To clarify the underlying mechanisms of active compounds (3, 10 and 12), system pharmacology was employed. The results revealed that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) may be the main targets of 12 against AD, while thyroid hormone signaling pathway was involved in the mechanisms of 10.

However, the bioleaching mechanism of LiCoO2 has not been clearly elaborated. In the present study, the effects of the energy source of bacteria, such as Fe2+, pyrite and S0, and the products of bacterial oxidation, such as Fe3+ and sulfuric acid, on the chemical leaching of LiCoO2 were studied. The results indicated that lithium was dissolved by acid, and cobalt was released by the reduction of Fe2+ and acid dissolution. The recovery of Li+ and Co2+ could be significantly improved by pH adjustment. Finally, optimal recoveries of Li+ and Co2+ were observed in the pyrite group, reaching 91.4% and 94.2%, respectively. By using pyrite as the energy source, the role of bacteria in bioleaching of LiCoO2 was investigated. The results showed that bacteria could produce sulfuric acid by oxidizing pyrite to promote the mobilization of Li+ and Co2+. The recovery of lithium and cobalt could be increased to 100.0% and 99.3% by bacteria. Moreover, extracellular polymeric substances secreted by bacteria were found to be a factor for the improvement of Li+ and Co2+ recovery.",Antiviral treatment and virological monitoring of oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 in a patient with chronic B lymphocytic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014561,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2019 06 04,"We report the virological monitoring and the antiviral therapy adopted for the treatment of a patient affected by chronic B lymphocytic leukemia, who experienced a severe pneumonia with long-term shedding of influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09, characterized by an early development of oseltamivir resistance.",Safety and feasibility of cholecystectomy in octogenarians.

The process of cell mobilisation or transcellular cell migration from BM into the circulation (cell egress) is a crucial biological process in mammals as it is important to maintain homeostasis of various physiological functions including, but not limited to, the immune system, erythropoiesis, platelet release, and stem cell migration. The BM microvascular system composes of a monolayer of specialized endothelial cells, called sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs). While it is very well evident that the process of cell egress occurs exclusively through BM SECs, there is a lack of systematic analyses addressing the extent of contribution of BM SECs to the process of cell egress from the BM. Therefore, this review aims to address the potential ability of BM SECs in regulating and/or facilitating the process of cell egress from BM. In this review, we address, firstly, the unique ultra-/structural and molecular features of BM SECs and discuss the possible biological interactions between BM SECs and various egressing cells in physiological conditions. Secondly, we propose the potential role of BM SECs in egress of leukemic cells from BM into the circulation. Finally, we discuss the potential role of BM SECs in homing of haematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, the current review suggests that the BM SECs may not be merely a neutral gatekeeper for cell intravasation and extravasation, but rather is a dynamic trafficking surveillance system, thereby the process of BM cell egress/mobilisation can be regulated.",Immune-checkpoint inhibitors and candidate surrogate endpoints for overall survival across tumour types: A systematic literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014514,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,2019 05 21,Surrogate endpoints (SEs) for overall survival (OS) are specific to therapeutic class.

The present review aims at providing updated evidence on the state of the art about the available techniques and indications for radiation therapy in patients with early breast cancer, specifically focusing on young women. In addition, future perspectives including the ongoing trials and the potential impact of combined approaches with systemic therapies (such as immunotherapy) are reviewed. Major conclusions from this overview are that young women affected by invasive breast cancer seem to receive the greatest benefit from the boost on the tumor bed. Most young patients affected by ductal carcinoma in situ should receive postoperative whole breast irradiation (WBI). When regional node irradiation is considered, young age should be considered as a high-risk factor. Partial breast irradiation is not suitable for young patients and should be recommended within the context of a clinical trial. Importantly, robust data have already supported the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated-WBI schedules that should now replace standard fractionated-WBI as gold standard for all patients irrespective of their age. Finally, organs-at-risk sparing systems as strategy for prevention of radiation-related long-term toxicities should be strongly considered for these patients. Considering the lack of inclusion of young patients in several published trials as well as in some of the ongoing ones, robust evidence to counsel young breast cancer patients on the optimal radiation therapy approach is still lacking. Further studies and ad hoc subgroup analyses in this specific patient population are strongly warranted.",Role of epigenetic mechanisms in cisplatin-induced toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014509,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,2019 05 21,"Cisplatin (CDDP) is a highly effective antineoplastic agent, widely used in the treatment of various malignant tumors. However, its major problems are side effects associated to toxicity. Considerable inter-individual differences have been reported for CDDP-induced toxicity due to genetic and epigenetic factors. Genetic causes are well described; however, epigenetic modifications are not fully addressed. In the last few years, many evidences were found linking microRNA to the development of CDDP-mediated toxicity, particularly nephrotoxicity. In this review, we described how genetic and epigenetic modifications can be important determinants for the development of toxicity in patients treated with CDDP, and how these alterations may be interesting biomarkers for monitoring toxicity induced by CDDP. Considering the validation in different studies, we suggest that miR-34a, -146b, -378a, -192, and -193 represent an attractive study group to evaluate potential biomarkers to detect CDDP-related nephrotoxicity."

The first lymphatic vessels arise from pre-existing veins after venous endothelial cells become specified as lymphatic progenitors. Prox1 specifies lymphatic fate and labels these progenitors; however, the mechanisms restricting Prox1 expression and limiting the progenitor pool remain unknown. We identified a zebrafish mutant that displayed premature, expanded, and prolonged lymphatic specification. The gene responsible encodes the regulator of alternative splicing, Nova2. In zebrafish and human endothelial cells, Nova2 selectively regulates pre-mRNA splicing for components of signaling pathways and phosphoproteins. Nova2-deficient endothelial cells display increased Mapk/Erk signaling, and Prox1 expression is dynamically controlled by Erk signaling. We identify a mechanism whereby Nova2-regulated splicing constrains Erk signaling, thus limiting lymphatic progenitor cell specification. This identifies the capacity of a factor that tunes mRNA splicing to control assignment of cell fate during vascular differentiation.",Efficient Front-Rear Coupling in Neutrophil Chemotaxis by Dynamic Myosin II Localization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014479,Developmental cell,2019 04 24,"Efficient chemotaxis requires rapid coordination between different parts of the cell in response to changing directional cues. Here, we investigate the mechanism of front-rear coordination in chemotactic neutrophils. We find that changes in the protrusion rate at the cell front are instantaneously coupled to changes in retraction at the cell rear, while myosin II accumulation at the rear exhibits a reproducible 9-15-s lag. In turning cells, myosin II exhibits dynamic side-to-side relocalization at the cell rear in response to turning of the leading edge and facilitates efficient turning by rapidly re-orienting the rear. These manifestations of front-rear coupling can be explained by a simple quantitative model incorporating reversible actin-myosin interactions with a rearward-flowing actin network. Finally, the system can be tuned by the degree of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) phosphorylation, which appears to be set in an optimal range to balance persistence of movement and turning ability.",The Nuclear Arsenal of Cilia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014478,Developmental cell,2019 04 24,"Several recent studies have revealed that nuclei and cilia share molecular components implicated in DNA damage response, splicing, gene expression, and sub-compartmentalization of the cell.

As such, medical centers are becoming more accustomed to managing the deleterious late consequences of combat trauma related to the dysregulation of the immune system. In this review, we aim to highlight these late consequences and identify areas for future research and therapeutic strategies. Trauma leads to the dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which places the injured at risk for several late consequences, including delayed wound healing, late onset sepsis and infection, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are significant for their association with the increased morbidity and mortality of wounded personnel. The mechanisms by which these consequences develop are complex but include an imbalance of the immune system leading to robust inflammatory responses, triggered by the presence of damage-associated molecules and other immune-modifying agents following trauma. Treatment strategies to improve outcomes have been difficult to develop as the immunophenotype of injured personnel following trauma is variable, fluid and difficult to determine. As more information regarding the triggers that lead to immune dysfunction following trauma is elucidated, it may be possible to identify the immunophenotype of injured personnel and provide targeted treatments to reduce the late consequences of trauma, which are known to lead to significant morbidity and mortality.",TCF21 and AP-1 interact through epigenetic modifications to regulate coronary artery disease gene expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014396,Genome medicine,2019 06 15,"Genome-wide association studies have identified over 160 loci that are associated with coronary artery disease.

Accumulating evidence from clinical trials increasingly suggests that combined immunotherapies enhance therapeutic responses in patients with malignances, especially for GI tumors which have a complex matrix, and significant molecular and immunological differences. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest there are advantages to combined immunological regimens, which represents the next logical step in this field, although further research is necessary.

The deregulated BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase encoded by the fusion gene resulting from the translocation is considered the pathogenetic driver and can be therapeutically targeted. In both CML and Ph-positive (Ph+) ALL, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved outcomes. In the TKI era, testing for BCR-ABL1 transcript levels by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) has become the gold standard to monitor patient response, anticipate relapse, and guide therapeutic decisions. In CML, key molecular response milestones have been defined that draw the ideal trajectory towards optimal long-term outcomes. Treatment discontinuation (treatment-free remission, TFR) has proven feasible in a proportion of patients, and clinical efforts are now focused on how to increase this proportion and how to best select TFR candidates. In Ph+ ALL, results of trials with second- and third-generation TKIs are challenging the role of intensive chemotherapy and even that of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Additional weapons are offered by the recently introduced monoclonal antibodies. In patients harboring mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain, prompt therapeutic reassessment and individualization based on mutation status are important to regain response and prevent disease progression. Next-generation sequencing is likely to become a precious tool for mutation testing because of the greater sensitivity and the possibility to discriminate between compound and polyclonal mutations. In this review, we discuss the latest advances in treatment and monitoring of CML and Ph+ ALL and the issues that still need to be addressed to make the best use of the therapeutic armamentarium and molecular testing technologies currently at our disposal.",Neonatal deaths in Cambodia: findings from a community-based mortality review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014375,BMC research notes,2019 05 02,"The aim of this study was to describe potential factors contributing to neonatal mortality in Takeo, Cambodia through assessment of verbal autopsies collected following newborn deaths in the community.

Over the past decades we have gained considerable experience in how particle properties and particle-bio interactions are linked to human health. This insight is useful for improved risk management in the case of unwanted health effects but also for developing novel medical therapies. The concepts that help us better understand particles' and fibres' risks include the fate of particles in the body; exposure, dosimetry and dose-metrics and the 5 Bs: bioavailability, biopersistence, bioprocessing, biomodification and bioclearance of (nano)particles. This includes the role of the biomolecule corona, immunity and systemic responses, non-specific effects in the lungs and other body parts, particle effects and the developing body, and the link from the natural environment to human health. The importance of these different concepts for the human health risk depends not only on the properties of the particles and fibres, but is also strongly influenced by production, use and disposal scenarios."

As ischemic stroke risk differs by setting and region, the aim of this study is to estimate ischemic stroke risk (stratified by the CHA2DS2-VASc-score) for a broadly representative population with AF from southern Germany and compare them to results from previous studies.",LightCpG: a multi-view CpG sites detection on single-cell whole genome sequence data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014252,BMC genomics,2019 05 03,"DNA methylation plays an important role in multiple biological processes that are closely related to human health. The study of DNA methylation can provide an insight into the mechanism behind human health and can also have a positive effect on the assessment of human health status. However, the available sequencing technology is limited by incomplete CpG coverage. Therefore, it is crucial to discover an efficient and convenient method capable of distinguishing between the states of CpG sites. Previous studies focused on identifying methylation states of the CpG sites in single cell, which only evaluated sequence information or structural information.",Tissue specific human fibroblast differential expression based on RNAsequencing analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014251,BMC genomics,2019 06 11,"Physical forces, such as mechanical stress, are essential for tissue homeostasis and influence gene expression of cells. In particular, the fibroblast has demonstrated sensitivity to extracellular matrices with assumed adaptation upon various mechanical loads. The purpose of this study was to compare the vocal fold fibroblast genotype, known for its unique mechanically stressful tissue environment, with cellular counterparts at various other anatomic locales to identify differences in functional gene expression profiles.",Reliability of routinely collected anthropometric measurements in primary care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014250,BMC medical research methodology,2019 05 02,"Measuring body mass index (BMI) has been proposed as a method of screening for preventive primary care and population surveillance of childhood obesity.

Collectively, members of FIESC can produce diverse mycotoxins. However, because the species diversity of FIESC has been recognized only recently, the potential of species to cause mycotoxin contamination of crop plants is unclear. In this study, therefore, we used comparative genomics to investigate the distribution of and variation in genes and gene clusters responsible for the synthesis of mycotoxins and other secondary metabolites (SMs) in FIESC.","Genomic sequence analysis reveals diversity of Australian Xanthomonas species associated with bacterial leaf spot of tomato, capsicum and chilli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014247,BMC genomics,2019 05 03,"The genetic diversity in Australian populations of Xanthomonas species associated with bacterial leaf spot in tomato, capsicum and chilli were compared to worldwide bacterial populations. The aim of this study was to confirm the identities of these Australian Xanthomonas species and classify them in comparison to overseas isolates.

Most of these cases involve loss-of-function mutations in one or more trait-specific genes. However, in parasitoid insects the evolutionary loss of a metabolic trait is not associated with gene decay. Parasitoids have lost the ability to convert dietary sugars into fatty acids. Earlier research suggests that lack of lipogenesis in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis is caused by changes in gene regulation."

To address this challenge in population health management, it is critical to have a better understanding of primary care utilizers' heterogeneous health profiles. We aimed to segment a population of primary care utilizers into classes with unique disease patterns, and to report the 1 year follow up healthcare utilizations and all-cause mortality across the classes.",Aging in the Drosophila ovary: contrasting changes in the expression of the piRNA machinery and mitochondria but no global release of transposable elements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014230,BMC genomics,2019 05 04,"Evolutionary theory indicates that the dynamics of aging in the soma and reproductive tissues may be distinct. This difference arises from the fact that only the germline lineage establishes future generations. In the soma, changes in the landscape of heterochromatin have been proposed to have an important role in aging. This is because redistribution of heterochromatin during aging has been linked to the derepression of transposable elements and an overall loss of somatic gene regulation. A role for changes in the chromatin landscape in the aging of reproductive tissues is less well established. Whether or not epigenetic factors, such as heterochromatin marks, are perturbed in aging reproductive tissues is of interest because, in special cases, epigenetic variation may be heritable. Using mRNA sequencing data from late-stage egg chambers in Drosophila melanogaster, we characterized the landscape of altered gene and transposable element expression in aged reproductive tissues. This allowed us to test the hypothesis that reproductive tissues may differ from somatic tissues in their response to aging.",Detailed prediction of protein sub-nuclear localization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014229,BMC bioinformatics,2019 06 03,"Sub-nuclear structures or locations are associated with various nuclear processes. Proteins localized in these substructures are important to understand the interior nuclear mechanisms. Despite advances in high-throughput methods, experimental protein annotations remain limited. Predictions of cellular compartments have become very accurate, largely at the expense of leaving out substructures inside the nucleus making a fine-grained analysis impossible.",Tiling Nussinov's RNA folding loop nest with a space-time approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014228,BMC bioinformatics,2019 06 03,"An RNA primary structure, or sequence, is a single strand considered as a chain of nucleotides from the alphabet AUGC (adenine, uracil, guanine, cytosine). The strand can be folded onto itself, i.e., one segment of an RNA sequence might be paired with another segment of the same RNA sequence into a two-dimensional structure composed by a list of complementary base pairs, which are close together with the minimum energy. That list is called RNA's secondary structure and is predicted by an RNA folding algorithm. RNA secondary structure prediction is a computing-intensive task that lies at the core of search applications in bioinformatics.",Elevated temperatures cause loss of seed set in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) potentially through the disruption of source-sink relationships.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014227,BMC genomics,2019 05 02,"Climate change models predict more frequent incidents of heat stress worldwide. This trend will contribute to food insecurity, particularly for some of the most vulnerable regions, by limiting the productivity of crops. Despite its great importance, there is a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of variation in heat tolerance within plant species. Common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is relatively susceptible to heat stress, which is of concern given its critical role in global food security. Here, we evaluated three genotypes of P. vulgaris belonging to kidney market class under heat and control conditions. The Sacramento and NY-105 genotypes were previously reported to be heat tolerant, while Redhawk is heat susceptible.",CALCA and TRPV1 genes polymorphisms are related to a good outcome in female chronic migraine patients treated with OnabotulinumtoxinA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014225,The journal of headache and pain,2019 04 24,"Some variables have been proposed as predictors of efficacy of OnabotulinumtoxinA in chronic migraine patients, but data available are inconclusive.

Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Documented occurrences of fossil taxa are the empirical foundation for understanding large-scale biodiversity changes and evolutionary dynamics in deep time. The fossil record contains vast amounts of understudied taxa. Yet the compilation of huge volumes of data remains a labour-intensive impediment to a more complete understanding of Earth's biodiversity history. Even so, many occurrence records of species and genera in these taxa can be uncovered in the palaeontological literature. Here, we extract observations of fossils and their inferred ages from unstructured text in books and scientific articles using machine-learning approaches. We use Bryozoa, a group of marine invertebrates with a rich fossil record, as a case study. Building on recent advances in computational linguistics, we develop a pipeline to recognize taxonomic names and geologic time intervals in published literature and use supervised learning to machine-read whether the species in question occurred in a given age interval. Intermediate machine error rates appear comparable to human error rates in a simple trial, and resulting genus richness curves capture the main features of published fossil diversity studies of bryozoans. We believe our automated pipeline, that greatly reduced the time required to compile our dataset, can help others compile similar data for other taxa."
