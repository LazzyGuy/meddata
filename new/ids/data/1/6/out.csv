Nursing programs in the United States provide a median of 2.13 hours of formal content regarding LGBTQ health, which contributes to iatrogenic barriers to care. Patient experiences related to inadequate provider preparation include misguided treatment strategies, impedance of communication, and abuse. A pilot educational project was developed to provide advanced practice nursing (APRN) students meaningful clinical interactions with LGBTQ-identifying standardized patients (SPs) to better prepare them to care for LGBTQ patients with cultural humility. This project was determined to be Exempt by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan. Implemented in an advanced health assessment course with 99 APRN students, components of the project included course readings, lecture content, laboratory activities, an SP experience, and both large and small debriefing sessions. The SP experience itself was a 15-minute clinical encounter with a patient presenting with ""abdominal pain,"" with an emphasis on history-taking, communication, and cultural humility. Qualitative data analysis was performed using the constant comparison method to interpret the results from student evaluations and other written feedback. This pilot project has promise to inform future educational offerings and set the standard for LGBTQ health content and application for APRN students. Further research is needed to evaluate the quality of LGBTQ content in APRN curricula to improve the ability of APRN students to provide care to LGBTQ patients.",Use of Music Lyrics to Engage Millennial Learners in Undergraduate Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169782,Nursing education perspectives,2019 06 06,"Undergraduate research, a high-impact learning practice, peaks interest and enthusiasm for research and contributes to development of research process knowledge, skills, and competency.

During the first cycle, severe MTX toxicity was observed with increased MTX serum levels and delayed MTX clearance requiring rescue treatment with intensified leucovorin. In the following cycles, cisplatin and doxorubicin were discontinued and MTX dose was reduced. The elimination half-life slowly improved over the following cycles suggesting a reversible cause responsible for reduced MTX clearance and toxicity during the first cycle. Cisplatin is well-known for its nephrotoxic effects and can induce reversible tubular injury. Prior treatment with cisplatin may well have been responsible for decreased MTX clearance and combination treatment should be used with adequate monitoring of MTX levels.

This study aimed to improve the awareness on DIA and to prevent errors through an analysis of lawsuit judgments.Sentenced judgments involving DIA from 1998 to 2017 using the database of the Korean Supreme Court Judgment System were collected. General characteristics, results, and recognized negligence of DIA litigation cases were analyzed.Of 27 lawsuit cases included, antibiotics (nâ=â6, 22.2%), radiocontrast media (nâ=â6, 22.2%), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nâ=â5, 18.5%) were the most common drugs that had caused DIA.

Maipelo Trust, a nongovernmental organization, funded care for most migrants (70%); most citizens (85%) had personal health insurance. Seventy percent of migrants and 93% of citizens had received antiretroviral therapy (ART). At study end, 44% and 27% of migrants and citizens, respectively were retained in care at the clinic (Pâ<â.001). Among the 35% and 60% of migrants and citizens on ART respectively with viral load (VL) results in 2016, viral suppression was lower among migrants (82%) than citizens (95%) (Pâ<â.001). Citizens on ART had a median 157-unit [95% confidence interval (CI) 122-192] greater increase in CD4+ T-cell count (last minus first recorded count) than migrants after adjusting for baseline count (Pâ<â.001). Five-year survival was 92% (95% CIâ=â87.6-94.8) for migrants and 96% (95% CIâ=â95.4-97.2) for citizens.

Multivariate analysis was performed to screen statistically significant variables. A nomogram was constructed by R software to predict the 3-, 5- and 10-year survival rates. Predictive abilities were compared by C-indexes, calibration plots, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), as well as decision curve analysis (DCA).In total, 4505 osteosarcoma patients were identified. They were divided into training (70%, nâ=â3153) and validating (30%, nâ=â1352) groups. Multivariate analyses identified independent predictors. Subsequently, the nomogram system of a new model was established, which comprised 7 variables as age, sex, site, decade of diagnosis (DOD), extent of disease (EOD), tumor size and patients undergoing tri-modality therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). It provided better C-indexes than the model without therapies (0.727, 0.712 vs 0.705, 0.668) in the 2 cohort, respectively. As well, the new model had good performances in the calibration plots. Moreover, both IDI and NRI improved for 3-, 5- and 10-year follow-up of C-indexes. Finally, DCA demonstrated that the nomogram of new model was clinically meaningful.We developed a reliable nomogram for prognostic determinants and treatment outcome analysis of osteosarcoma, thus helping better choose medical examinations and optimize therapeutic regimen under the cooperation among oncologists and surgeons.",The trim-and-fill method for publication bias: practical guidelines and recommendations based on a large database of meta-analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169736,Medicine,2019 06 06,"Publication bias is a type of systematic error when synthesizing evidence that cannot represent the underlying truth. Clinical studies with favorable results are more likely published and thus exaggerate the synthesized evidence in meta-analyses. The trim-and-fill method is a popular tool to detect and adjust for publication bias. Simulation studies have been performed to assess this method, but they may not fully represent realistic settings about publication bias. Based on real-world meta-analyses, this article provides practical guidelines and recommendations for using the trim-and-fill method. We used a worked illustrative example to demonstrate the idea of the trim-and-fill method, and we reviewed three estimators (R0, L0, and Q0) for imputing missing studies. A resampling method was proposed to calculate P values for all 3 estimators. We also summarized available meta-analysis software programs for implementing the trim-and-fill method. Moreover, we applied the method to 29,932 meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and empirically evaluated its overall performance. We carefully explored potential issues occurred in our analysis. The estimators L0 and Q0 detected at least one missing study in more meta-analyses than R0, while Q0 often imputed more missing studies than L0. After adding imputed missing studies, the significance of heterogeneity and overall effect sizes changed in many meta-analyses. All estimators generally converged fast. However, L0 and Q0 failed to converge in a few meta-analyses that contained studies with identical effect sizes. Also, P values produced by different estimators could yield different conclusions of publication bias significance. Outliers and the pre-specified direction of missing studies could have influential impact on the trim-and-fill results. Meta-analysts are recommended to perform the trim-and-fill method with great caution when using meta-analysis software programs. Some default settings (e.g., the choice of estimators and the direction of missing studies) in the programs may not be optimal for a certain meta-analysis; they should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Sensitivity analyses are encouraged to examine effects of different estimators and outlying studies. Also, the trim-and-fill estimator should be routinely reported in meta-analyses, because the results depend highly on it.",Combining procalcitonin with the qSOFA and sepsis mortality prediction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169735,Medicine,2019 06 06,"To investigate whether procalcitonin (PCT) can improve the performance of quick sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score in predicting sepsis mortality, we conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study with independent validation in a prospectively collected cohort in 3 tertiary medical centers. Patients with presumed sepsis were included. Serum PCT levels were measured at admission. Quick SOFA score and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria were calculated for each patient. PCT levels were assigned into 0, 1, and 2 points for a serum level of <0.25, 0.25 to 2, and >2âng/mL, and added to the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score. The incremental value of PCT to qSOFA was then evaluated by logistic regression, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and reclassification analysis.In all, 1318 patients with presumed severe infection were enrolled with a 30-day mortality of 13.5%. Serum level of PCT showed a high correlation with qSOFA score and 30-day inhospital mortality. The area under the ROC curve was 0.56 for SIRS criteria, 0.67 for qSOFA score, and 0.73 for qSOFA_PCT in predicting 30-day mortality. The risk prediction improvement was reflected by a net reclassification improvement of 35% (17%-52%). Incorporation of PCT into the qSOFA model could raise the sensitivity to 86.5% (95% confidence interval 80.6%-91.2%). In the validation cohort, qSOFA_PCT greatly improved the sensitivity to 90.9%.A simple modification of qSOFA score by adding the ordinal scale of PCT value to qSOFA could greatly improve the suboptimal sensitivity problem of qSOFA and may serve as a quick screening tool for early identification of sepsis.",The clinical outcomes for chordomas in the cranial base and spine: A single center experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169734,Medicine,2019 06 06,"Owing to the special growth pattern of chordomas and the limited treatment options currently available, the treatment of chordoma still remains difficult.

This study aimed to investigate the correlation between the NRAMP1 3'UTR polymorphism and the risk of PTB.This meta-analysis included 29 case-control studies to better and comprehensively assess this correlation. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of the association.These 29 case-control studies included 4672 cases and 6177 controls. The NRAMP1 3'UTR polymorphism displayed a significant positive correlation with the risk of PTB in 3 models (for del/del vs ins/ins: ORâ=â1.22, 95% CIâ=â1.01-1.47; for Ins/del vs ins/ins: ORâ=â1.19, 95% CI 1.08-1.30; for Ins/del + del/del vs ins/ins: ORâ=â1.25, 95% CIâ=â1.08-1.45). A stratified analysis by ethnicity revealed that the NRAMP1 3'UTR polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of PTB in the Asian population, but not in Caucasian, African, and South American populations.The present results indicate that the NRAMP1 3'UTR polymorphism may be considered a risk factor for PTB in the Asian population.",Association between gene variants and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation: An updated meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169720,Medicine,2019 06 06,Studies showed the controversial results about the effect of common genetic polymorphisms on the atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence.

The purpose of this study was to examine how coping styles (positive and negative) mediated the association between perceived stress and psychological distress among Chinese physicians.A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Liaoning Province, China, between October and December 2017. Self-administered questionnaires, including the General Health Questionnaire to assess psychological distress, the Stress Reaction Questionnaire to assess perceived stress, and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire to assess coping style, as well as surveys of demographic and occupational characteristics, were distributed to 1120 physicians employed in large general hospitals. The final sample consisted of 1051 participants. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were used to examine how coping style mediated the association between perceived stress and psychological distress.Perceived stress was significantly and positively associated with psychological distress among physicians. Both positive and negative coping significantly mediated the association between perceived stress and psychological distress. For psychological distress and its 3 dimensions (depression, anxiety, and reduced self-affirmation), the proportions of mediating roles of coping styles were 26.1%, 29.9%, 24.8%, and 22.7%, respectively.Perceived stress had positive effects on psychological distress, and coping style was a mediator in this relationship among Chinese physicians. In addition to reducing stress in clinical practice, appropriate coping styles should be adopted in psychological distress prevention and treatment strategies.",Relationship between CXC chemokine receptor 4 expression and prognostic significance in acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169718,Medicine,2019 06 06,"CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells correlated with stromal cell derived factor-1Î± (SDF-1Î±) and retained hematopoietic progenitors and leukemia cells within the bone marrow microenvironment. Here, we examined CXCR4 expression in 134 de novo AML and 21 controls by flow cytometry, evaluated the relationship between CXCR4 expression and clinical characteristics, and elucidated the prognostic significance of CXCR4 expression in AML prospectively. We found that the CXCR4 expression was significantly higher in AML patients than controls (Pâ=â.000). One hundred thirty four cases of de novo AML patients were divided into 2 groups according to the median of CXCR4 relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). CXCR4 high group (RFI >4.23) had markedly shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than CXCR4 low group (RFI â¤4.23) in 106 AML patients who received chemotherapy (Pâ=â.002; .026, respectively). Furthermore, in the 87 non-M3 patients who received induction therapy, there was a significant decrease for OS but not for DFS in the CXCR4 high group (Pâ=â.047 and .178, respectively). Moreover, high levels of CXCR4 expression independently increased the risk of relapse in both all AML and non-M3 patients who achieved complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy (odds ratioâ=â1.090, Pâ=â.010; odds ratioâ=â1.068, Pâ=â.048, respectively). Collectively, our data suggest that CXCR4 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for disease relapse and poorer OS in both all AML and non-M3 patients. CXCR4 expression levels can be determined at disease presentation by the flow rapidly and easily. As such, CXCR4 could be used as a potential therapeutic target in AML patients with poor prognosis.",Epidemiologic characteristics and risk factors in patients with ketamine-associated lower urinary tract symptoms accompanied by urinary tract infection: A cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169717,Medicine,2019 06 06,"Young adults with longstanding ketamine abuse present with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), which may be accompanied by urinary tract infection (UTI).

To ascertain these, we surveyed patients with a history of ketamine abuse and LUTS at the time of their initial presentation.One hundred untreated patients with ketamine-associated LUTS were initially surveyed at 3 medical institutions. The patients' basic demographic and clinical information, KALAUTI status, and possible risk factors were obtained via a questionnaire and analyzed.Eighty-one patients were finally enrolled. Eight patients (9.88%) had a definitive diagnosis of KALAUTI and 16 (19.75%) had suspected KALAUTI. The diagnosis of KALAUTI was ruled out in the remaining 57 patients (70.37%). Patients with upper urinary tract involvement, longer duration of drug use, or more severe LUTS (Pâ<â.05), were more prone to KALAUTI. Frequent urine culture and a higher voiding symptom score (VSS) were risk factors for KALAUTI (Pâ<â.05), increasing the risk of KALAUTI by 44.241- and 1.923-fold, respectively.The study indicates that frequent urine culture and severe VSS are risk factors for KALAUTI.

The main causes of infant (1-12 months) death were infectious diseases, including pneumonia, meningitis, and viral brainstem encephalitis.This study was the 1st retrospective analysis of autopsies of fetal, neonatal, and infant death in TFMC and central China. We delineate the common causes of early demise among cases referred for autopsy, and report a male preponderance in this population. Our data observed that placental and/or umbilical cord pathology, asphyxia due to AFA, and/or MAS, and pneumonia were the leading causes of fetal, neonatal, and infant death, respectively. And it can inform clinical practitioners about the underlying causes of some of the most distressing cases in their practices.",Feasibility of high-resolution manometry for decision of feeding methods in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169677,Medicine,2019 06 13,"As amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progresses, dysphagia gets worse due to the weakening of pharyngeal musculature. As oral feeding becomes more difficult or dangerous due to worsening dysphagia, tracheal aspiration, or undernutrition, the necessity for tube feeding becomes increasingly important. This study aims to establish a standard pressure point by applying pharyngeal pressure using high-resolution manometry (HRM) to start tube feeding in patients with ALS.This study was designed as a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Forty-one patients with ALS and 20 healthy subjects were participated. Both groups were evaluated using HRM, videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), and pulmonary function test. The swallowing pressure along the velopharynx (VP), tongue base (TB), pre-upper esophageal sphincter (UES), lower pharynx, and cricopharyngeus, as well as minimal UES pressure were measured using HRM.There was significantly positive correlation between the pressure of cricopharyngeus and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). And there were significant correlations between results of VFSS and FEV1, FEV1%, forced vital capacity (FVC), and FVC%. There was a significant difference in the pressure of TB and cricopharyngeus between the control group and the ALS patient group. The pressures of VP, TB, lower pharynx, and cricopharyngeus have a significant correlation with the recommended feeding type by VFSS.Because it is possible to use HRM to quantitatively assess pharyngeal and respiratory weaknesses and it is more sensitive than other evaluation tools, the cutoff value of HRM parameters may be used to decide the feeding type in patients with ALS.",Predictive role of subcomponents of the left arcuate fasciculus in prognosis of aphasia after stroke: A retrospective observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169676,Medicine,2019 06 13,"The relationship between the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and stroke-related aphasia is unclear. In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate the role of subcomponents of the left AF in predicting prognosis of aphasia after stroke. Twenty stroke patients with aphasia were recruited and received language assessment as well as diffusion tensor tractography scanning at admission. According to injury of the left AF, the participants were classified into four groups: group A (4 cases), the AF preserved intactly; group B (6 cases), the anterior segment injured; group C (4 cases), the posterior segment injured; and group D (6 cases), completely injured. After a consecutive speech therapy, language assessment was performed again. Changes of language functions among the groups were compared and the relation between these changes with segments injury of the AF was analyzed. After therapy, relatively high increase score percentage changes in terms of all the subcategories of language assessment were observed both in group A and C; by contrast, only naming in group B, and spontaneous speech in group D. Although no statistical difference was demonstrated among the four groups. In addition, there was no significant correlation between improvement of language function with segments injury of the AF. The predictive role of subcomponents of the left AF in prognosis of aphasia is obscure in our study. Nevertheless, it indicates the importance of integrity of the left AF for recovery of aphasia, namely that preservation of the left AF on diffusion tensor tractography could mean recovery potential of aphasia after stroke.","Effects of wine on blood pressure, glucose parameters, and lipid profile in type 2 diabetes mellitus: A meta-analysis of randomized interventional trials (PRISMA Compliant).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169675,Medicine,2019 06 13,Previous studies identified conflicting results about the effects of wine intake on glucose parameters and the risk of cardiovascular diseases in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

The clinical manifestations and inflammatory reaction indicators were analyzed by univariate logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to screen out the independent risk factors of CA. The Î² coefficients of independent risk factors entering the multivariate model were assigned by rounding, and the total score was the sum of values of all factors. Finally, verification and analysis were performed for the predictive model, and the operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve was drawn. Then, the area under the curve (AUC) was compared with the THRIVE scale, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow method was used to evaluate whether the model fitted well.The multivariate logistic regression analysis of independent risk factors was performed, and the values were rounded to the variable assignment based on the Î² coefficient values. The plotted ROC and AUC was calculated as 0.857 (Pâ<â.001). Using the Hosmer-Lemeshow method, the X-value was 12.430, suggesting that the prediction model fitted well.The scoring system can quickly determine whether this is a CA, allowing for an earlier and correct diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, the scoring system was convenient, economical, and affordable.

We conducted a qualitative exploratory study with nurses to explore their professional practices in the context of ART adherence. Sixteen nurses participated in data collection: nine in a focus group and seven in individual interviews. We identified four themes: building a therapeutic relationship with PLWH as a foundation of HIV nursing care; nursing activities to support PLWH with ART adherence; challenges faced by nurses providing ART-related care; and resource mobilization supporting nursing practice development in ART management and HIV care. Aspects of HIV nursing practice need to be strengthened to enhance best practice care, such as managing powerlessness in the context of ART nonadherence.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

An accurate diagnosis of this condition is essential for guiding the clinical management, as these patients may need a tailored management. The current recommendations for diagnosing periprocedural myocardial infarction based on the fourth universal definition appear at first sight straightforward, but the clinical and prognostic significance of routine periprocedural cardiac troponin (cTn) assessment remains uncertain. The current scientific evidence suggests that the likelihood of observing increased periprocedural values of cTn is high, comprising between 30 and 90%. Moreover, cTn values after PCI do not straightforwardly predict major adverse cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality. Although it seems still premature to classify many cases as 'false positive' periprocedural MIs, it is now clear that an isolate 'biochemical diagnosis' of myocardial injury during or immediately after PCI does not translate into early unfavourable clinical consequences. At this point in time, it seems reasonable to suggest that serial cTn assessment should not be routinely performed, but should be reserved for a high-risk subset of PCI patients who have also developed new ECG changes or symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia.",Are Routine Postoperative CT Scans Warranted for All Patients After Operative Fixation of Pelvic Ring Injuries?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169632,Journal of orthopaedic trauma,2019 06 06,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of routine postoperative computed topography (CT) scan after percutaneous fixation of unstable pelvic ring injuries.,How Well Represented Are Women Orthopaedic Surgeons and Residents on Major Orthopaedic Editorial Boards and Publications?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169631,Clinical orthopaedics and related research,2019 06 06,"Recent studies indicate that women are substantially underrepresented as orthopaedic surgeons and residents compared with other specialties in medicine and medical school.

Significant progress has been made in establishing defined expectations for the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors required for successful transition to residency training, but individualization of educational processes to assist learners in reaching these competencies has been predominantly conceptual to date. The traditional time-based structure of medical education has posed a challenge to individualization within the curriculum and has led to more attention on innovations that facilitate transition from medical school to residency.

In cutaneous lesions, the diagnosis is usually based on the recognition of diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells and its variants. In nodal Hodgkin lymphoma, so-called mummified cells (cells with condensed cytoplasm and pyknotic eosinophilic or basophilic nuclei) are often seen. They are sometimes conspicuous and easy to recognize, thus serving as a clue to the diagnosis. Our objective was to study cases of cutaneous Hodgkin lymphoma to identify the occurrence of mummified cells. We studied 12 patients (4 women and 8 men; age range 23-80 years). In 6 patients, cutaneous and extracutaneous disease was identified almost simultaneously; in 4 patients, lymph node disease preceded cutaneous involvement; and in the remaining 2 patients, the skin lesions were the presenting sign, whereas lymph node involvement occurred later. Histopathological, immunohistochemical, and molecular-genetic studies, including rearrangements for TCR, IgH genes, and PCR for EBV, were performed. Cutaneous biopsy specimens revealed either a multinodular or diffuse infiltrate, included small lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells, and macrophages, but in all cases, diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells and its variants were identified. Mummified cells were detected in 9 cases, either as occasional scattered mummified cells often requiring a search (6 cases) or being conspicuous, grouped and therefore easily identified (3 cases). Immunohistochemically, in all 7 cases studied, mummified cells were positive for both CD30 and CD15.

The mechanism by which activation of the innate immune system contributes to vessel-specific autoimmunity in vasculitis is not known. Systemic administration of Candida albicans water-soluble extract (CAWS) induces vasculitis in the aortic root and coronary arteries of mice that mimics human Kawasaki disease. We found that Dectin-2 signaling in macrophages resident in the aortic root of the heart induced early CCL2 production and the initial recruitment of CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes (iMo) into the aortic root and coronary arteries. iMo differentiated into monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) in the vessel wall and were induced to release IL-1Î² in a Dectin-2-Syk-NLRP3 inflammasome dependent pathway. IL-1Î² then activated cardiac endothelial cells to express CXCL1 and CCL2 and adhesion molecules that induced neutrophil and further iMo recruitment and accumulation in the aortic root and coronary arteries. Our findings demonstrate that Dectin-2-mediated induction of CCL2 production by macrophages resident in the aortic root and coronary arteries initiates vascular inflammation in a model of Kawasaki disease, suggesting an important role for the innate immune system in initiating vasculitis.",Full-scale comparison of N2O emissions from SBR N/DN operation versus one-stage deammonification MBBR treating reject water - and optimization with pH set-point.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169520,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 06 06,"To be able to fulfill the Paris agreement regarding anthropogenic greenhouse gases, all potential emissions must be mitigated. Wastewater treatment plants should aim to eliminate emissions of the most potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O). In this study, these emissions were measured at a full-scale reject water treatment tank during two different operation modes: nitrification/denitrification (N/DN) operating as a sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and deammonification (nitritation/anammox) as a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR). The treatment process emitted significantly less nitrous oxide in deammonification mode 0.14-0.7%, compared to 10% of total nitrogen in N/DN mode. The decrease can be linked to the changed feeding strategy, the lower concentrations of nitrite, a lower load of ammonia oxidized, a shorter aeration time, the absence of non-optimized ethanol dosage or periodic lack of oxygen as well as the introduction of biofilm. Further, evaluation was done how the operational pH set point influenced the emissions in deammonification mode. Lower concentrations of nitrous oxide were measured in water phase at higher pH (7.5-7.6) than at lower pH (6.6-7.1). This is believed to be mainly because of the lower aeration ratio and increased complete denitrification at the higher pH set point.",How does greywater separation impact the operation of conventional wastewater treatment plants?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169519,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 06 06,"Source separation has thus far been addressed mainly within the context of decentralization in new development areas; centralized approaches for resource-oriented sanitation remained, however, largely disregarded. By means of inhabitant-specific load and volume flow balances, based on typical reference values for municipal wastewater in Germany, a stepwise transition towards on-site greywater recycling was investigated for a model wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Up to 17% transition (separation of greywater from 17% of the total inhabitants), greywater separation was proven to benefit plant operation by reducing energy consumption for aeration. From 17% transition onwards, however, unfavorable carbon to nitrogen ratios (C/N) were reported, as less biodegradable carbon reaches denitrification, thus shifting C/N ratios negatively. Therefore, nitrogen recovery/removal from N-rich sludge sidestreams would be required. At 35% transition, a 50% N recovery from sludge liquor was proven to be sufficient in order to ensure full denitrification; combined with greywater separation, nutrient recovery yielded 14% reduction in power demand for aeration (on the actual state). Additionally, extensive mainstream process changeovers could be avoided by separating N-rich urine alongside greywater from the main wastewater stream. Urine separation was proven to maintain denitrification stability as well as reduce power demand for aeration. The calculations show that, under consideration of specific boundary conditions, existing WWTP can be successfully integrated in transition concepts for resource-oriented sanitation.",Impact of biotic interactions on the survival of emerging pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii in aquatic media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169518,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 06 06,"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen causing infections in immunocompromised patients. Recent studies recorded its persistence in a variety of abiotic conditions, but data regarding the biotic interactions with other microorganisms are limited. The aim was to assess the interaction of clinically relevant A. baumannii with common faecal bacteria Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium. Additionally, the interaction with a bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga as a potential agent for biological control of A. baumannii was examined. Experiments were conducted in nutrient-poor spring water (SW) and nutrient-rich diluted nutrient broth (DNB) at 22 Â°C. A. baumannii coexisted with E. coli and E. faecium in both media, suggesting the absence of inter-bacterial competition in long-term survival. No difference in the survival of pandrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant or antibiotic sensitive isolates of A. baumannii was observed. Rotifers contributed to the removal of all tested bacteria, particularly in SW. Rotifers were able to remove 5.5 Â± 1.3 log CFU/mL of A. baumannii in SW and 3.5 Â± 1.7 log CFU/mL in DNB. Additionally, no intracellular growth of A. baumannii inside A. vaga was detected. In wastewater treatment plants and drinking water facilities, grazing by rotifers might be useful for the removal of emerging human pathogens such as A. baumannii from water.",Immobilization of cesium-resistant bacterial cells by radiation polymerization and their bioremoval efficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169517,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 06 06,"Biological approaches for the removal of heavy metals and radionuclides from contaminated water are reported.

However, RO is limited to a maximum operating salinity of about 75 g kg-1. Electrodialysis (ED) is a potentially attractive option as it can achieve much higher concentrations, thereby reducing the capacity and energy demand of the subsequent evaporation step. Feed-and-bleed experiments were undertaken on a laboratory-scale ED stack using a series of model solutions based on the most common inorganic salts with the aim of determining maximum achievable concentrations. The maximum salt concentration achievable via ED ranged between 104.2 and 267.6 g kg-1, with levels predominantly limited by water transport. In addition, a straightforward review of how ED incorporation can affect ZLD process economics is presented. The operational cost of an ED-based ZLD system for processing RO retentate was almost 20% lower than comparable processes employing high-efficiency RO and disc tubular RO. As the ED-based ZLD system appears economically preferable, and as maximum achievable concentrations greatly exceeded RO operating limits, it would appear to be a promising approach for bridging the gap between RO and evaporation, and may even eliminate the evaporation step altogether."

The average GHG flux and net carbon sequestration flux as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) were measured. The results showed that the GHG flux emitted from DSCW and MWP were 2,128 and 2,148 g CO2 eq./m2-yr, respectively, while the flux of net sequestered carbon was 2,909 and 3,178 g CO2 eq./m2-yr, respectively, which achieved carbon budget values of -676 and -230 g CO2 eq./m2-yr, respectively, exhibiting carbon source effects. Some amounts of N2O, with a high global warming potential of 265, emitted from both artificial wetland systems might cause high GHG flux as CO2 eq. emitted from the wetland systems.

Although enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) is used worldwide for phosphorus removal, the standard activated sludge-based EBPR process shows limitations with stability and efficiency. Recently, a new EBPR moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) process has been developed at HIAS (Hamar, Norway), enabling a phosphorus removal stability above 90% during a whole year cycle. To increase the knowledge of the HIAS (MBBR) process the aim of the current work was to characterize the MBBR microbiota and operational performance weekly for the operational year. Surprisingly, we found a major succession of the microbiota, with a five-fold increase in phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs), and major shifts in eukaryote composition, despite a stable phosphorus removal. Temperature was the only factor that significantly affected both phosphorus removal and the microbiota. There was a lower phosphor removal during the winter, coinciding with a higher microbiota alpha diversity, and a lower beta diversity. This differs from what is observed for activated sludge based EBPR. Taken together, the knowledge gained from the current microbiota study supports the efficiency and stability of MBBR-based systems, and that knowledge from activated sludge-based EBPR approaches cannot be translated to MBBR systems.",Adsorption behaviors of methylene blue on sunflower stem pith.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169503,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 06 06,"Adsorption behaviors of methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution using sunflower stem pith (SSP) as adsorbent were investigated. The effects of adsorption conditions such as adsorption time, initial concentration of MB and dosage of SSP on the detoxification of MB were examined. The equilibrium adsorption data were analyzed using three well-known isotherms: Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin. The results indicated that the Langmuir isotherm fitted well to the data as compared with another isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the Langmuir isotherm model was 277 mg/g at 338 K. Kinetic analyses were conducted using pseudo first order, pseudo second order and the Elovich model. The regression results showed that the MB adsorption was described by the pseudo second order model. Different thermodynamic parameters such as Gibb's free energy (ÎGo), standard enthalpy change (ÎHo) and standard entropy change (ÎSo) were also evaluated. The results showed that the detoxification of MB using SSP as adsorbent was feasible, non-spontaneous and exothermic under experimental conditions.",Removal of metals from water using a novel high-rate algal pond and submerged macrophyte pond treatment reactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169502,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 06 06,"A combined high-rate algal pond and submerged macrophyte pond (APMP) reactor was introduced as a novel biotechnique for efficient heavy metals (HMs) removal from wastewater.

Results showed that water temperature significantly affected algae proliferation and HMs removal. Effects of light regime and N:P only showed obvious influences on HMs removal performance at high temperature. HMs removal efficiency reached 75.8% (Cr), 63.6% (Pb), and 61.1% (Zn) at 5-day hydraulic retention time (HRT) in APMP. Positive correlation existed closely between HMs removal and algal growth with long HRT.

The hydrophilicity, permeability, antibacterial and antifouling performance and mechanism of the hybrid ultrafiltration membranes were evaluated and compared in detail, aiming at screening a superior hybrid membrane for practical application in micro-polluted source water purification. Among these newly-developed hybrid membranes, GO/CNC/PVDF exhibited an enhanced perm-selectivity with a water flux of 230 L/(m2 h bar) and humic acid rejection of 92%, the improved antibacterial activity (bacteriostasis rate of 93%) and antifouling performance (flux recovery rate (FRR) of >90%) being due to the optimized pore structure, higher surface roughness, incremental hydrophilicity and electronegativity. A lower biofouling level after three weeks' filtration of the actual micro-polluted source water further demonstrated that embedding the hydrophilic and antibacterial GO/CNC nanocomposite into the polymer matrix is an effective strategy to improve membrane anti-biofouling ability.",GPIHBP1 expression in gliomas promotes utilization of lipoprotein-derived nutrients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169500,eLife,2019 06 06,"GPIHBP1, a GPI-anchored protein of capillary endothelial cells, binds lipoprotein lipase (LPL) within the subendothelial spaces and shuttles it to the capillary lumen. The GPIHBP1-bound LPL is essential for the margination of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) along capillaries, allowing the lipolytic processing of TRLs to proceed. In peripheral tissues, the intravascular processing of TRLs by the GPIHBP1-LPL complex is crucial for generating lipid nutrients for adjacent parenchymal cells. GPIHBP1 is absent in capillaries of the brain, which uses glucose for fuel; however, GPIHBP1 is expressed in capillaries of mouse and human gliomas. Importantly, the GPIHBP1 in glioma capillaries captures locally produced LPL. We document, by NanoSIMS imaging, that TRLs marginate along glioma capillaries and that there is uptake of TRL-derived lipid nutrients by surrounding glioma cells. Thus, GPIHBP1 expression in gliomas facilitates TRL processing and provides a source of lipid nutrients for glioma cells.",Slow presynaptic mechanisms that mediate adaptation in the olfactory pathway of Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169499,eLife,2019 06 10,"The olfactory system encodes odor stimuli as combinatorial activity of populations of neurons whose response depends on stimulus history. How and on which timescales previous stimuli affect these combinatorial representations remains unclear. We use in vivo optical imaging in Drosophila to analyze sensory adaptation at the first synaptic step along the olfactory pathway. We show that calcium signals in the axon terminals of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) do not follow the same adaptive properties as the firing activity measured at the antenna. While ORNs calcium responses are sustained on long timescales, calcium signals in the postsynaptic projection neurons (PNs) adapt within tens of seconds. We propose that this slow component of the postsynaptic response is mediated by a slow presynaptic depression of vesicle release and enables the combinatorial population activity of PNs to adjust to the mean and variance of fluctuating odor stimuli.",Improving survival prediction for melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169498,eLife,2019 06 12,The survival of patients with cutaneous melanoma can be accurately predicted using just four DNA methylation marks.,An integrative genomic analysis of the Longshanks selection experiment for longer limbs in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169497,eLife,2019 06 06,"Evolutionary studies are often limited by missing data that are critical to understanding the history of selection. Selection experiments, which reproduce rapid evolution under controlled conditions, are excellent tools to study how genomes evolve under selection. Here we present a genomic dissection of the Longshanks selection experiment, in which mice were selectively bred over 20 generations for longer tibiae relative to body mass, resulting in 13% longer tibiae in two replicates. We synthesized evolutionary theory, genome sequences and molecular genetics to understand the selection response and found that it involved both polygenic adaptation and discrete loci of major effect, with the strongest loci tending to be selected in parallel between replicates. We show that selection may favor de-repression of bone growth through inactivating two limb enhancers of an inhibitor, Nkx3-2. Our integrative genomic analyses thus show that it is possible to connect individual base-pair changes to the overall selection response.",A four-DNA methylation biomarker is a superior predictor of survival of patients with cutaneous melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169496,eLife,2019 06 12,"Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is a life-threatening form of skin cancer. Prognostic biomarkers can reliably stratify patients at initial melanoma diagnosis according to risk, and may inform clinical decisions. Here, we performed a retrospective, cohort-based study analyzing genome-wide DNA methylation of 461 patients with CM from the TCGA database. Cox regression analyses were conducted to establish a four-DNA methylation signature that was significantly associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with CM, and that was validated in an independent cohort. Corresponding Kaplan-Meier analysis displayed a distinct separation in OS. The ROC analysis confirmed that the predictive signature performed well. Notably, this signature exhibited much higher predictive accuracy in comparison with known biomarkers. This signature was significantly correlated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy-related signatures, and may have potential as a guide for measures of responsiveness to ICB immunotherapy."

The 24-amino-acid C-terminal peptide of the S coat protein can undergo proteolytic cleavage without affecting particle stability or infectivity. Mutagenic studies have shown that this sequence is involved in particle assembly, virus movement, RNA encapsidation and suppression of gene silencing. However, it is unclear how these processes are related, and which part(s) of the sequence are involved in each process. Here, we have analysed the effect of mutations in the C-terminal region of the S protein on the assembly of empty virus-like particles and on the systemic movement of infectious virus.

At present, the role of surgery in the treatment of head and neck LMs is still controversial, focusing mainly on surgical efficacy and indications. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effect and influential factors of surgical treatment in children with head and neck LMs, hoping to provide a basis for rational selection of surgical indications. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 128 children with head and neck LMs and underwent surgical treatment in Beijing Children's Hospital from May 2007 to June 2016. They were classified into three morphological groups: macrocystic, microcystic, and mixed. Based on de Serres staging, they were divided into five groups: stage I to V. The local lesion control rate, complication rate, and recurrence rate were summarized and analyzed. Results: The rate of completely controlled and almost completely controlled in cases with head and neck LMs was 71.1%. The postoperative complication rate was 13.3%, and the postoperative recurrence rate was 11.9%. Statistically significant difference was found for local lesion control and postoperative recurrence rates between different morphological and clinical staging groups. Furthermore, the complication rate showed a significant difference between different morphological groups, but not between clinical staging groups. Conclusions: Surgical resection in children with macrocystic, low-stage, or neck-limited LMs demonstrated better therapeutic effect, with fewer complications. However, the effect remained poor and had more complications for microcystic, diffused and high-stage patients. High stage and incomplete resection are considered as the main factors for postoperative recurrence. Current staging system for LMs has important predictive value in the prognosis of head and neck LMs. For LMs in posterior pharyngeal space, plasma ablation has certain advantages.",Changes in cerebral oxygen saturation and cerebral blood flow velocity under mild +Gz hypergravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169473,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 06 06,"We previously reported that cerebral blood flow (CBF) was reduced by even mild +Gz hypergravity. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (C-rSO2) has been widely used to detect cerebral ischemia in clinical practice. For example, decreases in C-rSO2 reflect reduced CBF or arterial oxygen saturation. Thus, it was hypothesized that C-rSO2 would decrease in association with reduced CBF during mild hypergravity. To test this hypothesis, we measured CBF velocity by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and C-rSO2 during mild +Gz hypergravity while participants were in a sitting position. Among 17 male participants, 15 completed 21 min of exposure to +1.5 Gz generated by short-arm centrifuge. C-rSO2 and mean CBF velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCBFVMCA) during centrifugation were averaged every 5 min and compared with pre-hypergravity (+1.0 Gz). C-rSO2 did not change significantly throughout centrifugation, although MCBFVMCA gradually decreased from the beginning (-1.2% at 0-5 min), and significantly decreased at 5-10 min (-4.8%), 10-15 min (-6.7%), and 15-20 min (-7.4%). Contrary to our hypothesis, decreases in C-rSO2 were not detected, despite reductions in CBF velocity during hypergravity. Since some assumptions, such as unaltered arteriovenous volume ratio, hemoglobin concentration, extracranial blood flow, and brain activity, need to be satisfied to monitor cerebral ischemia by C-rSO2, the present results suggest that these necessary assumptions for near-infrared spectroscopy are not always applicable, and that cerebral oxygenation may not precisely reflect decreases in CBF under mild +Gz hypergravity.",NON-INVASIVE QUANTIFICATION OF MACROPHAGIC LUNG RECRUITMENT DURING EXPERIMENTAL VENTILATION-INDUCED LUNG INJURY.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169472,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 06 06,"Macrophagic lung infiltration is pivotal in the development of lung biotrauma due to ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI).

We previously reported that ASIC1 in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) contribute to pulmonary vasoreactivity and vascular remodeling during the development of chronic hypoxia (CH)-induced pulmonary hypertension. However, the roles of ASIC2 and ASIC3 in regulation of pulmonary vasoreactivity and the development of CH-induced pulmonary hypertension are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that ASIC2 and ASIC3 contribute to increased pulmonary vasoreactivity and development of CH-induced pulmonary hypertension using ASIC2 and ASIC3 knockout (-/-) mice. In contrast to this hypothesis, we found that ASIC2-/- mice exhibit enhanced CH-induced pulmonary hypertension compared to WT and ASIC3-/- mice. This response was not associated with a change in ventilatory sensitivity or systemic cardiovascular function; but was instead associated with direct changes in pulmonary vascular reactivity and pulmonary arterial morphology in ASIC2-/- mice. This increase in reactivity correlated with enhanced pulmonary arterial basal tone, elevated basal PASMC [Ca2+]

 and vasoreactivity was dependent on ASIC1-mediated Ca2+ influx, but was not contingent upon an increase in ASIC1 mRNA or protein expression in PASMC from ASIC2-/- mice. Together, the results from this study demonstrate an important role for ASIC2 to regulate pulmonary vascular reactivity and for ASIC2 to modulate the development of CH-induced pulmonary hypertension. These data further suggest that loss of ASIC2 enhances the contribution of ASIC1 to overall pulmonary vascular reactivity.",Regional pulmonary perfusion patterns in humans are not significantly altered by inspiratory hypercapnia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169470,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 06 06,"Pulmonary vascular tone is known to be sensitive to both local alveolar PO2 and PCO2. Although the effects of hypoxia are well studied, the hypercapnic response is relatively less understood. We assessed changes in regional pulmonary blood flow in humans in response to hypercapnia using previously developed MRI techniques. Dynamic measures of blood flow were made in a single slice of the right lung of seven healthy volunteers following a block-stimulus paradigm (baseline, challenge, recovery), with CO2 added to inspired gas during the challenge block to effect a 7 Torr increase in end-tidal CO2. Effects of hypercapnia on blood flow were evaluated based on changes in spatio-temporal variability (fluctuation dispersion, FD) and in regional perfusion patterns in comparison to hypoxic effects previously studied. Hypercapnia increased FD 2.5% from baseline (relative to control), which was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). Regional perfusion patterns were not significantly changed as a result of increased FiCO2 (p = 0.90). Re-analysis of previously collected data using a similar protocol but with the physiologic challenge replaced by decreased FIO2 (FIO2= 0.125) showed marked flow redistribution (p = 0.01) with the suggestion of a gravitational pattern, demonstrating hypoxia has the ability to affect regional change with a global stimulus. Taken together, these data indicate that hypercapnia of this magnitude does not lead to appreciable changes in the distribution of pulmonary perfusion, and that this may represent an interesting distinction between the hypoxic and hypercapnic regulatory response.",Culturally sensitive assessment of anxious-depressive distress in the Cambodian population: Avoiding category truncation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169469,Transcultural psychiatry,2019 06 06,"In a large national survey in Cambodia (Nâ=â2689), the present study investigated the prominence of certain culturally salient symptoms and syndromes in the general population and among those with anxious-depressive distress (as determined by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25, or HSCL). Using an abbreviated Cambodian Symptom and Syndrome Addendum (CSSA), we found that the CSSA complaints were particularly elevated among those with anxious-depressive distress. Those with anxious-depressive distress had statistically greater mean scores on all the CSSA items as well as severity of endorsement analyzed by percentage: among those with HSCL caseness, 75.3% were bothered ""quite a bit"" or ""extremely"" by ""thinking a lot"" (vs. 27.5% without caseness); 53.8% were bothered by ""standing up and feeling dizzy"" (vs. 13.8%); and 45.6% by blurry vision (vs. 16.8%). In a logistic regression analysis to predict anxious-depressive distress, 51% of the variance was accounted for by five predictors: ""weak heart,"" ""thinking a lot,"" dizziness, "" khyÃ¢l hitting up from the stomach,"" and sleep paralysis. Using ROC analysis, a cut-off score of 1.81 on the CSSA was optimal as a screener to indicate anxious-depressive distress, giving a sensitivity of 0.86. The study results suggest that to avoid category truncation (i.e., the omission of key complaints that are part of an assessed distress domain) when profiling anxious-depressive distress among Cambodia population that items other than those in standard psychopathology measures should be assessed such as ""thinking a lot,"" ""weak heart,"" ""blurry vision,"" and ""dizziness upon standing up."""

Characterization by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) demonstrated that GO and Ag+ were reduced during the formation of TiO2-rGO-Ag nanocomposites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), photoluminescence spectra(PL) and Photocurrent spectrum measurement were applied to quantitatively characterize the bonding between TiO2 and rGO, the band gap energy of catalysts as well as electron-hole pairs recombination rate. The results revealed that the introduction of rGO sheets and Ag nanoparticles reduced the band gap energy of catalysts; it also suppressed the recombination of electron-hole pairs. However, C-O-Ti bond, which played a key role in photocatalysis, was reduced to some extent by the existence of Ag. Photodegradation results showed that, when the Ag loading was 9âmol% of TiO2, the reaction rate constant of formaldehyde (HCHO) removal improved distinctly, by about 22.3 times that of TiO2.

Thus, it is critical to identify if the same parasite species infects both native and exotic hosts. However, developmental- or environmental-induced morphological variation may render species identification ambiguous. Our study reports a range expansion in the southern United States of the pentastome Raillietiella indica from the Mediterranean gecko, Hemidactylus turcicus, as well as a host expansion into the green anole, Anolis carolinensis, in the anole's native range. Species identification was based on sequence data and male spicule shape. In agreement with a study from Australia, we found that much of the morphological variation in hook measurements, the primary diagnostic traits of raillietiellid pentastomes, was due to development. Here, we explicitly link this developmental variation to instar stage by incorporating experimental infection data obtained from the literature. We also show that the various hook traits are themselves highly correlated and, thus, likely not independent. Taking instar stage and correlated hook variables into account, we directly controlled for development on a composite hook size measurement. Using a large sample size from H. turcicus, we did not find any consistent effects of potential factors (host sex, host snout-vent-length, or parasite intensity) that may result in environmental-induced variation in relative hook size (corrected for body length). However, relative male spicule size tended to be negatively correlated with parasite intensity. In contrast, both pentastome body length and relative hook size significantly varied among host species whereas relative male spicule size was not significantly different among host species. Our study independently supports the conclusions that developmental- and host-induced morphological variations need to be accounted for to accurately identify pentastome species.",Prediction of Low and Very Low Bone Mineral Density Among Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169453,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,2019 06 06,To develop and validate prediction models for low and very low bone mineral density (BMD) on the basis of clinical and treatment characteristics that identify adult survivors of childhood cancer who require screening by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.,Mesoporous gold nanoparticles for photothermal controlled anticancer drug delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169451,"Nanomedicine (London, England)",2019 06 06,"Aim: To realize the transit and release of cancer drug exactly as well as high drug loading ratio, we reported a biocompatible and temperature responsive controlled drug delivery system based on 3D mesoporous structured Au networks.

Results & conclusion: LNCs quickly penetrated leukocytes without cytotoxicity; inhibited mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine release and leukocyte migration under inflammatory stimulation, which were associated with inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway and intracellular calcium influx. Hence, we showed LNCs as a down-regulatory agent on immune cells, suggesting that either the particles themselves or their application as a drug carrier can halt non-desired inflammatory processes.","Reactor performance and economic evaluation of singular, binary, and ternary mixing of feedstocks for anaerobic digestion.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169448,Environmental technology,2019 06 14,"This study compared the performance of singular, binary, and ternary mixing of feedstocks for anaerobic digestion. Three wastes, including organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), dairy manure, and corn stover, were tested under the mesophilic condition. Results showed that the binary and ternary mixing stabilised digesters while solely processing OFMSW resulted in pH drop and over accumulation of volatile fatty acids. The highest methane yield of 302.3âL/kg-VS was achieved with 50% OFMSW, 33% corn stover, and 17% dairy manure, which was about 5 times of that obtained from digesting OFMSW alone. The binary and ternary mixing led to multiple peaks in daily methane production, which evened out methane production throughout the 50-day digestion process. Economic analysis showed that solid digestate price, direct fixed capital cost, and labour cost significantly affected net present value (NPV). Ternary mixtures had the highest NPV and internal rate of return and were financially attractive under analysis conditions.",Rapid fingerprinting technology of heavy oil spill by Mid-infrared spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169447,Environmental technology,2019 06 06,"With the increase of unconventional oil production and transportation, the detection methods of light crude oil have been challenged. Mid-Infrared spectroscopy can reflect the functional group of the oil related samples, which has strong absorption signals with distinguishable peaks featured as a fast, economy, and robust technique. Nevertheless, the previous study and application of oil relevant samples, such as petroleum chemical industry online monitoring, are mainly based on Near-infrared spectroscopy. Recently, the rapid development of the spectral instrument manufacturing and the data analysis methods provides a more comprehensive technical support for the rapid and accurate identification of marine oil spill by Mid-infrared spectroscopy. In this paper, ten crude oil samples were selected for infrared spectroscopy detection, and the results were analyzed and compared with those of gas chromatography flame ionization detection method. The character information of the IR spectra and GC/FID chromatograms were extracted and classified both by principal component analysis and partial least squares regression. Under the condition of small sample size, the recognition accuracy was up to 100%. The results show that the mid-infrared method combined with chemometrics can be expected to achieve rapid, accurate and economical identification of heavy oil species.",The role of ammonium transporter (AMT) against salt stress in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169446,Plant signaling & behavior,2019 06 06,"Since NH4+ is one of the most important limiting nitrogen sources for plant growth, ammonium uptake and transport system has particular attention. In plant cells, ammonium transporters (AMTs) are responsible for ammonium uptake and transport. In previous studies, we identified a PutAMT1;1 gene from Puccinellia tenuiflora, which is a monocotyledonous halophyte species that thrives in alkaline soil. The overexpression of PutAMT1;1 in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced plant growth and increased plant susceptibility to toxic methylammonium (MeA). This transporter might be useful for improving the root to shoot mobilization of MeA (or NH4+). Interestingly, in our other studies, it can be assumed that urease acts on urea to produce NH4+, which may exacerbate salt stress. Overexpression of PutAMT1;1 promoted early root growth after seed germination in transgenic Arabidopsis under salt stress condition. These findings suggest that ammonium transport alleviates ammonia toxicity caused by salt stress. Subcellular localization revealed that PutAMT1;1 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane and the nuclear periphery and endomembrane system of yeast and plant cells. Here, we discuss these recent findings and speculate on the regular dynamic localization of PutAMT1;1 throughout the cell cycle, which may be related to intracellular activity.","aFARP-ChIP-seq, a convenient and reliable method for genome profiling in as few as 100 cells with a capability for multiplexing ChIP-seq.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169445,Epigenetics,2019 06 06,"Much effort has been devoted to understand how chromatin modification regulates development and disease.

We aimed to determine the clinical features and natural course of node positive melanoma, such as first relapse and final outcome and other factors influencing them. Methods: A total of 362 node positive melanoma patients included in the study and reviewed retrospectively. Results: Cases were as follows: N1 (56.6%); N2 (27.1%); and N3 (16.3%). Lymphovascular invasion was found significant among node positive subtypes; it was predominant in patients with two or more node involvement (pâ<â0.05). The majority of the relapses were locoregional alone (43.4%), and distant alone (31.3%). The lung/pleura was the most frequently metastasized site (32.1%). Time to relapse was the longest for N1 (20.8 months) (pâ<â0.05). Five- and 10-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 40% and 38%, respectively. Nodular histopathology, ulcerated lesion and higher mitotic rates carried worse RFS for all patients and also for N1. 5-and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 49% and 40%, respectively. Older age, nodular histopathology, higher mitotic rates, and relapse of disease (pâ=â0.001) were the independent variables that were inversely correlated with OS for all patients.

Design: A group of four, including one senior cardiothoracic surgeon and one senior anesthesiologist, scrutinized deaths within 30 days after cardiac surgery at the Clinic of Cardiothoracic Surgery, St Olav's University Hospital, Norway between February 2012-October 2015 in line with the POCMA-methodology. We used the clinic's internal register to identify patients and utilized all available written information from each patient course. We decided whether each death was surgeon dependent, FTR or a result of a multifactorial etiology, and evaluated the strength of our decisions. Results: We identified 51 deaths out of 1983 operations in our study period, giving unadjusted mortality of 2.6%. Nine deaths were classified as surgeon dependent, 3 FTR and 39 multifactorial. Conclusions: POCMA- and FTR-analyses can be carried out in clinical data which is well documented.

Official statistics show that the number of fatally injured road users has declined substantially from 341 deaths in 2000 to 117 in 2015. In-depth crash investigations of all fatal RTCs started in Norway in 2005. The aim of this study was to investigate whether fatal crash characteristics, vehicle safety features, and prevalence of drugs and/or alcohol among fatally injured drivers and riders has changed during 2005-2015, accompanying the reduction in road fatalities. Methods: Data on all car/van drivers and motorcycle/moped riders fatally injured in RTCs during 2005-2015 were extracted from Norwegian road traffic crash registries and combined with forensic toxicology data. Results: The proportion of cars and motorcycles with antilock braking systems and cars with electronic stability control, increased significantly during the study period. The prevalence of nonuse of seat belts/helmets and speeding declined among both fatally injured drivers and riders. In addition, the prevalence of alcohol declined, though no significant change in the total prevalence of other substances was noted. Conclusion: The observed changes toward more safety installations in cars and motorcycles and lower prevalence of driver-related risk factors like alcohol use, speeding, and nonuse of seat belts/helmets among fatally injured drivers/riders may have contributed to the decrease in road traffic deaths.",Prospect of performance-contingent reward distorts the action relevance of predictive context information.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169404,"Journal of experimental psychology. Learning, memory, and cognition",2019 06 06,"There is much evidence showing that the prospect of performance-contingent reward increases the usage of cuing information and cognitive stability. In a recent study, we showed that participants under reward conditions even continued using cues even when they were no longer predictive of the required response rule, even at the expense of higher errors feedback. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism underlying this maladaptive perseveration. One possible mechanism was that participants under reward conditions use cue-related stimulus frequencies even when they are not indicative of response rule frequencies. In a series of 3 experiments, using modified versions of the classical AX-continuous performance task, this hypothesis was confirmed. Taken together, the findings have important implications, as they show that the prospect of performance-contingent reward encourages the selective usage of any information that might be relevant for preparatory behavior. And this reward-induced cue usage persists until the cuing information loses any predictive information.

Further, we extend this framework to a second educationally relevant ability: second-language vocabulary learning. A large sample of young adults received a battery of working memory, fluid intelligence, language comprehension, and memory updating tasks. The results indicate that individual differences in reading comprehension and vocabulary learning benefit from the ability to maintain active information, as well as to disengage from no longer relevant information.

Learning, memory, and cognition",2019 06 06,"Stimuli encoded shortly before an aversive event are typically well remembered. Traditionally, this emotional memory enhancement has been attributed to beneficial effects of physiological arousal on memory formation. Here, we proposed an additional mechanism and tested whether memory formation is driven by the unpredictable nature of aversive events (i.e., aversive prediction errors). In a combined Pavlovian fear conditioning and incidental memory paradigm, participants saw initially neutral pictures from 2 distinct categories, 1 of which was associated with a risk to receive an electric shock. During encoding, we measured both physiological arousal and explicit prediction errors to explain memory differences in a surprise recognition test that followed approximately 24 hr later. In a first experiment, we show that physiological arousal, expressed as outcome-related skin conductance responses, was associated with improved recognition memory, corroborating arousal-based models. Critically, unsigned binary prediction errors derived from explicit shock expectancy ratings in each trial were also linked to enhanced recognition and model fits showed that the impact of prediction errors on memory was dissociable from the impact of arousal. In a second experiment, we replicated and extended the findings of the first experiment by demonstrating that the memory-promoting effect of prediction errors remained even after controlling for arousal. The present data point to prediction error-related learning as a cognitive mechanism that contributes to the emotional enhancement of memory, above and beyond the well-established effects of arousal in emotional memory formation.

In this context, the way we represent contingencies can determine our ability to adapt to the environment. However, it is not clear how agents encode and organize available knowledge about the future to react to possible states of the world. In the present study, we investigated the process of contingency representation with three eye-tracking experiments. In Experiment 1, we introduced a novel relational-inference task in which participants had to learn and represent conditional rules regulating the occurrence of interdependent future events. A cluster analysis on early gaze data revealed the existence of 2 distinct types of encoders. A group of (sophisticated) participants built exhaustive contingency models that explicitly linked states with each of their potential consequences. Another group of (unsophisticated) participants simply learned binary conditional rules without exploring the underlying relational complexity. Analyses of individual cognitive measures revealed that cognitive reflection is associated with the emergence of either sophisticated or unsophisticated representation behavior. In Experiment 2, we observed that unsophisticated participants switched toward the sophisticated strategy after having received information about its existence, suggesting that representation behavior was modulated by strategy generation mechanisms. In Experiment 3, we showed that the heterogeneity in representation strategy emerges also in conditional reasoning with verbal sequences, indicating the existence of a general disposition in building either sophisticated or unsophisticated models of contingencies.

What drives children's looking toward the mouth versus eyes of a talking face? This study reports data from 292 children who viewed faces speaking English, French, and Russian. We investigated the impact of children's age (5 months to 5 years) and language background (monolingual English, monolingual French, bilingual English-French), and the speaker's language (dominant, nondominant, or nonnative) relative to children's native language(s). Data from 129 bilingual adults were also collected for comparison. Five-month-olds showed balanced attention to the eyes and mouth, but children up to 5 years tended to be most interested in the mouth. In contrast, adults were most interested in the eyes. We found little evidence for different patterns of attention for monolinguals versus bilinguals, or to a native versus a nonnative speaker. Using percentile scores, monolinguals with larger productive vocabularies looked more at the mouth, while bilinguals with larger comprehension vocabularies looked marginally less at the mouth, although both effects were small and not as robust with raw vocabulary scores. Children showed large but stable individual variability in their face scanning patterns across different speakers. Our results show that the way that children allocate their attention to talking faces continues to change from infancy through the preschool years and beyond. Future studies will need to go beyond looking at bilingualism, speaker language, and vocabulary size to understand what drives children's in-the-moment attention to talking faces.

To date, longitudinal studies have focused on repeated measures of youths' outcomes and the temporal dynamics of marital conflict have largely been ignored. Marital conflict changes over time as contextual and relationship characteristics change, and these patterns of change may provide unique predictive power in accounting for differences in youth outcomes. This study provides a novel exploration of an old idea by focusing on dynamic patterns of marital conflict in predicting trajectories of adolescents' adjustment. All variables were measured at ages 16, 17, and 18 with 252 adolescents (53% female) enrolled in the longitudinal Family Stress and Youth Development Study. Latent growth curve models with latent variable interactions were used to determine whether marital conflict at age 16 (intercept), change over time in marital conflict (slope), and the intercept-slope interaction predicted change over time in adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms and levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 18. Youth exposed to high and increasing levels of marital conflict reported high and stable levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms across adolescence. Adolescents exposed to low and decreasing levels of marital conflict had consistently fewer symptoms. Furthermore, exposure to initially low but increasing levels of marital conflict was associated with increases in problems across adolescence, which contrasted with findings for youth with initially high marital conflict exposure that decreased over time. Findings are discussed in relation to both conceptual and methodological advances. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

However, the dynamics of social change cannot be fully understood without taking into account the reactions of the members of advantaged groups to collective action by low-status groups. In 10 experiments conducted in 4 different intergroup contexts (N = 1349), we examine advantaged groups support for normative versus non-normative collective action by disadvantaged groups. Experiments 1a to 1e show that normative collective action is perceived as more likely to improve the disadvantaged group's position and that non-normative collective action is perceived as more damaging to the advantaged group's social image. Also, these differences are due to differences in perceptions of actions violating norms of protest and perceptions of protesters as blaming the advantaged group for the inequality. Experiments 2a to 3 show that high compared with low identified members of advantaged groups distinguish more between types of collective action, showing a greater preference for the normative type. Both a mediational design and an experimental-causal-chain design (Experiments 3 and 4) show that support among high identifiers depends more on whether collective action damages the high-status group's social image than on whether it actually reduces inequality. Findings suggest that high-status groups' support for collective action is not only shaped by the perceived likelihood of change but also by its potential damage to the image of the high-status ingroup.

Outcome monitoring may be triggered by rostral parts of the MFC, which contain neurons that are modulated by reward consumption and are necessary for the expression of relative reward value. Here, we examined if the MFC further has a role in the control of instrumental licking. We used a progressive ratio licking task in which rats had to make increasing numbers of licks to receive liquid sucrose rewards. We determined what measures of progressive ratio performance are sensitive to value by testing rats with rewards containing 0%-16% sucrose. We found some measures (breakpoint, number of licking bouts) were sensitive to sucrose concentration and others (response rate, duration of licking bouts) were not. Then, we examined the effects of reversibly inactivating rostral (medial orbital) and caudal (prelimbic) parts of the MFC. We were surprised to find that inactivation had no effects on measures associated with value (e.g., breakpoint). Instead, inactivation altered behavioral measures associated with the pace of task performance (response rate and time to break). These effects depended on where inactivations were made. Response rates increased and time to break decreased when the caudal prelimbic area was inactivated. By contrast, response rates decreased and the time to break increased when the rostral medial orbital cortex was inactivated. Our findings suggest that the medial frontal cortex has a role in maintaining task engagement, but not in the motivational control of action, in the progressive ratio licking task.

The postsubiculum (PoS) is a crucial brain region for the use of visual cues, but its role in the use of self-movement cues is less clear. We therefore evaluated rats' navigational performance on a food-carrying task in light and in darkness in rats that had bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the PoS. Animals were trained postoperatively to exit a refuge and search for a food pellet, and carry it back to the refuge for consumption. In both light and darkness, control and PoS-lesioned rats made circuitous outward journeys as they searched for food. However, only control rats were able to accurately use visual or self-movement cues to make relatively direct returns to the home refuge. These results suggest the PoS's role in navigation is not limited to the use of visual cues, but also includes the use of self-movement cues.

In the present study, I compare the predictions of the perceptual (preonset and start-gun) and decisional bias hypotheses with respect to onset N1P2 amplitude, the point of subjective equality (PSE) and delta/theta activity. The onsets of the comparison intervals (CIs) were manipulated to begin earlier, later, or on-time with regard to a standard interval (SI). Results supported the start-gun account by demonstrating an increase in the N1P2 amplitude and delta power in the ""early"" and ""late"" onset conditions due to temporal mismatch. Delayed or premature initiation of timing with respect to the predicted temporal point were associated with rightward and leftward shifts in the PSEs of the ""early"" and ""late"" onset conditions, respectively. In addition to the observed increase in temporal prediction-related delta activity in the ""early"" and ""late"" onset conditions, higher theta power in the ""early"" onset suggested an additional neural response for unexpected events that might be linked to response caution. Moreover, the ramping activity during the CIs, namely the contingent negative variation (CNV), showed a decision-related attenuation toward the end of an interval in the ""late"" onset. The latter finding was supported by the changes in offset N1P2 amplitude. The present study contributes to the interval-timing literature by presenting support in favor of the hypothesis that the onset N1P2 is a neural marker for the initiation of timing.

To examine whether these processes could be probed on a moment to moment basis as they activate to motivate near term drinking, we sampled future-oriented expectancy verbal associates (i.e., self-generated words) using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) paradigm every 3 hr on 3 days of the week (2 days of likely drinking and 1 of low drinking likelihood). Expectancy associates were chosen because cognitive psychologists consider verbal items collected in this manner a part-way approach to measurement of automatic/implicit processes. Consistent with predictions, more positively valenced alcohol expectancies activated within a few hours preceding increased alcohol consumption, and this activation could be statistically distinguished from the influence of a wide array of other variables known to predict consumption, including autocorrelation. As previously observed, more positively valenced alcohol expectancies were activated in alcohol-related environments. These findings provide further evidence that anticipatory information processing is engaged for the direction of future behavior, and that probing expectancies in real-time can be useful for predicting near-term alcohol consumption.

Participants included 34 teacher-student dyads. Using the ISP-Function, teachers rated the extent to which students exhibited disruptive behavior, as well as the frequency with which disruptions were met with four consequences. Ratings were completed across three 10-min sessions, during which a research assistant also collected systematic direct observation (SDO) data regarding the same behavior and consequences. Results indicated adequate temporal reliability (â¥.70) was attained for the adult attention and peer attention targets across the three ratings; in contrast, up to 8-18 data points would be needed to achieve adequate reliability across the remaining targets. Findings further suggested that while ISP-Function ratings of disruptive behavior, adult attention, and peer attention were moderately to highly correlated with SDO data, correlations were in the low range for the access to items/activities and escape/avoidance targets. Finally, analysis of difference scores showed that on average, mean ISP-Function scores fell within only 0.33 to 1.81 points of mean SDO scores (on the 0-10 DBR scale). Agreement coefficients indicative of exact score agreement were less consistent, suggesting accuracy ranged from poor to substantial.

Thirty-eight independent data sets met criteria for inclusion. Overall, there was a moderate effect of age group on trust (g = 0.22), whereby older adults were more trusting than young adults. Three additional meta-analyses assessed age-related differences in trust in response to varying degrees of trustworthiness. This revealed that older adults were more trusting than young adults in response to neutral (g = 0.31) and negative (g = 0.33), but not positive (g = 0.15), indicators of trustworthiness. The effect of age group on trust in response to positive and neutral cues was moderated by type of trust (financial vs. nonfinancial) and type of responding (self-report vs. behavioral). Older adults were more trusting than young adults in response to positive and neutral indicators of trustworthiness when trust was expressed nonfinancially, but not financially. There was also an age-related increase in self-reported, but not behavioral, trust in response to neutral cues. Older adults were more trusting than young adults in response to negative indicators of trustworthiness regardless of the type of trust or type of responding. The reliability of information about trustworthiness did not moderate any of the effects of age group on trust. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

Using survey data collected at three points in time from 312 early career professionals, we find that psychosocial mentoring, but not career mentoring, positively relates to professional identification. For short-term goal outcomes, professional identification positively relates to extrinsic goals, intrinsic goals, and goals that are high quality (i.e., specific, difficult, to which one is committed). For long-term goal outcomes, professional identification positively relates to extrinsic and intrinsic goals, but not to goal quality. Instead, in the long-term goal model, psychosocial mentoring is directly related to goal quality.

Understanding the environmental and genetic factors that contribute to alcohol-related behaviors is a potential gateway for developing novel therapeutic approaches for patients that abuse the drug. To this end, we have used Drosophila melanogaster as a model to investigate the effect of diet, an environmental factor, on ethanol sedation. Providing flies with diets high in yeast, a routinely used component of fly media, increased their resistance to ethanol sedation. The yeast-induced resistance to ethanol sedation occurred in several different genetic backgrounds, was observed in males and females, was elicited by yeast from different sources, was readily reversible, and was associated with increased nutrient intake as well as decreased internal ethanol levels. Inhibition of serotonergic neuron function using multiple independent genetic manipulations blocked the effect of yeast supplementation on ethanol sedation, nutrient intake, and internal ethanol levels. Our results demonstrate that yeast is a critical dietary component that influences ethanol sedation in flies and that serotonergic signaling is required for the effect of dietary yeast on nutrient intake, ethanol uptake/elimination, and ethanol sedation.

In this study, we optimised a method for analysing genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of extracted ctDNA and CTCs enriched using a LFIMA as a first-phase examination of 30 patients with head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC). Seven patients with advanced CRC were enrolled in the second-phase examination to monitor the emergence of alterations occurring during treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific antibodies.

In this study we describe a rapid procedure suitable for the identification of induced recessive and dominant mutations applied to two Zea mays mutants expressing a dwarf and a pale green phenotype, respectively, which were obtained through pollen EMS mutagenesis. First, without prior backcrossing, induced mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) segregating in a (M2 ) family derived from a heterozygous (M1 ) parent were identified using whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of a small number of (M2 ) individuals with mutant and wild type phenotypes. Second, the state of zygosity of the mutation causing the phenotype was determined for each sequenced individual by phenotypic segregation analysis of the self-pollinated (M3 ) offspring. Finally, we filtered for segregating EMS-induced SNPs whose state of zygosity matched the determined state of zygosity of the mutant locus in each sequenced (M2 ) individuals. Through this procedure, combining sequencing of individuals and Mendelian inheritance, 3 and 4 SNPs in linkage disequilibrium passed our zygosity filter for the homozygous dwarf and heterozygous pale green mutation, respectively. The dwarf mutation was found to be allelic to the an1 locus and caused by an insertion in the largest exon of the AN1 gene. The pale green mutation affected the nuclear W2 gene and was caused by a nonsynonymous amino acid exchange in encoded chloroplast DNA polymerase with a predicted deleterious effect. This coincided with lower cpDNA levels in pale green plants. This article is protected by copyright.

Tumor cells can escape from immune attack by secreting suppressive cytokines which solely or cooperatively impair the immune function of DCs. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully defined. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as a major cytokine in the tumor microenvironment. To elucidate the effects of VEGF on the motility and immune function of mature DCs (mDCs), the cells were treated with 50 ng/ml VEGF and investigated by proteomics and molecular biological technologies. The results showed that VEGF can impair the migration capacity and immune function of mDCs through RhoA-cofilin1 (COF1) pathway mediated by the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), suggesting impaired motility of mDCs by VEGF is one of the aspects of immune escape mechanisms of tumors.

Hence, our purpose is to delineate the involvement of LINC00958 in regulating cell sensitivity to radiotherapy in cervical cancer. LINC00958 expression in cervical cancer was assayed, followed by verification of the relationship among LINC00958, microRNA-5095 (miR-5095) and ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2). Hela cells were transduced with up-/downregulation of miR-5095 or RRM2, or LINC00958 silencing, respectively, and then treated with or without a 6âGy dose of X-ray irradiation. Then the cell proliferation, apoptosis, survival fraction rate, as well as sensitivity to radiotherapy, were assessed. Finally, xenograft tumor in nude mice was established by transplanting Hela cells transfected with sh-LINC00958 and irradiated with 6âGy of X-ray. High expression of LINC00958 was revealed in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, as well as in radiation-resistant patients, which was associated with lower sensitivity to radiotherapy in cervical cancer. Moreover, cervical cancer patients with higher LINC00958 expression exhibited a shorter overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. In addition, LINC00958 could regulate the expression of RRM2 by competing for miR-5095. A combination of radiotherapy with LINC00958 silencing, RRM2 downregulation or miR-5095 overexpression was found to inhibit cervical cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth, while promoting cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that LINC00958 could regulate RRM2 by competing to miR-5095, which regulates cell sensitivity to radiotherapy in cervical cancer.",The dilemma to diagnose Wilson disease by genetic testing alone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169307,European journal of clinical investigation,2019 06 06,Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disorder of hepatic copper excretion.

Although its mortality is steady or declining because of earlier diagnoses, its survival rate varies because of different tumour types. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify key biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets in thyroid cancer. The expression profiles of GSE3467, GSE5364, GSE29265 and GSE53157 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included a total of 97 thyroid cancer and 48 normal samples. After screening significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each data set, we used the robust rank aggregation method to identify 358 robust DEGs, including 135 upregulated and 224 downregulated genes, in four datasets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed by DAVID and the KOBAS online database, respectively. The results showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in various cancer-related functions and pathways. Then, the STRING database was used to construct the protein-protein interaction network, and modules analysis was performed. Finally, we filtered out five hub genes, including LPAR5, NMU, FN1, NPY1R, and CXCL12, from the whole network. Expression validation and survival analysis of these hub genes based on the The Cancer Genome Atlas database suggested the robustness of the above results. In conclusion, these results provided novel and reliable biomarkers for thyroid cancer, which will be useful for further clinical applications in thyroid cancer diagnosis, prognosis and targeted therapy.",Assessment of the Opening Minds Scale for use with nursing students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169305,Perspectives in psychiatric care,2019 06 06,Evaluate the validity of the Opening Minds Scale (OMS) for nursing students via Rasch models and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).,Melatonin attenuates inflammation-related venous endothelial cells apoptosis through modulating the MST1-MIEF1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169304,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 06 06,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a prevalent and potentially debilitating condition that affects millions of individuals. An excessive endothelial inflammatory response is reportedly involved in the development of CVD. In this study, we explored the effect and mechanism of melatonin on venous endothelial damage induced by tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±). Our data demonstrated that inflammation injury triggered mitochondrial dysfunction, activated reactive oxygen species-related oxidative damage, inhibited mitochondrial potential and ultimately initiated caspase-involved cellular death. Interestingly, melatonin preserved inflammation-attacked mitochondrial performance and thus increased cell survival under TNF-Î±. Cellular experiments illustrated that inflammation injury promoted the levels of mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) and mitochondrial elongation factor 1 (MIEF1); active MST1-MIEF1 pathway disturbed mitochondria-related energy production, leading to mitochondria-induced cell damage. Interestingly, melatonin effectively suppressed MST1-MIEF1 axis and thus improved cell survival ratio under TNF-Î±-mediated inflammation injury. Reactivation of MST1-MIEF1 pathway attenuated melatonin-related endothelial protective actions. Herein, our results illuminate that melatonin is an effective approach to attenuate inflammation-related venous endothelial cell damage through handling the MST1-MIEF1 signaling pathway.",Pseudogene DUXAP10 can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in human cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169303,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 06 06,"The pseudogene DUXAP10 is overexpressed in numerous types of human cancers.

A total of 50 studies comprising 11,292 patients were collected in this integrated analysis. DUXAP10 was confirmed to be significantly overexpressed in various human cancers (pâ<â.05). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve analysis was implemented, which indicated that DUXAP10 was a potential diagnostic biomarker for human cancers (area under the curve [AUC] of SROC curveâ=â0.81 [0.77-0.84]; pooled sensitivityâ=â0.69 [0.62-0.75]; pooled specificityâ=â0.81 [0.73-0.87]). In addition, hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained to evaluate the association of DUXAP10 expression with overall survival (OS) time of cancer patients. Outcomes of meta-analysis suggested that upregulation of DUXAP10 was closely associated with poor OS (pooled HRâ=â1.11 [1.03-1.18]).

Here, we present an up-to-date review of what is known about the biology of passive electroreception and considered how this knowledge can assist in understanding the ecological consequences of responding to electric and magnetic stimuli by electroreceptive fish in the marine environment. The focus is on electroreception in marine Chondrichthyes, the current understanding of the passive mode, ecomorphology of the receptor system and its functional importance in terms of the ecology of this sensory system. The review complements the review of electroreception in freshwater fish in this special issue, which provides a comprehensive state of knowledge regarding the evolution of electroreception. The review concludes that whilst there has been much improved understanding of the biology of electroreception in the marine environment, there are several outstanding gaps in knowledge which limit our full understanding of the sensory ecology of electroreception, particularly in an environment that increasingly is being altered by anthropogenic electric and magnetic fields.

They are frequently the source of inflammatory conditions such as de Quervain's tenosynovitis or carpal tunnel syndrome. During academic dissection, a cadaver presented with bilateral, additional muscles running parallel to the abductor pollicis longus muscles (APL) in the extensor compartment of the forearm. Both additional muscles had two bellies, one proximal and one distal, with an intervening tendon. The proximal bellies were separate and distinct from the adjacent APLs. The tendons traversed the first dorsal compartments with the tendons of the APLs and the extensor pollicis brevis muscles (EPB). The distal bellies lay adjacent to the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles in the thenar compartments, and inserted onto the volar base of the proximal phalanges of the thumbs. Following a thorough search of the literature, we determined that these additional muscles constitute a previously unreported variation. This report details the variation, compares it with other reported variations, presents the related embryology, and reviews the significance of this variation as it relates to inflammatory conditions and surgical procedures.","Small molecule GSK-3 antagonists play a pivotal role in reducing the local inflammatory response, in promoting resident stem cell activation and in improving tissue repairing in regenerative dentistry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169298,Histology and histopathology,2019 06 12,"Regenerative dentistry is attracting growing interest in the scientific community, mainly because of its translational and promising therapeutic approach. The latest research carried out by the scientific community are aimed at triggering the local cellular response, in order to induce a physiological self-repairing of damaged oral tissues. Such physiological processes mainly involve the activation of local stem cell populations: mesenchymal stem cells, in fact, retain the ability to proliferate and to differentiate towards functional mature elements, thus leading towards healing of damaged tissues. Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a key-regulator of the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway; it phosphorylates Î²-catenin, that then is degraded in the cytosol. The activation of such signalling, mediated by Wnt ligand/receptor association, inhibits GSK-3, leading to translocation of Î²-catenin to the nucleus and to gene transcription. Selective inhibitors of GSK-3 have been linked to the activity of Wnt signalling and to the regeneration of injured tissues, including complex dental and oral structures. Small Molecule GSK-3 Antagonists are the most interesting class of molecules acting with a ""Bystander effect"": reducing local inflammation and local bone resorption and triggering the activity and differentiation of resident ""sleeping"" MSCs. The aim of this narrative topical review is to describe the current knowledge on the role of small molecule GSK-3 antagonists in regenerative dentistry, with strategic insights towards the translational applications in nanomaterials in dentistry and in dental repairing."

Molecular dynamics based simulations were performed in conjunction with the reactive force field to study the crack tip behaviour in single and bi-crystalline h-BN nanosheets. Atomistic simulations help in predicting a positive effect of the GB plane in the near vicinity of the crack tip. The density of 5|7 dislocation pairs significantly affects the fracture behaviour of bi-crystalline h-BN nanosheets. Additionally, the distance of the GB plane from the crack tip, and limited hydrogen functionalisation of GB atoms, further help in improving the fracture toughness of bi-crystalline h-BN nanosheets. Hydrogen functionalisation helps in inducing out of plane displacement at the GB plane, which helps in arresting or retarding the crack propagation. It can be concluded from the results that instead of deteriorating, geometrical defects such as GBs can also be used to tailor the fracture toughness of h-BN nanosheets. This study on the fracture toughness of bi-crystalline h-BN nanosheets helps in complementing the research on using porous h-BN nanosheets as nanomembranes for water desalination and ion separation.",Investigation of hairpin DNA and chelerythrine interaction by a single bio-nanopore sensing interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169284,The Analyst,2019 06 06,"Chelerythrine (CHE) is one of the potential drugs for cancer treatments. The interaction between hairpin DNA and CHE has been investigated by spectral and mass spectrometry methods. In this paper, the stability of hairpin DNA with different loop bases and its interaction with CHE were explored with a single Î±-hemolysin (Î±-HL) nanopore sensing interface. The results showed that the characteristic current pulses not only relate to the loop composition changes of the hairpin DNA, but also provide interaction information between CHE and the hairpin DNA molecules. The dwell time of current pulses for hairpin DNA was significantly increased (hundreds of ms) due to the addition of CHE, and two characteristic current distributions were recognized for the hairpin with T3 and C3 loops. The two characteristic current groups could be ascribed to the hairpin DNA and the ones with CHE. This study indicates that it is possible to study the interaction between single CHE and single hairpin DNA molecules by the single-nanopore sensing interface as an alternative method to conventional spectrometric methods for therapeutic mechanism and drug screening purposes.",Phase behavior and design rules for plastic colloidal crystals of hard polyhedra via consideration of directional entropic forces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169283,Soft matter,2019 06 06,"Plastic crystals - like liquid crystals - are mesophases that can exist between liquids and crystals and possess some of the characteristic traits of each of these states of matter. Plastic crystals exhibit translational order but orientational disorder. Here, we characterize the phase behavior in systems of hard polyhedra that self-assemble plastic face-centered cubic (pFCC) colloidal crystals. We report a first-order transition from a pFCC to a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) crystal, a smooth crossover from pFCC to an orientationally-ordered FCC crystal, and an apparent orientational glass transition wherein long-range order fails to develop from a plastic crystal upon an increase in density. Using global order parameters and local environment descriptors, we describe how particle shape influences the development of orientational order with increasing density, and we provide design rules based on the arrangement of facets for engineering plastic crystal behavior in colloidal systems.",Synthesis of dual functional gallic-acid-based carbon dots for bioimaging and antitumor therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169282,Biomaterials science,2019 06 06,"Carbon quantum dots are excellent photoluminescent materials because of their unique fluorescence properties. They are widely used in biomedical imaging due to their good biocompatibility. However, carbon quantum dots with antitumor activity have rarely been reported.

In this study, GA based carbon dots (GACDs) with fluorescence and antitumor activity were synthesized by a simple microwave-assisted method and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Studies of optical properties indicated that the GACDs exhibited significant photoluminescence. In addition, we observed the antitumor activity of the GACDs using both cell-based assays and mouse xenograft tumors. Our results demonstrated that the GACDs can be used as both a bioimaging material and an antitumor agent, suggesting their great potential in future clinical applications.",Transition-metal-free direct nucleophilic substitution of carboranyllithium and 2-halopyridines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169281,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 06 06,"A practical and efficient C(cage)-heteroarylation of carborane is presented, via direct nucleophilic substitution of carboranyllithium with 2-halopyridines.

A thin film of thermotropic liquid crystal is subjected to hybrid anchoring by an air interface and a water substrate, and viewed under polarised optical microscopy. Upon heating from smectic-A to nematic, a packing of focal conic domains melts into a dense array of boojums-nematic surface defects-which then coarsens by pair-annihilation. With the aid of Landau-de Gennes numerical modeling, we elucidate the topological and geometrical rules underlying this transformation. In the transition from nematic to smectic-A, we show that focal conic domain packings are organised over large scales in patterns that retain a geometric memory of the nematic boojum configuration, which can be recovered with remarkable fidelity.",Non-uniform curvature and anisotropic deformation control wrinkling patterns on tori.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169279,Soft matter,2019 06 06,"We investigate wrinkling patterns in a tri-layer torus consisting of an expanding thin outer layer, an intermediate soft layer and an inner core with a tunable shear modulus, inspired by pattern formation in developmental biology, such as follicle pattern formation during the development of chicken embryos. We show from large-scale finite element simulations that hexagonal wrinkling patterns form for stiff cores whereas stripe wrinkling patterns develop for soft cores. Hexagons and stripes co-exist to form hybrid patterns for cores with intermediate stiffness. The governing mechanism for the pattern transition is that the stiffness of the inner core controls the degree to which the major radius of the torus expands - this has a greater effect on deformation in the long direction as compared to the short direction of the torus. This anisotropic deformation alters stress states in the outer layer which change from biaxial (preferred hexagons) to uniaxial (preferred stripes) compression as the core stiffness is reduced. As the outer layer continues to expand, stripe and hexagon patterns will evolve into zigzags and segmented labyrinths, respectively. Stripe wrinkles are observed to initiate at the inner surface of the torus while hexagon wrinkles start from the outer surface as a result of curvature-dependent stresses in the torus. We further discuss the effects of elasticities and geometries of the torus on the wrinkling patterns.","Solvent-dependent photophysics of a red-shifted, biocompatible coumarin photocage.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169278,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 06 06,Controlling the activity of biomolecules with light-triggered photocages is an important research tool in the life sciences. We describe here a coumarin photocage that unusually combines the biocompatible optical properties of strong absorption at a long wavelength close to 500 nm and high photolysis quantum yields. The favourable properties are achieved by synthetically installing on the photocage scaffold a diethyl amino styryl moiety and a thionoester group rather than the lactone typical for coumarins. The photocage's photophysics are analysed with microsecond transient absorption spectroscopy to reveal the nature of the excited state in the photolysis pathway. The excited state is found to be strongly dependent on solvent polarity with a triplet state formed in DMSO and a charge-separated state in water that is likely due to aggregation. A long triplet lifetime is also correlated with a high photolysis quantum yield. Our study on the biocompatible photocage reveals fundamental insight for designing advanced photocages such as longer wavelengths in different solvent conditions tailored for applications in basic and applied research.,Direct Csp3-H methylenation of 2-arylacetamides using DMF/Me2NH-BH3 as the methylene source.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169277,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 06 06,"A direct Csp3-H methylenation of 2-arylacetamides using DMF/Me2NH-BH3 as the methylene source was developed.

The modeling procedure was focused on well-known components, namely gold nanoparticles, citrate, chitosan and gentamicin, and the experiments tuned on purpose. On the one hand, gold nanoparticles were synthesized, fuctionalized with chitosan, loaded with gentamicin and characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). On the other hand, an effective model of a functionalized gold nanoparticle was created and its structure and dynamics were explored by classical reactive molecular dynamics simulations in solution based on the ReaxFF atomistic description. The structure, dynamics and drug release were reproduced realistically disclosing the motion of all the molecular components, their adsorption on the metal support, desorption, intermolecular interactions and self-assembly. The system size was very close to the experimental conditions and all the calculations could efficiently identify the most probable binding modes, the locations of the adsorbed molecules, the characteristic arrangements of the chains and the effects due to the surrounding environment. The role played by the substrate and water molecules in the releasing process was described in detail. In line with the literature it was found that the antibiotic activity was preserved and the drug release from the carrier could be tuned by changing the chitosan/getamicin weight ratio and the deposition pattern of the adsorbed layers."

It is characterized by the progressive fibrosis of the submucosal tissue. The pathogenesis of OSMF has been directly related to the habit of chewing areca nut and its commercial preparation, which is widespread in Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The areca nut has been classified as a ""group one human carcinogen."" Oral squamous cell carcinoma in the background of OSMF is one of the most common malignancies in South and Southeast Asian countries. Malignant transformation has been reported in 7%-12% cases of OSMF. Histopathological spectrum of OSMF includes the apparent alterations observed in the epithelium and connective tissue. Epithelial atrophy and sometimes epithelial hyperplasia with or without dysplasia are the peculiar alterations seen in the epithelium. In the connective tissue, there is extracellular matrix remodeling which results in excessive collagenization. Further cross-linking of collagen leads to hyalinization which makes the collagen resistant to proteolysis. Owing to fibrosis in the connective tissue, there is narrowing of blood vessels which further results in compromised blood supply to the local tissue milieu, that is, hypoxia. This tissue hypoxia elicits angiogenesis which may result in the malignant transformation of OSMF. Perpetual irritation of areca nut and its constituents to the oral mucosa leads to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and further juxtaepithelial inflammation. Thus, these coordinated reactions in epithelium and connective tissue leads the OSMF toward malignant transformation.",Molecular characterization of metastasizing ameloblastoma: A comprehensive review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169204,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,2019 06 06,"Metastasizing ameloblastoma (MA) is a very rare odontogenic tumor with 2% of incidence rate.

The surgical margins (SMs) or resection margins are boundaries of resection specimen excised by the surgeon. The status of these resected SMs is an important and valuable tool to predict the treatment outcome. It is necessary to attain optimal SM to avoid local recurrence and improve overall survival. However, the controversies exist regarding the concept of optimal SM. There are various factors that influence the assessment of the SMs. In addition, apart from routine histopathology, the molecular assessment of resected margins has recently gained value which has a promising role for margin surveillance. Furthermore, the histological and molecular appraisal of tumor-free margins is also necessary to standardize the treatment modalities. Hence, this review aims to summarize the above issues that influence the evaluation of SMs of OSCC along with recent updates. Furthermore, an attempt has been made to give an overview about future possible approaches for the tumor-free margins. An electronic search was performed for items related to the evaluation of SMs in OSCC, and the obtained articles were critically assessed and the relevant information was extracted and summarized.",Sciatic nerve injury alters the spatial arrangement of neurons and glial cells in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169202,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 06,"The spatial arrangement of the cell is important and considered as underlying mechanism for mathematical modeling of cell to cell interaction. The ability of cells to take on the characteristics of other cells in an organism, it is important to understand the dynamical behavior of the cells. This method implements experimental parameters of the cell-cell interaction into the mathematical simulation of cell arrangement. The purpose of this research was to explore the three-dimensional spatial distribution of anterior horn cells in the rat spinal cord to examine differences after sciatic nerve injury. Sixteen Sprague-Dawley male rats were assigned to control and axotomy groups. Twelve weeks after surgery, the anterior horn was removed for first- and second-order stereological studies. Second-order stereological techniques were applied to estimate the pair correlation and cross-correlation functions using a dipole probe superimposed onto the spinal cord sections. The findings revealed 7% and 36% reductions in the mean volume and total number of motoneurons, respectively, and a 25% increase in the neuroglial cell number in the axotomized rats compared to the control rats. In contrast, the anterior horn volume remained unchanged. The results also indicated a broader gap in the pair correlation curve for the motoneurons and neuroglial cells in the axotomized rats compared to the control rats. This finding shows a negative correlation for the distribution of motoneurons and neuroglial cells in the axotomized rats. The cross-correlation curve shows a negative correlation between the motoneurons and neuroglial cells in the axotomized rats. These findings suggest that cellular structural and functional changes after sciatic nerve injury lead to the alterations in the spatial arrangement of motoneurons and neuroglial cells, finally affecting the normal function of the central nervous system.

However, the theme trends and knowledge structures for human neural stem cells have not yet been studied bibliometrically. In this study, we retrieved 2742 articles from the PubMed database from 2013 to 2018 using ""Neural Stem Cells"" as the retrieval word. Co-word analysis was conducted to statistically quantify the characteristics and popular themes of human neural stem cell-related studies. Bibliographic data matrices were generated with the Bibliographic Item Co-Occurrence Matrix Builder. We identified 78 high-frequency Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. A visual matrix was built with the repeated bisection method in gCLUTO software. A social network analysis network was generated with Ucinet 6.0 software and GraphPad Prism 5 software. The analyses demonstrated that in the 6-year period, hot topics were clustered into five categories. As suggested by the constructed strategic diagram, studies related to cytology and physiology were well-developed, whereas those related to neural stem cell applications, tissue engineering, metabolism and cell signaling, and neural stem cell pathology and virology remained immature. Neural stem cell therapy for stroke and Parkinson's disease, the genetics of microRNAs and brain neoplasms, as well as neuroprotective agents, Zika virus, Notch receptor, neural crest and embryonic stem cells were identified as emerging hot spots. These undeveloped themes and popular topics are potential points of focus for new studies on human neural stem cells.",Ginsenoside Rb1 protects dopaminergic neurons from inflammatory injury induced by intranigral lipopolysaccharide injection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169200,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 06,"Accumulating studies suggest that neuroinflammation characterized by microglial overactivation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. As such, inhibition of microglial overactivation might be a promising treatment strategy to delay the onset or slow the progression of Parkinson's disease. Ginsenoside Rb1, the most active ingredient of ginseng, reportedly exerts neuroprotective effects by suppressing inflammation in vitro. The present study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of ginsenoside Rb1 in a lipopolysaccharide-induced rat Parkinson's disease model. Rats were divided into four groups. In the control group, sham-operated rats were intraperitoneally administered normal saline for 14 consecutive days. In the ginsenoside Rb1 group, ginsenoside Rb1 (20 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected for 14 consecutive days after sham surgery. In the lipopolysaccharide group, a single dose of lipopolysaccharide was unilaterally microinjected into the rat substantial nigra to establish the Parkinson's disease model. Lipopolysaccharide-injected rats were treated with normal saline for 14 consecutive days. In the ginsenoside Rb1 + lipopolysaccharide group, lipopolysaccharide was unilaterally microinjected into the rat substantial nigra. Subsequently, ginsenoside Rb1 was intraperitoneally injected for 14 consecutive days. To investigate the therapeutic effects of ginsenoside Rb1, behavioral tests were performed on day 15 after lipopolysaccharide injection. We found that ginsenoside Rb1 treatment remarkably reduced apomorphine-induced rotations in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats compared with the lipopolysaccharide group. To investigate the neurotoxicity of lipopolysaccharide and potential protective effect of ginsenoside Rb1, contents of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Compared with the lipopolysaccharide group, ginsenoside Rb1 obviously attenuated the lipopolysaccharide-induced depletion of dopamine and its metabolites in the striatum. To further explore the neuroprotective effect of ginsenoside Rb1 against lipopolysaccharide-induced neurotoxicity, immunohistochemistry and western blot assay of tyrosine hydroxylase were performed to evaluate dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantial nigra par compacta. The results showed that lipopolysaccharide injection caused a large loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra and a significant decrease in overall tyrosine hydroxylase expression. However, ginsenoside Rb1 noticeably reversed these changes. To investigate whether the neuroprotective effect of ginsenoside Rb1 was associated with inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial activation, we examined expression of the microglia marker Iba-1. Our results confirmed that lipopolysaccharide injection induced a significant increase in Iba-1 expression in the substantia nigra; however, ginsenoside Rb1 effectively suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced microglial overactivation. To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of ginsenoside Rb1, we examined expression levels of inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-1Î², inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase 2) and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B signaling-related proteins (IÎºB, IKK) in the substantia nigra with enzyme-linked immunosorbent and western blot assays. Our results revealed that compared with the control group, phosphorylation and expression of inflammatory mediators IÎºB and IKK in the substantia nigra of lipopolysaccharide group rats were significantly increased; whereas, ginsenoside Rb1 obviously reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced changes on the lesioned side of the substantial nigra par compacta. These findings confirm that ginsenoside Rb1 can inhibit inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide injection into the substantia nigra and protect dopaminergic neurons, which may be related to its inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway.

Although connections between changes in brain networks of Alzheimer's disease patients have been established, the mechanisms that drive these alterations remain incompletely understood. This study, which was conducted in 2018 at Northeastern University in China, included data from 97 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset covering genetics, imaging, and clinical data. All participants were divided into two groups: normal control (n = 52; 20 males and 32 females; mean age 73.90 Â± 4.72 years) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 45, 23 males and 22 females; mean age 74.85 Â± 5.66). To uncover the wiring mechanisms that shaped changes in the topology of human brain networks of Alzheimer's disease patients, we proposed a local naÃ¯ve Bayes brain network model based on graph theory. Our results showed that the proposed model provided an excellent fit to observe networks in all properties examined, including clustering coefficient, modularity, characteristic path length, network efficiency, betweenness, and degree distribution compared with empirical methods. This proposed model simulated the wiring changes in human brain networks between controls and Alzheimer's disease patients. Our results demonstrate its utility in understanding relationships between brain tissue structure and cognitive or behavioral functions. The ADNI was performed in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, US 21CFR Part 50-Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56-Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Research Good Clinical Practice guidelines Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Research Ethics Boards (REBs).",Differences in pathological changes between two rat models of severe traumatic brain injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169198,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 06,"The rat high-impact free weight drop model mimics the diffuse axonal injury caused by severe traumatic brain injury in humans, while severe controlled cortical impact can produce a severe traumatic brain injury model using precise strike parameters. In this study, we compare the pathological mechanisms and pathological changes between two rat severe brain injury models to identify the similarities and differences. The severe controlled cortical impact model was produced by an electronic controlled cortical impact device, while the severe free weight drop model was produced by dropping a 500 g free weight from a height of 1.8 m through a plastic tube. Body temperature and mortality were recorded, and neurological deficits were assessed with the modified neurological severity score. Brain edema and blood-brain barrier damage were evaluated by assessing brain water content and Evans blue extravasation. In addition, a cytokine array kit was used to detect inflammatory cytokines. Neuronal apoptosis in the brain and brainstem was quantified by immunofluorescence staining. Both the severe controlled cortical impact and severe free weight drop models exhibited significant neurological impairments and body temperature fluctuations. More severe motor dysfunction was observed in the severe controlled cortical impact model, while more severe cognitive dysfunction was observed in the severe free weight drop model. Brain edema, inflammatory cytokine changes and cortical neuronal apoptosis were more substantial and blood-brain barrier damage was more focal in the severe controlled cortical impact group compared with the severe free weight drop group. The severe free weight drop model presented with more significant apoptosis in the brainstem and diffused blood-brain barrier damage, with higher mortality and lower repeatability compared with the severe controlled cortical impact group. Severe brainstem damage was not found in the severe controlled cortical impact model. These results indicate that the severe controlled cortical impact model is relatively more stable, more reproducible, and shows obvious cerebral pathological changes at an earlier stage. Therefore, the severe controlled cortical impact model is likely more suitable for studies on severe focal traumatic brain injury, while the severe free weight drop model may be more apt for studies on diffuse axonal injury. All experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Experiments of Tianjin Medical University, China (approval No. IRB2012-028-02) in February 2012."

Therapeutic hypothermia significantly reduces death and major disability associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; however, many infants still experience lifelong disabilities to movement, sensation and cognition. Clinical guidelines, based on strong clinical and preclinical evidence, recommend therapeutic hypothermia should be started within 6 hours of birth and continued for a period of 72 hours, with a target brain temperature of 33.5 Â± 0.5Â°C for infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The clinical guidelines also recommend that infants be rewarmed at a rate of 0.5Â°C per hour, but this is not based on strong evidence. There are no randomized controlled trials investigating the optimal rate of rewarming after therapeutic hypothermia for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Preclinical studies of rewarming are conflicting and results were confounded by treatment with sub-optimal durations of hypothermia.

In recent years, the predicted number of miRNAs has skyrocketed, largely as a consequence of high-throughput sequencing technologies becoming ubiquitous. This dramatic increase in miRNA candidates poses multiple challenges in terms of data deposition, curation, and validation. Although multiple databases containing miRNA annotations and targets have been developed, ensuring data quality by validating miRNA-target interactions requires the efforts of the research community. In order to generate databases containing biologically active miRNAs, it is imperative to overcome a multitude of hurdles, including restricted miRNA expression patterns, distinct miRNA biogenesis machineries, and divergent miRNA-mRNA interaction dynamics. In the present review, we discuss recent advances and limitations in miRNA prediction, identification, and validation. Lastly, we focus on the most enriched neuronal miRNA, miR-124, and its gene regulatory network in human neurons, which has been revealed using a combined computational and experimental approach.",Physiological effects of amyloid precursor protein and its derivatives on neural stem cell biology and signaling pathways involved.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169172,Neural regeneration research,2019 06 06,"The pathological implication of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in Alzheimer's disease has been widely documented due to its involvement in the generation of amyloid-Î² peptide. However, the physiological functions of APP are still poorly understood. APP is considered a multimodal protein due to its role in a wide variety of processes, both in the embryo and in the adult brain. Specifically, APP seems to play a key role in the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neural stem cells. In addition, APP can be processed through two canonical processing pathways, generating different functionally active fragments: soluble APP-Î±, soluble APP-Î², amyloid-Î² peptide and the APP intracellular C-terminal domain. These fragments also appear to modulate various functions in neural stem cells, including the processes of proliferation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis or cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects are still unclear. In this review, we summarize the physiological functions of APP and its main proteolytic derivatives in neural stem cells, as well as the possible signaling pathways that could be implicated in these effects. The knowledge of these functions and signaling pathways involved in the onset or during the development of Alzheimer's disease is essential to advance the understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and in the search for potential therapeutic targets.",Factors affecting the interrelationship between cynical hostility and dental anxiety among dental patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169167,Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research,2019 06 06,The objectives of this study were to assess the relationship between dental anxiety and cynical hostility in a sample of dental patients and to study the possible role of socioeconomic status (SES) in this relationship.,Evaluation of anxiety levels and their characteristics in dental care: Cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169166,Indian journal of dental research : official publication of Indian Society for Dental Research,2019 06 06,Anxiety is defined as an emotion produced by a set of feelings and physical changes.

Forensic dentists play a pivotal role in various areas of crime scene investigations and thereby help solve innumerable mysteries. Teeth appear to be vital pieces of evidence in several such investigations. Teeth are preserved in the closed cavities of the mouth and are generally resistant to the threatening environmental conditions that may be associated with the death of an individual, making them very useful in postmortem analysis. Teeth thus obtained may be useful in age estimation of the deceased victim or in determining his blood group. Identification of individuals in mass disasters can also be performed based on the unique morphological characteristics of the human dentition and through dental DNA fingerprinting. Again teeth play an all important role in catching a culprit through the positive correlation of the bite marks left behind at the crime scene and the suspect's own teeth marks. Thus, teeth prove to be an important adjunct in forensics. Its scope is ever-increasing with time, and a great amount of research is being carried out to implement the same.

Altogether, 78 PFUI patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) after primary posterior urethroplasty were enrolled and divided into two treatment groups: VED combined with Tadalafil (Group 1, n = 36) and Tadalafil only (Group 2, n = 42). Changes in penile length, testosterone level, International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) questionnaire, Quality of Erection Questionnaire (QEQ), and nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing were used to assess erectile function before and after 6 months of ED treatment. Results showed that the addition of VED to regular use of Tadalafil preserved more penile length statistically (0.4 Â± 0.9 vs -0.8 Â± 0.7 cm, P < 0.01). IIEF-5 score and QEQ score in Group 1 were higher than Group 2 (both P < 0.05). After treatment, 21/36 (58.3%) Group 1 patients and 19/42 (45.2%) Group 2 patients could complete vaginal penetration. Group 1 patients also had markedly improved testosterone levels (P = 0.01). Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in NPT testing between two therapies. For PFUI patients with ED after posterior urethroplasty, the addition of VED to regular use of Tadalafil could significantly improve their conditions - improving erection and increasing penile length - thus increasing patient satisfaction and confidence in penile rehabilitation.",Establishment of two new predictive models for prostate cancer to determine whether to require prostate biopsy when the PSA level is in the diagnostic gray zone (4-10 ng ml-1).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169140,Asian journal of andrology,2019 06 06,"Our goal was to establish two new predictive models of prostate cancer to determine whether to require a prostate biopsy when the prostate-specific antigen level is in the diagnostic gray zone.

Regardless of the type of inducers present, the acrosome reaction is ultimately mediated by the elevation of cytosolic calcium. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated calcium channels are important components of the acrosome reaction signaling pathway and have been confirmed by several researchers. In this study, we used a novel permeabilization tool BioPORTERÂ® and first demonstrated its effectiveness in spermatozoa. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate type-1 receptor antibody was introduced into spermatozoa by BioPORTERÂ® and significantly reduced the calcium influx and acrosome reaction induced by progesterone, solubilized zona pellucida, and the calcium ionophore A23187. This finding indicates that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate type-1 receptor antibody is a valid inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inhibitor and provides evidence of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated calcium channel involvement in the acrosome reaction in human spermatozoa. Moreover, we demonstrated that the transfer of 1,4,5-trisphosphate into spermatozoa induced acrosome reactions, which provides more reliable evidence for this process. In addition, by treating the spermatozoa with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/BioPORTERÂ® in the presence or absence of calcium in the culture medium, we showed that the opening of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-gated calcium channels led to extracellular calcium influx. This particular extracellular calcium influx may be the major process of the final step of the acrosome reaction signaling pathway."

A core feature and contributor to BPD, emotion dysegulation (ED), consists of deficits in the ability to regulate emotions in a manner that allows the individual to pursue important goals or behave effectively in various contexts. Biosocial developmental models of BPD have emphasized a transaction of environmental conditions (e.g., invalidating environments and adverse childhood experiences) with key genetically linked vulnerabilities (e.g., impulsivity and emotional vulnerability) in the development of ED and BPD. Emerging evidence has begun to highlight the complex, heterotypic pathways to the development of BPD, with key heritable vulnerability factors possibly interacting with aspects of the rearing environment to produce worsening ED and an adolescent trajectory consisting of self-damaging behaviors and eventual BPD. Adults with BPD have shown evidence of a variety of cognitive, physiological, and behavioral characteristics of ED.

The objective of this study was to verify if the chronic exposure to CF diet in animals submitted to ELS could relief the stress response at behavioral, neuroendocrine, and neurobiochemical levels, via differences in glucocorticoid receptors expression in brain areas involved in the stress response. From the second day of life, litters of Wistar rats and their mothers were submitted to the reduced nesting material protocol (ELS). In adult life, ELS and a control group were exposed chronically to two diet schemes: standard rat chow only or both ""CF"" diet, containing fat (34%) and sugar (20%) and a diet similar to the standard diet. Anxiety-like behavior, neuroendocrine response stress, leptin, GR, SOCS-3, pSTAT3, and the abdominal fat were evaluated. The anxiety-like behavior results showed that ELS group when exposed to comfort food were not different from the others groups. Chronic exposure to CF diet induced an anxiety-like behavior in the control group. Groups chronically exposed to CF diet had lower levels of corticosterone over time independent of the neonatal group. The ELS group exposed to the ""CF"" diet had higher levels of hippocampal GR, lower levels of hypothalamic SOCS-3 and greater accumulation of abdominal fat. Chronic CF diet consumption is able to reduce corticosterone levels independent of the neonatal history, but is associated with anxiety-like behavior in animals without previous history of trauma. Metabolic disturbances like increased adiposity and altered SOCS-3 seem to be a result of multiple insults (neonatal trauma followed by chronic CF diet).

It depends mainly on the climatic conditions, and the findings may vary from study to study. Commonly, the studies are based on monthly data. The population at risk plays a central role. For births or deaths over short periods, the population at risk is proportional to the lengths of the months. Hence, one must analyze the number of births (and deaths) per day. If one studies the seasonality of multiple maternities, the population at risk is the total monthly number of confinements and the number of multiple maternities in a given month must be compared with the monthly number of all maternities. Consequently, when one considers the monthly rates of multiple maternities, the monthly number of births is eliminated and one obtains an unaffected seasonality measure of the rates. In general, comparisons between the seasonality of different data sets presuppose standardization of the data to indices with common means, mainly 100. If one assumes seasonality as 'non-flatness' throughout a year, a chi-squared test would be an option, but this test calculates only the heterogeneity and the same test statistic can be obtained for data sets with extreme values occurring in consecutive months or in separate months. Hence, chi-squared tests for seasonality are weak because of this arbitrariness and cannot be considered a model test. When seasonal models are applied, one must pay special attention to how well the applied model fits the data. If the goodness of fit is poor, nonsignificant models obtained can erroneously lead to statements that the seasonality is slight, although the observed seasonal fluctuations are marked. In this study, we investigate how the application of seasonal models can be applied to different demographic variables.",Do young adults value sustainable diet practices?

Chemical control is currently the most effective and reliable method; however, application of fungicides has many drawbacks. The combination of biological control agents with newly developed fungicides may be a practicable method to control B. cinerea. Fluopimomide is a newly developed fungicide with a novel mode of action. Bacillus methylotrophicus TA-1, isolated from rhizosphere soil of tomato, is a bacterial strain with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. Little information is currently available about the effect of fluopimomide and its integrated effect on B. cinerea. Therefore, laboratory, pot, and field experiments were carried out to determine the effects of fluopimomide alone and in combination with B. methylotrophicus TA-1 against gray mold on tomato. The in vitro growth of B. methylotrophicus TA-1 was unaffected by 100 mg liter-1 fluopimomide. Inhibition of B. cinerea mycelial growth was significantly increased under combined treatment of fluopimomide and B. methylotrophicus TA-1.

The aim of this work was to identify potential insect vectors of the PMeV-Mexican variant (PMeV-Mx) and determine whether these potential vectors are capable of transmitting the virus. Adult insects were collected in papaya fields in the south-southeast region of Mexico and were identified morphologically and molecularly. Their abundance and frequency were determined, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to establish if they carried PMeV-Mx. The Cicadellidae family (Hemiptera) was the most diverse and abundant, and Empoasca papayae was the most abundant species and had the highest virus titers. PMeV-Mx transmission assays were conducted under controlled conditions using E. papayae on C. papaya 'Maradol'. E. papayae was a carrier of PMeV-Mx at 6 h after exposure, and its viral titer increased with time, peaking at 2.125 pg/Î¼l of PMeV-Mx RNA from 20 ng/Âµl of cDNA, 5 days after exposure (dae). From 14 days after plants were exposed to insects, PMeV-Mx was detected and quantified in 100% of the evaluated papaya plants, whose viral RNA titer increased from 0.06 (21 dae) to 26.6 pg/Î¼l of PMeV-Mx RNA (60 dae) from 20 ng/Âµl of cDNA. Three months later, these plants developed sticky disease symptoms, demonstrating that E. papayae is capable of transmitting PMeV-Mx to C. papaya 'Maradol'."

There were no significant differences in VO2 peak (17.7âÂ±â4.1 and 16.9âÂ±â4.5âmL/kg/min), VE/VCO2 slope (39.7âÂ±â8.4 and 39.6âÂ±â10.2) or EPB prevalence (20% and 19.5%) in patients with or without appropriate ICD therapy. According to Cox regression analysis, none of the CPET variables were significant predictors of appropriate ICD therapy. Conclusions: In this cohort study of HF patients, CPET variables did not predict appropriate ICD therapies. Further studies with large number of patients are warranted to address this issue.","A unique tri-culture model to study osteoblasts, osteoclasts and endothelial cells interactions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169074,"Tissue engineering. Part C, Methods",2019 06 06,"Many studies have shown that bone is a dynamic organ, in which cell communication plays a central role. A production of relevant in vitro models appears essential to better understand the cellular interactions. The conventional in vitro mono-cultures are hindered by over-simplification and are unable to reproduce the complex features of the processes investigated. Here, our aim was to establish an original tri-culture model allowing the retention of the phenotype of bone formation, bone resorbing and vasculature forming cells. Human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSC) were used to obtain osteoblasts (OB). Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from human umbilical cord blood and were used to obtain both osteoclasts (OC)-derived MNC and endothelial progenitor cells (EPC)-derived MNC. First results led to the establishment of a new cell culture medium: EGM2*/Î±MEM. In separated mono-cultures, the tested medium did not affect the retention of EPC, OB and OC phenotypes nor the OC resorptive activity. Similarly, both HBMSC and EPC-derived MNC phenotypes were preserved in the co-culture. Then, we demonstrated that our medium, made of EGM2*/Î±MEM, was compatible with the retention of OB, OC and EPC phenotypes, as well as OC resorptive activity in an original and unique direct tri-culture model. Finally, we investigated the homeostasis of our system through the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, this study was a mandatory first step to establish an in vitro micro-environment suitable to study bone cell communication. These promising results will permit further investigations to study cell-to-cell crosstalk, which will be of relevance to the process of bone regeneration and bone diseases.",Comparative genomics and genome biology of Campylobacter showae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169073,Emerging microbes & infections,2019 06 06,"Campylobacter showae a bacterium historically linked to gingivitis and periodontitis, has recently been associated with inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Our aim was to generate genome sequences for new clinical C. showae strains and identify functional properties explaining their pathogenic potential. Eight C. showae genomes were assessed, four strains isolated from inflamed gut tissues from paediatric Crohn's disease patients, three strains from colonic adenomas, and one from a gastroenteritis patient stool. Genome assemblies were analyzed alongside the only 3 deposited C. showae genomes. The pangenome from these 11 strains consisted of 4686 unique protein families, and the core genome size was estimated at 1050âÂ±â15 genes with each new genome contributing an additional 206âÂ±â16 genes. Functional assays indicated that colonic strains segregated into 2 groups: adherent/invasive vs. non-adherent/non-invasive strains. The former possessed Type IV secretion machinery and S-layer proteins, while the latter contained Cas genes and other CRISPR associated proteins. Comparison of gene profiles with strains in Human Microbiome Project metagenomes showed that gut-derived isolates share genes specific to tongue dorsum and supragingival plaque counterparts. Our findings indicate that C. showae strains are phenotypically and genetically diverse and suggest that secretion systems may play an important role in virulence potential.","Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice Regarding Research Ethics Committees Among Health Care Faculty at Two Public Universities in Jordan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169072,Journal of empirical research on human research ethics : JERHRE,2019 06 06,"Human research at Jordanian universities is increasing. This descriptive cross-sectional survey assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning the procedures and review process of research ethics committees (RECs) among faculty in health sciences in two major Jordanian universities. Most faculty reported having no training in research ethics in their current institutions. Although knowledge of RECs' roles and functions was adequate, deficiencies were found regarding the advisory and monitoring roles for RECs raised in this survey. Faculty expressed concerns about levels of ethical training for members of RECs and potential conflicts of interest and bias in review process. RECs should provide ethics training for faculty, and future research should examine the functioning of the RECs in Jordan and other Middle Eastern countries.",Partner Disagreement on the Occurrence of Intimate Partner Violence Among a National Sample of Heterosexual Young-Adult Couples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169071,Violence against women,2019 06 06,"To assess the extent and patterns of partner disagreement on the occurrence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among a young-adult couple sample, the Add Health Romantic Pairs data are used ( N = 1,183 heterosexual couples). Among young-adult couples in which IPV is reported, substantial partner disagreement is the norm. Moreover, women are more likely to report their own perpetration of minor and physical IPV than men. For injurious and sexual IPV, no gendered patterns are observed. In conclusion, IPV prevalence rates vary depending on which partner's self-reports are being considered. Prior research may have suffered from a reporting bias and to obtain accurate estimates of IPV both partners of a couple should be included in future research.",The four repeat Giardia lamblia telomere forms tetramolecular G-quadruplex with antiparallel topology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169070,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 06 06,"Guanine rich DNA sequences of regulatory genomic regions form secondary structures known as G-quadruplexes usually stabilized by tetrads of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonded guanines. The in vivo existence of G-quadruplexes ascertains their biological roles. Human telomeric repeats are the most studied G-rich sequences. The four repeat Giardia telomeric sequence (TAGGG)4 differs from its human counterpart (TTAGGG)4, by deletion of one T at the G-tract intervening site of each repeat. We show here that whilst the two repeat Giardia telomeric sequence (TAGGG)2 forms parallel and antiparallel quadruplexes with tetramolecular topology exclusively, the four repeat version (TAGGG)4 forms a tetramolecular (antiparallel) and unimolecular (parallel) quadruplexes in Na+. The tetramolecular (antiparallel) G-quadruplex formed by four repeats of Giardia telomeric sequence is stabilized by the additional Watson-Crick bonding between its intervening TA bases aligned in antiparallel fashion. Four stranded antiparallel quadruplex for four repeats of any telomeric sequence have not been characterized till date. We hypothesize that telomeric association in antiparallel fashion, (via G-overhangs to form tetramolecular quadruplex) could be a biologically relevant molecular event. Further, coexistence of Hoogsteen as well as Watson-Crick base pairing might give insight for recognition of conformationally diverse DNA structures by ligands. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",Environmental stress and socioeconomic status: Does parent and adolescent stress influence executive functioning in urban youth?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169069,Journal of prevention & intervention in the community,2019 06 06,"This study examined whether parental and adolescent stress act as mediators between socio-economic status (SES) and adolescent executive functioning (EF) in urban youth. Two hundred and sixty-seven 6th-11th grade students (ages 11-16, 55.4% female; 49.1% Black/African American) attending racially and socioeconomically diverse schools in Chicago, Illinois, completed self-report measures on urban stress and EF. Parents of adolescents completed measures on parental chronic stress and demographic information on the family's socioeconomic status. Results indicated that parent stress was directly related to adolescent stress, while adolescent stress was directly related to behavior components of EF (i.e., emotion control, set shifting, and inhibition). Although parental stress was related to adolescent's ability to shift from one task to another, no relationship was found with adolescent's ability to modulate mood or delay impulsive behaviors. Implications for socio-ecological mental health interventions for youth residing in urban environments are discussed.",Exploring the factors contribute to the injury severities of vulnerable roadway user involved crashes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169068,International journal of injury control and safety promotion,2019 06 06,"The vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) applications will enable safety, mobility, and environmental advancements for the vulnerable roadway user (VRU) that current technologies are unable to provide. The present research aims to explore the use of random parameters in logit models to examine factors that significantly influence injury severity of VRU involved crashes. Two types of logit models, the mixed generalized ordered logit (MGOL) models and mixed logit models are proposed to provide insights on reducing injury severities of pedestrian and bicyclist involved crashes and benefit amending current V2P applications to address the special safety needs and challenges of these VRUs. Based on 9180 pedestrian involved crashes and 1402 bicyclist involved crashes from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), the measure of injury severities - time-to-death is considered as the independent variables to capture a more comprehensive picture of events after a crash occurs. By comparing to the ordered logit models and the multinomial logit models, the effectiveness and appropriateness of the proposed models are verified through two perspectives - goodness of fit and predictive power. The modelling results show that the injury severity of VRU involved crashes is significantly associated with involved non-motorist characteristics (age and police reported alcohol involvement), involved motorist characteristics (drunk drivers, previous recorded crashes, number of occupants), involved vehicle characteristics (vehicle body type, vehicle model year, travel speed), roadway characteristics (interstate, junction, roadway profile), and environmental characteristics (light and weather condition). Among these significant factors, the number of occupants, vehicle body type, interstate, and junction result in random parameters, which capture and reflect the unobserved heterogeneity across sampled observations. The analyses of under-researched aspects of VRU involved crashes, that is time-to-death, help us develop a deeper understanding of the consequences of injury and ultimately health and social costs. The findings indicate that the proposed MGOL models and mixed logit models can account for the heterogeneity issues in crash data due to the unobserved factors. In addition, the injury severity models that incorporate the random parameter features can reveal new insights and have superior goodness of fit.",Predicting Sexual Recidivism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169067,Sexual abuse : a journal of research and treatment,2019 06 06,"The current study focuses on adolescents with sex offense histories and examines sexual reoffending patterns within 2 years of a prior sex offense. We employed inductive statistical models using archival official records maintained by the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (FDJJ), which provides social, offense, placement, and risk assessment history data for all youth referred for delinquent behavior. The predictive accuracy of the random forest models is tested using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, the area under the curve (AUC), and precision/recall plots. The strongest predictor of sexual recidivism was the number of prior felony and misdemeanor sex offenses. The AUC values range between 0.71 and 0.65, suggesting modest predictive accuracy of the models presented. These results parallel the existing literature on sexual recidivism and highlight the challenges associated with predicting sex offense recidivism. Furthermore, results inform risk assessment literature by testing various factors recorded by an official institution.",The effects of two different electrical stimulation methods on the pain intensity of the patients who had undergone abdominal surgery with a midline incision: Randomized controlled clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169066,Contemporary nurse,2019 06 14,"Aims-Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) on pain and analgesic drug consumption in patients who had undergone abdominal surgery.

All participants (100%, N = 429) decided to continue directly to the study, choosing to forgo additional information about the study and the institutional review board (IRB) approval process. Participants indicated they liked this streamlined consent process, even though on average they only comprehended about half of the information this streamlined process contained. A plurality of participants indicated they would like to see this style of streamlined consent continued in future online studies. However, if we want to continue referring to informed consent as informed, future research should be welcomed and supported by IRBs to seek ways to apply the newest Common Rule guidelines while increasing comprehension; otherwise, informed consent will likely always remain an oxymoron.",Geographies of Sexual Assault: A Spatial Analyses to Identify Neighborhoods Affected by Sexual and Gender-Based Violence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169050,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 06 06,"Emergency departments are a common access point for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), but very little is known about where survivors live and the neighborhoods they return to. The objectives of this study were to describe the patient population that present for a sexual or partner-based assault and explore the geographic distribution of cases across the Ottawa-Gatineau area. Data for this study were extracted from the Sexual Assault and Partner Abuse Care Program (SAPACP) case registry (January 1 to December 31, 2015) at The Ottawa Hospital. Spatial analyses were conducted using six-digit postal codes converted into Canadian Census Tract units to identify geographic areas with concentrated cases of SGBV. Concentrated areas were defined as Census Tracts with seven or more SGBV cases within a single calendar year. In 2015, there were 406 patients seen at the SAPACP and 348 had valid postal codes and were included in the analyses. More than 90% of patients were female and 152 (43.68%) were below 24 years of age. More than 70% knew their assailant and the most common locations of the assault were at the survivors' home (31.03%), assailants' home (27.01%), or outdoors (10.92%). Eight concentrated areas were identified including three in the downtown entertainment district, three lower income areas, one high-income neighborhood, and one suburb more than 20 km from downtown. The findings from this study describe the typical clinical presentation of sexual and domestic assault survivors and also challenge geographic stereotypes of where survivors live and what areas of the city are most affected by SGBV. Using residential information provides a survivor-centric approach that highlights the widespread nature of SGBV and supports the need for population-based approaches to improve care for survivors.",Smoldering multiple myeloma: the role of different scoring systems in identifying high-risk patients in real-life practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31169049,Leukemia & lymphoma,2019 06 06,"We explore the predictive role of 2014-updated International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) diagnostic criteria and of some of currently available risk models for progression to symptomatic myeloma when applied in our unselected population of 75 smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) patients observed between 2000 and 2015. Risk scores including routinely used clinical parameters such as bone marrow plasmacell infiltration rate, immunoparesis, serum monoclonal component (sMC) value, and altered free light chain ratio (FLCr), were clinically useful to identify SMM patients at higher risk of progression. Time to myeloma progression in our ultra-high risk SMM according to IMWG diagnostic update criteria was very short (12.4 months). Our analysis identified as independent reliable predictors of progression altered FLCr as well as increasing plasma cell infiltration which are part of most commonly applied risk models.

Two female patients with end-stage renal disease were undergoing hemodialysis with a high probability of failure due to repeated stenosis every few months at the venous outflow regions over 1.5âyears. Biotubes formed in both patients and were bypassed over the venous stenosis region of the arteriovenous shunt. After bypass with Biotubes without living cells, palpable thrill and typical turbulent flow pattern were observed by pulsed-wave Doppler.

Targeted dependent variables were also assessed at six months post-intervention. Following the intervention study, 90 external raters completed a social validation procedure. Method: An ABABAB experimental sequence was implemented for each participant with a cross-over effect. A social validation assessment involving 90 external raters was carried out. Results: Data emphasized an improved performance for each participants involved (i.e., adaptive responses). Five participants showed a capacity of independent choice. One participant seemed to be closely linked to the position of the container. Social raters favorably endorsed the use of the program since they positively evaluated the use of the technology on all the dimensions investigated. Conclusion: A microswitch intervention may improve choice making and activity engagement for children with Rett syndrome.

We recently demonstrated that, unlike its parent compound, the benzoyl ester of 1 (compound 3) exhibits negligible reactivity towards GSH, and has a different mode of interaction with GSTP1-1. Unfortunately, 3 is susceptible to rapid metabolic hydrolysis. In an effort to improve the metabolic stability of 3, its ester group has been replaced by an amide, leading to N-(6-((7-nitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)hexyl)benzamide (4). Unlike 3, compound 4 was stable to human liver microsomal carboxylesterases, but retained the ability to disrupt the interaction between GSTP1-1 and TRAF2 regardless of GSH levels. Moreover, 4 exhibited both a higher stability in the presence of GSH and a greater cytotoxicity towards cultured A375 melanoma cells, in comparison with 1 and its analog 2. These findings suggest that 4 deserves further preclinical testing."

B,2019 06 13,"To explore the volatile profiles and the contents of ten bioactive components (polyphenols and caffeine) of sun-dried Pu-erh tea leaves from ancient tea plants on Bulang Mountain, 17 samples of three tea varieties were analyzed by headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A total of 75 volatile components were tentatively identified. Laomaner (LME), Laobanzhang (LBZ), and other teas on Bulang Mountain (BL) contained 70, 53, and 71 volatile compounds, respectively. Among the volatile compounds, alcohols (30.2%-45.8%), hydrocarbons (13.7%-17.5%), and ketones (12.4%-23.4%) were qualitatively the most dominant volatile compounds in the different tea varieties. The average content of polyphenol was highest in LME (102.1 mg/g), followed by BL (98.7 mg/g) and LBZ (88.0 mg/g), while caffeine showed the opposite trend, 27.3 mg/g in LME, 33.5 mg/g in BL, and 38.1 mg/g in LBZ. Principal component analysis applied to both the volatile compounds and ten bioactive components showed a poor separation of samples according to varieties, while partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed satisfactory discrimination. Thirty-four volatile components and five bioactive compounds were selected as major discriminators (variable importance in projection (VIP) >1) among the tea varieties.

Science. B,2019 06 13,"Although a relationship between epigenetics and aging phenotypic changes has been established, a theoretical explanation of the intrinsic connection between the epigenetics and aging is lacking. In this essay, we propose that epigenetic recording of varied cell environment and complex history could be an origin of cellular aging. Through epigenetic modifications, the environment and historical events can induce the chromatin template into an activated or repressive accessible structure, thereby shaping the DNA template into a spectrum of chromatin states. The inner nature of diversity and conflicts born by the cell environment and its historical events are hence recorded into the chromatin template. This could result in a dissipated spectrum of the chromatin state and chaos in overall gene expression. An unavoidable degradation of epigenome entropy, similar to Shannon entropy, would be consequently induced. The resultant disorder in epigenome, characterized by corrosion of epigenome entropy as reflected in chromatin template, can be stably memorized and propagated through cell division. Furthermore, the hysteretic nature of epigenetics responding to the emerging environment could exacerbate the degradation of epigenome entropy. As well as stochastic errors, we propose that outside entropy (or chaos) derived from the varied environment and complex cell history, gradually input and imprinted into the chromatin via epigenetic modifications, would lead inevitably to cellular aging, the extent of which could be aggravated by hysteresis of epigenetics without error erasing and correction.",Recent advances in the neural regulation of feeding behavior in adult Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168968,Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B,2019 06 13,"The ability to maintain metabolic homeostasis is a key capability critical for the survival and well-being of animals living in constantly changing environments. Metabolic homeostasis depends on neuromodulators, such as biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and hormones, to signal changes in animals' internal metabolic status and to orchestrate their behaviors accordingly. An important example is the regulation of feeding behavior by conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms across the animal kingdom. Its relatively simple brain coupled with well-characterized genetics and behavioral paradigms makes the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster an excellent model for investigating the neuromodulatory regulation of feeding behavior. In this review we discuss the neuromodulators and neural circuits that integrate the internal physiological status with external sensory cues and modulate feeding behavior in adult fruit flies. Studies show that various specific aspects of feeding behavior are subjected to unique neuromodulatory regulation, which permits fruit flies to maintain metabolic homeostasis effectively.",Human Neural Tissues from Neural Stem Cells Using Conductive Biogel and Printed Polymer Microelectrode Arrays for 3D Electrical Stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168967,Advanced healthcare materials,2019 06 06,"Electricity is important in the physiology and development of human tissues such as embryonic and fetal development, and tissue regeneration for wound healing.

In silico analysis demonstrated that this temporary linear ""signature"" was regulated by drugs, which reduce mortality or extend life span in model organisms, including 24 inhibitors of the IGF-1/PI3K/mTOR pathway that mimicked, and 5 activators that opposed, the signature.

A panel of ex- and in-situ characterizations by XRD, SEM and solid-sate NMR provided some evidences that, after the simultaneous use of pre-made ZSM-5 and NH4F, as confined Al source and mineralizer, respectively. The confined zeolite framework of ZSM-5 prevented the forming of AlFx species between NH4F and Al atoms, thus ensuring the desirable acidic property of prepared samples. Moreover, the resulting morphology could be controlled by applying different silica substrates. Due to its unique structure and directly exposed acidic sites, without extra ion-exchange process, the obtained H-type MFI zeolite showed excellent catalytic performance in methanol to gasoline reactions. Our developed one-pot strategy provides a prior alternative for facile synthesis of H-type zeolite with defined morphology."

MicroRNAs can regulate the expression of a variety of atherosclerotic inflammation-related genes in macrophages. There are currently no definitive methods for delivering microRNAs into the interior of plaque. Monocytes typically possess a pathological feature that allows them to be recruited to atherosclerotic plaque resulting in rupture-prone; however, whether monocytes can be modified to be gene carriers remains unclear. In this study, a novel monocyte surface-engineered gene-delivery system based on graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is developed. Briefly, GQDs-microRNA223 linked by disulfide bonds are grafted onto the monocyte membrane via a carefully designed C18-peptide (C18P) containing a hydrophobic end to afford the designed monocyte-C18P-GQDs-miR223 architecture. The system can reach and enter the interior of the plaque and release the GQDs-miRNA via C18P digestion. The released GQDs-miRNA are taken up by the macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques, and the disulfide linkages between the GQDs and the miRNA are cleaved through Î³-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) in the lysosome. Under the protection of GQDs, miRNA cargos are transfected into the cytosol and subsequently undergo nuclear translocation, allowing a significantly reduced plaque burden by regulating inflammatory response in vivo.",Copper(I)-Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Borylation of Racemic Benzyl Chlorides Enabled by Quadrant-by-Quadrant Structure Modulation of Chiral Bisphosphine Ligands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168946,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 06 06,"The first copper(I)-catalyzed enantioselective borylation of racemic benzyl chlorides has been realized by a quadrant-by-quadrant structure modulation of QuinoxP*-type three-hindered-quadrant bisphosphine ligands.

However, the quality of the film is degraded owing to the addition of additives. Holes and defects can be observed, and the dispersion of the additives are uneven inside. Here, a copper coordination polymer, Cu-bix, with matching energy level and fluorescent properties was screened for use as an additional additive to dope Spiro-OMeTAD. The doping of Cu-bix effectively improved the dispersion state of the additives in the hole transport layers and alleviated the aggregation of LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) or/and lithium salt complexes in the film. Owing to better dispersion of the additives, Spiro-OMeTAD was more fully and uniformly oxidized whereas the possibility of charge recombination was reduced in the devices. Furthermore, the flat and tightly bonded film layer obtained by optimization of the doping amount can efficiently transfer holes from the perovskite layers to the hole transport layers. Possible interaction mechanisms between additives and the copper coordination polymer are proposed and discussed. The resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) for Cu-bix-doped PSCs was improved from 16.52â% to 18.47â% compared to the pristine devices, and this type of PSCs also showed a long stability in air owing to the increased hydrophobicity of the Cu-bix-based hole transport layers.","Simple, efficient and eco-friendly sample preparation for simultaneous determination of paracetamol and chloramphenicol in meat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168942,Journal of separation science,2019 06 06,"This study develops and validates a simple, eco-friendly and reliable method to simultaneously determine paracetamol and chloramphenicol in meat with ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Currently, there is no effective pharmacological or genetic therapy for all EB subtypes. Dry extract from birch bark and betulin upregulate some pro-inflammatory mediators and downregulate others. The increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines is temporary and attenuated over long-term treatment. This inflammatory stimulus is thought to be prerequisite for a secondary anti-inflammatory response. Dry extract from birch bark and its active marker substances have also been shown to increase the migration of primary human keratinocytes, accelerate wound closure, and promote differentiation of keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo - processes that are essential for re-epithelialization and maintenance of the skin barrier. Comprehensive clinical data are available to support the use of Oleogel-S10 in the treatment of partial thickness wounds of different aetiologies, and a proof-of-concept phase 2 study in patients with dystrophic EB has suggested the potential for faster re-epithelialization of wounds treated with Oleogel-S10.

However, little is known about the level and nature of such activity in these settings. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature, and requested grey information from Muslim organizations, local councils, and mosques in 13 selected areas in the United Kingdom. Thirty-five interventions were identified; most were poorly described and not evaluated. Twenty-seven interventions focused on physical activity behaviours, four on diet behaviours, one on both behaviours, and seven addressed long-term conditions associated with obesity. Most interventions were led by volunteers from the congregation/faith leaders and were funded through donations from congregants or charity organizations. The evidence suggests that health promotion interventions in IRS have a relatively high reach. Obesity interventions are commonly delivered in UK IRS. Most target physical activity behaviours, are instigated and led by volunteers from the congregation or faith leaders, receive no public funding, and are only recorded in people's memories. High-quality evaluations of well-specified interventions in this context are needed. We suggest that the methods used in this review, including the learning around positionality of researchers, could be adopted by other researchers as a way to locate opportunities for effective community-level interventions.",Dulaglutide-combined basal plus correction insulin therapy contributes to ideal glycemic control in noncritical hospitalized patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168938,Journal of diabetes investigation,2019 06 06,We investigated whether dulaglutide (DU)-combined conventional insulin therapy is beneficial for glycemic control in noncritically ill hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes.,Modelling Conformational Flexibility of Kinases in Inactive States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168936,Proteins,2019 06 06,"Kinase structures in the inactive 'DFG-out' state provide a wealth of druggable binding site variants. The conformational plasticity of this state can be mainly described by different conformations of binding site-forming elements such as the DFG motif, A-loop, P-loop, and Î±C-helix. Compared to DFG-in structures, DFG-out structures are largely underrepresented in the PDB. Thus, structure-based drug design efforts for DFG-out inhibitors may benefit from an efficient approach to generate an ensemble of DFG-out structures. Accordingly, the here presented modelling pipeline systematically generates homology models of kinases in several DFG-out conformations based on a sophisticated creation of template structures that represent the major states of the flexible structural elements. Eighteen template classes were initially selected from all available kinase structures in the PDB and subsequently employed for modelling the entire kinome in different DFG-out variants by fusing individual structural elements to multiple chimeric template structures. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that conformational transitions between the different DFG-out states generally do not occur within trajectories of a few hundred nanoseconds length. This underlines the benefits of the presented homology modelling pipeline to generate relevant conformations of 'DFG-out' kinase structures for subsequent in silico screening or binding site analysis studies.

The presence of H5N1 influenza A virus in the affected birds was detected by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on full length gene sequences of all eight gene segments revealed that these recent outbreaks were caused by a new reassotant of clade 2.3.2.1a H5N1 virus, which had been detected earlier in 2015 during surveillance in live bird markets (LBMs) and wet lands. This reassortant virus acquired PB2, PB1, PA, NP and NS genes from low pathogenic avian influenza viruses mostly of non-H9N2 subtypes but retained HA, NA and M genes of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses. Nevertheless, the HA gene of these new viruses was 2.7% divergent from that of the old clade 2.3.2.1a viruses circulated in Bangladesh. Interestingly, similar reassortment events could be traced back in four 2.3.2.1a virus isolates of 2013 from backyard ducks. It suggests that this reassortant virus emerged in 2013, which took two years to be detected at a broader scale (i.e. in LBMs), another two years until it became widely spread in poultry and fully replaced the old viruses. Several mutations were detected in the recent Bangladeshi isolates, which are likely to influence possible phenotypic alterations such as increased mammalian adaptation, reduced susceptibility to antiviral agents and reduced host antiviral response.

Approximately one-third of the world's population is overweight or obese, and in the United States alone, obesity affects one in six children. Meta-analysis studies suggest that obesity increases the likelihood of developing several types of cancer, and with poorer outcomes, especially in children. The contribution of obesity to cancer risk requires a better understanding of the association between obesity-induced metabolic changes and its impact on genomic instability, which is a major driving force of tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss how molecular changes during adipose tissue dysregulation can result in oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage. This represents one of the many critical steps connecting obesity and cancer since oxidative DNA lesions can result in cancer-associated genetic instability. In addition, the by-products of the oxidative degradation of lipids (e.g., malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal, and acrolein), and gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile acid metabolites (e.g., deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid), can function as genotoxic agents and tumor promoters. We also discuss how obesity can impact DNA repair efficiency, potentially contributing to cancer initiation and progression. Finally, we outline obesity-related epigenetic changes and identify the gaps in knowledge to be addressed for the development of better therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity-related cancers.",Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)-Neooxazolomycin Using a Chirality Transfer Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168911,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 06 06,The total synthesis of (+)-neooxazolomycin was achieved from the amino acid D-serine.

To properly realize their potential, biomarker trajectory models must be robust to both under-sampling and measurement errors and should be able to integrate multi-modal information to improve trajectory inference and prediction. Here we present a parametric Bayesian multi-task learning based approach to modeling univariate trajectories across subjects that addresses these criteria. Our approach learns multiple subjects' trajectories within a single model that allows for different types of information sharing, that is, coupling, across subjects. It optimizes a combination of uncoupled, fully coupled and kernel coupled models. Kernel-based coupling allows linking subjects' trajectories based on one or more biomarker measures. We demonstrate this using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, where we model longitudinal trajectories of MRI-derived cortical volumes in neurodegeneration, with coupling based on APOE genotype, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid PET-based biomarkers. In addition to detecting established disease effects, we detect disease related changes within the insula that have not received much attention within the literature. Due to its sensitivity in detecting disease effects, its competitive predictive performance and its ability to learn the optimal parameter covariance from data rather than choosing a specific set of random and fixed effects a priori, we propose that our model can be used in place of or in addition to linear mixed effects models when modeling biomarker trajectories. A software implementation of the method is publicly available.",The effects of melatonin on neurohormonal regulation in cardiac cachexia: A mechanistic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168891,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 06,"Heart failure (HF) is one of the prominent health concerns and its morbidity is comparable to many malignancies. Cardiac cachexia (CC), characterized by significant weight loss and muscle wasting, frequently occurs in progressive stage of HF. The pathophysiology of CC is multifactorial including nutritional and gastrointestinal alterations, immunological and neurohormonal activation, and anabolic/catabolic imbalance. Neurohormones are critically involved in the development of both HF and CC. Melatonin is known as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant hormone. It seems that melatonin possibly regulates the neurohormonal signaling pathway related to muscle wasting in CC, but limited comprehensive data is available on the mechanistic aspects of its activity. In this, we reviewed the reports regarding the role of neurohormones in CC occurrence and possible activity of melatonin in modulation of HF and subsequently CC via neurohormonal regulation. In addition, we have discussed proposed mechanisms of action for melatonin considering its possible interactions with neurohormones. In conclusion, melatonin likely regulates the signaling pathways related to muscle wasting in CC by reducing tumor necrosis factor Î± levels and activating the gene expression of insulin-like growth factor-1. Also, this hormone inhibits the proteolytic pathway by inhibiting nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), renin-angiotensin system and forkhead box protein O1 pathways and could increase protein synthesis by activating Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin. To elucidate the positive role of melatonin in CC and exact mechanisms related to muscle wasting more cellular and clinical trial studies are needed.",Do GLP-1RA and SGLT-2i reduce cardiovascular events in black patients with type 2 diabetes?

The improving effect of SM5 was particularly pronounced. Transgenic expression was further enhanced with the increasing SM5 copy number. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that several arrangements of the DNA-binding motifs for CEBP, FAST, Hox, glutathione, and NMP4 may help increase transgenic expression levels and the average population of highly expressed cells.

Although geometry, materials chemistry, stiffness, and porosity have been shown to influence nerve growth within nerve guidance scaffolds, independent tuning of these properties in a high-throughput manner remains a challenge. Here, fiber drawing is combined with salt leaching to produce microchannels with tunable cross sections and porosity. This technique is applicable to an array of biochemically inert polymers, and it delivers hundreds of meters of porous microchannel fibers. Employing these fibers as filaments during 3D printing enables the production of microchannel scaffolds with geometries matching those of biological nerves, including branched topographies. Applied to sensory neurons, fiber-based porous microchannels enhance growth as compared to non-porous channels with matching materials and geometries. The combinatorial scaffold fabrication approach may advance the studies of neural regeneration and accelerate the development of nerve repair devices.",SIN3 LIKE genes mediate long-day induction of flowering but inhibit the floral transition in short days through histone deacetylation in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168864,The Plant journal : for cell and molecular biology,2019 06 06,"Day length or photoperiod changes are crucial for plants to align the timing of the floral transition with seasonal changes. Through the photoperiod pathway, day-length changes induce the expression of the florigenic FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) to promote flowering. In the facultative long-day plant Arabidopsis thaliana, long-day signals induce flowering, whereas short days inhibit flowering. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis SIN3 LIKE (SNL) family genes, encoding a scaffold protein for assembly of histone deacetylase complexes, directly repress the expression of an FT activator and three FT repressors to regulate the transition to flowering in short days and long days, respectively. Under inductive long days, SNLs including SIN3 LIKE 1 (SNL1) to SNL5, function in partial redundancy to repress the expression of three AP2 family transcription factors that repress FT expression, and thus mediate long-day induction of FT expression and promote the transition to flowering. In contrast, under non-inductive short days SNLs act to inhibit the floral transition, partly through direct repression of a MADS box transcriptional factor that promotes FT expression. Thus, our results reveal that SNLs, through histone deacetylation, play a dual role for the control of flowering in the long-day plant Arabidopsis: inhibiting flowering when the day length is shorter and promoting the floral transition when days become longer than a threshold length.

To date, modifications of the myosin heavy chains (MHC) isoforms proportion and increases in fiber size are considered as the main factors of sarcomeric plasticity in response to exercise training. In this study, we investigated the effects of a resistance training protocol on myofibrillar ATPase (m-ATPase) cycle, muscle performance (power output) and MHC gene expression. For this purpose, eight-week-old Wistar han rats were subjected to four weeks of resistance training with five sessions per week. Muscle samples, i.e. Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP), biceps and deltoid, were collected and subjected to RT-qPCR analyses and m-ATPase activity with rapid flow quench apparatus. Training led to a significant increase in muscles mass excepted for the biceps, and total mechanical power output (+135.7%, pÂ <Â 0.001). A shift toward intermediate fiber-type (i.e. MHC2x-to-MHC2a isoforms transition) was also observed in biceps and FDP but not in the deltoid muscle. Importantly, rapid flow quench experiments revealed an enhancement of the m-ATPase activity during contraction at maximal velocity (kF ) in the three muscles with a more marked effect in FDP (+242%, pÂ <Â 0.001). Data fitting revealed that the rate constant of ATP hydrolysis products liberation (k3 ) appears to be the main factor influencing the increase in m-ATPase activity. In conclusion, the data showed that, in addition to classically observed changes in MHC isoforms content and fiber hypertrophy, m-ATPase activity is enhanced during resistance training and may significantly contribute to performance gains.

To reconcile high-frequency covariates with lower-frequency demographic censuses, many statistical tools involve aggregating environmental conditions over long periods, potentially obscuring the importance of fluctuating conditions in driving mortality. Here, we introduce a flexible model designed to infer how survival probabilities depend on changing environmental covariates. Specifically, the model quantifies 1) effects of environmental covariates at a higher frequency than the census intervals, and 2) allows partitioning of environmental drivers of individual survival into acute (short-term) and chronic (accumulated) effects. By applying our method to a long-term observational dataset of eight annual plant species, we show we can accurately infer daily survival probabilities as temperature and moisture levels change. Next, we show that a species' water use efficiency, known to mediate annual plant population dynamics, is positively correlated with the importance of ""chronic stress"" inferred by the model. This suggests that model parameters can reflect underlying physiological mechanisms. This method is also applicable to other binary responses (hatching, phenology) or systems (insects, nestlings). Once known, environmental sensitivities can be used for ecological forecasting even when the frequency or variability of environments are changing. This article is protected by copyright.

Journal of parenteral and enteral nutrition,2019 06 06,"Ketogenic states are of 3 major types: total starvation and those resulting from the consumption of semistarvation, ketogenic diets, and eucaloric ketogenic diets. All are characterized by little or no dietary carbohydrate, resulting in a fat-based metabolism with sustained ketonemia of varying degrees in each state. The latter 2 diets are clinically useful with important impacts on both aspects of the energy balance equation with increased satiety and less hunger on the intake side and probably increased energy expenditure on the output side; both may have important implications for the successful long-term management of obesity. Consideration of older research regarding the hormonal response to carbohydrate-free dieting and recent findings on hepatic glycogen status that occurs with sustained ketonemia support the likelihood that there are profound differences in 24-hour gluconeogenesis rates between ketogenic diets and balanced diets containing substantial carbohydrate. This metabolic distinction could have a meaningful impact to increase the thermic effect of feeding and daily energy expenditure amounting to 100Â kcal/d or more with each of the ketogenic diets.",The effect of extracellular matrix on the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168838,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 06,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are promising research materials to investigate cell fate determination since they have the capability to differentiate. Stem cell differentiation has been extensively studied with various microenvironment mimicking structures to modify cellular dynamics associated with the cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and cell-cell communications.

Based on our data, coating the surface of mESCs with Matrigel, used as an acellular matrix substrate, resulted in morphological and biochemical changes. mESCs exhibited alterations in their phenotype after growing on the Matrigel-coated surfaces, including their differentiation capacity, cell cycle phase pattern, membrane fluidity, and metabolic activities. In conclusion, mESCs can be stimulated physiologically, chemically, or mechanically to convert them a new phenotype. Thus, identification of ESCs' behavior in the acellular microenvironment could be vital to elucidate the mechanism of diseases.

However, little is known about the role of ATDC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression level, biological function and underlying mechanism of ATDC in HCC. The expression of ATDC in HCC cells was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Cell growth was determined by cell counting kit-8 assay and colony formation assay. Cell invasion was assessed by Transwell invasion assay. The activation status of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling was evaluated by luciferase reporter assay. Functional experiments showed that the silencing of ATDC expression significantly suppressed the growth and invasion of HCC cells, whereas the overexpression of ATDC promoted the growth and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Moreover, we showed that ATDC overexpression promoted the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3Î² and resulted in the activation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Notably, the inhibition of GSK-3Î² activity significantly abrogated the tumor suppressive effect of ATDC silencing, while the silencing of Î²-catenin partially reversed the oncogenic effect of ATDC overexpression. Taken together, these findings reveal an oncogenic role of ATDC in HCC and show that the suppression of ATDC impedes the growth and invasion of HCC cells associated with the inactivation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Our study suggests that ATDC may serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC. This article is protected by copyright.

Ballooning dispersal by spiderlings and migration of planthoppers carried on air currents are salient examples (Reynolds etÂ al. 2007, Chapman etÂ al. 2015). In Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), some neonate caterpillars that have limited mobility ride on the wind using silk threads for dispersal, which may compensate for adult flightlessness in some species (Barbosa etÂ al. 1989). However, heavier, more mature larvae cannot use the wind to move. Instead, when searching for food or pupation sites, they usually descend on the plant surface or from silk threads, which can be risky due to potential predation and exposure to adverse weather conditions (e.g., desiccation and freezing). In a few lepidopteran species, mature larvae are known to parachute down to the ground on leaves for pupation or feeding (Yamazaki 2010, Walla and Greeney 2012). However, active use of wind for dispersal has not been reported in mature larvae.

And what if the island is subject to the recurrent activity of several volcanoes? The Canary Islands archipelago, in the North Atlantic Ocean, meets both conditions. These volcanic islands have been inhabited by humans for the last two millennia (Arco etÂ al. 1997) and currently are a major tourist destination (15 million visitors in 2016). Surviving here for centuries is certainly a real challenge for any tree, since in addition to usual volcanic activity, the human arrival triggered extinctions of endemic species and disappearance of whole ecosystems. But unexpected things sometimes happen. The Teide National Park, in Tenerife island, was declared in 1954 and includes several active volcanoes, the highest of which is named Teide and peaks at 3,718 m above sea level, just 15 km away from the shoreline in the midst of the island. Park managers, concerned with preserving and recovering Teide's native flora and fauna (see Olano etÂ al. 2017), are now directing their efforts to study the population dynamics and longevity of remaining Canary Islands junipers (Juniperus cedrus Webb. & Berthel.).

To collect data over large spatial and temporal extents for such inferences, especially for species with low densities or wide distributions, citizen science can be an efficient approach. Integrated models have also emerged as an important methodology to estimate population parameters by combining multiple types of data, including citizen science data. We developed a spatially explicit integrated model that combines opportunistically collected presence-absence (PA) data, commonly collected in citizen science efforts, with systematically collected spatial-capture-recapture (SCR) data, which are often limited to small spatial and temporal extents. We conducted single and multi-season simulations with parameters informed by North American black bear (Ursus americanus) populations, to evaluate the influence of varying amounts of opportunistic PA data collected at larger spatial and temporal extents on the estimation of population-level parameters. Integrating opportunistic PA data increased the precision and accuracy of posterior estimates of abundance, and survival and recruitment rates. In some cases, adding PA locations improved abundance estimates more than increasing PA detection probability. Posterior estimates were as precise and unbiased as when higher quality, but sparse, SCR data were available. We also applied the integrated model to SCR and citizen science PA data collected on black bears in New York, with results consistent with our simulations. Our findings indicate that citizen science in integrated models can be a cost efficient way to improve estimates of population parameters and increase the spatio-temporal extent of inference. Continued developments with integrated models and citizen science data will offer additional ways to improve our understanding of population structure and demographics.

Furthermore, the possible correlations between resistin and insulin, IR, and obesity in patients with CRC and controls were explored.",Misassembly of long reads undermines de novo-assembled ethnicity-specific genomes: validation in a Chinese Han population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168775,Human genetics,2019 06 06,"An ethnicity is characterized by genomic fragments, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and structural variations specific to it. However, the widely used 'standard human reference genome' GRCh37/38 is based on Caucasians. Therefore, de novo-assembled reference genomes for specific ethnicities would have advantages for genetics and precision medicine applications, especially with the long-read sequencing techniques that facilitate genome assembly. In this study, we assessed the de novo-assembled Chinese Han reference genome HX1 vis-Ã -vis the standard GRCh38 for improving the quality of assembly and for ethnicity-specific applications. Surprisingly, all genomic sequencing datasets mapped better to GRCh38 than to HX1, even for the datasets of the Chinese Han population. This gap was mainly due to the massive structural misassembly of the HX1 reference genome rather than the SNPs between the ethnicities, and this misassembly could not be corrected by short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS). For example, HX1 and the other de novo-assembled personal genomes failed to assemble the mitochondrial genome as a contig. We mapped 97.1% of dbSNP, 98.8% of ClinVar, and 97.2% of COSMIC variants to HX1. HX1-absent, non-synonymous ClinVar SNPs were involved in 140 genes and many important functions in various diseases, most of which were due to the assembly failure of essential exons. In contrast, the HX1-specific regions were scantly expressible, as shown in the cell lines and clinical samples of Chinese patients. Our results demonstrated that the de novo-assembled individual genome such as HX1 did not have advantages against the standard GRCh38 genome due to insufficient assembly quality, and that it is, therefore, not recommended for common use.",Skipping of an exon with a nonsense mutation in the DMD gene is induced by the conversion of a splicing enhancer to a splicing silencer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168774,Human genetics,2019 06 06,"Modulation of dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing is an attractive strategy to ameliorate the severe phenotype of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), although this requires a better understanding of the mechanism of splicing regulation. Aberrant splicing caused by gene mutations provides a good model to study splicing regulatory cis-elements and binding proteins. In this study, we identified skipping of in-frame exon 25 induced by a nonsense mutation (NM_004006.2:c.3340Aâ>âT;p.Lys1114*) in the DMD gene. Site-directed mutagenesis study in minigenes suggested that c.3340Aâ>âT converts an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) to a silencer element (ESS). Indeed, RNA pull-down and functional study provided evidence that c.3340Aâ>âT abolishes the binding of the splicing enhancer protein Tra2Î² and promotes interactions with the repressor proteins hnRNP A1, hnRNP A2, and hnRNP H. By carefully analyzing the sequence motif encompassing the mutation site, we concluded that the skipping of exon 25 was due to disruption of a Tra2Î²-dependent ESE and the creation of a new ESS associated with hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2, which in turn increased the recruitment of hnRNP H to a nearby binding site. Finally, we demonstrated that c.3340Aâ>âT impairs the splicing of upstream intron 24 in a splicing minigene assay. In addition, we showed that the correct splicing of exon 25 is finely regulated by multiple splicing regulators that function in opposite directions by binding to closely located ESE and ESS. Our results clarify the detailed molecular mechanism of exon skipping induced by the nonsense mutation c.3340Aâ>âT and also provide information on exon 25 splicing.",[Magnetic resonance imaging following cartilage repair of focal chondral lesions].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168773,Der Radiologe,2019 06 06,"Focal cartilage lesions are common pathologies of weight-bearing joints.

Recently, it is also finding new and important applications in speech pathology and laryngology practices. A High-Resolution Pharyngeal Manometry International Working Group was formed as a grass roots effort to establish a consensus on methodology, protocol, and outcome metrics for high-resolution pharyngeal manometry (HRPM) with consideration of impedance as an adjunct modality. The Working Group undertook three tasks (1) survey what experts were currently doing in their clinical and/or research practice; (2) perform a review of the literature underpinning the value of particular HRPM metrics for understanding swallowing physiology and pathophysiology; and (3) establish a core outcomes set of HRPM metrics via a Delphi consensus process. Expert survey results were used to create a recommended HRPM protocol addressing system configuration, catheter insertion, and bolus administration. Ninety two articles were included in the final literature review resulting in categorization of 22 HRPM-impedance metrics into three classes: pharyngeal lumen occlusive pressures, hypopharyngeal intrabolus pressures, and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function. A stable Delphi consensus was achieved for 8 HRPM-Impedance metrics: pharyngeal contractile integral (CI), velopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal CI, hypopharyngeal pressure at nadir impedance, UES integrated relaxation pressure, relaxation time, and maximum admittance. While some important unanswered questions remain, our work represents the first step in standardization of high-resolution pharyngeal manometry acquisition, measurement, and reporting. This could potentially inform future proposals for an HRPM-based classification system specifically for pharyngeal swallowing disorders.",Insights into transcriptional characteristics and homoeolog expression bias of embryo and de-embryonated kernels in developing grain through RNA-Seq and Iso-Seq.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168755,Functional & integrative genomics,2019 06 06,"Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an allohexaploid, and the transcriptional characteristics of the wheat embryo and endosperm during grain development remain unclear. To analyze the transcriptome, we performed isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) for wheat grain and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) for the embryo and de-embryonated kernels. The differential regulation between the embryo and de-embryonated kernels was found to be greater than the difference between the two time points for each tissue. Exactly 2264 and 4790 tissue-specific genes were found at 14Â days post-anthesis (DPA), while 5166 and 3784 genes were found at 25Â DPA in the embryo and de-embryonated kernels, respectively. Genes expressed in the embryo were more likely to be related to nucleic acid and enzyme regulation. In de-embryonated kernels, genes were rich in substance metabolism and enzyme activity functions. Moreover, 4351, 4641, 4516, and 4453 genes with the A, B, and D homoeoloci were detected for each of the four tissues. Expression characteristics suggested that the D genome may be the largest contributor to the transcriptome in developing grain. Among these, 48, 66, and 38 silenced genes emerged in the A, B, and D genomes, respectively. Gene ontology analysis showed that silenced genes could be inclined to different functions in different genomes. Our study provided specific gene pools of the embryo and de-embryonated kernels and a homoeolog expression bias model on a large scale. This is helpful for providing new insights into the molecular physiology of wheat.",Cost Effectiveness of Mirabegron Compared with Antimuscarinic Agents for the Treatment of Adults with Overactive Bladder in Colombia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168754,PharmacoEconomics - open,2019 06 06,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of mirabegron relative to two antimuscarinics, oxybutynin extended release (ER) and tolterodine ER, in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) from the perspective of a third-party payer in Colombia.",Brain-wide Mapping of Mono-synaptic Afferents to Different Cell Types in the Laterodorsal Tegmentum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168753,Neuroscience bulletin,2019 06 06,"The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brain structure involved in distinct behaviors including arousal, reward, and innate fear. How environmental stimuli and top-down control from high-order sensory and limbic cortical areas converge and coordinate in this region to modulate diverse behavioral outputs remains unclear. Using a modified rabies virus, we applied monosynaptic retrograde tracing to the whole brain to examine the LDT cell type specific upstream nuclei. The LDT received very strong midbrain and hindbrain afferents and moderate cortical and hypothalamic innervation but weak connections to the thalamus. The main projection neurons from cortical areas were restricted to the limbic lobe, including the ventral orbital cortex (VO), prelimbic, and cingulate cortices. Although different cell populations received qualitatively similar inputs, primarily via afferents from the periaqueductal gray area, superior colliculus, and the LDT itself, parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic cells received preferential projections from local LDT neurons. With regard to the different subtypes of GABAergic cells, a considerable number of nuclei, including those of the ventral tegmental area, central amygdaloid nucleus, and VO, made significantly greater inputs to somatostatin-positive cells than to PV+ cells. Diverse inputs to the LDT on a system-wide level were revealed.","Identifying the tick Amblyomma javanense (Acari: Ixodidae) from Chinese pangolin: generating species barcode, phylogenetic status and its implication in wildlife forensics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168752,Experimental & applied acarology,2019 06 06,"Zoonotic diseases transmitted through ticks and other ectoparasites often travel across the globe with illegally traded wildlife parts and products.

Building a genomic resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cassava responses to T. urticae is vital for characterizing cassava resistance to mites. Based on the tolerance of cassava varieties to mite infestation (focusing on mite development rate, fecundity and physiology), cassava variety SC8 was selected to analyze transcriptomic and proteomic changes after 5Â days of T. urticae feeding. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 698 and 2140 genes with significant expression changes under low and high mite infestation, respectively. More defense-related genes were found in the enrichment pathways at high mite density than at low density. In addition, iTRAQ-labeled proteomic analysis revealed 191 proteins with significant expression changes under low mite infestation. Differentially expressed genes and proteins were mainly found in the following defense-related pathways: flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism under low-density mite feeding and plant hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interaction pathways under high-density mite feeding. The plant hormone signal transduction network, involving ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid transduction pathways, was explored in relation to the M. esculenta response to T. urticae. Correlation analysis of the transcriptome and proteome generated a Pearson correlation coefficients of Râ=â0.2953 (Pâ<â0.01), which might have been due to post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation resulting in many genes being inconsistently expressed at both the transcript and protein levels.

Because of scrotal swelling and the patient complaining about pain in the right testicle, we performed a scrotal ultrasound, which demonstrated an enlarged right testicle, with an inhomogeneous echostructure due to the presence of a hypoechoic area in the middle and upper portion of the testicle. Color Doppler ultrasound did not show signals of intralesional vascularization. The lesion, although having characteristics compatible with hematoma, must not be diagnosed as testicular neoplasia, segmental infarction, or other mimics. For more information, a CEUS examination was performed. The examination clearly showed the extent of the lesion, the integrity of the testicular capsule, and the absence of internal vascularization; all these findings were regarded as indicators of a testicular hematoma. After the urological examination, the patient was prescribed antibiotic therapy and bed rest. For further confirmation of the CEUS examination, an MR was performed 2Â days later, showing a perfect correspondence with the CEUS findings. Our case demonstrates that CEUS is a faster, cheaper, and valid alternative to MR in an emergency setting, as in testicular trauma, in which the hematoma may mimic conditions (neoplasm) that require a different treatment.",Evaluating the impact of image guidance in the surgical setting: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168704,Surgical endoscopy,2019 06 06,"Image guidance has been clinically available for over a period of 20Â years.

The objective of this review was to establish the metrics used to report on the impact of surgical image guidance systems used in a clinical setting.",Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody improves efficacy of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein vaccine against Schistosoma japonicum in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168702,Parasitology research,2019 06 06,"Schistosomiasis is a devastating disease caused by Schistosoma infection. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has emerged as a candidate vaccine component against Schistosoma japonicum, but only confers partial protection. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) regulates T cell activation and shows negative effects on vaccine-induced immune protection; however, its potential influence on the protective effects of a GAPDH vaccine against S. japonicum and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we established a mouse model of S. japonicum infection, and the mice were randomly divided into uninfected, infected control, anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (anti-CTLA-4 mAb), GAPDH, and GAPDH combined with anti-CTLA-4 mAb groups to compare the protective effects against infection and the consequent tissue damage. The worm reduction rate in the GAPDH-treated infected mice was 26.58%, which increased to 54.61% when combined with anti-CTLA-4 mAb. The frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly higher in the anti-CTLA-4 mAb group and was lower in the GAPDH group. However, both anti-CTLA-4 mAb and GAPDH elevated the levels of the cytokines IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 in the spleens of infected mice, and their combination further enhanced cytokine production. The diameter of egg granuloma in the anti-CTLA-4 mAb group and combined treatment group increased significantly compared to that of the other groups. These results suggest that anti-CTLA-4 mAb can be used as an adjuvant to enhance the immune protection of the GAPDH vaccine via inducing the Th1 immune response, although this comes at the cost of enhanced body injury.",Linking consumer physiological status to food-web structure and prey food value in the Baltic Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168701,Ambio,2019 06 06,"Declining physiological status in marine top consumers has been observed worldwide. We investigate changes in the physiological status and population/community traits of six consumer species/groups in the Baltic Sea (1993-2014), spanning four trophic levels and using metrics currently operational or proposed as indicators of food-web status. We ask whether the physiological status of consumers can be explained by food-web structure and prey food value. This was tested using partial least square regressions with status metrics for gray seal, cod, herring, sprat and the benthic predatory isopod Saduria as response variables, and abundance and food value of their prey, abundance of competitors and predators as predictors. We find evidence that the physiological status of cod, herring and sprat is influenced by competition, predation, and prey availability; herring and sprat status also by prey size. Our study highlights the need for management approaches that account for species interactions across multiple trophic levels.",Bringing action into the picture. How action influences visual awareness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168700,"Attention, perception & psychophysics",2019 06 06,"This article discusses how the analysis of interactions between action and awareness allows us to better understand the mechanisms of visual awareness. We argue that action is one of several factors that influence visual awareness and we provide a number of examples. We also discuss the possible mechanisms that underlie these influences on both the cognitive and the neural levels. We propose that action affects visual awareness for the following reasons: (1) it serves as additional information in the process of evidence accumulation; (2) it restricts the number of alternatives in the decisional process; (3) it enables error detection and performance monitoring; and (4) it triggers attentional mechanisms that modify stimulus perception. We also discuss the possible neuronal mechanisms of the aforementioned effects, including feedback-dependent prefrontal cortex modulation of the activity of visual areas, error-based modulation, interhemispheric inhibition of motor cortices, and attentional modulation of visual cortex activity triggered by motor processing.",Theory of Event Coding (TEC) V2.0: Representing and controlling perception and action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168699,"Attention, perception & psychophysics",2019 06 06,"This article provides an update of the Theory of Event Coding (TEC), which claims that perception and action are identical processes operating on the same codes - event files consisting of integrated networks of sensorimotor feature codes. The original version of the theory emphasized its representational underpinnings, but recent theoretical developments provide the basis for a more integrated view consisting of both the codes that are shared between perception and action in the control processes operating on these codes. Four developments are discussed in more detail: The degree to which the integration and retrieval of event files depends on current goals, how metacontrol states impact the handling of event files, how feature binding relates to event learning, and how the integration of non-social events relates to the integration of social events. Case examples using various versions of the Simon task are used to explain how the new version of TEC explains interactions between perception and action in non-social and social situations.",Examining Colorectal Cancer Risk Awareness and Food Shelf Use Among Health Center Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168698,Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities,2019 06 06,"To employ the Colorectal Cancer Risk Awareness for Public Health Prevention (CRC-PHP) survey to examine how food shelf use and other covariates predict awareness of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk factors among patients of a Federally Qualified Health Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

By studying the length of time DNA is likely to persist in an environment until detection, a more holistic assessment of DNA evidence in the context of a case can be made. The current study looks at the persistence of DNA from blood, keratinocytes, and several types of mock exhibits under various conditions, in the tropical rainforest climate of Singapore. While DNA on articles left outdoors showed highly variable persistence subject to the presence of rainfall, DNA from items placed indoors at ambient temperature and under controlled temperature and humidity is comparatively stable. The information gathered from this study, while not exhaustive, serves to provide investigators and the courts with a better understanding of the relevance of DNA recovered from crime scenes of different environmental conditions."

The experimental birds received the dietary treatments from 1 to 21Â days of age. The dietary supplementation (g/kg) with commercial probiotic, yoghurt, and SB during the first 21Â days of age did not affect broiler's growth performance variables at day 42, relative weight of immunity organs, blood hematological indices, or the ileal and cecal bacterial counts at day 42, but increased the serum IgG levels and reduced the cecal aerobes at day 21. The probiotic and yoghurt treatments increased the serum content of antibody titer against Newcastle disease virus and decreased the counts of ileal aerobes and E. coli at day 21, whereas the SB treatment increased the ileal lactobacilli count at day 21.

Life sciences,2019 06 06,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in numerous biological processes in plants, including development, responses to environmental stimuli, and programmed cell death (PCD). Deficiency in MOSAIC DEATH 1 (MOD1), a plastid-localized enoyl-ACP reductase essential for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, leads to the increased malate export from chloroplasts to mitochondria, and the subsequent accumulation of mitochondria-generated ROS and PCD. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a mod1 suppressor, som592. SOM592 encodes mitochondrion-localized NAD+ transporter 2 (NDT2). We show that the mitochondrial NAD pool is elevated in the mod1 mutant. The som592 mutation fully suppressed mitochondrial NADH hyper-accumulation, ROS production, and PCD in the mod1 mutant, indicating a causal relationship between mitochondrial NAD accumulation and ROS/PCD phenotypes. We also show that in wild-type plants, the mitochondrial NAD+ uptake is involved in the regulation of ROS production in response to continuous photoperiod. Elevation of the alternative respiration pathway can suppress ROS accumulation and PCD in mod1, but leads to growth restriction. These findings uncover a regulatory mechanism for mitochondrial ROS production via NADH homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana that is likely important for growth regulation in response to altered photoperiod.",Anti-inflammatory activity of extensively hydrolyzed casein is mediated by granzyme B.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168680,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

So far, a completely noninvasive method to access RV stiffness has not been reported. We aimed to clarify the clinical usefulness of our new echocardiographic index of RV operating stiffness using atrial-systolic descent of the pulmonary artery-RV pressure gradient derived from pulmonary regurgitant velocity (PRPGDAC) and tricuspid annular plane movement during atrial contraction (TAPMAC). We studied 81 consecutive patients with various cardiac diseases who underwent echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. We measured PRPGDAC and TAPMAC using continuous-wave Doppler and M-mode echocardiography, respectively, and calculated PRPGDAC/TAPMAC. RV end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP) and RV pressure increase during atrial contraction (ÎRVPAC) were invasively measured, and RV volume change during atrial contraction (ÎVAC) was calculated from echocardiographic late-diastolic transtricuspid flow time-velocity integral and tricuspid annular area; thus ÎRVPAC/ÎVAC was used as the standard index for RV operating stiffness. PRPGDAC/TAPMAC well correlated with ÎRVPAC/ÎVAC (râ=â0.84, pâ<â0.001) and RVEDP (râ=â0.80, pâ<â0.001), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to discriminate RVEDPâ>â12Â mmHg was 0.94.

Skin grafts were irradiated daily for ten consecutive days, starting immediately after the surgery using a red (630Â nm) or near-infrared (850Â nm) LED. The results showed that the red wavelength LED significantly enhanced the skin graft score in relation to the NIR group and increased transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) protein expression and density of collagen fibers compared with the other experimental groups. These results suggest that the red wavelength LED was efficient to improve the dermo-epidermal junction and modulate the expression proteins related to tissue repair.",Presbyopic lens exchange (PRELEX) cataract surgery outcomes with implantation of a rotationally asymmetric refractive multifocal intraocular lens: femtosecond laser-assisted versus manual phacoemulsification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168677,International ophthalmology,2019 06 06,To compare the visual and refractive outcomes obtained with the implantation of a rotationally asymmetric refractive multifocal IOL after femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and conventional lens extraction (CLE).,Vitamin D3 Release from Traditionally and Additively Manufactured Tricalcium Phosphate Bone Tissue Engineering Scaffolds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168676,Annals of biomedical engineering,2019 06 06,"Bone is a randomized, complex porous network which researchers have tried to mimic within bone tissue engineering scaffolds.

Results showed the naphthalene scaffold surface area was only 0.3% that of 3D printed scaffolds due to the lower open pore interconnectivity. This increase in surface area produced higher release of drug and osteoblast proliferation in 3D printed scaffolds comparatively. By 11Â days, osteoblast proliferation was enhanced by 64% from scaffolds manufactured using 3D printing compared to traditional processing.

Ausg. A,2019 06 06,"The current version of the urology training program will concentrate on the mediation of competences and skills in various fields of action for outpatient urology instead of persisting on the minimum and reference numbers of surgical and diagnostic procedures. However, the following fields of action must be fulfilled: microbiology, andrology and systemic cancer therapy. There is justifiable concern that various institutions will lose their permission for aÂ complete 5âyear residency program based on the above-mentioned demands since not all institutions have all subspecialties in urology. Those institutions need to define new ways of residency training such as interdisciplinary programs within their own institution between disciplines like pediatric surgery, gynecology and medical oncology. Other options are combined training programs between regional urology departments with different main focuses or training programs between institutions and urologists in private practice. There is an unmet need to improve residency training as well as board examinations by new structures and aÂ reliable curriculum. Based on the changed main focuses of the new version of urology training, we need to discuss the future of residency programs. It might be helpful to discuss two different types of urology training with aÂ common trunk for the first three years followed by aÂ more outpatient-based residency training for the general urologist and aÂ more specialized training for the inpatient urologist to be educated in complex treatment modalities.

After 7-21Â days, histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the morphology and extracellular matrix was performed. While the dermis remained robust in all explants cultures, keratinocytes seeded on the papillary layer showed less tissue infiltration and remodelling and formed clusters across the tissue. In contrast, keratinocytes seeded on the reticular layer infiltrated the tissue homogenously with an intact single-cell-layer surface coverage and structural changes characterised by increased deposition of ground substance, glycosaminoglycans, and collagen VII in 14Â days. In addition, while the papillary section showed more new laminin deposition by 14Â days than the reticular section, the latter expressed more connexin 43.

This study aimed to elucidate whether combined assessment of LA functional and structural remodeling can predict LAA dysfunction and recurrent cerebrovascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We performed transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in 196 patients within 7Â days after acute ischemic stroke. Peak systolic LA strain was evaluated using 2D speckle tracking imaging. We defined the ratio of LA peak systolic strain to LA volume index (LAVI) as the LA remodeling index (LARI). All patients were prospectively followed for recurrent cerebrovascular events. We divided patients into four groups according based on the LARI quartile. LAA dysfunction increased with decreasing LARI. In total, 52 recurrent cerebrovascular events were noted during the median follow-up period of 700Â days.

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with lower LARI were more susceptible to recurrent cerebrovascular events than those with higher LARI. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that LARI was an independent predictor of recurrent cerebrovascular events after adjustment for confounding factors. Net reclassification index improved with the addition of LARI to basic predictors. LARI is a novel feasible parameter for LAA dysfunction and can predict recurrent cerebrovascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke.",Efficacy of linked colour imaging in magnifying chromoendoscopy with crystal violet staining: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168654,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 06 14,Diagnosis of the depth of invasion is crucial in the endoscopic management of early colorectal cancer.

In this study, we found that the deletion of the SRS2 gene, which encodes a DNA helicase necessary for the control of homologous recombination, induces aberrant chromosome segregation during budding yeast meiosis. This abnormal chromosome segregation in srs2 cells accompanies the formation of a novel DNA damage induced during late meiotic prophase I. The damage may contain long stretches of single-stranded DNAs (ssDNAs), which lead to aggregate formation of a ssDNA binding protein, RPA, and a RecA homolog, Rad51, as well as other recombination proteins inside of the nuclei, but not that of a meiosis-specific Dmc1. The Rad51 aggregate formation in the srs2 mutant depends on the initiation of meiotic recombination and occurs in the absence of chromosome segregation. Importantly, as an early recombination intermediate, we detected a thin bridge of Rad51 between two Rad51 foci in the srs2 mutant, which is rarely seen in wild type. These might be cytological manifestation of the connection of two DSB ends and/or multi-invasion. The DNA damage with Rad51 aggregates in the srs2 mutant is passed through anaphases I and II, suggesting the absence of DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest after the pachytene stage. We propose that Srs2 helicase resolves early protein-DNA recombination intermediates to suppress the formation of aberrant lethal DNA damage during late prophase I.",Identification of predictive factors for overall survival at baseline and during azacitidine treatment in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome patients treated in the clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168652,Annals of hematology,2019 06 06,"The outcome of high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients treated with 5-azacitidine (5-AZA) in the real-life setting remains largely unknown.

Ethanol is postulated to provide an alternative energy source, enabling effective use of glucose for cellulose biosynthesis rather than for energy acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the effect of ethanol supplementation on the global gene expression profile of Komagataeibacter xylinus E25 using RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq). We demonstrate that when ethanol is present in the culture medium, glucose metabolism is directed towards cellulose production due to the induction of genes related to UDP-glucose formation and the repression of genes involved in glycolysis and acetan biosynthesis. Transcriptional changes in the pathways of cellulose biosynthesis and c-di-GMP metabolism are also described. The transcript level profiles suggest that Schramm-Hestrin medium supplemented with ethanol promotes bacterial growth by inducing protein biosynthesis and iron uptake. We observed downregulation of genes encoding transposases of the IS110 family which may provide one line of evidence explaining the positive effect of ethanol supplementation on the genotypic stability of K. xylinus E25. The results of this study increase knowledge and understanding of the regulatory effects imposed by ethanol on cellulose biosynthesis, providing new opportunities for directed strain improvement, scaled-up bionanocellulose production, and wider industrial exploitation of the Komagataeibacter species as bacterial cellulose producers.",Prophylactic effects of probiotic Bifidobacterium spp. in the resolution of inflammation in arthritic rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168650,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 06 06,"In the present study, the modulatory effects of bifidobacterial spp. (Bifidobacterium breve NCIM 5671, Bifidobacterium longum NCIM 5672 and Bifidobacterium bifidum NCIM 5697) on adjuvant induced arthritis in rats were evaluated. Arthritis was induced in male Wistar rats by injecting 250Â Î¼g of Freund's adjuvant directly into the paw. Fifteen days before and 15Â days after the induction of arthritis, suspended cultures of bifidobacteria (109Â cfu/ml) were administered by oral gavage. Paw volume, bone mineral content, oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, cytokines, eicosanoids and expression of COX2, as well as bone hydrolytic enzymes, were assessed by RT PCR. Although piroxicam-treated groups (drug control) had better effects than bifidobacteria-treated groups, bifidobacteria probiotics administration exhibited significant (Pâ<â0.05) prophylactic effects in terms of downregulating arthritis markers. Parameters including paw volume, bone mineral content, cytokines, and eicosanoids level were significantly (pâ<â0.05) modulated in bifidobacteria administered groups compared to arthritic control group. Among the three strains tested, B. breve NCIM 5671 exhibited superior prophylactic effects as assessed in the experimental rat model of arthritis. In conclusion, bifidobacteria probiotics administration can downregulate the markers of arthritis and hence can be a potential therapeutic regimen in the treatment of arthritis."

Nodulation, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) presence and the genetic diversity of rhizobia were evaluated by 16S-ITS-23S-RFLP patterns and by sequencing. The bean rhizobial population in the region was diverse, despite its geographic isolation. No biogeographic relationships were detected, apart from a Rhizobium tropici-related strain that originated from an acidic soil. No clear pattern was detected in clustering with bean species and all isolates formed nodules with both bean species. Most strains were related to Rhizobium leguminosarum and a number of isolates were falling outside the already characterized species of genus Rhizobium. Application of heavy fertilization has resulted in high soil N and P levels, which most likely reduced nodulation and AMF spore presence.

The isolate grew in both aliphatic- and aromatic hydrocarbon-amended Bushnell-Haas medium (BHM). When incubated in 1% (v/v) Assam crude oil-amended BHM for 5 and 10Â days, this strain was able to degrade 88% and 99.8% of the n-hexane extractable crude oil components, respectively. The isolate showed appreciable emulsification index (E24 65.26âÂ±â1.2%), hydrophobicity (60.88âÂ±â3.5%) and produced lipopeptide biosurfactant (0.57Â g L-1). The isolate was able to tolerate heavy metal salts at concentrations reported in crude oil-polluted sediments from Assam.

The etiology of CTS is multifactorial, involving both personal and occupational risk factors. To date, few prospective cohort studies on occupational risk factors of CTS have examined the general working population. Methods The study population consisted of participants from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort of 1966 who attended the 31-year follow-up in 1997 and were working â¥3 days a week in a paid job (N=6326). Information on socio-economic status, weight and height, smoking, exposure to occupational physical factors, and long-term illnesses was collected at baseline in 1997. Data on hospitalizations due to CTS came from the Care Register for Health Care, 1997-2016. Results Between 1997 and 2016, 3.4% of the participants had been hospitalized (attended secondary care) for CTS. After adjusting for confounders, women [hazard ratio (HR) 3.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.70-5.25], overweight/obese participants (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.29-2.22), smokers (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.12-1.96), farmers and manual workers (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.85-4.92 compared with upper clerical workers), lower clerical workers (HR 1.74, 95% CI=1.08-2.80), workers exposed to hand vibration (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.48-3.54) and participants with physically demanding jobs (HR 1.71, CI 1.06-2.76) were at increased risk of hospitalization for CTS. Physically demanding work increased the risk of hospitalization for CTS for overweight/obese participants at baseline, but not for participants of normal weight. Conclusions Excess body mass and occupational physical factors increase the risk of hospitalization for CTS. Excess body mass potentiates the adverse effects of strenuous work on CTS.",Healthcare use before and after changing disability pension policy: a regional Danish cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168632,European journal of public health,2019 06 06,The social security policy for disability pension (DP) was changed in Denmark in 2013 and eligibility requirements were tightened.

Many factors, such as diets, life stages, host habitats can influence microbial community structure. In this study, the diversity of bacterial communities in the gut of housefly larvae fed on different artificial diets was comprehensively characterized using high-throughput sequencing with the aim shedding light on an optimal larval diet. The results showed that the dominant bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes phyla were related to polysaccharide degradation. The comparative analysis indicated that the dominant intestinal bacteria of larvae fed on high-protein were similar to those on high-fat diet. The same was the case in larvae fed high-starch diet and wheat bran alone. In addition, the diversity of intestinal bacteria at genus level in larvae fed high-protein and high-fat diet was higher than in larvae fed the other two diets. Further analysis indicated that the increase of potential commensals and decrease of pathogens in larvae fed on high-fat diet contributed to the increase of housefly larvae immunity. It established a foundation for further research on improvement of nutrition of housefly larvae used for poultry and fish feed.","A hierarchical view of gecko locomotion: photic environment, physiological optics, and locomotor performance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168628,Integrative and comparative biology,2019 06 06,"Terrestrial animals constantly move in complex habitats that vary both spatially and temporally. The characteristics of these habitats are not only defined by the physical environment, but also the photic environment even though the latter has largely been overlooked. Numerous studies of terrestrial locomotion have examined the role of habitat structure, such as incline, perch diameter, and compliance, on running performance, yet the role of the photic environment is vastly understudied. Geckos are an exceptional group for analyzing the role of the photic environment on locomotion as they exhibit several independent shifts to diurnality from a nocturnal ancestor, they are visually-guided predators, and they are extremely diverse. Our initial goal is to discuss the range of photic environments that can be encountered in terrestrial habitats, such as day versus night, canopy cover in a forest, fog, and clouds. We then review the physiological optics of gecko vision with some new information about retina structures, the role of vision in motor-driven behaviors, and what is known about gecko locomotion under different light conditions, before demonstrating the effect of light levels on gecko locomotor performance. Overall, we highlight the importance of integrating sensory and motor information and establish a conceptual framework as guide for future research. Several future directions, such as understanding the role of pupil dynamics, are dependent on an integrative framework. This general framework can be extended to any motor system that relies on sensory information, and can be used to explore the impacts of performance features on diversification and evolution.","Cumulative childhood adversity, adolescent psychiatric disorder and violent offending in young adulthood.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168626,European journal of public health,2019 06 06,"Childhood adversity (CA) is a risk indicator for psychiatric morbidity.

Many studies regarding this have involved males. We, therefore, have focused our attention on females, especially postmenopausal females, who typically have limited supplies of estrogen. By using sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) transgenic mice, we produced a humanoid environment, and facilitated deposition and modulation of sex-hormones. After exposure to diethylnitrosamine to induce HCC and upon reaching the age of 40 weeks, mice were fed the fat-rich diet for five months. Fat-rich diet fed or ovariectomized (OVX) WT mice aged 62 weeks showed HCC progression, whereas fat-rich diet fed SHBG mice or OVX SHBG mice displayed fewer tumors. In the liver of fat-rich diet fed SHBG mice, estrogenic conditions including high levels of 17Î²-estradiol and estrogen receptor alpha led to the induction of the lipogenesis inhibitor, phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and consequently suppressed fatty liver. The presence of plasma SHBG in HCC bearing mice suppressed the levels of steatosis and inflammation in a process mediated by estrogens and estrogen receptor alpha. Conversely, in the liver of OVX SHBG mice, lipogenic inhibition was also observed under conditions where the supply of estrogens is limited. Through in vitro experiment, it was confirmed SHBG suppresses lipogenesis via inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase level. In conclusion, our results show that plasma SHBG might have a clinical impact on lipid-mediated hepatic diseases.",Peroxidase from proso millet exhibits endonuclease-like activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168624,Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,2019 06 06,"In this study, the mechanism of DNA cleavage by cationic peroxidase from proso millet (PmPOD) was investigated. PmPOD cleaved supercoiled circular DNA into both nicked circular and linear forms via a cleavage mechanism that resembles those of native endonucleases. Inhibition and ligation studies demonstrated that reactive oxygen species and the ferriprotoporphyrin IX moiety in PmPOD are not involved in PmPOD-mediated DNA cleavage. Similar to other endonucleases, Mg ions considerably enhance the DNA cleavage activity of PmPOD. Further studies suggested that PmPOD can disrupt phosphodiester bonds in DNA and mononucleotides, indicating that it is a phosphatase. The phosphatase activity of PmPOD is higher than that of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), but the peroxidase activity of PmPOD was lower than that of HRP. PmPOD-mediated hydrolytic cleavage of DNA observed in this study is different from those reported for heme proteins. This study provides valuable insights into the distinct mechanisms underlying DNA cleavage by heme proteins.",Distinct influence of omega-3 fatty acids on the plasma metabolome of healthy older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168623,"The journals of gerontology.

With the goal of gaining new insight into some less well-characterized biological effects of n3-PUFAs in healthy older adults, we performed metabolomics of fasting peripheral blood plasma collected from 12 young adults and 12 older adults before and after an open-label intervention of n3-PUFA (3.9g/day, 2.7g EPA, 1.2g DHA). Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) based lipoprotein subclass analysis revealed the expected reduction in total TG, but also demonstrated that n3-PUFA supplementation reduced VLDL particle number, modestly increased HDL cholesterol, and shifted the composition of HDL subclasses. Further metabolite profiling by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry revealed pronounced changes in phospholipids, cholesterol esters, diglycerides, and triglycerides following n3-PUFA supplementation. Furthermore, significant changes in hydroxyproline, kynurenine, and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPF) following n3-PUFA supplementation provide further insight into some less well-recognized biological effects of n3-PUFA supplementation, including possible effects on protein metabolism, the kynurenine pathway, and glucose metabolism."

For decades, the performance and ultimate decline of mitochondria have been implicated in the demise of somatic tissue, but exactly why mitochondrial function declines as individuals age has remained elusive. A possible source of decline that has been of intense debate is mutations to the mitochondrial DNA. There are two primary sources of such mutations: oxidative damage, which is widely discussed by ecologists interested in aging, and mitochondrial replication error, which is less familiar to most ecologists. The goal of this review is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to the concept of mitochondrial replication error and to review the current status of research on the relative importance of replication error in senescence. We conclude by detailing some of the gaps in our knowledge that currently make it difficult to deduce the relative importance of replication error in wild populations and encourage organismal biologists to consider this variable both when interpreting their results and as viable measure to include in their studies.",Joint contribution of rotation of the back and repetitive movements to disability pension using job exposure matrix data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168605,European journal of public health,2019 06 06,"Heavy physical effort at work has been linked with disability pension, but the contribution of other ergonomic job exposures is less studied.

However, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), which plays a vital role in the anchoring of insulin granules on pancreatic Î² cell membrane, is probably a downstream of the transcription factor PPAR-Î³. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation among PPAR-Î³, CASK and insulin secretion. We found that rosiglitazone (RSG) had a positive effect on the expression of CASK and PPAR-Î³ in INS-1 cells as shown by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot analysis, but did not change the cellular location of CASK as shown by immunofluorescence assay. Knockdown of PPAR-Î³ significantly attenuated the mRNA and protein expression levels of CASK. ChIP-qPCR and luciferase assays showed that PPAR-Î³ bound with the Cask promoter, and promoter activity of Cask was elevated by RSG. RSG significantly enhanced the insulin secretion with potassium stimulation, but did not alter the insulin content as shown by potassium-stimulated insulin secretion assay. In addition, with RSG pretreatment, knockdown of Cask did not significantly affect the PPAR-Î³ activation-mediated insulin secretion. Moreover, electron microscopy demonstrated that with RSG pretreatment, silence of Cask did not change the number of vesicles anchored on the cell membranes compared with those in siCask-treated cells. Overall, the present study identifies that CASK is one of the PPAR-Î³ downstream targets and PPAR-Î³ exerts a positive effect on the expression of CASK in INS-1 cells.

However, due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, it is extremely challenging to decipher the exact combinations of genes that trigger the epistatic effects. Many existing methods only focus on two-way interactions. Some of the most effective methods used machine learning techniques, but many were designed for special case-and-control studies or suffer from overfitting. We propose three new algorithms for multi-effect and multi-way epistases detection, with one guaranteeing global optimality and the other two being local optimization oriented heuristics.",Picropodophyllin inhibits type I endometrial cancer cell proliferation via disruption of the PI3K/Akt pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168597,Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,2019 06 06,"The type-I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) is overexpressed in endometrial cancer. High IGF-IR expression was considered as an important prognostic factor for tumor progression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of IGF-IR inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) in the growth and development of endometrial cancer. High expression of IGF-IR was observed in endometrial cancer tissues, as well as in ECC-1 and KLE cell lines. PPP suppressed the number of clones of ECC-1 and KLE cell lines; however, it had no significant effect on HEC-1-A cell line, which expressed lower IGF-IR than ECC-1 and KLE cell lines. Furthermore, PPP reduced cell proliferation capacity, inhibited the IGF-IR mRNA expression, and suppressed protein phosphorylation of IGF-IR and Akt in the three cell lines. In addition, PPP inhibited the protein expression of survivin in KLE cell line after 1Â h of exposure, though this effect did not last for prolonged time. In conclusion, IGF-IR was mostly overexpressed in type I endometrial cancer. High IGF-IR expression was an important prognostic factor of tumor progression. PPP mediated the down-regulation of IGF-IR phosphorylation and inhibited cell proliferation via the PI3K/Akt signal pathway. PPP may have the potential to become a clinical treatment target in endometrial carcinoma.",Comparison between lymph node station- and zone-based classification for the future revision of node descriptors proposed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer in surgically resected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168596,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019 06 06,"The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) proposed further subdivisions of pathological N1 (pN1) and pN2 by including the location and the number of involved lymph node (LN) stations.

Engaging communities that are considered disadvantaged and marginalized in priority-setting is essential to making their voices and concerns visible in global health research projects' topics and questions. However, without attention to power dynamics, their engagement can often lead to presence without voice and voice without influence. Global health research priority-setting must be designed to share power with such communities to ensure that research projects' topics and questions reflect the health care and system inequities they face. To better understand what sharing 'power over' priority-setting requires, 29 in-depth, semi-structured interviews and one focus group were undertaken with researchers, ethicists, community engagement practitioners and community-based organization staff. The study shows that, before moving ahead with priority-setting for global health research projects, it is vital to assess whether contextual factors necessary for meaningful engagement between researchers and marginalized communities are present or can be built in the research setting. Study findings describe several such contextual factors and 12 features of priority-setting that affect how processes are run, who participates in them, and who influences their outputs. During priority-setting for global health research projects, it is essential to implement ways of sharing power with communities in relation to these features. Study findings describe a multitude of such strategies that are employed in practice. After priority-setting, it is important to demonstrate respect and accountability to communities.",Identification and characterization of BoPUB3: a novel interaction protein with S-locus receptor kinase in Brassica oleracea L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168565,Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,2019 06 06,"Armadillo repeat containing 1 (ARC1) is phosphorylated by S-locus receptor kinase (SRK) and functions as a positive regulator in self-incompatibility response of Brassica. However, ARC1 only causes partial breakdown of the self-incompatibility response, and other SRK downstream factors may also participate in the self-incompatibility signaling pathway. In the present study, to search for SRK downstream targets, a plant U-box protein 3 (BoPUB3) was identified from the stigma of Brassica oleracea L. BoPUB3 was highly expressed in the stigma, and its expression was increased with the stigma development and reached to the highest level in the mature-stage stigma. BoPUB3, a 76.8-kDa protein with 697 amino acids, is a member of the PUB-ARM family and contains three domain characteristics of BoARC1, including a U-box N-terminal domain, a U-box motif, and a C-terminal arm repeat domain. The phylogenic tree showed that BoPUB3 was close to BoARC1. The synteny analysis revealed that B. oleracea chromosomal region containing BoPUB3 had high synteny with the Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomal region containing AtPUB3 (At3G54790). In addition, the subcellular localization analysis showed that BoPUB3 primarily localized in the plasma membrane and also in the cytoplasm. The combination of the yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assay showed that both BoPUB3 and BoARC1 could interact with SRK kinase domain, and SRK showed much higher level of Î²-galactosidase activity in its interaction with BoPUB3 than with BoARC1. These results implied that BoPUB3 is a novel interactor with SRK, which lays a basis for further research on whether PUB3 participates in the self-incompatibility signaling pathway.",Association of Antiviral Therapy With Risk of Parkinson Disease in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168563,JAMA neurology,2019 06 06,"Epidemiologic evidence suggests that hepatitis C virus (HCV) could be a risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD), but treatment for HCV infection has never been considered in these studies; hence, the association between antiviral therapy and PD incidence has remained unclear.

Identification of factors that promote the expression of ectopic bone genes- process known as osteomimicry- leading to tumor progression is crucial to prevent and treat metastatic prostate cancer and prolong life expectancy for patients. Here, we identify the extracelular matrix protein mindin in the secretome of prostate adenocarcinoma cells and show that mindin overexpression in human and mouse TRAMP-C1-induced prostate tumors correlates with upregulated levels of bone-related genes in the tumorigenic prostate tissues. Moreover, mindin silencing decreased osteomimicry in adenocarcinoma cells and in the prostate tumor mice model, as well as reduced tumor cell proliferation, migration and adhesion to bone cells. Inhibition of the ERK 1/2 kinase phosphorylation decreased the proliferative, migratory and pro-adhesion actions of mindin on prostate tumor cells. In addition, conditioned media obtained by crosstalk stimulation of either osteocytes or osteoblasts with the secretome of TRAMP-C1 cells promoted osteomimicry in prostate tumor cells; an effect inhibited by mindin silencing of TRAMP-C1 cells. In vivo, tibiae of primary tumor-bearing mice overexpressed the pro-angiogenic and pro-metastattic factor VEGFR2 in a mindin-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that mindin is a novel regulator of osteomimicry in prostate tumors and potentially mediates tumor-bone cell crosstalk, suggesting its promising role as a target to inhibit bone metastases.",Equations of the state of hard sphere fluids based on recent accurate virial coefficients B5-B12.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168560,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 10,"By using the recently published simulation data for the compressibility factor (M.

Here, we show that the bis(2-pyridyl)methane ligand, also known as dipyridylmethane or dpma, can support [Cp*Rh] complexes in the formally +iii and +ii rhodium oxidation states. Specifically, two new rhodium complexes ([Cp*Rh(dpma)(L)]n+, L = Cl-, CH3CN) have been isolated and structurally characterized, and the properties of the complexes have been compared with those of [Cp*Rh] complexes bearing the related dimethyldipyridylmethane (Me2dpma) ligand. Complex [Cp*Rh(dpma)(NCCH3)]2+ displays a quasireversible rhodium(iii/ii) reduction by cyclic voltammetry; related electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic studies confirm access to the unusual rhodium(ii) oxidation state. Further reduction to the formally rhodium(i) oxidation state, however, is followed by deprotonation of dpma, as observed in electrochemical studies and chemical reduction experiments. This reactivity can be understood to occur as a consequence of the presence of doubly benzylic protons in the dpma ligand, since use of the analogous Me2dpma enables reduction to rhodium(i) without involvement of ligand deprotonation. These findings highlight the important role of the ligand backbone substitution pattern in influencing the stability of highly-reduced complexes, a key class of metal species for study of electron and proton management in catalysis.",Protein film electrochemical EPR spectroscopy as a technique to investigate redox reactions in biomolecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168558,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 06,"Redox reactions and paramagnetic intermediates are ubiquitous in biological chemistry.

In biological systems, management of defects/errors (e.g. DNA repair) is critical to an organism's survival, which has inspired the design of artificial nanomachines that mimic nature's ability to detect defects and repair damage. Biological motors have captured considerable attention in developing such capabilities due to their ability to convert energy into directed motion in response to environmental stimuli, which maximizes their ability for detection and repair. The objective of the present study was to develop an understanding of how the presence of non-bonding domains, here considered as a ""defect"", in microtubule (MT) building blocks affect the kinesin-driven, active assembly of MT spools. The assembly/joining of micron-scale bonding (i.e., biotin-containing) and non-bonding (i.e., no biotin) MTs resulted in segmented MT building blocks consisting of alternating bonding and non-bonding domains. Here, the introduction of these MT building blocks into a kinesin gliding motility assay along with streptavidin-coated quantum dots resulted in the active assembly of spools with altered morphology but retained functionality. Moreover, it was noted that non-bonding domains were autonomously and preferentially released from the spools over time, representing a mechanism by which defects may be removed from these structures. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this active assembly system has an intrinsic ability for quality control, which can be potentially expanded to a wide range of applications such as self-regulation and healing of active materials.",Cation diffusion patterns across the magneto-structural transition in Fe7S8.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168544,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 06,"Migration of atoms in solids during diffusion-dependent reactions is relatively fast and generally not directly recordable in experiments. Here we present an experimental framework that includes fast differential scanning calorimetry to resolve cation-migration paths in crystalline solids using the reversible magneto-structural transition of 4C to 1C pyrrhotite as a testbed. The transition between these two polymorphic Fe7S8 phases at about 600 K is a diffusive process of vacancies, respectively of Fe in octahedral interstitial sites within a hexagonal close-packed lattice of sulfur, and it coincides with the Curie temperature of 4C pyrrhotite. The Fe cations migrate along three kinds of diffusion paths, and their enthalpy contributions to the total reaction enthalpy are taken to define the diffusion patterns in the endothermic reaction and the exothermic back-reaction, respectively. Our experimental findings provide insight into the potential of diffusion patterns to disentangle ordering mechanisms in solids.",Three-dimensional yielding in anisotropic materials: validation of Hill's criterion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168543,Soft matter,2019 06 06,"Yielding transition in isotropic soft materials under the superposition of orthogonal deformation fields is known to follow von Mises' criterion. However, in anisotropic soft materials, von Mises' criterion fails owing to the preferred directions associated with the system. In this work we study a model anisotropic yield stress system: electrorheological (ER) fluids which show structural formation in the direction of an electric field. We subject the ER fluids to the superposition of orthogonal stress fields which leads to different yield stress values. We obtain a yielding state diagram by plotting the normalized rotational shear stress against the normalized radial shear stress corresponding to a yield point for a given electric field. Remarkably, the state diagram validates the Hill yielding criterion, which is a general yielding criterion for materials with anisotropy along three orthogonal directions, originally developed for metallic systems. Validation of Hill's criterion suggests the universality of its application in anisotropic systems including conventional anisotropic soft materials having yield stress.",Dimers of glutaredoxin 2 as mitochondrial redox sensors in selenite-induced oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168542,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,2019 06 06,"Glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) has been previously shown to link thioredoxin and glutathione systems receiving reducing equivalents by both thioredoxin reductase and glutathione. Grx2 catalyzes protein glutathionylation/de-glutathionylation and can coordinate an iron-sulfur cluster, forming inactive dimers stabilized by two molecules of glutathione. This protein is mainly located in the mitochondrial matrix, though other isoforms have been found in the cytosolic and nuclear cell compartments. In the present study, we have analyzed the monomeric and dimeric states of Grx2 under different redox conditions in HeLa cells, and sodium selenite was utilized as the principal oxidizing agent. After selenite treatment, an increased glutathione oxidation was associated to Grx2 monomerization and activation, specifically in the mitochondrial compartment. Interestingly, in mitochondria, a large decline of thioredoxin reductase activity was also observed concomitantly to Grx2 activity stimulation. In addition, Grx2 monomerization led to an increase free iron ions concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, induction of lipid peroxidation and decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that the disassembly of Grx2 dimer involved the release of the iron-sulfur cluster in the mitochondrial matrix. Moreover, sodium selenite-triggered lipid and protein oxidation was partially prevented by deferiprone, an iron chelator with mitochondriotropic properties, suggesting a role of the iron-sulfur cluster release in the observed impairment of mitochondrial functions. Thus, by sensing the overall cellular redox conditions, mitochondrial Grx2 dimers become active monomers upon oxidative stress induced by sodium selenite with the consequent release of the iron-sulfur cluster, leading to activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.",Shear-thinning hyaluronan-based fluid hydrogels to modulate viscoelastic properties of osteoarthritis synovial fluids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168540,Biomaterials science,2019 06 06,"Hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA) has been extensively explored as an attractive biomaterial for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications due to its unique physiological properties. In particular, HA is a major component of synovial fluid in normal knee joints and provides viscoelastic properties to synovial fluid. In osteoarthritic joints, synovial fluid loses its unique viscoelastic and lubrication properties. Intra-articular injection of HA in osteoarthritic knee joints is believed to restore viscoelasticity and lubrication abilities to synovial fluid. However, the main drawback of HA is its rapid degradation in synovial fluid. In order to overcome the problem of rapid clearance of HA, a HA-based hydrogel (vinyl sulfone-modified HA crosslinked by dithiol-terminated poly(ethylene glycol), HA-VS/SH-2-PEG) was synthesized in this study. Injectable fluid hydrogels (viscosupplements) possessing tunable viscoelasticity and controllable degradation rates were then prepared by adding HA-VS/SH-2-PEG microgels to HA solutions. The resultant viscosupplements exhibit enhanced viscoelastic properties, lubrication effects, efficient triamcinolone acetonide payload capacity, and high resistance to enzymatic degradation along with good biocompatibility and the capability to inhibit the progression of osteoarthritis in vivo. Overall, the results provide support for the use of injectable fluid hydrogels as a strategy for the treatment of osteoarthritis and potential for the clinical translation.",Modulating effects of polysaccharides from the fruits of Lycium barbarum on the immune response and gut microbiota in cyclophosphamide-treated mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168539,Food & function,2019 06 06,"In the present study, the effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPS) on immunoregulation and gut microbiota dysbiosis in cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced mice were investigated to elucidate whether the attenuation of immunosuppression is related to the modulation of the gut microbiota. The results showed that administration of LBPS could protect immune organs (enhancing immune organ indexes and alleviating immune organ damage), enhance the production of immune-related cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and IFN-Î³) and prevent the hepatotoxicity in CTX-induced mice. Additionally, LBPS treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty acids and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota, increasing the relative abundances of Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Prevotellaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae, which were positively associated with immune traits. The present results indicated that LBPS might regulate the immune response depending on the modulation of the gut microbiota, suggesting that LBPS could be developed as special ingredients for immunoregulation in association with the modulation of the gut microbiota.",Ameliorative effect of fermentable fibres on adiposity and insulin resistance in C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat and sucrose diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168538,Food & function,2019 06 06,"The consumption of diets rich in fat and refined sugars is recognized to be one of the causes of lifestyle disorders, and dietary fibres are being advocated to ameliorate the complications associated with these disorders. In the present study, the effects of two soluble fermentable fibres, viz., gum acacia and inulin on the progression of adiposity, insulin resistance, and the expression of genes related to metabolism were examined in C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat and sucrose diet for 18 weeks. The feeding of either type of fibre resulted in decrease in body weight, epididymal fat mass, adipocyte size, hyperlipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinemia. In the fibre-fed groups, the expressions of adiponectin and glucose transporter 4 in the epididymal fat increased significantly, while the expressions of leptin, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha decreased significantly. Moreover, the expressions of genes related to beta-oxidation, viz., carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1Î², and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in the liver tissue of the fibre-fed groups enhanced significantly. Furthermore, due to the feeding of either type of fibre, the expressions of zonula occludens 1 and fasting-induced adipose factor in the distal ileum and proglucagon in the colon increased significantly. From the results of the present study, it can be concluded that the beneficial effects of the fibres are mediated due to enhanced energy expenditure, improved intestinal integrity, and reduced inflammation.",A theoretical approach to the role of different types of electrons in planar elongated boron clusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168537,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 06 06,"We analyze the thermodynamic stability of some small elongated boron clusters and confirm the relationship between their planarity and their inherent electron configuration [â¦Ï2(n+1) Ï12(n+1) Ï22n].

Florida Conference on Recent Advances in Robotics,2019 06 10,"Soft Robotic Actuators (SRAs) have piqued the interest of researchers in recent years. SRAs are generally constructed of soft elastomers and use air or water as a mean of actuation. Due to the inherent properties of these actuators, they are ideal for HumanRobot Interactions (HRI), exoskeletons for rehabilitation and for grasping delicate objects. Since SRA's are actuated using a fluid, being able to effectively control the rate of actuation, pressure and the force applied is necessary so that the actuator and the object being grasped does not get damaged. This paper aims to evaluate three types of controllers, an open-loop controller, pressure-feedback controller, and a force-feedback controller, all used to control an SRA. A custom test stand was built to hold the SRA and test it with all three controllers. The pressure-feedback controller was set to limit the pressure to 8.9 kPa and the force was limited to 0.147 N in the force-feedback controller. Since the open-loop controller had no feedback, the SRA was actuated at a specified frequency while force and pressure measurements were taken. The force-feedback and the pressure-feedback controllers accurately controlled the actuators and the open loop-controller was able to actuate the SRA reliably.",Inverted Perovskite Photovoltaics Using Flame Spray Pyrolysis Solution Based CuAlO2/Cu-O Hole-Selective Contact.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168522,ACS applied energy materials,2019 06 10,We present the functionalization process of a conductive and transparent CuAlO2/Cu-O hole-transporting layer (HTL).

Hospital teaching status is an institutional factor found to be predictive of outcomes following several complex procedures; however, its impact on outcomes following TIPS is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the association between hospital teaching status and long-term survival in patients with cirrhosis receiving TIPS. We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study using linked administrative health data from Ontario, Canada. Adult patients with cirrhosis who received TIPS between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2016, with follow-up until December 31, 2017, were included. Hospital teaching status was defined based on hospital participation in the instruction of medical students and/or resident physicians. Liver transplant-free (LTF) survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and overall survival was assessed using competing risks regression analysis, which accounted for hospital clustering. A total of 857 unique patients were included (mean age 57.1Â years; 69.1% male). The TIPS procedures were performed in teaching hospitals (84.3%) as well as nonteaching hospitals (15.7%). Median LTF survival was more than twice as long for procedures performed in teaching hospitals compared to nonteaching hospitals (2.2Â years versus 0.9Â year, respectively; PÂ <Â 0.001).

Conclusion: Hospital procedure volume is associated with long-term survival following TIPS. These results further support the centralization of TIPS to high-volume hospitals to improve long-term outcomes in this population.",Serum Liver-Type Fatty Acid-Binding Protein Is a Possible Prognostic Factor in Human Chronic Liver Diseases From Chronic Hepatitis to Liver Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168516,Hepatology communications,2019 06 10,"Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is a key regulator of fatty acid metabolism, but serum L-FABP levels are not well investigated in chronic liver diseases. We aimed to elucidate the prognostic ability of serum L-FABP in human chronic liver diseases and compare it with the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score. In 242 chronic liver disease patients, including chronic hepatitis (CH, nÂ =Â 100), liver cirrhosis (LC, nÂ =Â 142), and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, nÂ =Â 144), serum L-FABP levels were correlated with liver function (PÂ <Â 0.0001), increased in LC compared with CH (PÂ <Â 0.01), and correlated to ALBI score (PÂ <Â 0.0001). Serum L-FABP levels were increased in the presence of HCC (PÂ <Â 0.0001), correlating to des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (PÂ <Â 0.0001), alpha-fetoprotein (PÂ =Â 0.009), and Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer stage. In the average follow-up period of 1,054 days, serum L-FABP levels were elevated (PÂ <Â 0.0001) in patients who eventually died. The area under the curve (AUC) of serum L-FABP (0.764) was higher than that of ALB (0.709), and the patients with serum L-FABPÂ â¤Â 6.8 ng/mL had significantly longer rates of survival (PÂ <Â 0.0001). Serum L-FABP (hazard ratio [HR] 4.0; PÂ <Â 0.001), HCC (HR 3.7; PÂ =Â 0.001), ALBI score (HR 2.7; PÂ <Â 0.001), and age (HR 1.0; PÂ =Â 0.049) were independent predictors of survival. In the subgroup who maintained liver function, the AUC of serum L-FABP (0.751) was higher than that of ALB (0.643). In this subgroup, serum L-FABP (HR 4.4; PÂ =Â 0.002) and HCC (HR 13.9; PÂ <Â 0.001) were independent predictors of survival. Conclusion: Serum L-FABP is a possible predictor of survival in chronic liver diseases from CH to LC and HCC, including any subgroup that maintains liver function.",Immune Determinants in the Acquisition and Maintenance of Antibody to Hepatitis B Surface Antigen in Adults After First-Time Hepatitis B Vaccination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168515,Hepatology communications,2019 06 10,"Global implementation of a birth-dose hepatitis B (HB) vaccine has significantly reduced the prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. Durable and sufficient titers of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) are desirable for vaccinees to gain resistance to HBV exposure. However, the existence of primary nonresponders and vaccinees who lost anti-HBs over time remains a challenge for the strategy of HBV elimination. We thus aim to clarify the mechanisms of acquisition and maintenance of vaccine-induced anti-HBs in healthy adults. We retrospectively analyzed the vaccination records of 3,755 first-time HB-vaccinated students and also traced the acquired antibody transition of 392 first-time vaccinees for 10 consecutive years. To understand the cellular and humoral immune response, we prospectively examined peripheral blood from 47 healthy first-time HB-vaccinated students, 62 booster-vaccinated health care workers, and 20 individuals who maintained their anti-HBs. In responders, a significant increase of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, activated plasmablasts, and plasma cells was observed in first-time-vaccinated but not booster-vaccinated persons. We also discovered memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells were more abundant in individuals who maintained anti-HBs. According to vaccination records, higher anti-HBs antibody titer acquisition was related to the longer term maintenance of anti-HBs, the level of which was positively correlated with prevaccination levels of serum interferon-Î³ and related chemokines. The second series of vaccination as a booster provided significantly higher anti-HBs antibody titers compared to the initial series. Conclusion: Coordinated activation of Tfh and B-cell lineages after HB vaccination is involved in the acquisition and maintenance of anti-HBs. Our findings support the rationale of preconditioning the immune status of recipients to ensure durable vaccine responses."

We previously developed and used for field validation a screening tool to detect generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) in the rural communities of the Chaco region of Bolivia. The objective of the present study was to perform a hospital-based validation of the same questionnaire and to compare the levels of accuracy obtained when validated in the field or in a hospital-based context. We carried out a hospital-based validation in the Hospital Hernandez Vera of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where we enrolled patients affected by epilepsy with GTCS and controls. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were calculated. One hundred twenty questionnaires were administered to 59 patients (27 men [45.8%]; mean ageÂ Â±Â SDÂ =Â 32.4Â Â±Â 14.2Â years) and 61 controls (27 men [44.3%]; mean ageÂ Â±Â SDÂ =Â 32.6Â Â±Â 14.3Â years).

Using the rodent freeze lesion model, we have sought the underlying circuit abnormalities contributing to the epileptiform activity that occurs in association with the structural pathology of four-layered microgyria. We showed previously that within the epileptogenic paramicrogyral region (PMR) surrounding the malformation, non-fast-spiking neurons commonly containing somatostatin (SSt) exhibit alterations, including having a greater maximum firing rate. Here we examined the output of SSt interneurons with optogenetics, using SSt-Cre mice mated to mice with floxed channelrhodopsin-2. Voltage clamp recordings from layer V pyramidal neurons in ex vivo slices had significantly enhanced SSt-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents in PMR cortex compared to control. In addition, under conditions of low-Mg2+ artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF), light activation of the SSt neurons evoked field potential epileptiform activity in the PMR cortex, but not in control. These data suggest that within the PMR cortex, SSts have a significantly larger effect on excitatory neurons. Surprisingly, the network effect of this enhanced inhibition is hyperexcitability with propagating epileptiform activity, perhaps due to disinhibition of other interneuron cell types or to enhanced synchrony of excitatory cortical elements. This identification creates a new locus for potential modulation of epileptiform activity associated with cortical malformation.",Histopathologic substrate of drug-resistant epilepsy in older adults and the elderly undergoing surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168500,Epilepsia open,2019 06 10,"Patients 60Â years or older are one of the highest risk age groups for development of epilepsy.

We provide the first analysis of the histopathological substrates underlying drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in older adults/elderly patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery (RES) at Cleveland Clinic. A total of 78 patients (mean age Â± standard deviation: 64.7Â Â±Â 3.7Â years; 59% female) were included in the study. The most common pathologies included hippocampal sclerosis (HS; 35.9%; all visible on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), focal cortical dysplasia (FCD; 25.6%) and remote infarct/ischemic changes (12.8%). Underlying pathology did not differ significantly between the patients achieving a good seizure outcome (Engel class I; 77% [47 of 61 patients]) and the rest of the cohort. With one exception, all MRI-negative cases had FCD type Ib. A receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis found a significant association (PÂ =Â 0.002) between seizure-onset age and HS, whereby the odds of its presence were reduced by 4% for every 1Â year increase in the age at seizure onset. The model showed that the age cutoff for seizure onset predicting HS was 43Â years, with a negative predictive value of 81.6%. None of the 14 patients with late-onset epilepsy (â¥60Â years of age) were found to have HS; they mostly had acquired lesions.

We also found that two of the shared pathways (carbon metabolism and pyruvate metabolism) are linking to important traits conferring resistance in alfalfa. Most importantly, the specific role of linoleic acid metabolism was found to be associated with jasmonic acid, flavonoid biosynthesis, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis that might have been associated with the insect-resistant material synthesis in the resistant alfalfa cultivar. Our study suggested that both alfalfa cultivars (R, S) could govern protein expression through carbon and pyruvate metabolism.

Moench] in relation to grain yield heterosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168432,3 Biotech,2019 06 10,"Evaluation of a set of 10 F1 hybrids along with their female (27A and 7A) and male parents (C 43, RS 673, RS 627, CB 26, and CB 29) for grain yield and its component traits revealed that grain yield/plant followed by panicle weight, primary branches/panicle, and 100-seed weight exhibited high levels of heterosis. Eight hybrids exhibited 50% or more mid-parent heterosis for grain yield/plant, of which, one hybrid (27AâÃâRS673) recorded heterobeltiosis above 50% (73.61%). Differential display analysis generated about 2995 reproducible transcripts, which were categorized as UPF1-expressed in any one of the parents and F1 (10.53-14.76%), BPnF1-expressed in both parents but not in F1 (4.56-11.44%), UPnF1-expressed in either of the parents and not in F1 (17.95-27.40%), F1nBP-expressed only in F1 but not in either of the parents (14.39-20.54%), and UET-expressed in both parents and F1 (34.52-42.43%). A comparison between high and low heterotic hybrids revealed that the proportions of UPF1 and F1nBP transcript patterns were much higher in the former (21.31% and 45.24%) as compared to the latter (16.67% and 32.14%) at the booting and flowering stage, respectively, indicating the role of over-dominance and dominance in the manifestation of grain yield heterosis. Significant positive correlations were observed for differential transcript patterns with mid-parent and better-parent heterosis for the components of grain yield such as primary branches (0.63 and 0.61 at pâ<â0.01) and 100-seed weight (0.64 and 0.52 at pâ<â0.01). Cloning and sequence analysis of 16 transcripts that were differentially expressed in hybrids and their parental lines revealed that they code for genes involved in basic cellular processes, cellulose biosynthesis, and assimilate partitioning between various organs and allocation between various pathways, pyrimidine, and polyamine biosynthesis, enhancing ATP production and regulation of plant growth and development.",Variability of electrochemical skin conductance for screening diabetes mellitus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168431,Biomedical engineering letters,2019 06 10,"Electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) has been suggested as a noninvasive diabetic screening tool. We examined the relevance of ESC method for screening type 2 diabetes. A meal tolerance test (MTT) was conducted for 40 diabetic and 42 control subjects stratified by age, sex and body mass index (BMI). The glucose levels and ESC were measured before the MTT and every 30Â min after meal intake up to 120Â min. There was no correlation between the blood glucose level and ESC (râ=â0.249) or ESC variability (ESCV) (râ=â-â0.173). ESC (ESCV) was higher (lower) in diabetic patients than in normal control (pâ=â0.02 for ESC and pâ=â0.06 for ESCV). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) values of the ESC and ESCV were 0.654 and 0.691, respectively.

However, several issues remain to be solved for example high-cost sensor and algorithm as a home-use device. In this study, we aimed to develop an inexpensive and simple sleep monitoring system using a camera and video processing. Polysomnography (PSG) recordings were performed in six subjects for four consecutive nights. Subjects' body movements were simultaneously recorded by the web camera. Body movement was extracted by video processing from the video data and five parameters were calculated for machine learning. Four sleep stages (WAKE, LIGHT, DEEP and REM) were estimated by applying these five parameters to a support vector machine. The overall estimation accuracy was 70.3âÂ±â11.3% with the highest accuracy for DEEP (82.8âÂ±â4.7%) and the lowest for LIGHT (53.0âÂ±â4.0%) compared with correct sleep stages manually scored on PSG data by a sleep technician. Estimation accuracy for REM sleep was 68.0âÂ±â6.8%. The kappa was 0.19âÂ±â0.04 for all subjects. The present non-contact sleep monitoring system showed sufficient accuracy in sleep stage estimation with REM sleep detection being accomplished.

The Al load cell was designed with a rectangular shape, and the load was concentrated in the lower beam part of the load cell because of the anisotropic thickness. From the static analysis, we identified the appropriate location for a Wheatstone bridge circuit consisting of four strain gauges. In addition, the modal and harmonic analyses showed that the vibrational frequencies of the hospital environment do not seriously interfere with the output voltage of the Al load cell. However, random vibrations generated by the movement of the WRMA system on various surfaces severely increase the standard deviation of the measured solution weight by Â±â10Â g or more. Such vibrational error is too large because the average weight of Ringer's solution is 30-40Â g at the time of replacing Ringer's solution. Thus, this error could be confusing for nurses and result in mistakes in the timely replacement of the Ringer's solution. However, the standard deviation of the measured weight was dramatically reduced to Â±â3Â g or less by using the vibration correction algorithm developed in the present study.",An inversion of the conical Radon transform arising in the Compton camera with helical movement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168428,Biomedical engineering letters,2019 06 10,"Since the Compton camera was first introduced, various types of conical Radon transforms have been examined. Here, we derive the inversion formula for the conical Radon transform, where the cone of integration moves along a curve in three-dimensional space such as a helix. Along this three-dimensional curve, a detailed inversion formula for helical movement will be treated for Compton imaging in this paper. The inversion formula includes Hilbert transform and Radon transform. For the inversion of Compton imaging with helical movement, it is necessary to invert Hilbert transform with respect to the inner product between the vertex and the central axis of the cone of the Compton camera. However, the inner product function is not monotone. Thus, we should replace the Hilbert transform by the Riemann-Stieltjes integral over a certain monotone function related with the inner product function. We represent the Riemann-Stieltjes integral as a conventional Riemann integral over a countable union of disjoint intervals, whose end points can be computed using the Newton method. For the inversion of Radon transform, three dimensional filtered backprojection is used. For the numerical implementation, we analytically compute the Hilbert transform and Radon transform of the characteristic function of finite balls. Numerical test is given, when the density function is given by a characteristic function of a ball or three overlapping balls.",Multi class disorder detection of magnetic resonance brain images using composite features and neural network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168427,Biomedical engineering letters,2019 06 10,"Brain disorder recognition has becoming a promising area of study. In reality, someÂ disorders share similar features and signs, making the task ofÂ diagnosis and treatment challenging. This paper presents a rigorous and robust computer aided diagnosis system for the detection of multiple brain abnormalities which can assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases. In this system, we used energy of wavelet sub bands, textural features of gray level co-occurrence matrix and intensity feature of MR brain images. These features are ranked using Wilcoxon test. The composite features are classified using back propagation neural network. Bayesian regulation is adopted to find the optimal weights of neural network. The experimentation is carried out on datasets DS-90 and DS-310 of Harvard Medical School. To enhance the generalization capability of the network, fivefold stratified cross validation technique is used. The proposed system yields multi class disease classification accuracy of 100% in differentiating 90 MR brain images into 18 classes and 97.81% in differentiating 310 MR brain images into 6 classes. The experimental results reveal that the composite features along with BPNN classifier create a competent and reliable system for the identification of multiple brain disorders which can be used in clinical applications. The Wilcoxon test outcome demonstrates that standard deviation feature along with energies of approximate and vertical sub bands of level 7 contribute the most in achieving enhanced multi class classification performance results."

However, some have questioned whether such a period, in which the disease is more susceptible to disease-modifying treatment, really exists. Observational studies are most frequently referenced as supporting evidence, but results of such studies are subject to confounding. In addition formal consensus on the definition of the term has never been reached. We first reviewed the literature to establish if there is agreement on the concept of the window of opportunity in terms of its time period and the outcomes influenced. Second, a systemic literature search was performed on the evidence of the benefit of early versus delayed treatment as provided by randomised clinical trials. We observed that the concept of the window of opportunity has changed with respect to timing and outcome since its first description 25 years ago. There is an 'old definition' pointing to the first 2 years after diagnosis with increased potential for disease-modifying treatment to prevent severe radiographic damage and disability. Strong evidence supports this concept. A 'new definition' presumes a therapeutic window in a pre-RA phase in which the biologic processes could be halted and RA development prevented by very early treatment. This definition is not supported by evidence, although is less well studied in trials. Some suggestions for future research in this area are made.","Development, usability and acceptability of an integrated eHealth system for spondyloarthritis in the Netherlands (SpA-Net).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168405,RMD open,2019 06 10,To develop and test the usability and acceptability of a disease-specific integrated electronic health (eHealth) system for spondyloarthritis (SpA) in the Netherlands ('SpA-Net').,Interplay between obesity and smoking with regard to RA risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168404,RMD open,2019 06 10,"Previous studies on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and body mass index (BMI) have yielded diverging results.

Current advancement in technology has improved the understanding of the pathogenesis and pathology of gastric cancers (GC). But, high mortality rates, unfavorable prognosis and lack of clinical predictive biomarkers provide an impetus to investigate novel early diagnostic/prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for GC, which are sufficiently sensitive to GC. Current biomedical investigations have explored several budding GC biomarker by utilizing serum proteins, natural oncogenic genes during improvement in molecular technologies as microarray, and RNA/DNA-Seq. Recently, small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are becoming vital regulators in oncogenesis pathways and can act as handy clinical biomarkers. The newly introduced class of biomarkers is rising as new molecules for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. For better understanding of the gastric carcinogenesis, miRNAs may help to elucidate the mechanisms of tumor growth and can help to discover novel untimely potent markers for early detection of GC. Here in this review, we summarize the recent research studies supporting the utility of miRNAs as novel early diagnostic/prognostic tools and therapeutic targets. Thus, here we introduce potential future treatment strategies for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, which indicate the practicality and clinical applications of miRNAs in GC.",Random pulse induced synchronization and resonance in uncoupled non-identical neuron models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168334,Cognitive neurodynamics,2019 06 10,"Random pulses contribute to stochastic resonance in neuron models, whereas common random pulses cause stochastic-synchronized excitation in uncoupled neuron models. We studied concurrent phenomena contributing to phase synchronization and stochastic resonance following induction by a weak common random pulse in uncoupled non-identical Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models. The common random pulse was selected from a gamma distribution and the degree of synchronization depended on the corresponding shape parameter. Specifically, a low shape parameter of the weak random pulse induced well-synchronized spiking in uncoupled neuron models, whereas a high shape parameter of the weak random pulse or a weak periodic pulse caused low degrees of synchronization. These were improved by concurrent inputs of periodic and random pulses with high shape parameters. Finally, the output pulse was synchronized with the periodic pulse, and the common random pulse revealed periodic responses in the present neuron models.",Neurodynamic analysis of Merkel cell-neurite complex transduction mechanism during tactile sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168333,Cognitive neurodynamics,2019 06 10,"The present study aimed to identify the mechanism of tactile sensation by analyzing the regularity of the firing pattern of Merkel cell-neurite complex (MCNC) under the stimulation of different compression depths.

The numerical simulation results showed that (1) when the skin was pressed by the same sphere and the depth of the pressing finger skin and position of the force application point remained unchanged, the firing rate of the neuron depended on the synergistic effect of the number of receptors connected with the neuron and the distance between the neuron and the force application point. (2) When the fingertip was pressed by the same sphere at a constant depth and the different contact position, the overall firing rate of the MCNC neural network increased with the number of SAI mechanoreceptors in the area where the force application point was located.",Relationship between the use of electronic devices and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168332,Cognitive neurodynamics,2019 06 10,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune condition influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Dirty electricity generated by electronic equipment is one of the environmental factors that may directly or indirectly impact MS susceptibility. The current Study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the usage time of electronic equipment and susceptibility to MS in North-West Iranian people. This approach was carried out upon 471 MS-diagnosed patients and 453 healthy participants as control group in East Province of Azerbaijan. By utilizing structured questionnaires, the information of all participants about usage status of some electronic devices was obtained. Data were analyzed by IBM SPSS Statistics version 18.0 and the quantitative variables were analyzed by Chi Square and Independent sample t tests. P values below or equal to 0.05 were considered as significant. Among the evaluated items in this approach, the utilization of cell phones and satellite television dishes were significantly higher in MS patients (pâ<â0.001, pâ=â0.07). Furthermore, a correlation was observed between sleeping with cell phone and/or laptop under the pillow (pâ=â0.011) and MS disease; however, there was no significant differences between MS patients and controls in computer using and television watching. Our study reinforces the concept that the utilization of some electronic devices and the continuous exposure to dirty electricity would increase the risk of MS disease thereupon by enhancing the cognizance of adverse effects of dirty electricity and reducing the time spent over electronic devices during adolescence and adulthood the occurrence probability of MS could be declined.",Mental fatigue level detection based on event related and visual evoked potentials features fusion in virtual indoor environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168331,Cognitive neurodynamics,2019 06 10,"The purpose of this work is to set up a model that can estimate the mental fatigue of users based on the fusion of relevant features extracted from Positive 300 (P300) and steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) measured by electroencephalogram. To this end, an experimental protocol describes the induction of P300, SSVEP and mental workload (which leads to mental fatigue by varying time-on-task) in different scenarios where environmental artifacts are controlled (obstacles number, obstacles velocities, ambient luminosity). Ten subjects took part in the experiment (with two suffering from cerebral palsy). Their mission is to navigate along a corridor from a starting point A to a goal point B where specific flickering stimuli are introduced to perform the P300 task. On the other hand, SSVEP task is elicited thanks to 10 Hz flickering lights. Correlated features are considered as inputs to fusion block which estimates mental workload. In order to deal with uncertainties and heterogeneity of P300 and SSVEP features, Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidential reasoning is introduced. As the goal is to assess the reliability for the estimation of mental fatigue levels, D-S is compared to multi layer perception and linear discriminant analysis. The results show that D-S globally outperforms the other classifiers (although its performance significantly decreases between healthy and palsied groups). Finally we discuss the feasibility of such a fusion proposal in real life situation.",A cognitive brain-computer interface monitoring sustained attentional variations during a continuous task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168330,Cognitive neurodynamics,2019 06 10,"We introduce a cognitive brain-computer interface based on a continuous performance task for the monitoring of variations of visual sustained attention, i.e. the self-directed maintenance of cognitive focus in non-arousing conditions while possibly ignoring distractors and avoiding mind wandering.

Pairwise discrimination of these task difficulties from electroencephalographic features was performed using a leave-one-subject-out cross validation approach. Features were selected using the orthogonal forward regression supervised feature selection method. Cognitive load was best predicted using a combination of prefrontal theta power, broad spatial range gamma power, fronto-central beta power, and fronto-central alpha power.

Although FOK provides evidence for the mechanisms of metacognitive systems, the neurobiological basis of FOK is still unclear. We investigated the neural correlates of FOK induced by an episodic memory task in 77 younger adult participants. Data were gathered using event-related potentials (ERPs). ERP components during high, low, extremely high and extremely low FOK judgments were analyzed. Stimulus-locked ERP analyses indicated that FOK judgment was associated with greater positivity for P200 component at frontal, central, and parietal electrode zones and greater negativity for the N200 component at parietal electrode zones. Furthermore, results revealed that amplitude of the ERP components for FOK judgments were affected by the level of FOK judgment. Results suggest that ERP components of FOK judgment observed within a 200Â ms time window support the perceptual fluency-based model.",Influence of pharmacological and epigenetic factors to suppress neurotrophic factors and enhance neural plasticity in stress and mood disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168328,Cognitive neurodynamics,2019 06 10,"Stress-induced major depression and mood disorders are characterized by behavioural abnormalities and psychiatric illness, leading to disability and immature mortality worldwide. Neurobiological mechanisms of stress and mood disorders are discussed considering recent findings, and challenges to enhance pharmacological effects of antidepressant, and mood stabilizers. Pharmacological enhancement of ketamine and scopolamine regulates depression at the molecular level, increasing synaptic plasticity in prefrontal regions. Blood-derived neurotrophic factors facilitate mood-deficit symptoms. Epigenetic factors maintain stress-resilience in hippocampal region. Regulation of neurotrophic factors blockades stress, and enhances neuronal survival though it paralyzes limbic regions. Molecular agents and neurotrophic factors also control behavioral and synaptic plasticity in addiction and stress disorders. Future research on neuronal dynamics and cellular actions can be directed to obtain the etiology of synaptic dysregulation in mood disorder and stress.

Due to a number of natural and technical reasons (e.g., inhomogeneous scene illumination, shadows, and reflections), unsupervised identification of relevant plant structures (i.e., image segmentation) represents a nontrivial task that often requires extensive human-machine interaction. Registration of multimodal plant images enables the automatized segmentation of 'difficult' image modalities such as visible light or near-infrared images using the segmentation results of image modalities that exhibit higher contrast between plant and background regions (such as fluorescent images). Furthermore, registration of different image modalities is essential for assessment of a consistent multiparametric plant phenotype, where, for example, chlorophyll and water content as well as disease- and/or stress-related pigmentation can simultaneously be studied at a local scale. To automatically register thousands of images, efficient algorithmic solutions for the unsupervised alignment of two structurally similar but, in general, nonidentical images are required. For establishment of image correspondences, different algorithmic approaches based on different image features have been proposed. The particularity of plant image analysis consists, however, of a large variability of shapes and colors of different plants measured at different developmental stages from different views. While adult plant shoots typically have a unique structure, young shoots may have a nonspecific shape that can often be hardly distinguished from the background structures. Consequently, it is not clear a priori what image features and registration techniques are suitable for the alignment of various multimodal plant images. Furthermore, dynamically measured plants may exhibit nonuniform movements that require application of nonrigid registration techniques. Here, we investigate three common techniques for registration of visible light and fluorescence images that rely on finding correspondences between (i) feature-points, (ii) frequency domain features, and (iii) image intensity information. The performance of registration methods is validated in terms of robustness and accuracy measured by a direct comparison with manually segmented images of different plants. Our experimental results show that all three techniques are sensitive to structural image distortions and require additional preprocessing steps including structural enhancement and characteristic scale selection. To overcome the limitations of conventional approaches, we develop an iterative algorithmic scheme, which allows it to perform both rigid and slightly nonrigid registration of high-throughput plant images in a fully automated manner.",Bayesian optimization for seed germination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168313,Plant methods,2019 06 10,"Efficient seed germination is a crucial task at the beginning of crop cultivation.

However, the fundamental molecular mechanisms engaged with landfill leachate exposure inducing cellular and sub-cellular ramifications are not well explicated. Therefore, we aim to examine the potential of leachate to impair mitochondrial machinery and its associated mechanisms in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. On assessment, the significant increase in the dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence, accumulation of 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), and levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) strongly indicated the ability of the leachate to induce a pro-oxidant state inside the cell. The decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and alterations in the mitochondrial genome observed in leachate-exposed cells further suggested the disturbances in mitochondrial machinery. Moreover, these mitochondrial-associated redox imbalances were accompanied by the increased level of NF-ÎºÎ², pro-inflammatory cytokines, and DNA damage. In addition, the higher DNA fragmentation, release of nucleosomes, levels of polyadenosine diphosphate ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and activity of caspase-3 suggested the involvement of mitochondrial mediated apoptosis in leachate exposed cells. These observations were accompanied by the low proliferative index of the exposed cells. Conclusively, our results clearly indicate the ability of landfill leachate to disturb mitochondrial redox homeostasis, which might be a probable source for the immunotoxic consequences leading to plausible patho-physiological conditions in humans susceptible to such environmental exposures.",Trust and Glycemic Control in Black Patients With Diabetic Retinopathy: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168287,Diabetes spectrum : a publication of the American Diabetes Association,2019 06 10,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is more prevalent in blacks than whites because, compared to whites, blacks on average have worse glycemic control.

Hence, choosing an ideal treatment protocol remains challenging. This is further complicated by the rarity of these neoplasms and high recurrence rates following treatment. In our study, we tried to answer these questions in the background of Indian scenario. This is a retrospective study of 41 patients with extremity fibromatoses who were operated between June 2002 and November 2012. The mean age for all patients was 29.2Â years with 30 females and 11 males. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.37Â years. Eight patients were margin-positive on final histopathology. Seventeen developed recurrences (41.4%). Ten of these 17 patients underwent repeat surgery. The remaining 7 patients with inoperable recurrence were put on metronomic chemotherapy. The DFS for patients treated with surgical management was 62.6% at 3Â years, 54.4% at 5Â years and 44% at 10Â years. The enigmacy on the tumour biology, natural history and optimal management of fibromatoses continue.

This is a case series of early-stage vulvar cancer in the Department of Surgical Oncology in BL Kapur Superspeciality Hospital from Jan 2016 to date. Five patients with histologically proven diagnosis of early-stage vulvar cancer were included. The mean age for the diagnosis of vulvar cancer was 58Â years and the peak incidence was seen in postmenopausal age group. All of the cases were squamous cell carcinomas in stage IB except one which was a basisquamous variant. All cases were treated primarily with surgery and vulvar flap reconstruction. Adjuvant therapy was not given in any case. Cases were followed from 6Â months to date, and no recurrence noted. The limitations of the study were rarity of disease and less number of cases. As all the cases in our study were in early stage of disease (stages I and II), surgical treatment in the form of modified radical vulvectomy with B/L inguinofemoral lymph node dissection and oncoplastic procedure was the treatment modality chosen for all the patients.",Laparoscopic Ovarian Transposition in Rectal Cancer: More than Just Oncological Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168253,Indian journal of surgical oncology,2019 06 10,"Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy which down stages tumor and improves complete resection rates thus reducing local recurrences.

The main contraindications for BCS besides the presence of multicentricity and diffuse microcalcifications are inadequate tumour size to breast size ratio. With the advent of oncoplastic techniques, the indications of BCS may be further extended to patient with larger tumour size and or small volume breast. We prospectively assessed 42 patients undergoing oncoplastic breast conservation surgery for cosmetic and oncologic outcomes. Cosmetic outcome assessment was done by comparison of operated breast to contralateral breast by an independent surgeon, nurse and patient's attendant at 6Â months post-surgery. Risk factors for compromised oncologic outcomes included grades II/III tumours and non-ductal histology. Intraoperative margin assessment with frozen section analysis proved to be important in order to achieve negative surgical margins on final histopathology. By univariate analysis, tumours located in central quadrant and medial half of the breast had similar cosmetic outcomes comparable to tumours located in other quadrants. Majority of our patients (90%) had overall good to excellent cosmetic outcomes on Harvard scale. Oncoplastic breast conservation surgery techniques allow for larger parenchymal resections without compromising oncologic and cosmetic results. It further allows extension of BCS to patients otherwise denied for the same based on earlier recommendations for mastectomy. Oncoplastic techniques and intraoperative margin assessment with frozen section are vital in attaining adequate margins and also decrease chance of local recurrence and revision surgery for positive margins.",Accuracy of CT Scan in Predicting the Surgical PCI in Patients Undergoing Cytoreductive Surgery with/without HIPEC-a Prospective Single Institution Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168251,Indian journal of surgical oncology,2019 06 10,"Our aim was toÂ study the accuracy of CT scan in predicting the peritoneal cancer index (PCI) and the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), abdominal region, disease volume, and primary tumor site on it.

The accuracy of CT-PCI in predicting the surgical PCI and the difference between the two was evaluated. From January 2018 to August 2018, 50 patients were included. The median CT PCI was 6 (range 0-35) and median surgical PCI was 17 (range 2-35). CT-PCI was more than the surgical PCI in 12 (24%), less in 23 (46%), and same in 15 (30%) with an accuracy of 30%. The highest accuracy was in region 10 and lowest in region 3. It was 15% in patients with ovarian cancer, 30% in PMP, 21% in patients receiving NACT, 35% in high-volume disease, and 42.1% in low volume disease.

On multivariate analysis, node positivity and presence of perineural invasion emerged as independent predictors of recurrence. Cox regression analysis showed trismus, node positivity, and perineural invasion are significantly associated with recurrence. Aggressive multimodality treatment achieves good local control rates even in locally advanced disease, and the intent of treatment should be curative. Node positivity, presence of perineural invasion, and presence of trismus are found as independent predictors of recurrence.

This study included 24 operable women who were candidates for skin sparing or modified radical mastectomy. In one case, delay was only done and followed by mastectomy and flap transfer. In later experience, delay plus mastectomy was done first and followed later by flap transfer. Operative data and postoperative complications were recorded. The mean BMI was 37âÂ±â2.75.

A retrospective review was done of all patients who had an intraoperative frozen section for an indeterminate ovarian tumor over a six-year period. The reference standard was final histology. The validity indices for frozen section in diagnosing benign, borderline, and malignant lesions were determined. One hundred thirty-five intraoperative frozen section-diagnosed epithelial ovarian tumors were reviewed. The mean age was 44.9âÂ±â14.2Â years, the median parity was 2, and 57% (77/135) of patients were post-menopausal. The commonest histological subtype was mucinous 48.1% (65/135) on frozen section and 46.7% (63/135) on final histology. The overall concordance rate of frozen section to final histology was 81.5% (Æâ=â0.719, pâ=â0.0001). The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of frozen section to diagnose benign lesions were 86.7%, 85.7%, 97.2%, and 79.2% respectively. In borderline tumors, the diagnostic test characteristics were 88.1%, 81.2%, 90.3%, and 72.2%. For malignant lesions, these values were 88.1%, 77.8%, 95.1%, and 91.3% respectively. The odds ratios for frozen section being correct were 40.9 (95% CI 14.8-113.5) for benign lesions, 40.3 (95% CI 13.4-121.3) for borderline tumors, and 67.4 (95% CI 20.5-222.0) for malignancy. Over-treatment or under-treatment occurred in 19.3% of patients. Intraoperative frozen section is useful in situations where the nature of the ovarian tumor is uncertain. However, borderline ovarian tumors are more likely to be over-diagnosed. About a fifth of patients received inappropriate treatments based on the frozen section report."

Sixteen genotypes were evaluated in split plot design under irrigated and drought conditions. Various physiological traits were measured in irrigated and drought stressed plants such as canopy temperature, root length, specific leaf weight, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll, and epicuticular wax content. As compared with irrigated conditions, the percent reduction in mean soybean yield under rainout shelter was 40%. The mean yields of soybean genotypes ranged from 1162Â kg/ha (NRC 12) to 2610Â kg/ha (JS 335) under irrigated conditions, whereas, under water stress conditions, yields ranged from 852Â kg/ha (Samrat) to 1654Â kg/ha (EC 538828). Genotypes EC 538828, JS 97-52, EC 456548, and EC 602288 had better avoidance to drought than other genotypes. The superior drought tolerance of the four genotypes was related to their low canopy temperature, deep root system, and high values for root/shoot weight ratio, specific leaf weight, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, epicuticular wax content, and Photosystem II (PSII) efficiency.

All the redox parameters examined, substantiate the experimental outcome that treatment with elevated concentration of H2O2 caused serious loss of redox homeostasis and germination impairment, whereas low titre H2O2 treatment not only restored redox homeostasis but also improve germination and post-germinative growth. The inductive pulse of H2O2 (500Â ÂµM) exhibited significantly better performance of ascorbate-glutathione pathway, which was otherwise down-regulated significantly in 20Â mM H2O2 treatment-raised seedlings. A comparison between imbibitional chilling stress-raised experimental rice seedlings with 20Â mM H2O2 treated rice seedling revealed similar kind of generation of redox cues and oxidative stress response. Further, imbibitional H2O2 treatments in rice also revealed a dose-dependent regulation of expression of genes of Halliwell-Asada pathway enzymes, which is in consonance with the redox metabolic response of germinating rice seeds. In conclusion, a dose-dependent regulation of H2O2 mediated redox cues and redox regulatory properties during germination in rice are suggested, the knowledge of which may be exploited as a promising seed priming technology.",Integrated approaches to study the drought tolerance mechanism in hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168229,Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology,2019 06 10,"Drought is one of the predominant abiotic stresses which have phenomenal impact on crop productivity.

The ratio [ASA/ASAâ+âDHA] was calculated on the basis of the oxidation of ascorbic acid (ASA) into dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) in leaves. Results proved that oxidative stress was generated. This led to the accumulation of malondialdehyde which referred to a lipid peroxidation mainly in the sensitive Syrah. In order to cope with these oxidative disturbances, trans-resveratrol as well as its glucosides trans-piceid and cis-piceid have been de novo synthesized in the sensitive variety.

Although, several practices have evolved to sustain the growth of rice under salinity, the enormous role of calcium (Ca2+) as a signalling moleculeÂ in salt stress mitigation is still arcane. Considering this fact, an experiment was performed aiming to explicate the mechanism of salt-induced growth inhibition in rice and its alleviation by exogenous Ca2+. At germination stage, 10Â mM and 15Â mM CaCl2 primed rice (cv. Binadhan-10 & Binadhan-7) seeds were grown in petri dishes for 9Â days under 100Â mM NaCl stress. At seedling stage, 9-day-old rice seedlings grown on sandÂ were exposed to 100Â mM NaCl alone and combined with 10Â mM and 15Â mM CaCl2 for 15Â days. This research revealed that salinity radically slowed down growth of rice seedlings and Ca2+ treatment noticeably improved growth performances. At germination stage, 10Â mM CaCl2 treatment significantly increased the final germination percentage, germination rate index (in Binadhan-7), shoot, root length (89.20, 67.58% in Bindhan-10 & 84.72, 31.15% in Bindhan-7) and biomass production under salinity. Similarly, at seedling stage, 10Â mM CaCl2 supplementation in salt-stressed plants enhanced shoot length (42.17, 28.76%) and shoot dry weight (339.52, 396.20%) significantly in Binadhan-10 & Binadhan-7, respectively, but enhanced root dry weight (36.76%) only in Binadhan-10. In addition, 10Â mM CaCl2 supplementation on salt-stressed seedlings increased the chlorophyll and proline content, and oppressed the accretion of reactive oxygen species thus protecting from oxidative damage more pronouncedly in Binadhan-10 than Binadhan-7 as reflected by the elevated levels of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activity. The 15Â mM CaCl2 somehow also enhanced some growth parameters but overall wasÂ less effective than 10Â mM CaCl2 to alleviate salt stress, and sometimes showed negative effect.

Like all other methods, this one also has its pros and cons. Disadvantages compared to pharmacological methods include some maternal discomfort upon manipulation of the cervix, a theoretical increase in the risk of maternal and neonatal infection from the introduction of a foreign body, potential disruption of a low-lying placenta, and increase in the need of oxytocin induction of labor. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of using cervical ripening balloon in preinduction on the mode of delivery. This was a longitudinal, cohort, intervention, non-randomized one center study. Inclusion criteria were term pregnancies with gestational diabetes, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia and pregnancies after 41 weeks of pregnancy. Preinduction of labor was performed in term pregnancies at Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center. Results in the first 150 women having undergone labor preinduction with cervical ripening balloon were included. Two-sided p values <0.05 were considered significant. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS Version 20.0. The study included 150 women; one woman was excluded from further analyses due to conversion of fetal presentation (head to breech). Indications for labor preinduction were as follows: gestational diabetes, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia and pregnancies after 41 weeks of pregnancy. Women with normal vaginal delivery (96/149) had lower rates of gestational diabetes and oligohydramnios and used epidural analgesia more frequently. Women with dystocia (32/53) had a significantly longer labor duration and higher neonatal birth weight. In multivariate analysis, multiparity, greater cervical dilatation after balloon removal and use of epidural analgesia were associated with a decreased risk of cesarean section, while the presence of gestational diabetes and oligohydramnios was associated with an increased risk of cesarean section. We found this preinduction method safe and efficient, with a potential to increase the rate of vaginal deliveries."
