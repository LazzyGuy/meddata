However, the biological functions of alphasatellites during begomovirus/betasatellite infections remain unclear. Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) associated with a betasatellite (TYLCCNB) is a widespread monopartite begomovirus in China. In the Yunnan province of China, the TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB disease complex is found in association with an alphasatellite (TYLCCNA). In this study, in order to explain the mechanisms underlying TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB infection and reductions in viral DNA accumulation caused by TYLCCNA, we analyzed the transcriptome profiles of Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings challenged by TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB or TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB/TYLCCNA using RNA sequencing. In total, 2272 and 1207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified to respond to TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB and TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB/TYLCCNA infections, respectively. Compared with the DEGs in the TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB-infected N. benthamiana seedlings, the number of DEGs in plants co-infected with TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB + TYLCCNA was significantly reduced. Additionally, 36 DEGs were identified to be regulated by TYLCCNA, six of which were further analyzed using the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach. Silencing of these six TYLCCNA responsive DEGs caused more severe disease symptoms and higher viral DNA accumulation levels, suggesting that TYLCCNA responsive DEGs may attenuate TYLCCNV/TYLCCNB infection.",Thermal Decomposition and Ceramifying Process of Ceramifiable Silicone Rubber Composite with Hydrated Zinc Borate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096635,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"The ceramifiable silicone rubber composite was prepared using hydrated zinc borate and kaolin as ceramifiable fillers. Effects of the hydrated zinc borate content and the combustion temperature on the properties of the ceramifiable silicone rubber composite were investigated. Thermal decomposition and ceramifying processes of the composite in a muffle furnace under air were also studied. The results showed that the density and the hardness of the composites increased as the content of the hydrated zinc borate increased from 0 to 30 phr. The tensile strength and elongation at break decreased. In addition, hydrated zinc borate decreased the decomposition temperature of the composite, whereas the residue weight under air atmosphere was increased. In the process of decomposition and oxidation of the ceramifiable silicone rubber composite in air, B2O3 was generated by the decomposition of zinc borate and participated in the formation of the residue network structure, which decreased the temperature of the ceramifying transition. The new phases, zinc aluminate (ZnO·Al2O3) and aluminum-rich mullite (9Al2O3·2SiO2), appeared after high-temperature thermochemical reactions. Microscopy images revealed that different structures were formed at different temperatures. The network structure of the ceramic residue became increasingly compact, and the compressive strength increased from 0.31 to 1.82 MPa with the increase of temperature from 800 to 1400 °C, which had a better protective effect on heat transfer and mass loss. The weight loss and the linear shrinkage of the ceramic residue was 37.6% and 21.9%, respectively, with the 30 phr content of hydrated zinc borate. The bending strength was improved from 0.11 to 11.58 MPa, and the compressive strength also increased from 0.03 to 1.14 MPa.",EEMIP: Energy-Efficient Communication Using Timing Channels and Prioritization in ZigBee.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096634,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"With the expansion of the Internet-of-Things, energy-efficient communication is becoming vital. The communication among energy-limited devices (e.g., powered by batteries or harvesting the energy from their environment) must be energy-efficient, prolonging their lifetime or increasing data throughput. This article aims at proposing energy-efficient periodic communication for devices over the ZigBee protocol and powered by a battery. We propose using timing channels for different data priorities, thus, more important data are sent more frequently. The priority is also considered in case of congested traffic, where a central device (coordinator) prioritizes more important communication. We have implemented a simulator, which serves for verification of the proposed solution, and conducted experiments comparing the proposed EEMIP method with the standard nonbeacon ZigBee communication. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more energy efficient.",Analyzing Mortality Risk and Medical Burden among Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury and Subsequent Dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096633,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 17,"We used the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan to determine whether patients with posttraumatic dementia (PTD) exhibit increased mortality and medical burden than those without it. Patients ≥20 years of age having head injury admission (per the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 850-854, 959.01) between 2000 and 2012 were enrolled as traumatic brain injury (TBI) cohort. A PTD cohort (with ICD-9-CM codes 290, 294.1, 331.0) and a posttraumatic nondementia (PTN) cohort were established and compared in terms of age, sex, and comorbidities. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all-cause mortality risk, number of hospital days, and frequency of medical visits in these cohorts. Patients with PTD had a higher mortality rate than did patients with TBI alone (rate per 1000 person-years: 12.00 vs. 6.32), with an aHR of 1.54 (95% CI: 1.32-1.80). Patients with PTD who were aged ≥65 years (aHR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.31-1.80) or male (aHR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.45-2.18) exhibited greatly increased risks of mortality. Furthermore, patients with PTD had 19.9 more hospital days and required medical visits 4.49 times more frequently compared with the PTN cohort. Taiwanese patients with PTD had increased mortality risk and medical burden compared with patients who had TBI only. Our findings provide crucial information for clinicians and the government to improve TBI and PTD outcomes.","Newly Generated and Non-Newly Generated ""Immature"" Neurons in the Mammalian Brain: A Possible Reservoir of Young Cells to Prevent Brain Aging and Disease?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096632,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 17,"Brain plasticity is important for translational purposes since most neurological disorders and brain aging problems remain substantially incurable. In the mammalian nervous system, neurons are mostly not renewed throughout life and cannot be replaced. In humans, the increasing life expectancy explains the increase in brain health problems, also producing heavy social and economic burden. An exception to the ""static"" brain is represented by stem cell niches leading to the production of new neurons. Such adult neurogenesis is dramatically reduced from fish to mammals, and in large-brained mammals with respect to rodents. Some examples of neurogenesis occurring outside the neurogenic niches have been reported, yet these new neurons actually do not integrate in the mature nervous tissue. Non-newly generated, ""immature"" neurons (nng-INs) are also present: Prenatally generated cells continuing to express molecules of immaturity (mostly shared with the newly born neurons). Of interest, nng-INs seem to show an inverse phylogenetic trend across mammals, being abundant in higher-order brain regions not served by neurogenesis and providing structural plasticity in rather stable areas. Both newly generated and nng-INs represent a potential reservoir of young cells (a ""brain reserve"") that might be exploited for preventing the damage of aging and/or delay the onset/reduce the impact of neurological disorders.",Investigation of the In-Plane Mechanical Anisotropy of Magnesium Alloy AZ31B-O by VPSC⁻TDT Crystal Plasticity Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096631,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"The in-plane mechanical anisotropy of magnesium alloy sheet, which significantly influences the design of the parts produced by Mg alloy sheets, is of great importance regarding its wide application. Though the stress-strain response and texture evolution have been intensively investigated, and the anisotropy of Mg alloy can be significantly substantiated by its R-value, which reveals the lateral response of a material other than the primary response. As a consequence, the conjunction of viscoplastic self-consistent model and twinning and detwinning scheme (VPSC-TDT) is employed to investigate the in-plane anisotropy of magnesium alloy AZ31B-O sheet. The loading cases include both tension and compression along different paths with respect to the processing direction of the sheet. It is revealed that the stress-strain relation, texture evolution, R-value, and involved deformation mechanisms are all loading path-dependent. The unique R-values of Mg alloys are interpreted with the aid of modeling behaviors of Mg single crystals. The results agree well with the corresponding experiments. It is found that the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) crystallographic structure, deformation twinning, and initial basal texture are responsible for the characteristic behavior of Mg alloys.",The Diverse Functions of Non-Essential Amino Acids in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096630,Cancers,2019 05 17,"Far beyond simply being 11 of the 20 amino acids needed for protein synthesis, non-essential amino acids play numerous important roles in tumor metabolism. These diverse functions include providing precursors for the biosynthesis of macromolecules, controlling redox status and antioxidant systems, and serving as substrates for post-translational and epigenetic modifications. This functional diversity has sparked great interest in targeting non-essential amino acid metabolism for cancer therapy and has motivated the development of several therapies that are either already used in the clinic or are currently in clinical trials. In this review, we will discuss the important roles that each of the 11 non-essential amino acids play in cancer, how their metabolic pathways are linked, and how researchers are working to overcome the unique challenges of targeting non-essential amino acid metabolism for cancer therapy.",The Association between Habitual Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality with Glycemic Traits: Assessment by Cross-Sectional and Mendelian Randomization Analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096629,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 17,"Evidence on whether habitual sleep duration and sleep quality are associated with increased insulin resistance is inconsistent. Here, we investigated the associations between different measures of habitual sleep with glycemic traits through cross-sectional and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We assessed the associations of sleep duration and sleep quality with glycemic traits using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders in 4672 middle-aged (45-65 years; 48% men) nondiabetic participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity (NEO) study. Genetic variants for total, short, and long sleep duration were used as instrumental variables in MR analyses using summary-level data of glycemic traits in nondiabetic individuals (MAGIC; n = 58,074). In cross-sectional analyses, shortest sleepers (median 5.0 h of sleep per night) had 14.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0; 28.6%) higher fasting insulin level and 16.3% (95% CI: 2.7; 31.7%) higher HOMA-β. Bad sleep quality was associated with higher insulin resistance (e.g., 14.3% (95% CI: 4.7; 24.9%) higher HOMA-IR). All these associations disappeared after adjustment for BMI and the risk of sleep apnea. MR analyses did not indicate a causal association between total, short or long sleep duration and glycemic traits. Therefore, our used measures of habitual sleep duration and sleep quality are unlikely to directly associate with insulin resistance.",Zero-Bias Visible to Near-Infrared Horizontal p-n-p TiO2 Nanotubes Doped Monolayer Graphene Photodetector.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096628,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"We present a p-n-p monolayer graphene photodetector doped with titanium dioxide nanotubes for detecting light from visible to near-infrared (405 to 1310 nm) region. The built-in electric field separates the photo-induced electrons and holes to generate photocurrent without bias voltage, which allows the device to have meager power consumption. Moreover, the detector is very sensitive to the illumination area, and we analyze the reason using the energy band theory. The response time of the detector is about 30 ms. The horizontal p-n-p device is a suitable candidate in zero-bias optoelectronic applications.",Design and Fabrication of Wafer-Level Microlens Array with Moth-Eye Antireflective Nanostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096627,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Wafer-level packaging (WLP) based camera module production has attracted widespread industrial interest because it offers high production efficiency and compact modules. However, suppressing the surface Fresnel reflection losses is challenging for wafer-level microlens arrays. Traditional dielectric antireflection (AR) coatings can cause wafer warpage and coating fractures during wafer lens coating and reflow. In this paper, we present the fabrication of a multiscale functional structure-based wafer-level lens array incorporating moth-eye nanostructures for AR effects, hundred-micrometer-level aspherical lenses for camera imaging, and a wafer-level substrate for wafer assembly. The proposed fabrication process includes manufacturing a wafer lens array metal mold using ultraprecise machining, chemically generating a nanopore array layer, and replicating the multiscale wafer lens array using ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography. A 50-mm-diameter wafer lens array is fabricated containing 437 accurate aspherical microlenses with diameters of 1.0 mm; each lens surface possesses nanostructures with an average period of ~120 nm. The microlens quality is sufficient for imaging in terms of profile accuracy and roughness. Compared to lenses without AR nanostructures, the transmittance of the fabricated multiscale lens is increased by ~3% under wavelengths of 400-750 nm. This research provides a foundation for the high-throughput and low-cost industrial application of wafer-level arrays with AR nanostructures."

Here, we demonstrated that GFP-biosensor transgenes shared similar expression patterns with the corresponding endogenous CYP genes during proliferation and differentiation in HepaRG cells. Interestingly, differentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells expressed GFP at higher levels than cholangiocyte-like cells. Despite weaker inductions of GFP expression compared to the strong increases in mRNA levels of endogenous genes, we also demonstrated that the biosensor transgenes were induced by prototypical drug inducers benzo(a)pyrene and phenobarbital. In addition, we used the differentiated biosensor HepaRG cells to evidence that pesticide mancozeb triggered selective cytotoxicity of hepatocyte-like cells.

This focus group study of veterinarians (n = 32) examined the impact of these improvements and the potential challenges they introduce in small animal practice. It shows that while advanced diagnostics and therapies deliver benefits in patient care, they also add complexities to decision-making. Although the veterinarians participating in the study were aware of their duty to act in the best interests of the animal, their decisions were highly dependent on factors such as the client's financial background and the emotional bond between client and animal, as well as the veterinarian's place of work, and level and field of specialization, and certain economic aspects of the practice. The overall conclusion is that small animal veterinarians are increasingly torn between serving the best interests of the animal, medical feasibility and contextual factors related to the client, the veterinarian, and professional colleagues. Further, the findings suggest that services are not only oriented towards the provision of medical care in a strict medical sense. On top of this, veterinarians need to deal with various expectations and wishes of clients which influence their decision-making. As it will be shown, factors like the possibility of referring patients to specialist veterinarians or prompt diagnostic results influence their decision-making.","Medical Clerkship in a State Registration and Reception Center for Forced Migrants in Germany: Students' Experiences, Teachable Moments, and Psychological Burden.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096613,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 17,"Aspects of global health are becoming increasingly relevant for doctors of future generations. However, medical curricula rarely include courses which focus on global health or forced migration. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether students are at risk to develop psychological strain, after being confronted with highly burdened or even traumatized asylum seekers. This is a prospective study using a mixed-methods approach. We included n = 22 medical students performing a medical clerkship in a state registration and reception center for refugees. By applying (1) qualitative interviews, (2) reflective diaries, and (3) psychometric questionnaires, we examined the students' experiences, teachable moments, and potential psychological burdens. In the interviews, the students emphasized the importance of cultural sensitivity during their clerkship. However, they also reported cognitive changes concerning their views of themselves and the world in general; this could indicate vicarious traumatization. The reflective diaries displayed high learning achievements. According to the psychometric questionnaires, the assignment in the reception center had not caused any significant psychological strain for the students. By completing their medical clerkship in a reception center, students were able to improve their medical, organizational, and interactional knowledge and skills. Furthermore, they reported that they had broadened their personal and cultural horizons.",Performance Comparison of Three Fibre-Based Reflective Optical Sensors for Aero Engine Monitorization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096612,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Among the different available optical technologies, fibre bundle-based reflective optical sensors represent an interesting alternative for parameter monitorization in aero engines. Tip clearance is one of the parameters of great concern for engine designers and engineers. In the framework of this optical technology, three fibre-based reflective optical sensors have been compared. Two of them are custom designed and based on the same geometrical fibre arrangement, whereas the third one is commercially available and relies on a different geometrical arrangement of the fibres. Their performance has been compared in clearance measurements carried out during an experimental program followed at a transonic wind tunnel for aero turbines. The custom-designed solution that operates in the most sensitive part of its response curve proved to be by far the most reliable tool for clearance measurements. Its high resolution opens up the possibility to detect small blade features such as cracks, reflectivity changes, etc. that otherwise could not be tracked. These results show that the detection of unexpected features on blade tips may have an important effect on how the clearance is calculated, ultimately giving rise to corrective actions.",Temporal Effects on Radiation Responses in Nonhuman Primates: Identification of Biofluid Small Molecule Signatures by Gas Chromatography⁻Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096611,Metabolites,2019 05 17,"Whole body exposure to ionizing radiation damages tissues leading to physical symptoms which contribute to acute radiation syndrome. Radiation biodosimetry aims to determine characteristic early biomarkers indicative of radiation exposure and is necessary for effective triage after an unanticipated radiological incident. Radiation metabolomics can address this aim by assessing metabolic perturbations following exposure. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a standardized platform ideal for compound identification. We performed GC time-of-flight MS for the global profiling of nonhuman primate urine and serum samples up to 60 d after a single 4 Gy γ-ray total body exposure. Multivariate statistical analysis showed higher group separation in urine vs. serum. We identified biofluid markers involved in amino acid, lipid, purine, and serotonin metabolism, some of which may indicate host microbiome dysbiosis. Sex differences were observed for amino acid fold changes in serum samples. Additionally, we explored mitochondrial dysfunction by tricarboxylic acid intermediate analysis in the first week with a GC tandem quadrupole MS platform. By adding this temporal component to our previous work exploring dose effects at 7 d, we observed the highest fold changes occurring at 3 d, returning closer to basal levels by 7 d. These results emphasize the utility of both MS-based metabolomics for biodosimetry and complementary analytical platforms for increased metabolome coverage.",Surgical Treatment of Paediatric Chronic Rhinosinusitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096610,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 17,"Rhinosinusitis (RS) is a common disease in children, significantly affecting their quality of life. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is frequently linked to other respiratory diseases, including asthma. Children affected by CRS may be candidates for surgery in the case of failure of maximal medical therapy comprising three to six weeks of broad-spectrum systemic antibiotics with adjunctive therapies. Although endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is the surgical treatment of choice in adult patients with CRS, different surgical procedures are scheduled for refractory paediatric CRS and include adenoidectomy, paediatric ESS (PESS), and balloon catheter sinuplasty (BCS). The present paper discusses the indications and limitations of each treatment option in children with CRS. Given the amount of current evidence, it is reasonable to suggest that, in young and otherwise healthy children with refractory CRS, an adenoidectomy (eventually combined with BCS) should be offered as the first-line surgical treatment. Nevertheless, this approach may be considered ineffective in some patients who should be candidates for traditional ESS. In older children, those with asthma, or in the case of peculiar conditions, traditional ESS should be considered as the primary treatment.","Nanotechnology Meets Oncology: Nanomaterials in Brain Cancer Research, Diagnosis and Therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096609,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Advances in technology of the past decades led to development of new nanometer scale diagnosis and treatment approaches in cancer medicine leading to establishment of nanooncology.

Oxidative stress, in particular, the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), play an important role in the development of these diseases, as evidenced by the detection of products of lipid, protein and DNA oxidation in vivo. Even if they participate in cell signaling and metabolism regulation, ROS are also formidable weapons against most of the biological materials because of their intrinsic nature. By nature too, neurons are particularly sensitive to oxidation because of their high polyunsaturated fatty acid content, weak antioxidant defense and high oxygen consumption. Thus, the overproduction of ROS in neurons appears as particularly deleterious and the mechanisms involved in oxidative degradation of biomolecules are numerous and complexes. This review highlights the production and regulation of ROS, their chemical properties, both from kinetic and thermodynamic points of view, the links between them, and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases.",Machine Learning Application for Rupture Risk Assessment in Small-Sized Intracranial Aneurysm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096607,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 17,"The assessment of rupture probability is crucial to identifying at risk intracranial aneurysms (IA) in patients harboring multiple aneurysms.

Our system showed a sensitivity of 78.76% (95% CI: 72.30%-84.30%), a specificity of 72.15% (95% CI: 60.93%-81.65%), and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76.84% (95% CI: 71.36%-81.72%) in aneurysm rupture predictions. The area under the ROC (AUROC) in the CNN was 0.755 (95% CI: 0.699%-0.805%), better than that obtained from a human evaluator (AUROC: 0.537; p < 0.001). The CNN-based prediction system was feasible to assess rupture risk in small-sized aneurysms with diagnostic accuracy superior to human evaluators. Additional studies based on a large data set are necessary to enhance diagnostic accuracy and to facilitate clinical application.",Colloidal Silver Induces Cytoskeleton Reorganization and E-Cadherin Recruitment at Cell-Cell Contacts in HaCaT Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096606,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Up until the first half of the 20th century, silver found significant employment in medical applications, particularly in the healing of open wounds, thanks to its antibacterial and antifungal properties. Wound repair is a complex and dynamic biological process regulated by several pathways that cooperate to restore tissue integrity and homeostasis. To facilitate healing, injuries need to be promptly treated. Recently, the interest in alternatives to antibiotics has been raised given the widespread phenomenon of antibiotic resistance. Among these alternatives, the use of silver appears to be a valid option, so a resurgence in its use has been recently observed. In particular, in contrast to ionic silver, colloidal silver, a suspension of metallic silver particles, shows antibacterial activity displaying less or no toxicity. However, the human health risks associated with exposure to silver nanoparticles (NP) appear to be conflicted, and some studies have suggested that it could be toxic in different cellular contexts. These potentially harmful effects of silver NP depend on various parameters including NP size, which commonly range from 1 to 100 nm. In this study, we analyzed the effect of a colloidal silver preparation composed of very small and homogeneous nanoparticles of 0.62 nm size, smaller than those previously tested. We found no adverse effect on the cell proliferation of HaCaT cells, even at high NP concentration. Time-lapse microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that this preparation of colloidal silver strongly increased cell migration, re-modeled the cytoskeleton, and caused recruitment of E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions of human cultured keratinocytes."

This has led to a considerable market opportunity for botanical insecticides. In this scenario, our study investigated the potential of selected bioactive monoterpenoids, carvacrol and thymol, as safe and effective tools to control the West Nile vector Culex pipiens. Furthermore, the combined effect of thymol-carvacrol mixtures and their possible interactions were assessed. Methods: For determining larvicidal and ovicidal 50% lethal concentration (LC50), each monoterpenoid was tested at different concentrations (5-500 mg/L). Then, the fixed ratio method was used for evaluating their combinational efficacy. Results: Carvacrol was more toxic against larvae of Cx. pipiens, with a LC50 value of 14 mg/L, whereas thymol exhibited a LC50 value of 49 mg/L. Comparable trends of efficacy were observed when toxicity on Cx. pipiens eggs was investigated, with LC50 values of 7 and 13 mg/L for carvacrol and thymol, respectively. In combinational toxicity assays, the mixture thymol-carvacrol at 1:4 ratio achieved a synergistic effect against larvae of Cx. pipiens, whereas an additive effect was observed on eggs. Other ratios showed antagonistic effects. Conclusions: Overall, our findings pointed out that the 1:4 ratio of thymol-carvacrol blend can enhance the insecticidal efficacy on Cx. pipiens young instars and can be considered further as active ingredient for developing botanical insecticides to be used in mosquito control operations.",Nutritional Modulation of Immune and Central Nervous System Homeostasis: The Role of Diet in Development of Neuroinflammation and Neurological Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096592,Nutrients,2019 05 17,"The gut-microbiome-brain axis is now recognized as an essential part in the regulation of systemic metabolism and homeostasis. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that dietary patterns can influence the development of metabolic alterations and inflammation through the effects of nutrients on a multitude of variables, including microbiome composition, release of microbial products, gastrointestinal signaling molecules, and neurotransmitters. These signaling molecules are, in turn, implicated in the regulation of the immune system, either promoting or inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expansion of specific leukocyte subpopulations, such as Th17 and Treg cells, which are relevant in the development of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions. Metabolic diseases, like obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, are related to inadequate dietary patterns and promote variations in the aforementioned signaling pathways in patients with these conditions, which have been linked to alterations in neurological functions and mental health. Thus, maintenance of adequate dietary patterns should be an essential component of any strategy aiming to prevent neurological pathologies derived from systemic metabolic alterations. The present review summarizes current knowledge on the role of nutrition in the modulation of the immune system and its impact in the development of neuroinflammation and neurological disease.",Antioxidant Activities of Sorghum Kafirin Alcalase Hydrolysates and Membrane/Gel Filtrated Fractions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096591,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Sorghum has a significant amount of proteins, especially kafirin; however, limited information is available on evaluating its potential for peptide antioxidants. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the effects of two key variables, enzyme-to-substrate ratio and reaction time on kafirin hydrolysis using Alcalase; (2) evaluate the antioxidant performances of the hydrolysates and fractions from membrane ultrafiltration and gel filtration; and (3) identify peptide sequences in the antioxidant fraction using MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Kafirin hydrolysates prepared at enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 0.4 Au/g and 4 h had a good balance of antioxidant activity, yield, and economic efficiency. Medium-sized fraction of hydrolysates (5-10 kDa) from membrane filtration possessed the highest antioxidant activities among various fractions. The fraction also unveiled a good inhibition effect against lipid oxidation in emulsion and ground meat systems. Smaller-sized fraction (F3) collected through gel-filtration chromatography had significantly stronger antioxidant activities than other fractions, and 26 representative peptide sequences were identified in the fraction.",Characterization of a Novel Megalocytivirus Isolated from European Chub (Squalius cephalus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096590,Viruses,2019 05 17,"A novel virus from moribund European chub (Squalius cephalus) was isolated on epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. Transmission electron microscopic examination revealed abundant non-enveloped, hexagonal virus particles in the cytoplasm of infected EPC cells consistent with an iridovirus. Illumina MiSeq sequence data enabled the assembly and annotation of the full genome (128,216 bp encoding 108 open reading frames) of the suspected iridovirus. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses based on 25 iridovirus core genes supported the European chub iridovirus (ECIV) as being the sister species to the recently-discovered scale drop disease virus (SDDV), which together form the most basal megalocytivirus clade. Genetic analyses of the ECIV major capsid protein and ATPase genes revealed the greatest nucleotide identity to members of the genus Megalocytivirus including SDDV. These data support ECIV as a novel member within the genus Megalocytivirus. Experimental challenge studies are needed to fulfill River's postulates and determine whether ECIV induces the pathognomonic microscopic lesions (i.e., megalocytes with basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions) observed in megalocytivirus infections.",A New Angular Light Scattering Measurement of Particulate Matter Mass Concentration for Homogeneous Spherical Particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096589,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Under the condition of ultra-low emission for power plants, the particulate matter concentration is significantly lower than that of typical power plants a decade ago, which posed new challenges for the particulate matter monitoring of stationary emission. The monitoring of particulate matter mass concentration based on ensemble light scattering has been found affected by particle size. Thus, this study develops a method of using the scattering angular distribution to obtain the real-time particle size, and then correct the particulate matter concentration with the real-time measured particle size. In this study, a real-time aerosol concentration and particle size measurement setup is constructed with a fixed detector at the forward direction and a rotating detector. The mass concentration is measured by the fixed detector, and the particle size is measured from the intensity ratio of the two detectors. The simulations show that the particle size has power law functionality with the angular spacing of the ripple structure according to Mie theory. Four quartz aerosols with different particle size are tested during the experiment, and the particle size measured from the ripple width is compared with the mass median size measured by an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI). Both techniques have the same measurement tendency, and the measurement deviation by the ripple width method compared with ELPI is less than 15%. Finally, the measurement error of the real-time mass concentration is reduced from 38% to 18% with correction of the simultaneously measured particle size when particle size has changed.",Effects of Cast-Iron Surface Texturing on the Anti-Scuffing Performance under Starved Lubrication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096588,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Advances in heavy-duty diesel engine designs place higher demands on the friction and wear performance of the piston ring and cylinder liner (PRCL) interface. The potential of using micro-textures machined on the whole stroke of a cast-iron cylinder liner was investigated in this work. A set of running-in and starved lubrication experiments was performed using a custom reciprocating test rig that imparts a combination of combustion-level pressures and the resulting impacts. Based on a comparison of micro-dimple parameters, the friction coefficient for the running-in period at the shocking dead center was the smallest at a designed combination of 1000-μm diameter, 22% area fraction, and arrangement with half-radius intersecting distance of two adjacent micro-dimple columns. The non-scuffing time under starvation was the longest at a designed combination of the following parameters: 800 μm diameter, 22% area fraction, and quarter-radius intersecting distance arrangement. From finite element analysis, it was found that stress concentrates at the micro-dimple periphery and at the connections between adjacent micro-dimples. However, surface topography examination showed that scuffing initiates in the non-dimpled regions between the micro-dimpled columns rather than at their edges. Finally, under reciprocating motion, micro-dimples can collect wear debris to inhibit further propagation of scuffing in the micro-dimpled region.","A 2-Year Single-Centre Audit on Antibiotic Resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae Strains from an Intensive Care Unit and Other Wards in a General Public Hospital in Greece.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096587,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Hospital-acquired infections, particularly in the critical care setting, are becoming increasingly common during the last decade, with Gram-negative bacterial infections presenting the highest incidence among them. Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality, with significant direct and indirect costs resulting from long hospitalization due to antibiotic failure. As treatment options become limited, antimicrobial stewardship programs aim to optimize the appropriate use of currently available antimicrobial agents and decrease hospital costs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the most common resistant bacteria encountered in intensive care units (ICUs) and other wards. To establish preventive measures, it is important to know the prevalence of Gram-negative isolated bacteria and antibiotic resistance profiles in each ward separately, compared with ICUs. In our single centre study, we compared the resistance levels per antibiotic of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and K.pneumoniae clinical strains between the ICU and other facilities during a 2-year period in one of the largest public tertiary hospitals in Greece. The analysis revealed a statistically significant higher antibiotic resistance of the three bacteria in the ICU isolates compared with those from other wards. ICU strains of P. aeruginosa presented the highest resistance rates to gentamycin (57.97%) and cefepime (56.67%), followed by fluoroquinolones (55.11%) and carbapenems (55.02%), while a sensitivity rate of 97.41% was reported to colistin. A high resistance rate of over 80% of A. baumannii isolates to most classes of antibiotics was identified in both the ICU environment and regular wards, with the lowest resistance rates reported to colistin (53.37% in ICU versus an average value of 31.40% in the wards). Statistically significant higher levels of resistance to most antibiotics were noted in ICU isolates of K. pneumoniae compared with non-ICU isolates, with the highest difference-up to 48.86%-reported to carbapenems. The maximum overall antibiotic resistance in our ICU was reported for Acinetobacter spp. (93.00%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (72.30%) and Pseudomonas spp. (49.03%).",Pulsed Laser Fabrication of TiO2 Buffer Layers for Dye Sensitized Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096586,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"We report on the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells with a TiO2 buffer layer between the transparent conductive oxide substrate and the mesoporous TiO2 film, in order to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency of the device. The buffer layer was fabricated by pulsed laser deposition whereas the mesoporous film by the doctor blade method, using TiO2 paste obtained by the sol-gel technique. The buffer layer was deposited in either oxygen (10 Pa and 50 Pa) or argon (10 Pa and 50 Pa) onto transparent conducting oxide glass kept at room temperature. The cross-section scanning electron microscopy image showed differences in layer morphology and thickness, depending on the deposition conditions. Transmission electron microscopy studies of the TiO2 buffer layers indicated that films consisted of grains with typical diameters of 10 nm to 30 nm. We found that the photovoltaic conversion efficiencies, determined under standard air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) conditions, of the solar cells with a buffer layer are more than two times larger than those of the standard cells. The best performance was reached for buffer layers deposited at 10 Pa O2. We discuss the processes that take place in the device and emphasize the role of the brush-like buffer layer in the performance increase.",Dextran-Coated Zinc-Doped Hydroxyapatite for Biomedical Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096585,Polymers,2019 05 17,"Dextran-coated zinc-doped hydroxyapatite (ZnHApD) was synthesized by an adapted sol-gel method. The stability of ZnHApD nanoparticles in an aqueous solution was analyzed using ultrasonic measurements. The analysis of the evolution in time of the attenuation for each of the frequencies was performed. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations exhibited that no impurity was found. The morphology, size and size distribution of the ZnHApD sample was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The TEM and SEM results showed that the ZnHApD particles have an ellipsoidal shape and a narrow distribution of sizes. The cell growth and toxicity of HEK-293 cells were investigated on the ZnHApD solution for four different concentrations and analyzed after 24 and 48 h. The ZnHApD solution presented a non-toxic activity against HEK-293 cells for all analyzed concentrations. The antibacterial assay revealed that all the tested microorganisms were inhibited by the ZnHApD dispersion after 24 and 48 h of incubation. It was observed that the effect of the ZnHApD solution on bacteria growth depended on the bacterial strain. The Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 bacterial strain was the most sensitive, as a growth inhibition in the presence of 0.075 μg/mL ZnHApD in the culture medium was observed.",Colour Constancy for Image of Non-Uniformly Lit Scenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096584,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Digital camera sensors are designed to record all incident light from a captured scene, but they are unable to distinguish between the colour of the light source and the true colour of objects. The resulting captured image exhibits a colour cast toward the colour of light source. This paper presents a colour constancy algorithm for images of scenes lit by non-uniform light sources. The proposed algorithm uses a histogram-based algorithm to determine the number of colour regions. It then applies the K-means++ algorithm on the input image, dividing the image into its segments. The proposed algorithm computes the Normalized Average Absolute Difference (NAAD) for each segment and uses it as a measure to determine if the segment has sufficient colour variations. The initial colour constancy adjustment factors for each segment with sufficient colour variation is calculated. The Colour Constancy Adjustment Weighting Factors (CCAWF) for each pixel of the image are determined by fusing the CCAWFs of the segments, weighted by their normalized Euclidian distance of the pixel from the center of the segments. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the statistical techniques and its images exhibit significantly higher subjective quality to those of the learning-based methods. In addition, the execution time of the proposed algorithm is comparable to statistical-based techniques and is much lower than those of the state-of-the-art learning-based methods."

Important members of the RHO GTPase family are capable of controlling cytoskeleton conformation and altering motility characteristics of cells. There is a well-known relationship between small GTPases and the PI3K/AKT pathway. Endothelial cell migration can lead to angiogenesis, which is highly linked to wound healing processes. Phenolics, flavonoids, and anthocyanins are major groups of phytochemicals and are abundant in many natural products. Their antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, angiogenenic, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective properties have been extensively documented.

Resistance mutations are often identified one-at-a-time by studying viral evolution within treated patients or during viral growth in the presence of a drug in cell culture. Such approaches have previously mapped resistance to enfuvirtide, the only clinically approved HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, to enfuvirtide's binding site in the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) of the Envelope (Env) transmembrane domain as well as a limited number of allosteric sites. Here, we sought to better delineate the genotypic determinants of resistance throughout Env. We used deep mutational scanning to quantify the effect of all single-amino-acid mutations to the subtype A BG505 Env on resistance to enfuvirtide. We identified both previously characterized and numerous novel resistance mutations in the NHR. Additional resistance mutations clustered in other regions of Env conformational intermediates, suggesting they may act during different fusion steps by altering fusion kinetics and/or exposure of the enfuvirtide binding site. This complete map of resistance sheds light on the diverse mechanisms of enfuvirtide resistance and highlights the utility of using deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map potential drug resistance mutations.",Monitoring Chemical Processes Using Judicious Fusion of Multi-Rate Sensor Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096571,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"With the emergence of Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, an increasing number of hardware and software sensors have been implemented in chemical production processes for monitoring key variables related to product quality and process safety. The accuracy of individual sensors can be easily impaired by a variety of factors. To improve process monitoring accuracy and reliability, a sensor fusion scheme based on Bayesian inference is proposed. The proposed method is capable of combining multi-rate sensor data and eliminating the spurious signals. The efficacy of the method has been verified using a process implemented at the Dow Chemical Company.

They are important for cell-cell interactions, proliferation and much more. Here, we emphasize the glycan-mediated interactions between pathogens and host cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responsible for a huge number of nosocomial infections, is especially the focus when it comes to glycan-derivatives as pathoblockers. We present a microwave assisted protecting group free synthesis of glycomonomers based on lactose, melibiose and fucose. The monomers were polymerized in a precipitation polymerization in the presence of NiPAm to form crosslinked glyco-nanogels. The influence of reaction parameters like crosslinker type or stabilizer amount was investigated. The gels were characterized in lectin binding studies using model lectins and showed size and composition-dependent inhibition of lectin binding. Due to multivalent presentation of glycans in the gel, the inhibition was clearly stronger than with unmodified saccharides, which was compared after determination of the glycan loading. First studies with Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed a surprising influence on the secretion of virulence factors. Functional glycogels may be in the future potent alternatives or adjuvants for antibiotic treatment of infections based on glycan interactions between host and pathogen.",Cyclodextrin⁻Amphiphilic Copolymer Supramolecular Assemblies for the Ocular Delivery of Natamycin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096569,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Natamycin is the only drug approved for fungal keratitis treatment, but its low water solubility and low ocular penetration limit its efficacy. The purpose of this study was to overcome these limitations by encapsulating the drug in single or mixed micelles and poly(pseudo)rotaxanes. Soluplus and Pluronic P103 dispersions were prepared in 0.9% NaCl and pH 6.4 buffer, with or without α-cyclodextrin (αCD; 10% w/v), and characterized through particle size, zeta potential, solubilization efficiency, rheological properties, ocular tolerance, in vitro drug diffusion, and ex vivo permeation studies. Soluplus micelles (90-103 nm) and mixed micelles (150-110 nm) were larger than Pluronic P103 ones (16-20 nm), but all showed zeta potentials close to zero. Soluplus, Pluronic P103, and their mixed micelles increased natamycin solubility up to 6.00-fold, 3.27-fold, and 2.77-fold, respectively. Soluplus dispersions and poly(pseudo)rotaxanes exhibited in situ gelling capability, and they transformed into weak gels above 30 °C. All the formulations were non-irritant according to Hen's Egg Test on the Chorioallantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) assay. Poly(pseudo)rotaxanes facilitated drug accumulation into the cornea and sclera, but led to lower natamycin permeability through the sclera than the corresponding micelles. Poly(pseudo)rotaxanes made from mixed micelles showed intermediate natamycin diffusion coefficients and permeability values between those of Pluronic P103-based and Soluplus-based poly(pseudo)rotaxanes. Therefore, the preparation of mixed micelles may be a useful tool to regulate drug release and enhance ocular permeability.",Effect of Ground Transportation on Adrenocortical Activity in Prepuberal Female Mice from Five Different Genetic Backgrounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096568,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 17,"Specific experimental protocols necessitate transportation, a potentially stressful event that could confound results. We determined adrenocortical activity by measuring fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs), as a stress marker, in prepuberal (three-week old) female C57BL/6J, C57BL/6NCrl, FVB/NCrl, Crl:CD1(ICR), and BALB/cAnCrl mice. On each transport day, five female cage mates per genetic background were weaned and transported in stable groups via truck from the breeding to the research facility. Fecal pellets were collected on Days 0, 1, and 4. Mice were superovulated for embryo production to determine if repeated fecal collection impacts this procedure. The average duration of transportation over 600 km and from packing to unpacking of mice was 7.24 and 22.62 h, respectively. FCM levels increased from Day 0 to Day 1 and decreased on Day 4 in all genetic backgrounds except in FVB/NCrl, but only B6N showed significantly higher FCM levels on Day 1. Furthermore, embryo production was not affected by repeated feces collection. The results show that weaning and immediate transport of prepuberal mice from the breeding to the research facility led to temporal and genetic background-dependent increases of adrenocortical activity in four of the five genetic backgrounds investigated, which returned to baseline levels within four days.",The Crowded Crosstalk between Cancer Cells and Stromal Microenvironment in Gynecological Malignancies: Biological Pathways and Therapeutic Implication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096567,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 17,"The tumor microenvironment plays a pillar role in the progression and the distance dissemination of cancer cells in the main malignancies affecting women-epithelial ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer and cervical cancer. Their milieu acquires specific properties thanks to intense crosstalk between stromal and cancer cells, leading to a vicious circle. Fibroblasts, pericytes, lymphocytes and tumor associated-macrophages orchestrate most of the biological pathways. In epithelial ovarian cancer, high rates of activated pericytes determine a poorer prognosis, defining a common signature promoting ovarian cancer proliferation, local invasion and distant spread. Mesenchymal cells also release chemokines and cytokines under hormonal influence, such as estrogens that drive most of the endometrial cancers. Interestingly, the architecture of the cervical cancer milieu is shaped by the synergy of high-risk Human Papilloma Virus oncoproteins and the activity of stromal estrogen receptor α. Lymphocytes represent a shield against cancer cells but some cell subpopulation could lead to immunosuppression, tumor growth and dissemination. Cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can be eluded by over-adapted cancer cells in a scenario of immune-tolerance driven by T-regulatory cells. Therefore, the tumor microenvironment has a high translational potential offering many targets for biological and immunological therapies.",The Impact of an Outdoor and Adventure Sports Course on the Wellbeing of Recovering UK Military Personnel: An Exploratory Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096566,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"UK military personnel have faced increased demands over the last three decades; these have affected their wellbeing and caused multiple physical and mental health problems. Currently, bespoke rehabilitation systems may recommend participation in sports programmes. Although research attention has been drawn to the short-term positive effects of these programmes, their long-term impact on psychological wellbeing is unknown. To address this gap, the current study explored the long-term impact of a sports programme on UK military personnel's ability to make changes in their day-to-day life through the lens of psychological wellbeing. For this purpose, UK military personnel (n = 97) completed an online survey aiming to provide a quantitative and qualitative picture of their experiences of an outdoor and adventure sports programme, underpinned by the basic psychological needs theory, six months following completion. Findings suggest that 75% of respondents found that the course was useful for facilitating adaptive changes.

A sustainable alternative for the production of bioactive plant compounds are plant biofactories based on cell cultures and organs. In addition, plant extracts from biofactories have significant advantages over those obtained from plants, since they are free of contamination by microorganisms, herbicides and pesticides, and they provide more stable levels of active ingredients. In this context, we report the establishment of Satureja khuzistanica cell cultures able to produce high amounts of rosmarinic acid (RA). The production of this phytopharmaceutical was increased when the cultures were elicited with coronatine and scaled up to a benchtop bioreactor. S. khuzistanica extracts enriched in RA were found to reduce the viability of cancer cell lines, increasing the sub-G0/G1 cell population and the activity of caspase-8 in MCF-7 cells, which suggest that S. khuzistanica extracts can induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells through activation of the extrinsic pathway. In addition, our findings indicate that other compounds in S. khuzistanica extracts may act synergistically to potentiate the anticancer activity of RA.",Leptin and Ghrelin in Excessive Gestational Weight Gain-Association between Mothers and Offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096564,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 17,"Two-thirds of pregnant women exceed gestational weight gain recommendations. Excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) appears to be associated with offspring's complications induced by mechanisms that are still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether umbilical cord leptin (UCL) and ghrelin (UCG) concentrations are altered in full-term neonates born to EGWG mothers and whether neonatal anthropometric measurements correlate with UCL and UCG levels and maternal serum ghrelin and leptin as well as urine ghrelin concentrations. The study subjects were divided into two groups, 28 healthy controls and 38 patients with EGWG. Lower UCL and UCG levels were observed in neonates born to healthy mothers but only in male newborns. In the control group UCG concentrations correlated positively with neonatal birth weight, body length and head circumference. In the control group maternal serum ghrelin levels correlated negatively with neonatal birth weight, body length and head circumference as well as positively with chest circumference. In the EGWG group UCG concentrations correlated negatively with neonatal birth weight and birth body length. UCL correlated positively with birth body length in EGWG group and negatively with head circumference in the control group. In conclusion, EGWG is associated with disturbances in UCL and UCG concentrations."

The present study evaluated the effect of these Prdx6-inhibitory peptides (PIP) in a mouse (C57Bl/6) model of acute lung injury following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. All three peptides (PIP-1, 2 and 3) similarly inhibited the production of reactive O2 species (ROS) in isolated mouse lungs as detected by the oxidation of Amplex red. PIP-2 inhibited both the increased phospholipase A2 activity of Prdx6 and lung reactive oxygen species (ROS) production following treatment of mice with intratracheal LPS (5 µg/g body wt.). Pre-treatment of mice with PIP-2 prevented LPS-mediated lung injury while treatment with PIP-2 at 12 or 16 h after LPS administration led to reversal of lung injury when evaluated 12 or 8 h later, respectively. With a higher dose of LPS (15 µg/g body wt.), mortality was 100% at 48 h in untreated mice but only 28% in mice that were treated at 12-24 h intervals, with PIP-2 beginning at 12 h after LPS administration. Treatment with PIP-2 also markedly decreased mortality after intraperitoneal LPS (15 µg/g body wt.), used as a model of sepsis. This study shows the dramatic effectiveness of a peptide inhibitor of Prdx6 against lung injury and mouse mortality in LPS models. We propose that the PIP nonapeptides may be a useful modality to prevent or to treat human ALI.",Towards a Stable and High-Performance Hindered Phenol/Polymer-Based Damping Material Through Structure Optimization and Damping Mechanism Revelation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096550,Polymers,2019 05 17,"Although hindered phenol/polymer-based hybrid damping materials, with excellent damping performance, attract more and more attention, the poor stability of hindered phenol limits the application of such promising materials. To solve this problem, a linear hindered phenol with amorphous state and low polarity was synthesized and related polyurethane-based hybrid materials were prepared in this study. The structure and state of the hindered phenol were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The existence of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (HBs) between hindered phenol and polyurethane was confirmed by FT-IR, and the amorphous state of the hybrids was confirmed by XRD. Moreover, by a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and dynamic mechanical analysis, the relationship between the structure optimization of the hindered phenol and the high damping performance of the hybrids was quantitatively revealed. By constructing the synthetic hindered phenol, the intramolecular HBs between hindered phenols were restricted, while the strength and concentration of the intermolecular HBs increased by increasing the amount of hindered phenol. Thus, intermolecular interactions were enhanced, which lead to the compact chain packing of polyurethane, extended chain packing of hindered phenol, and good dispersion of hindered phenol in polyurethane. Therefore, the stability of the hindered phenol and the damping properties of the hybrids were both improved. The experiment results are expected to provide some useful information for the design and fabrication of high-performance polymeric damping materials.","Impact of Five Succinate Dehydrogenase Inhibitors on DON Biosynthesis of Fusarium asiaticum, Causing Fusarium Head Blight in Wheat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096549,Toxins,2019 05 17,"Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a class of mycotoxin produced in cereal crops infected with Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC). In China, FGSC mainly includes Fusarium asiaticum and F. graminearum. DON belongs to the trichothecenes and poses a serious threat to the safety and health of humans and animals. Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) are a class of fungicides that act on succinate dehydrogenase and inhibit the respiration of pathogenic fungi. In this study, the fungicidal activities of five SDHIs, including fluopyram, flutolanil, boscalid, benzovindiflupyr, and fluxapyroxad, against FGSC were determined based on mycelial growth and spore germination inhibition methods. The five SDHIs exhibited better inhibitory activities in spore germination than mycelial growth. Fluopyram exhibited a higher inhibitory effect in mycelial growth and spore germination in comparison to the other four SDHIs. In addition, the biological characteristics of F. asiaticum as affected by the five SDHIs were determined. We found that these five SDHIs decreased DON, pyruvic acid and acetyl-CoA production, isocitrate dehydrogenase mitochondrial (ICDHm) and SDH activities, and NADH and ATP content of F. asiaticum but increased the citric acid content. In addition, TRI5 gene expression was inhibited, and the formation of toxisomes was disrupted by the five SDHIs, further confirming that SDHIs can decrease DON biosynthesis of F. asiaticum. Thus, we concluded that SDHIs may decrease DON biosynthesis of F. asiaticum by inhibiting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Overall, the findings from the study will provide important references for managing Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by FGSC and reducing DON contamination in F. asiaticum-infected wheat grains.",The Association between Green and Black Tea Consumption on Successful Aging: A Combined Analysis of the ATTICA and MEDiterranean ISlands (MEDIS) Epidemiological Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096548,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Tea is one of the most-widely consumed beverages in the world with a number of different beneficial health effects, mainly ascribed to the polyphenolic content of the tea catechins. The aim of this study was to examine the consumption of green, black, or no tea, in relation to the previously validated successful ageing index (SAI; higher values ""healthier"" ageing) in a combined analysis of adults aged >50 years old from the ATTICA (n = 1128 adults from Athens, Greece metropolitan area) and the MEDiterranean Islands Study (MEDIS) (n = 2221 adults from various Greek island and Mani) studies. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and coffee consumption, green tea was positively associated with SAI (b ± SE: 0.225 ± 0.055, p < 0.001), while black tea was negatively associated with SAI (unstandardized b coefficient ± Standard error: -0.807 ± 0.054, p < 0.001). Green tea (vs black tea) consumption, had higher odds of a SAI of over 3.58 out of 10 (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.38-2.28). Green tea consumption was also associated with higher levels of physical activity (p < 0.001) and reduced likelihood of hypertension (p = 0.006) compared with black tea. Two possible mechanisms are that green tea possesses high levels of catechins such as (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate and l-theanine compared with black tea. Therefore, the present analysis supports both the role of green tea constituents in successful ageing, as well as its role as an important component of an overall healthy diet in adults aged 50 years and over from these two epidemiological studies.","Hydrogen Desorption Properties of LiBH4/xLiAlH4 (x = 0.5, 1, 2) Composites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096547,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"A detailed analysis of the dehydrogenation mechanism of LiBH4/xLiAlH4 (x = 0.5, 1, 2) composites was performed by thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), mass spectral analysis (MS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), along with kinetic investigations using a Sievert-type apparatus. The results show that the dehydrogenation pathway of LiBH4/xLiAlH4 had a four-step character. The experimental dehydrogenation amount did not reach the theoretical expectations, because the products such as AlB2 and LiAl formed a passivation layer on the surface of Al and the dehydrogenation reactions associated with Al could not be sufficiently carried out. Kinetic investigations discovered a nonlinear relationship between the activation energy (Ea) of dehydrogenation reactions associated with Al and the ratio x, indicating that the Ea was determined both by the concentration of Al produced by the decomposition of LiAlH4 and the amount of free surface of it. Therefore, the amount of effective contact surface of Al is the rate-determining factor for the overall dehydrogenation of the LiBH4/xLiAlH4 composites.",Angry Drivers Take Risky Decisions: Evidence from Neurophysiological Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096546,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 17,"The present study investigated the risk-taking behaviors of angry drivers, which were coincidentally measured via behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. We manipulated a driving scenario that concerned a Go/No-Go decision at an intersection when the controlling traffic light was in its yellow phase. This protocol was based upon the underlying format of the Iowa gambling task. Variation in the anger level was induced through task frustration. The data of twenty-four drivers were analyzed via behavioral and neural recordings, and P300 was specifically extracted from EEG traces. In addition, the behavioral performance was indexed by the percentage of high-risk choices minus the number of the low-risk choices taken, which identified the risk-taking propensity. Results confirmed a significant main effect of anger on the decisions taken. The risk-taking propensity decreased across the sequence of trial blocks in baseline assessments. However, with anger, the risk-taking propensity increased across the trial regimen. Drivers in anger state also showed a higher mean amplitude of P300 than that in baseline state. Additionally, high-risk choices evoked larger P300 amplitude than low-risk choices during the anger state. Moreover, the P300 amplitude of high-risk choices was significantly larger in the anger state than the baseline state. The negative feedback induced larger P300 amplitude than that recorded in positive feedback trials. The results corroborated that the drivers exhibited higher risk-taking propensity when angry although they were sensitive to the inherent risk-reward evaluations within the scenario. To reduce this type of risk-taking, we proposed some effective/affective intervention methods.",Identification and Characterization of Novel Fusion Genes with Potential Clinical Applications in Mexican Children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096545,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 17,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common type of childhood cancer worldwide. Mexico City has one of the highest incidences and mortality rates of this cancer. It has previously been recognized that chromosomal translocations are important in cancer etiology. Specific fusion genes have been considered as important treatment targets in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The present research aimed at the identification and characterization of novel fusion genes with potential clinical implications in Mexican children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The RNA-sequencing approach was used. Four fusion genes not previously reported were identified: CREBBP-SRGAP2B, DNAH14-IKZF1, ETV6-SNUPN, ETV6-NUFIP1. Although a fusion gene is not sufficient to cause leukemia, it could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Notably, these new translocations were found in genes encoding for hematopoietic transcription factors which are known to play an important role in leukemogenesis and disease prognosis such as IKZF1, CREBBP, and ETV6. In addition, they may have an impact on the prognosis of Mexican pediatric patients with ALL, with the potential to be included in the current risk stratification schemes or used as therapeutic targets.",Impact of Tetrazolium Ionic Liquid Thermal Decomposition in Solvothermal Reaction on the Remarkable Photocatalytic Properties of TiO2 Particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096544,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 17,"Ionic liquids (ILs) could serve as a structuring agent, a solvent, or a source of dopant during solvothermal synthesis of semiconductors particles. To understand the role of IL during formation of TiO2 particles, it is necessary to study the stability of this IL in solvothermal synthesis conditions, as well as studying the surface properties of formed TiO2 particles. In view of this, the effect of the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride IL ([TPTZ][Cl]) thermal decomposition during the solvothermal reaction and IL content in the reaction system on photoactivity of TiO2 microparticles has been systematically investigated. The samples obtained by using [TPTZ][Cl] exhibited remarkable photocatalytic properties in phenol degradation reaction under visible light. HPLC analysis of the solvothermal reaction medium and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of TiO2 particles revealed that [TPTZ][Cl] was decomposed completely and was incorporated into the TiO2 lattice. Generally, increasing the reaction time (1, 4, 12, and 24 h) promoted the TiO2 microspheres formation, as well as raising the visible light-induced photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts. Longer reaction time was also accompanied by an increase in the efficiency of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride decomposition. The properties of the photocatalysts were investigated by means of UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), BET surface area measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis, and XPS.",KLHL3 single-nucleotide polymorphism is associated with essential hypertension in Chinese Han population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096542,Medicine,2019 05 29,"Hypertension, including secondary and essential hypertension (EH) variants, is a multifactorial disease, affecting more than one billion people worldwide. Secondary hypertension results from mutations in the putative gene KLHL3 (Kelch-like protein 3); however, it has not been reported whether the KLHL3 gene polymorphisms are associated with EH. Here, we investigated the association between KLHL3 (rs2301708 and rs7444370) polymorphisms and EH in the Chinese Han population.This case-control study included 522 subjects-260 patients with EH and 262 normotensive controls matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and levels of Na, K, and Cl. The distribution of functional rs2301708 and rs7444370 polymorphisms within the KLHL3 gene was assessed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).There was no significant difference in allelic and genotypic frequencies of KLHL3 rs2301708 between the EH and normotensive groups; however, the rs7444370 T allele and CT genotype in females was significantly associated with a protective effect against EH (P = .001, P = .002; P = .019, P = .052), and the haplotype CT of rs2301708 and rs7444370 among females in the EH group was less than in the normotensive group (P = .000; P = .007).The KLHL3 rs7444370 variant could be a protective factor in the pathogenesis of females' EH.",Efficacy of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 as second-line treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma patient with sorafenib resistance: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096541,Medicine,2019 05 29,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common cancers worldwide, is an aggressive tumor with very poor prognosis.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether medication adherence can decrease the risk of dementia in COPD.This retrospective study enrolled COPD patients from 1 million beneficiaries randomly sampled from all beneficiaries in Taiwan. We excluded COPD patients not prescribed a bronchodilator or those using theophylline or short-acting β2-agonists for <1 year. To ensure a sufficient observation period, we excluded patients diagnosed with dementia within 1 year after the diagnosis of COPD or those prescribed bronchodilators after the diagnosis of dementia. Patients with COPD and a history of severe mental disorders were also excluded.There was a total of 13,015 first diagnoses of COPD from 1998 to 2012, of whom 9,489 had a proportion of days covered (PDC) <80% and 1,206 had a PDC ≥80% before matching.

This retrospective study aimed to compare the predictive value of metastatic lymph nodes (MNs), lymph node ratio (LNR), resected lymph nodes (RNs), and negative lymph nodes (NNs) with the currently used pathologic nodal (pN) staging category.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1019 consecutive NSCLC patients treated with complete resection in a single institution. Prognostic values of various lymph node factors were evaluated by analysis of univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, and the results were compared with those using the location-based pN stage classification.The median follow-up duration was 47 months. During this period, 353 cases of cancer recurrence and 337 deaths were reported. Multivariate cox analysis indicated that both pN and NN categories were independent predictors of patient survival. The patients were divided into six groups on the basis of pN and NN categories. The survival rates of the groups were as follows: pN0, NN≥8, 81.4%; pN0, NN<8, 73.8%; pN1, NN≥8, 61.4%; pN1, NN<8, 54.2%; pN2, NN≥8, 48.4%; and pN2>1, NN<8, 35.0%.

There were 7 males and 8 females with an average age of 32.5 years. First, the infection was eradicated completely, and the medullary canals were continuous irrigated for 2-3 weeks. After eradicating the infection tissues, the mean amount of bone defect was 8.7 cm (range, 4.0-16.0 cm). The unilateral consecutive distraction-compression osteosynthesis technique was applied after long-time medullary cavity-wound exclusion surgery. Enumeration data was described by frequency and measurement data by mean. Bone infections were controlled in all patients except 1 patient after the first debridement and irrigation.

The present study was designed to investigate the correlation of the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis with the prognosis of CSCC patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.A total of 117 CSCC patients treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin between May 2015 and April 2017 in the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were retrospectively analyzed. The pathologic diagnosis and classification of CSCC were based on the Guidelines of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The efficacy was defined as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and stability disease (SD). The expressions of survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Ki67 were determined with immunohistochemistry. Data were analyzed with SPSS software.Univariate analysis showed that survivin expression had no correlation with ages, FIGO stage, macroscopic type, lymphovascular invasion, depth of lymphovascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size among 117 CSCC patients. However, survivin expression was positively correlated with pathological grade (R = 0.691, P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that survivin expression was independently correlated with grades (P < .001). In addition, the analysis of correlation indicated that survivin expression is positively correlated with VEGF expression (R = 0.820, P < .001) and Ki67 expression (R = 0.673, P < .001). The numbers (percentages) of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and stability disease (SD) were 11 (9.4%), 91 (77.8%), and 15 (12.8%) respectively after the treatment of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Univariate analysis showed that efficacy of treatment was negatively correlated with pathological grade (R = 0.513, P < .001), Ki67 expression (R = 0.586, P < .001), VEGF expression (R = 0.476, P < .001) and survivin expression (R = 0.519, P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that efficacy of treatment was independently correlated with grades (P = .028), Ki67 (P < .001), and survivin expression (P = .015).The results suggested that survivin expression is negatively correlated with the prognosis of CSCC patients treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin.

Overall and stratification analyses including secular trends and temporal distributions were conducted, odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by applying random-effects model.Thirty-five studies were included. Type 2 diabetes was positively associated with a family history of type 2 diabetes (OR 2.89, 95%CI 2.38-3.49), hypertension (OR 2.73, 95%CI 2.25-3.36), central obesity (OR 2.28, 95%CI 1.94-2.68), dyslipidemia (OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.70-2.91), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 2.18, 95%CI 1.64-2.92), general obesity (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.66-2.18), hypercholesterolemia (OR 1.65, 95%CI 1.32-2.06), smoking (OR 1.26, 95%CI 1.13-1.40), and drinking (OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05-1.36), whereas a negative association with female gender (OR 0.87, 95%CI 0.78-0.97) existed. Except for female gender and drinking, the pooled effects of temporal and spatial stratification for the other five risk factors were consistent with the above results. For temporal stratification, the ORs of general obesity increased gradually during the periods of 1992 to 2005, 2006 to 2010, and 2011 to 2017, while the ORs of a family history declined. For regional stratification, the magnitudes of ORs for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia in northern areas were larger than that in southern areas, while opposite situation occurred for a family history. Except for the factor a family history, provincial results for the other nine risk factors differed from the overall results and among provinces.Effect differences existed for modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors in secular trends and regional distribution, which is of potential public health importance for type 2 diabetes prevention."

This study aimed to evaluate for the first time the interactive effects of high (NH4)2SO4 load and elevated O3 levels on cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) under field conditions. Cauliflower seedlings were treated with 0 (AS0) or 50 (AS50) kg ha-1 (NH4)2SO4 and exposed to ambient (AOZ, ≈20 ppb) or elevated (EOZ, ≈55 ppb) O3 for about one month, in a Free Air O3 Concentration Enrichment (FACE) system. The oligophagous diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella Linnaeus, 1758) showed a clear preference towards the seedlings treated with AS50, which intensively grazed. Plant-herbivore interactions were driven by (NH4)2SO4 availability, rather than O3, via increased nitrogen content in the leaves. Further laboratory bioassays were followed to confirm the validity of these observations using polyphagous Eri silkmoth larvae (Samia ricini) as a biological model in a standardized experimental setup. Choice assays, where larvae could select leaves among leaf samples from the different experimental conditions, and no-choice assays, where larvae could graze leaves from just one experimental condition, were conducted. In the choice assay, the larvae preferred AS50-treated leaves, in agreement with the field observations with diamondback moth. In the no-choice assay, larval body mass growth was inhibited when fed with leaves treated with EOZ and/or AS50. Larvae fed with AS50-treated leaves displayed increased mortality. These observations coincide with higher NO3 and Zn content in AS50-treated leaves. This study shows that plant-herbivore interactions can be driven by (NH4)2SO4 availability, independently of O3, and suggests that high N deposition may have severe health implications in animals consuming such plant tissues. Key message: Plant-herbivore interactions are driven by high (NH4)2SO4 availability, independently of O3.",A simple but robust convergence trajectory controlled method for pressure driven analysis in water distribution system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096428,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"This paper presents a novel convergence trajectory controlled method to perform pressure driven analysis (PDA) in water distribution systems (WDSs).

In addition, two Relaxation Factor section strategies are developed to control the convergence trajectory towards the desired downtrends. The novel methodology is implemented based on EPANET3.0 by modifying the source code which is available in GitHub (https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/epanet-dev). Firstly, the improved code was validated extensively with a benchmark WDS under rigorous boundary conditions. Subsequently, four challenging different size WDSs are also tested in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency. The results illustrate that the proposed method is able to enable the convergence of PDA to be more stable and more robust, even under some extreme abnormal boundary conditions.",Health effects associated with chronic exposure to low-level hydrogen sulfide from geothermoelectric power plants.

The following is a comprehensive summary for these remediation processes: (1) the EK process coupled with nano-Fe3O4/S2O82- oxidation process - Test results have shown that nanoscale Fe3O4 played a significant role in activating persulfate oxidation. Even a recalcitrant compound like di(2‑ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), its concentration in test sediment was reduced to 1.97 mg kg-1, far below the regulatory levels set by Taiwan EPA; (2) the EK process integrated with a novel Fenton-like process catalyzed by nanoscale schwertmannite (nano-SHM) - Test results have revealed that simultaneous injection of nano-SHM slurry and H2O2 into the anode reservoir and sediment compartment is a good practice. 70-99% in removal efficiency was obtained for various target PAEs; (3) enhanced in situ bioremediation coupled with the EK process for promoting the growth of intrinsic microorganisms by adding H2O2 as an oxygen release compound (ORC) - Test results have demonstrated that an intermittent mode of injecting lab-prepared ORC directly into the contaminant zone would be beneficial to the growth of intrinsic microorganisms in test sediment for in situ bioremediation of target PAEs; and (4) coupling of a second-generation ORC (designated 2G-ORC) with the EK-biological process - Test results have proved that 2G-ORC is long-lasting and can be directly utilized as the carbon source and oxygen source for microbial growth resulting in an enhanced biodegradation of PAEs. Except DEHP having a residual concentration of 4 μg kg-1, all other target PAEs in test sediment were totally removed by this novel combined remediation process.",Assessment of environmentally contaminated sediment using a contact assay with early life stage zebrafish (Danio rerio).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096425,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Lake Saint-Louis, a shallow fluvial lake near the western tip of the island of Montreal, QC, Canada is an important spawning ground for many species of fish. Sediments in certain areas of the lake are known to be contaminated with high levels of metals and legacy organic chemicals. To improve our understanding of risk to native fish populations, we conducted a study evaluating levels of sediment contamination and potential effects on early life stage fish. Concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs were several orders of magnitude higher at two industrial sites (B1 and B2) than at a nearby reference site (IP). Concentrations of 32 metals and metalloids were at least 5-fold higher at B1 and B2 than at IP. Moreover, all available interim sediment quality guidelines (ISQGs) were exceeded at the two contaminated sites, while none were exceeded at the reference site. Biological effects were evaluated using a sediment contact assay. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to clean water (control), or to sediment from IP, B1, and B2 until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). Mortality was significantly elevated in fish exposed to the B1, but not the B2 sediment. The frequency of deformities increased with increasing contamination, but this trend was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Genes that are implicated in the response to PAHs, PCBs, dioxins and furans (cyp1a, cyp1b1, ahr2) were significantly elevated in the 120 hpf larvae exposed to the B1 and B2 sediments. Global DNA methylation, and mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress (maft, cat, hmox1, sod2), embryonic development (bmp2b, baf60c), metal exposure (mt2), and DNA repair (gadd45b) were unaffected. Our results suggest that the Beauharnois sector of Lake Saint-Louis is poor quality spawning habitat due to high levels of contamination, and the potential for harmful effects on early life stage fish.",Assessment of urban flood susceptibility using semi-supervised machine learning model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096424,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"In order to identify flood-prone areas with limited flood inventories, a semi-supervised machine learning model-the weakly labeled support vector machine (WELLSVM)-is used to assess urban flood susceptibility in this study.

Urban flood susceptibility is mapped and compared using logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and a support vector machine. Model performances are evaluated using four evaluation indices (accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score) as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results show that WELLSVM can better utilize the spatial information (unlabeled data), and it outperforms all comparison models. The high-quality WELLSVM flood susceptibility map is thus applicable to efficient urban flood management.",Improving waste electric and electronic equipment management at full-scale by using material flow analysis and life cycle assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096423,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"This work has as main objective the analysis of waste from electric and electronic equipment (WEEE or e-waste) management through material flow analysis and life cycle assessment of a full-scale Italian facility that is significant about the e-waste flows treated (9900 t/y) and representative of a developed EU country about the industrial process outline, based on manual dismantling phases and physic-mechanical automatic processes. Three WEEE categories (i.e. R1-Cooling equipment, R2-Large household appliances and R3- TVs and screens) have been chosen with the reason that they are the most abundant in EU. The methodology was based on two end-of-life scenarios: S0-partial recycling of valuable fractions and landfilling of the rest, which is conventional e-waste processing in Italian facilities; S1-complete recycling of valuable fractions, limited incineration and landfilling of the rest, which describes what happens in the considered case study. Mass balance of the three treatment lines showed recycling rate (RR) values equal to: for R1 40% for S0 and 80% for S1; for R2 65% for S0 and 99% for S1; for R3 86% for S0 and 91% for S1, with significant fractions incinerated or landfilled only for R1 treatment line. Life cycle assessment considered transport (post-consumer collection), treatment, recycling, incineration and disposal. As main results, eco-toxicity aquatic potentials referring to marine and fresh water were the most relevant impact categories. In conclusion, recycling (mostly of metals) played a crucial role for environmental benefits, and transport and polyurethane plus rubber incineration for the environmental impacts.",Effectiveness of engineering interventions in decreasing worker exposure to metalworking fluid aerosols.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096422,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Machine industry accounts for the highest proportion of primary industry in Taiwan. Long-term exposure to metalworking fluid aerosols may pose significant threats to the health of workers. The aims of this study were to verify the efficacy of intervention methods in reducing airborne bacterial concentrations as well as effects on aerosol particle size distribution. This study evaluated airborne bacterial concentrations in a large precision machinery factory in Taichung, Taiwan, before and after the implementation of intervention methods. The installation of local exhaust systems and improvement of the operation mode were used as intervention methods. Concentration and size distribution of bacteria in the metal working environment were assessed using Andersen one-stage and six-stage viable impactors, respectively. The analytical results indicate that most bacterial concentrations were less than the recommended concentrations in the indoor air quality standards (500 CFU/m3) proposed by the United States Association of Advancing Occupational and Environmental Health (US ACGIH) before the installation of local exhaust systems. There was no significant difference in bacterial concentrations before and after the installation of the local exhaust and the intervention effect on reducing bacterial exposure was not as expected. The bacterial concentrations were significantly lowered in the Z region after improving the operation mode. The particle size of bioaerosols <7.0 μm was also substantially reduced. Improper operation modes are likely to expose employees to higher concentrations of bacteria within a short time period. It recommends adjusting the metal processing methods and proper use of air spray guns for decreasing high airborne bacterial concentrations exposure.",Study of dissolved oxygen responses to tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal based on Argo and satellite observations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096421,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Effects of tropical cyclones (TCs) on dissolved oxygen (DO) in subsurface waters (20-200 m) over the Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) are examined based on Argo and satellite data. Five TCs (Hudhud, Five, Vardah, Maarutha and Mora) during 2013-2018 are considered. Analyses reveal three types of DO temporal variability caused by the storm-induced mixing and upwelling. The first type features temporal DO increases in subsurface waters (37-70 m) caused mainly by intense vertical mixing and downwelling. The second type features DO reductions in subsurface waters after the storms attributed to storm-induced upwelling. The third type features temporal DO increases at depths between 40 and 79 m and decreases at depths between 80 and 150 m due to the combined effect of strong vertical mixing and upwelling. These three types of DO responses can occur in different areas, depending on TC intensity, translational speed and Ekman pumping. The temporal DO variability is also influenced by the shallow oxycline (58.3 ± 16.7 m), mesoscale eddies and biochemical processes. Due to TC intensification, a pre-existing oceanic cyclonic eddy produced a large upwelling and induced a long time of DO decrease in the subsurface layer. This study suggests three different types of DO responses along the TC track in the OMZ, which is useful to evaluate the influence of TCs on the OMZ.",Effects of electrostatic precipitators ash leachate (EPAL) from recovery boilers on the biological treatment of effluent of kraft pulp mills.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096420,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"The electrostatic precipitators ash leachate (EPAL) from recovery boilers of kraft pulp mills is generated in processes dedicated to the removal of potassium and chloride salts seeking to avoid fouling and corrosion in pipes and equipment. However, the EPAL is rich in salts and has high electrical conductivity. Whenever it is sent to the effluent treatment plant (ETP), it can cause negative impacts to the biological process. It may jeopardize particularly the microbial community and the sludge bio-flocculation, causing sludge losses in the secondary clarifiers, reducing the overall efficiency of the effluent treatment plant. The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of EPAL from the recovery boilers added to a typical effluent from a bleached eucalyptus kraft pulp mill in gradually increased doses and in sudden doses (shock loads) in the efficiency of the biological treatment. Three biological sequential batch reactors (R1, R2, R3) with a volume of 1000 ml each were tested. The Reactor R1 was operated as a reference and fed only with typical effluent from the pulp mill; Reactor R2 was fed with mill effluent with gradually increased doses of EPAL in fixed proportions until reaching a real industrial condition; Reactor R3 was fed with mill effluent and with sudden doses of EPAL. The reactors were operated in similar conditions, i.e., the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) was always kept higher than 2 mg L-1, COD:N:P ratio equal to 250:5:1 and hydraulic retention time of 12 h. Depending on the dose which was applied, the EPAL inhibited microbiological activity, reduced the efficiency of COD removal of the biological treatment (10% when EPAL was gradually applied and 15% in sudden doses) and increased the sludge carryover in the sedimentation phase (148% when EPAL was gradually applied and 170% in sudden dosages). Furthermore, the reduced efficiency and suspended solid carryover were more significant when sudden doses were applied compared to the application of gradual doses of the EPAL."

A forested area of eastern Japan was monitored for four years immediately after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident in March 2011 that released a large amount of radionuclides. The long physical half-life of 137Cs means that contamination can persist for decades, so it is vital to understand the mechanisms underlying the 137Cs dynamics in ecosystems. We sampled litterfall, throughfall, and soil, mainly from a cedar stand, over a four-year period, and analyzed the 137Cs concentrations of each sample to determine the transfer rate and total inventory. After validating our methodology through a comparison with results from an earlier study, we determined the temporal changes in the 137Cs distribution and in the major transfer pathway. Results showed that most 137Cs intercepted by canopies was transferred rapidly over the first nine months, and that the major pathway was not litterfall but throughfall. The ecological half-life of the 137Cs stocked in the canopy was calculated for both the early and later stages of contamination. Although the former is consistent with previous results, the latter ecological half-life is somewhat longer, probably because of dependence on the meteorological and tree physiological conditions at the site. This study presents valuable new data on the post-Fukushima 137Cs contamination, enhancing our understanding of the associated dynamics in forest ecosystems.",Occurrence and fate of methane leakage from cut and buried abandoned gas wells in the Netherlands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096407,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Methane leakage caused by well integrity failure was assessed at 28 abandoned gas wells and 1 oil well in the Netherlands, which have been plugged, cut and buried to below the ground surface (≥3 mbgl). At each location, methane concentrations were thoroughly scanned at the surface. A static chamber setup was used to measure methane flow rates from the surface as well as from 1 m deep holes drilled using a hand auger. An anomalously high flow rate from 1 m depth combined with isotopic confirmation of a thermogenic origin revealed ongoing leakage at 1 of the 29 wells (3.4%), that had gone undetected by surficial measurements. Gas fluxes at the other sites were due to shallow production of biogenic methane. Detailed investigation at the leaking well (MON-02), consisting of 28 flux measurements conducted in a 2 × 2 m grid from holes drilled to 1 and 2 m depth, showed that flux magnitude was spatially heterogeneous and consistently larger at 2 m depth compared to 1 m. Isotopic evidence revealed oxidation accounted for roughly 25% of the decrease in flux towards the surface. The estimated total flux from the well (443 g CH4 hr-1) was calculated by extrapolation of the individual flow rate measurements at 2 m depth and should be considered an indicative value as the validity of the estimate using our approach requires confirmation by modelling and/or experimental studies. Together, our findings show that total methane emissions from leaking gas wells in the Netherlands are likely negligible compared to other sources of anthropogenic methane emissions (e.g. <1% of emissions from the Dutch energy sector). Furthermore, subsurface measurements greatly improve the likelihood of detecting leakage at buried abandoned wells and are therefore essential to accurately assess their greenhouse gas emissions and explosion hazards.",Quantitatively analyzing effects of meteorology and PM2.5 sources on low visual distance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096406,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Low visual distance (0 to 10 km), a common pollution phenomenon, is a severe threat to the productivity and life of human society in China. In this study, we used the Positive Matrix Factorization model coupled with the Generalized Additive Model (PMF-GAM) to quantitatively analyze the effect of the meteorology and source emissions on visual distance. The results show that the relative importance of predictor variables is humidity and SN (sulfate and secondary organic carbon (SOC) plus nitrate) (H&SN, 69.14%), vehicle exhaust (VE, 13.5%), crustal dust (CD, 7.28%), temperature (T, 4.71%), coal combustion (CC, 4.08%), wind speed (WS, 1.08%) and atmospheric pressure (AP, 0.21%). Furthermore, the visual distance is higher when the humidity is lower (<20%), and the humidity with SN shows clear synergy effects when the humidity is higher (>60%).",Hydroclimatic influence on the salinity and water volume of a plateau lake in southwest China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096404,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Increasing shrinkage and salinization is occurring in China's inland lakes. Lake Chenghai is located in the southwestern plateau of China and it is one of only three lakes in the world where Spirulina is found naturally, which has experienced severe decline in water level in recent decades (especially between 2006 and 2016). In addition, in China, there is a lack of hydrological observation data collected for many of the similar plateau inland lakes, which has led to a research gap regarding water-salt balance. This study aimed to investigate the lake water-salt balance, identify the causes for the decline in water volume and the adverse effects of the transition of a freshwater lake to a saline lake. A coupled water-salt balance mathematical model of the lake was constructed to gain insight into inland water-salt variation in this data scarce region. For Lake Chenghai, there was a 6.43-m decline in water level with an average rate of decrease of 7.0 cm a-1 between 1970 and 2016; the multi-year average water shortage was 2945 × 104 m3 a-1 from 2006 to 2016. The variation in the water level was positively correlated with precipitation (R = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and surface runoff inflow (R = 0.76, P < 0.0001) during the wet season, and it was negatively correlated with evaporation (R = 0.71, P < 0.0001) during the dry season. The warm, dry climate in the dry, hot valley area may be the main reason for the decline in the lake level. Changes in water volume and lake salinity affected the presence and abundance of phytoplankton species and the pH of the aquatic ecosystems. The developed methodology can be used to predict the long-term water and salinity evolution of inland lakes to support sustainable water resource planning in data-scarce regions.",Assessing climate impact on forest cover in areas undergoing substantial land cover change using Landsat imagery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096403,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"In this study, we propose to assess climate impact on forest cover (represented by EVI) at multiple scales in areas undergoing substantial land cover change, using Landsat imagery with human-induced land cover change effect excluded. Taking the Qingliu River catchment located in a subtropical humid monsoon area in China as a case study, the results indicate that EVI increases significantly (p < 0.01) during 1989-2014 with a magnitude of 0.026/decade. Spatial distribution of EVI is distinct in summer and growing season. Temperature and precipitation show high partial correlations with EVI, with better partial correlation found between EVI and temperature. Their partial correlations with EVI on monthly scale are higher than those on annual scale. Besides, precipitation and pan evaporation show accumulative lag effects (4 months) on forest EVI, while temperature has no lag effect. Finally, an empirical formula is established to quantify the relationship among EVI and its main driving factors (temperature and precipitation) by considering the precipitation threshold (200 mm). The findings should provide scientific supports for local forest management and ecosystem services, and should also support the hydrological effect assessment of vegetation cover change under climate change for the study area.",Bioremediation of soil long-term contaminated with PAHs by algal-bacterial synergy of Chlorella sp. MM3 and Rhodococcus wratislaviensis strain 9 in slurry phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096402,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Remediation of soil contaminated with pollutants using biological agents is more a sustainable and greener approach as compared to physico-chemical technologies. We recently confirmed that a microalga, Chlorella sp. MM3, and a bacterium, Rhodococcus wratislaviensis strain 9, can degrade high-molecular weight PAHs. In this study, an algal-bacterial system of these two strains was developed by long-term growth on a mixture of phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). In a soil spiked with 50 mg L-1 phenanthrene, 10 mg L-1 of pyrene and 10 mg L-1 of BaP, the algal-bacterial system degraded these PAHs almost completely in slurry phase within 30 days. Also, the algal-bacterial system was able to successfully remediate these three PAHs in a soil long-term contaminated with 245.1 mg kg-1 of 16 PAHs and several heavy metals under slurry phase in 21 days. Use of such appropriate assays as chlorophyll estimation for the microalga and semi-quantitative PCR for the bacterium confirmed survival of both the strains during soil bioremediation. Moreover, the residual toxicity test involving Escherichia coli DH5α that expresses green fluorescent protein indicated the successful bioremediation of PAHs-contaminated soil in slurry phase. For the first time, here we demonstrate the great potential of an algal-bacterial synergy in bioremediation of soil long-term contaminated with PAHs even in the presence of toxic heavy metals.",The gut microbiota of soil organisms show species-specific responses to liming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096401,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Liming is a common agronomic practice used for alleviating soil acidification to improve plant growth. However, it is still unclear how liming can affect the gut microbiota composition of soil fauna, and subsequently the nutrient cycling and litter decomposition mediated by soil fauna. In the present study the effect of liming on the gut microbiota of two types of soil fauna, Folsomia candida, and Enchytraeus crypticus was investigated by using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing. The results revealed that there are differences between the gut microbial communities of the two types of soil fauna as well as between the gut microbiome of the soil fauna and the surrounding soil. Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae were the predominant families in the gut microbiota of E. crypticus, while Rickettsiaceae and Moraxellaceae were the predominant families in the gut microbiota of F. candida. Liming affected the gut microbiota of E. crypticus at both the taxonomical and core microbiota level. The gut microbiota of F. candida was not affected by liming. Structural equation models suggest that 97% of the variation in the E. crypticus gut microbiota could be explained by liming-induced changes in soil properties and the soil microbial community. The indirect effects of liming, caused by a shift in the soil microbial community, contributed more in reshaping the gut microbiota of E. crypticus than the direct effects of the changed soil properties did. These findings suggest that the effects of liming on the gut microbiota composition in soil fauna are species-specific and are likely dependent on the response of the host to changes in soil properties and the soil microbial community.",Dual in-aquifer and near surface processes drive arsenic mobilization in Cambodian groundwaters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096400,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Millions of people globally, and particularly in South and Southeast Asia, face chronic exposure to arsenic from reducing groundwaters in which. Arsenic release to is widely attributed largely to reductive dissolution of arsenic-bearing iron minerals, driven by metal reducing bacteria using bioavailable organic matter as an electron donor. However, the nature of the organic matter implicated in arsenic mobilization, and the location within the subsurface where these processes occur, remains debated. In a high resolution study of a largely pristine, shallow aquifer in Kandal Province, Cambodia, we have used a complementary suite of geochemical tracers (including 14C, 3H, 3He, 4He, Ne, δ18O, δD, CFCs and SF6) to study the evolution in arsenic-prone shallow reducing groundwaters along dominant flow paths. The observation of widespread apparent 3H-3He ages of <55years fundamentally challenges some previous models which concluded that groundwater residence times were on the order of hundreds of years. Surface-derived organic matter is transported to depths of >30m, and the relationships between age-related tracers and arsenic suggest that this surface-derived organic matter is likely to contribute to in-aquifer arsenic mobilization. A strong relationship between 3H-3He age and depth suggests the dominance of a vertical hydrological control with an overall vertical flow velocity of ~0.4±0.1m·yr-1 across the field area. A calculated overall groundwater arsenic accumulation rate of ~0.08±0.03μM·yr-1 is broadly comparable to previous estimates from other researchers for similar reducing aquifers in Bangladesh. Although apparent arsenic groundwater accumulation rates varied significantly with site (e.g. between sand versus clay dominated sequences), rates are generally highest near the surface, perhaps reflecting the proximity to the redox cline and/or depth-dependent characteristics of the OM pool, and confounded by localized processes such as continued in-aquifer mobilization, sorption/desorption, and methanogenesis.",Ammonium loading disturbed the microbial food webs in biofilms attached to submersed macrophyte Vallisneria natans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096399,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"The knowledge about the impacts of ammonium loading on microbial food webs in biofilms attached to submersed macrophytes is limited. In the present study, Illumina sequencing method was employed to investigate bacterial and eukaryotic communities in biofilms attached to leaves of Vallisneria natans (V. natans) exposed to 1-16 mg L-1 NH4+-N for 10 days, and 8 mg L-1 NH4+-N for 21 days. Ammonium loading stimulated biofilms growth, enhanced the relative abundance of nitrifying genus Nitrospira and several denitrifying genera. Eukaryotic kingdom Metazoa, Viridiplantae, Chromista, Fungi and super group SARNU (Stramenopiles, Alveolata, Rhizaria, Nucleariidae and Fonticula group and unknown eukaryotes) were obtained. Relative abundance of Metazoa decreased with the increased ammonium concentration and exposure time. Redundancy analysis revealed that ammonium, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH had a key role in determining microbial community structure. Network analyses revealed that there were complex interactions including feeding, parasitism and predatism among organism in biofilms, and the microbial food webs were disturbed by inhibiting metazoan growth but stimulating bacteria and algae growth. These results suggest that ammonium-disturbed microbial food webs in biofilms may contribute to the growth of biofilms and algae, and thus contribute to the decline of submersed macrophyte and provide ""algal seeds"" for the algae burst in water column. These data will be helpful in understanding the macrophytic region transform into algal region in water column polluted by ammonium.",Examining the effects of socioeconomic development on China's carbon productivity: A panel data analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096398,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"China, which is the largest carbon emitter and the largest developing country in the world, faces the challenge of achieving energy conservation and emission reduction without sacrificing economic development. Improving carbon productivity consists a possible way to seek a coordination between economic development and carbon emission reduction. Therefore, it is of great significance to examine the effects of socioeconomic development on China's carbon productivity and accordingly provide policy suggestions for China's low-carbon economic development. However, this topic has not been adequately addressed in previous studies. In order to fill this gap, this study detailed an empirical investigation into the impacts of socioeconomic development on China's carbon productivity. First, aided by spatial analysis methods, a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics of China's province-level carbon productivity was conducted. Moreover, using an extended STIRPAT model and panel data modeling technique, the effects of a range of socioeconomic factors on China's carbon productivity were quantitatively examined. The results indicated that China's carbon productivity increased gradually between 1997 and 2016, and carbon productivity in East China was much higher than that of their counterparts in Central China and West China. Provincial administrative units with highly developed economies witnessed spectacular increases in carbon productivity. Panel data analysis demonstrated that GDP per capita, technology level, trade openness, and foreign direct investment exerted positive effects, while energy consumption structure, industrial proportion, and urbanization level exerted negative effects, on China's carbon productivity. Based on the findings of this study, a series of policy suggestions with respect to improving China's carbon productivity were proposed."

Heme c is a very important co-factor participating the main metabolic reactions with catalytic and electron-transfer potential in the anammox bacteria, and is possible for use as an indicator to evaluate anammox performance. Knowledge of the relationship between the heme c concentration and the anammox reactor performance is, however, very limited available information is constrained at an operation temperature of 35 °C. In this study, we report the heme c concentration change along with nitrogen removal rate (NRR) in three anammox expanded granular sludge bed reactors operated at different temperatures (15, 25, 35 °C). The response of specific anammox activity (SAA) to temperature was revealed for biomass originating from three reactors. The results indicate a strong relationship between heme c concentration and NRR at different culture temperatures.

In the present study, PBDEs, PCBs and DDTs as well as liver histological changes were examined in common kingfisher breeding at a nature reserve (Shimentai National Nature Reserve, SNNR) near a notorious e-waste recycling site in South China. Mean ∑PBDEs (84.9 ng/g lipid weight), ∑PCBs (397 ng/g) and ∑TEQs (total toxic equivalent of coplanar PCBs, 2.68 ng/g) concentrations in kingfishers from SNNR were approximately 2-, 5-, and 4-fold higher than those detected in a reference population, respectively; suggesting contamination of the e-waste-derived OHCs in SNNR. Mean ∑DDTs concentration (2150 ng/g) in kingfishers from SNNR was also higher (~2-fold) than that from the reference samples. While ∑DDTs dominated the composition of the OHCs at both sampling sites, ∑PCBs was also important in kingfishers from SNNR, averaging 15% of ∑OHCs. Histological examination of the liver showed steatosis occurred in 60% of the kingfishers from SNNR. Birds with hepatic steatosis had significantly (p = 0.03) higher ∑TEQs than those without steatosis. Similar trends were also found for ∑PCBs and ∑DDTs, although it is not statistically significant. It therefore seems likely that the hepatic steatosis were associated with the relatively high body-burden of OHCs, although the possibility of other factors resulting in hepatic steatosis cannot be ruled out.","Fecal contamination of storm sewers: Evaluating wastewater micropollutants, human-specific Bacteroides 16S rRNA, and mitochondrial DNA genetic markers as alternative indicators of sewer cross connections.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096384,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"A set of fecal indicator bacteria and alternative markers were tested for their use to identify priority sectors of two urban watersheds in the Greater Montreal region with unintended household sewage connections to storm drainage systems. Analyses were performed for thermotolerant (fecal) coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli, human-specific Bacteroidales (HF183) and mitochondrial DNA (Hmt) markers, carbamazepine (CBZ), caffeine (CAF), theophylline (THEO) and acetaminophen (ACE). A high incidence of human fecal contamination was observed, illustrating the need for a method to appropriately prioritize sectors for the rehabilitation of sewer cross-connections. Concentrations of alternative markers were not significantly different between the residential and industrial/commercial/institutional (ICI) sectors. However, median E. coli concentrations were higher in the residential as compared to ICI sectors (p < 0.05). Hmt marker, CAF, and THEO were well correlated to E. coli in the ICI sector (r > 0.61, p < 0.05). Considering all sites, only CAF and THEO were correlated to E. coli (r > 0.59, p < 0.05), possibly as a result of higher E. coli inputs from other sources such as domestic animals or fauna in the residential sector. Thresholds were determined to relate alternative markers to E. coli for use in an index for prioritizing sectors with sewer cross-connections. HF183, Hmt, CAF, THEO, and ACE were identified as suitable markers for identifying sewer cross-connections and are more reliable than E. coli alone, most importantly in residential sectors.",Hg2+-binding peptide decreases mercury ion accumulation in fish through a cell surface display system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096383,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Mercury is a potentially toxic trace metal that poses threats to aquatic life and to humans. In this study, a mercury-binding peptide was displayed on the surface of Escherichia coli cells using an N-terminal region ice nucleation protein anchor. The surface-engineered E. coli facilitated selective adsorption of mercury ions (Hg2+) from a solution containing various metal ions. The Hg2+ adsorption capacity of the surface-engineered cell was four-fold higher than that of the original E. coli cells. Approximately 95% of Hg2+ was removed from solution by these whole-cell sorbents. The transformed strains were fed to Carassius auratus, so that the bacteria could colonize fish intestine. Engineered bacteria-fed C. auratus showed significantly less (51.1%) accumulation of total mercury when compared with the group that had not been fed engineered bacteria. The surface-engineered E. coli effectively protected fish against the toxicity of Hg2+ in aquatic environments by adsorbing more Hg2+. Furthermore, the surface-engineered E. coli mitigated microbial diversity changes in the intestine caused by Hg2+ exposure, thereby protecting the intestinal microbial community. This strategy is a novel approach for controlling Hg2+ contamination in fish.",Promoting charge separation of biochar-based Zn-TiO2/pBC in the presence of ZnO for efficient sulfamethoxazole photodegradation under visible light irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096382,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"A novel and effective photocatalyst namely titanium dioxide doped with zinc elements stacked on reed straw biochar which was pretreated by acid (Zn-TiO2/pBC) with visible light response was successfully prepared by a simple modified sol-gel method firstly. The prepared samples were characterized by scanning microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET) and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS). The photocatalytic activity of Zn-TiO2/pBC was further investigated through the photodegradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Compared with TiO2 and TiO2/pBC, Zn-TiO2/pBC had better photocatalytic activity under visible light due to zinc elements effectively inhibiting the agglomeration of TiO2 and hindering the combination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The removal rate of SMX could reach 81.21%, which was 1.37 times higher than that of TiO2/pBC(300). Three common anions (SO42-, Cl-, NO3-) existing in the Yellow River exhibited detrimental effects on the SMX photodegradation to a certain degree. It might mainly occurred hydroxylation, cleavage of SN bond and opening of isoxazole ring reactions during the photodegradation process of SMX. Meanwhile, there might be four main degradation pathways proposed throw the LC/MS/MS analysis. Finally, good reusability and stability illustrated Zn-TiO2/pBC owned good practicality and feasibility for removal of organic pollutants in environment remediation area.",Climate and land use changes will degrade the distribution of Rhododendrons in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096381,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Biodiversity loss and variation in species responses to climate and land use change have been found across broad taxonomic groups. However, whether species from the same taxonomic group with distinct geographical ranges will respond differently is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to predict the potential impacts of future climate and land use change on the distribution of narrow- and wide-ranging Rhododendron species, and estimate their relative contribution in China. We applied the presence-only ecological niche model MaxEnt to predict the distribution of 10 narrow-ranging and 10 wide-ranging Rhododendron species for the year 2070, using three general circulation models and three scenarios of climate and land use change. We measured the predicted distribution change of each species using change ratio, distance and direction of core range shifts, and niche overlap using Schoener's D. We found that the distribution areas of six narrow-ranging species would decrease, of which one species would go extinct. The remaining four narrow-ranging species would experience range expansion. Distribution of all the wide-ranging Rhododendron species would decrease. All Rhododendrons will shift to the northwest. We conclude that Rhododendron species generally will be negatively affected by the climatic and land use change expected in 2070 from the three scenarios evaluated in this study, but some narrow-ranging species may be positively influenced. Narrow-ranging Rhododendron species are more vulnerable compared to wide-ranging Rhododendron species. This study demonstrated that the effects of climate and land use change on alpine and subalpine plant species is species-specific, thereby strengthening our understanding of the impacts of climate and land use change on plant distribution.",Effective degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls by a facultative anaerobic bacterial consortium using alternating anaerobic aerobic treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096380,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are synthetic mixtures of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds that were widely used in the past and still found in the environment due to their highly recalcitrant nature. A combination of anaerobic dechlorination and aerobic oxidation is essential to degrade these PCB mixtures into less toxic products. It was hypothesized that due to the complexity of PCB mixtures, a consortium of carefully selected suitable microbial species will perform better than the application of individual microbes. In the present study, biodegradation of the commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260, was studied under two different combined anaerobic-aerobic conditions, namely, alternating (AN) and two stage (TS). The facultative anaerobic bacterial consortium consisted of naturally occurring Achromobacter sp. NP03, Ochrobactrum sp. NP04 and Lysinibacillus sp. NP05. These bacteria were found capable as individuals of solubilizing and degrading PCBs under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. 49.2 ± 2.5% total reduction of the original 50 mg/L Aroclor 1260 mixture was achieved after 2 weeks in AN treatment whereas the reduction was only 24.44 ± 2.46% in TS treatment. At the end of week 6, a yield of 17.63 ± 0.91 mg/L chloride released was measured under AN condition compared to 11.79 ± 1.28 mg/L measured under TS condition. The overall results suggested that the microbial consortia capable of degrading and utilizing PCBs under both, anaerobic and aerobic conditions achieved better PCB degradation by repeated exposure to short periods of anaerobic and aerobic conditions alternatingly rather than the conventional two stage anaerobic-aerobic conditions.",Gradients of three coastal environments off the South China Sea and their impacts on the dynamics of heterotrophic microbial communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096379,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Heterotrophic fungus-like marine protists are recognized to contribute significantly to the coastal carbon cycling largely due to their high biomass and ability to decompose recalcitrant organic matter. Yet, little is known about their dynamics at polluted coastal environments in the context of heterotrophic microbial communities. Here, we present the dynamics of these protists relative to their heterotrophic counterparts in three different environments, namely Pearl River Estuary (ZJK), Shenzhen Bay (SZW) and Daya Bay (DYW) along the coastline of South China Sea. ZJK and SZW were characterized by low salinity and high N levels with large variations, unlike DYW. However, the average abundance of fungus-like protists did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) among these environments, except that it increased in August (422 ± 264 cells/mL, P < 0.01) over March, May and October. Correlation analysis revealed association of their abundance to different environmental factors, namely dissolved organic N in ZJK (rho = -0.87); NH4+ (rho = 0.64) and Chl a (rho = 0.73) in SZW; and salinity (rho = 0.46), DO (rho = 0.57) and total P (rho = 0.48) in DYW, suggesting distinct influence of trophic conditions. Analysis of their abundance relative to other heterotrophic protists (HP) shows that fungus-like protists display selective advantage over HP in the environment (DWY) with low N levels. Further, the similar biomass fraction (ZJK: 5.97 ± 6.23%, SZW: 5.97 ± 5.28%, and DYW: 12.1 ± 11.4%; P > 0.05) of fungus-like protists relative to heterotrophic bacteria, suggest their invariable contribution to carbon cycling. Thus, dynamics of fungus-like protists in relation to their heterotrophic counterparts is largely regulated by the trophic conditions of coastal environments.",Immobilization of cadmium in polluted soils by phytogenic iron oxide nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096378,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"While phytogenic nanomaterials have been successfully used to remove heavy metals in wastewater, the potential to successfully use such materials to immobilize heavy metals in soils is still unclear. In this study, phytogenic iron oxide nanoparticles (PION) were used to immobilize cadmium (Cd) in six soils. Amendment with PION effectively immobilized Cd, with a concomitant increase in the concentrations of iron oxides, soil pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) under both oxic and anoxic conditions. However, observed changes in soil properties and Cd fractions were different under oxic and anoxic conditions. After PION application, the exchangeable Cd fraction decreased by up to 91 and 69%, while the carbonate bound Cd fraction decreased by up to 61 and 75%, under oxic and anoxic conditions, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that under both oxic and anoxic conditions, Cd fractions were significantly and positively correlated with free iron oxide content and pH, where free iron oxide content was positively correlated with amorphous iron oxide, DOC and pH. The Cd immobilization mechanisms potentially involved either (1) formation of insoluble hydroxides at elevated pH; (2) participation of biomolecules released from PION in ligand complexation with Cd and (3) co-precipitated of Cd during the formation of iron oxides. This study provided new insights into the potential effects of PION applications for practical Cd immobilization in contaminated soils.","Review of biochar for the management of contaminated soil: Preparation, application and prospect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096377,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"As a multi-beneficial amendment, biochar is reasonable and reliable to be employed as an amendment to implement soil remediation. An overview on the manufacture, applications for contaminated soil restoration and revegetation, as well as recommended aspects for future work has been accomplished. One of the objectives of this work presented herein was to determine the effect of feedstock and preparation conditions such as pyrolysis temperature, retention time, gas flow rate, additives on the biochar characteristics and application potentials. Besides, relevant modification or activation technologies have been discussed for the improvement of the biochar functions. The application of biochar could adjust the soil structure (surface area, pore size and distribution etc.), improve the soil physicochemical properties (pH, cation exchange capacity, water retention capacity etc.) and enhance the uptake of soil nutrients for plant growth; In addition, it also can be used to adsorb various contaminants (heavy metals, organic matters), modify the habit and function of microorganism and mitigate climate problem by changing the bioavailability of elements (C, N, K etc.) in soil. These results also provided the possibility to expend the application of biochar to modify the degraded soils in the saline-alkali soil and industrial regions, further increase the usable area of cultivated land. The future research directions could be suggested as long-term field trials, the evaluation of environmental risk and the optimization of biochar production.

Local to regional scale impacts on air quality from grassland fires in this region are not well understood, which is important as these types of prescribed fires may increase in the future to preserve broader areas of native grasses in the central U.S. Routine air quality and deposition measurements from sites in and near the Flint Hills were examined for coincident increases during periods of increased prescribed grassland fires. Prescribed fire activity in this region was quantified using satellite detections and multiple publicly available data products of area burned information. March and April comprise over half (41 to 93%) of all annual fire detections in the Flint Hills region seen from satellites between 2007 and 2018 excluding drought years. Annual total fire detections in this region range between 1 and 12 thousand and account for approximately 3% of all fire detections in the contiguous U.S. Annual acres burned ranged from 0.2 to 2 million acres based on U.S. EPA's National Emission Inventory, which accounts for 4 to 38% of grasslands in the area. A comparison of weekly standardized anomalies suggests a relationship between periods of increased grassland fire activity and elevated levels of PM2.5 organic carbon, elemental carbon, and potassium. Daily 1-hr maximum ozone (O3), ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and oxidized nitrogen gases measured at Konza Prairie also had increased levels when prescribed grassland fire activity was highest. This detailed characterization of prescribed fire activity in the Flint Hills and associated air quality impacts will benefit future efforts to understand changes in atmospheric composition due to changing land management practices.",Ingestion bioaccessibility of indoor dust-bound PAHs: Inclusion of a sorption sink to simulate passive transfer across the small intestine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096364,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"In this study, we investigated the levels of 12 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH12) pollutants, bioaccessible PAH12, and sorption sink for PAH12 by a silicone sheet of indoor dust samples, which were collected from teachers' offices (n = 17), students' offices (n = 17), laboratory (n = 11), and experimental center (n = 9), using an in vitro digestive model. In PAH12, bioaccessible PAH12, and sorption sink PAH12, benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF), phenanthrenes (Phe), and fluoranthene (FLA) were labeled respectively the most significant PAHs (6.61 ± 4.42 μg/g, 0.16 ± 0.11 μg/g, and 0.08 ± 0.06 μg/g) after indoor dust ingestion, whereas the proportions of anthracene (Ant), benzo(g,h,i)perylene (BghiP), and BghiP (0.34 ± 0.17, 0.03 ± 0.03 and 0.01 ± 0.01 μg/g) were low. Based on benzo[a]pyrene- equivalent carcinogenic concentrations, the mean daily exposure of bioaccessible PAH12 and sorption sink for PAH12 by indoor dust ingestion was 4.07 × 10-3 ± 1.73 × 10-3 and 3.23 × 10-3 ± 1.36 × 10-3 μg/day in the experimental center; 4.01 × 10-3 ± 2.05 × 10-3 and 1.46 × 10-3 ± 6.72 × 10-4 μg/day in students' offices; 8.25 × 10-4 ± 2.33 × 10-4 and 5.15 × 10-4 ± 1.37 × 10-4 μg/day in laboratory; and 7.05 × 10-4 ± 4.12 × 10-5 and 2.82 × 10-4 ± 4.36 × 10-5 μg/day in teachers' offices, respectively. Our results indicated that the passive transfer fraction of PAH12 (44.07%-67.36% in this case) is therefore large and needs to be considered in exposure and risk assessments.",Ball-milled biochar for galaxolide removal: Sorption performance and governing mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096363,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"The environmental risk of galaxolide (HHCB) spurs the need to develop efficient and economical removal technology. Although sorption is one of the best removal approaches, studies on sorption of HHCB by biochar were limited. With the purpose of combining the advantages of ball-milling and sorption technologies, six ball-milled biochars (BM-biochars) varied with biomasses and pyrolysis temperature were produced, characterized, and tested for HHCB removal from aqueous solution. At an initial HHCB concentration of 2 mg L-1, the unmilled and BM-biochars adsorbed 330-746 and 609-2098 mg kg-1 of HHCB, respectively. The increase in sorption capacities (about 3-fold increase) was mainly ascribed to the increase in BM-biochar's external and internal surface area, pore volume and pore size, and the exposure of the graphitic structure. The removal of HHCB by the BM-biochars increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. For lower temperature biochar (300 °C wheat straw biochar, WS300), hydrophobic partitioning played a major role in HHCB sorption onto unmilled biochar (log Koc/log Kow value of WS300 was 0.772 at a Ce of 1 mg L-1). Ball milling reduced the hydrophobicity of 300 °C biochar, which diminished the HHCB sorption. However, increased surface area, pore volume, pore size, and graphitic structure provided additional sorption sites, resulting in enhanced HHCB uptake (log Koc/log Kow value of BMWS300 was 1.23 at a Ce of 1 mg L-1). For higher temperature biochars (500 and 700 °C), ball milling mainly enhanced HHCB sorption onto high temperature biochars via surface adsorption, π-π interaction, and pore filling. For WS500, 77.9% of HHCB removal was due to surface adsorption. Ball milling increased this percentage to 96.7% for BMWS500. This work highlighted the potential of ball milling as an excellent engineering method to improve biochar's sorption properties.",Land use change in an agricultural landscape causing degradation of soil based ecosystem services.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096362,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Landscape structure and ecosystem service (ES) provision in Central Europe have changed fundamentally and some ES have been irreversibly degraded over the last 250 years. The land use change analysis of a typical agricultural landscape near Leipzig (Germany) uses digitized historical GIS-data, serial cadastral maps and documents in time steps 1750, 1850, 1950 and 2005. Arable land area increased from 73.4% (1750) to 87.2% (2005) and grassland decreased from 22.1% to 4.2%. ES provision change analysis has resulted e.g. in a significant increase of winter wheat production comparing the decades 1990-1999 to 2000-2009. However, natural soil production capacity has degraded based on the interpretation of historical soil assessment maps (1864, 1937) and the actual erosion risk hazard has increased strongly in the same period. Caused by the Prussian agricultural revolution between 1750 and 1850 a high biodiversity level is found, followed by a slight decrease during the industrialization in the second half of the 19th century. By industrialized production and collectivization since 1960 devastation of vegetation structures has brought habitat degradation and a dramatic biodiversity loss. Driving forces analysis shows that significant drivers of land use and ES changes since 1750 are socioeconomic, political and technical drivers. It clarifies the impact of landscape changes by Prussian agrarian reforms, industrialization, technical and land management innovations, Kolkhoz system and Common Agricultural Policy on ES degradation based on the indicators crop production, natural soil production capacity, soil degradation caused by erosion hazards and biodiversity.",Exploring the spatiotemporal pattern of PM2.5 distribution and its determinants in Chinese cities based on a multilevel analysis approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096361,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"China has been under threat of severe haze in recent years, particularly that caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Exploring the determinants of PM2.5 concentration is critical for improving air quality. The influencing mechanism of smog pollution is a comprehensive and systematic process affected by multiple driving factors. In this research, we collected PM2.5 monitoring data from 292 cities across China in 2015 and employed multilevel regression models constructed using three levels to detect the physical and socioeconomic driving forces behind the PM2.5 concentration at monthly, seasonal and spatial scales, which captured random effects both varied by season and region. The results indicated significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the PM2.5 distribution, with the pollution core located in central China and northern China. The most severely haze episodes occurred in winter. Multilevel models showed that 46.40% of the variance was derived from the seasonal and spatial levels, and the models could explain a maximum of 90.7% of the PM2.5 concentration variance. The multilevel model identified more determinant influences varying by time and region. The outcomes suggested that the impacts of temperature and relative humidity on PM2.5 were of significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity due to the influencing mechanism differing from season and station. The variation of anthropogenic activities led to the socioeconomic influences featured a significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. This research revealed the spatiotemporal characteristic of PM2.5 pollution influencing mechanism from physical and perspective and provided effective strategies for restricting air pollution.",The role of renewable energy technological innovation on climate change: Empirical evidence from China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096360,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"To develop renewable energy as well as promote China's transition to a low-carbon economy, the government needs to pay attention to renewable energy technological innovation (RETI). Using China's provincial panel data from 2000 to 2015, and regarding the CO2 emissions as the proxy of climate change, this paper identifies the relationship between RETI and CO2 emissions as well as seeks to confirm the role of RETI on climate change. The linear regression model confirms that the RETI has a significant negative effect on CO2 emissions. In addition, considering the disparities of energy structure, the impacts of RETI on CO2 emissions may be distinct. We, therefore, construct a panel threshold model by taking into account the distinct effect of RETI under different energy structure. We find that the effect of RETI on curbing CO2 emissions decreases with the rising of coal-dominated energy consumption structure but in contrast, this effect increases with the growing proportion of renewable energy generation. This paper provides new insight into the relationship between technological innovation and climate change. Based on these findings, some relevant policy recommendations are proposed.","Radiological characterisation of alkali-activated construction materials containing red mud, fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096359,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Poor storage of industrial wastes has been a cause of land contamination issues. These wastes or by-products have the potential to be used as secondary raw materials in construction, promoting the concept of a circular economy that will avoid land contamination. Here we evaluate radiological environmental impacts when wastes that contain elevated levels of naturally occurring radionuclides (NORs) such as red mud, fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag are made into 'green cements' such as geopolymers or alkali-activated materials (AAMs). During the study, three AAM concrete and mortar series with various mixing ratios were prepared and investigated. The NOR content, I-Index, radon emanation and exhalation of the precursor waste materials and their cement products were measured and calculated and the strength of the cement products was compared. The emanation and the exhalation properties were calculated for the final products, weighing the data of the components as a function of their mixing ratio. The I-index alone suggested that the AAMs would be suitable products. AAMs containing ground granulated blast furnace slag exhibited the lowest radon exhalation and higher compressive strength, while the fly ash and red mud AAMs had increased final radon exhalation. In the case of fly ash, alkaline activation of fly ash dramatically increased the radon exhalation; the highest measured fly ash exhalation was 1.49 times of the theoretically calculated exhalation value. This highlights the increased risk of using fly ash as a component in AAMs and the need to carry out testing on the final products as well as individual secondary raw materials.","Psychiatrics and selected metabolites in hospital and urban wastewaters: Occurrence, removal, mass loading, seasonal influence and risk assessment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096357,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"The occurrence, removal, mass loading, seasonal influence and environmental risk assessment of nine psychiatric pharmaceuticals and four of their selected metabolites, were studied in one hospital and one urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Ioannina city, in northwestern Greece, providing information about the efficiency of the plants and their contribution into the final receiver's flow. Samples were collected from the influents and the effluents of the plants in different sampling campaigns, from July to December 2016. Analytical methodology was based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry, after solid-phase extraction through Oasis HLB cartridges. Concentrations in both WWTPs ranged between <LOQ and 1126.3 ng/L in the influents and between <LOQ and 1127.4 ng/L, in the effluents. Results indicated that venlafaxine and its metabolite O-desmethyl venlafaxine were the most frequently detected compounds in the influents and the effluents of both WWTPs. Metabolite to parent compound ratio ranged in the influents between 0.01 and 87.2 while in the effluents between 0.01 and 47.7. Based on mass loads in the influents, venlafaxine is consumed in high amounts (up to 67.1 mg/day/1000 inhab.), and consequently its metabolite O-desmethyl venlafaxine (up to 139.1 mg/day/1000 inhab.). Similarly to the influents, environmental emissions, were also higher for venlafaxine and O-desmethyl venlafaxine (10.1 and 13.3 mg/d/1000 inhab., respectively). Removal efficiencies in the hospital WWTP ranged from -100% to 98.9%, while in the city WWTP from -49.9% to 99.8%. Furthermore, an important outcome was the evaluation of the potential ecotoxicological risk, by means of risk quotients (RQs), where none of the target psychiatrics or their metabolites showed RQ above 1.",Comparing probabilistic and statistical methods in landslide susceptibility modeling in Rwanda/Centre-Eastern Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096356,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Application of suitable methods to generate landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) can play a key role in risk management. Rwanda, located in centre-eastern Africa experiences frequent and intense landslides which cause substantial impacts. The main aim of the current study was to effectively generate susceptibility maps through exploring and comparing different statistical and probabilistic models. These included weights of evidence (WoE), logistic regression (LR), frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI). Experiments were conducted in Rwanda as a study area. Past landslide locations have been identified through extensive field surveys and historical records. Totally, 692 landslide points were collected and prepared to produce the inventory map. This was applied to calibrate and validate the models. Fourteen maps of conditioning factors were produced for landslide susceptibility modeling, namely: elevation, slope degree, topographic wetness index (TWI), curvature, aspect, distance from rivers and streams, distance to main roads, lithology, soil texture, soil depth, topographic factor (LS), land use/land cover (LULC), precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Thus, the produced susceptibility maps were validated using the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC/AUC). The findings from this study disclosed that prediction rates were 92.7%, 86.9%, 81.2% and 79.5% respectively for WoE, FR, LR and SI models. The WoE achieved the highest AUC value (92.7%) while the SI produced a lowest AUC value (79.5%). Additionally, 20.42% of Rwanda (5048.07 km2) was modeled as highly susceptible to landslides with the western part the highly susceptible comparing to other parts of the country. Conclusively, the comparison of produced maps revealed that all applied models are promising approaches for landslide susceptibility studying in Rwanda. The results of the present study may be useful for landslide risk mitigation in the study area and in other areas with similar terrain and geomorphological conditions. More studies should be performed to include other important conditioning factors that exacerbate increases in susceptibility especially anthropogenic factors.",Simultaneous remediation of sediments contaminated with sulfamethoxazole and cadmium using magnesium-modified biochar derived from Thalia dealbata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096355,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"In situ remediation and assessment of sediments contaminated with both antibiotics and heavy metals remains a technological challenge. In this study, MgCl2-modified biochar (BCM) was obtained at 500 °C through slow pyrolysis of Thalia dealbata and used for remediation of sediments contaminated by sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and Cd. The BCM showed greater surface area (110.6 m2 g-1) than pristine biochar (BC, 7.1 m2 g-1). The SMX sorption data were well described by Freundlich model while Langmuir model was better for the Cd2+ sorption data. The addition of 5.0% BCM significantly increased the sorption of SMX (by 50.8-58.6%) and Cd (by 24.2-25.6%) on sediments in both single and binary systems as compared with 5.0% BC. SMX sorption in sediments was significantly improved by addition of Cd2+, whereas SMX has no influence on Cd sorption on sediments. The addition of BCM distinctly decreased both SMX (by 51.4-87.2%) and Cd concentrations (by 56.2-91.3%) in overlying water, as well as in TCLP extracts (by 55.6-86.1% and 58.2-91.9% for SMX and Cd, respectively), as compared with sediments without biochar. Both germination rate and root length of pakchoi increased with increasing doses of BCM in contaminated sediments, 5.0% BCM showed greater promotion on pakchoi growth than 5.0% BC. Overall, BCM in the sediments does not only decrease the bioavailability of SMX and Cd, but it also diminishes the phytotoxicity, and thereby shows great application potential for in situ remediation of sediments polluted with antibiotics and heavy metals."

Although conservation strategies for these biodiversity hotspots have gradually increased, appropriate approaches for developing country contexts are lacking. Farm ponds provided hydrologic, biogeochemical, and socioeconomic benefits to southern China for thousands of years, but they are facing contemporary threats and management challenges, including (1) inadequate planning in terms of construction and conservation regulations; (2) rural nonpoint source and mini-point source pollution; (3) climate change induced abnormalities in the hydroperiod and disturbance to wildlife; (4) invasive species; and (5) inadequate social and political capacity to consider ecological conservation. Because farm ponds function as wetland complexes that are embedded within or integral to larger ecosystems, their conservation requires collaborative efforts over scales ranging from within-pond to regional. We highlight approaches that build public awareness and involve inventory maps as a basis. Policies that integrate top-down regulation and bottom-up engagement and emphasize sustainable management and utilization are recommended to ensure the effectiveness and continuous improvement of conservation programs. Techniques that involve interconnected smart sensors, volunteering and citizen science, and integrated process-based modeling are preferred when conducting comprehensive descriptions of the pond landscape, numerical assessments on their ecosystem services, and associated conservation cost analyses. Nature-based solutions are increasingly recognized as an important opportunity for coping with water-related crises. This paper presents the first synthetic perspective on the ecological roles of farm ponds in agriculturally dominated developing countries. The analytical framework and conservation suggestions are referential to sustainable rural development and the management of other small, scattered wetlands.",Evaluating anthropogenic and environmental tritium effects using precipitation and Hokkaido snowpack at selected coastal locations in Asia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096342,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Tritium dating requires a good understanding of the tritium and water inputs into hydrologic systems, including their main trends due to latitudinal, seasonal and altitudinal effects. Although tritium reached ambient levels at the end of the 20th century, tritium released from nuclear facilities and bomb tests since then has the potential to confound use of tritium for age dating. We therefore collected precipitation and snowpack samples for tritium analysis to confirm that tritium levels in Japanese precipitation had not exceeded ambient levels following the North Korean nuclear tests in January 6th 2016 and September 3rd 2017. As the result, the highest tritium concentration was 5.52(±0.27)TU at samples collected from January 8 to 11th at one Honshu and four Hokkaido locations and samples collected at six Honshu locations had 8.01(±1.5)TU from September 6 to 19th 2017. Confirming ambient tritium concentrations after both events we investigated the latitude tritium effect at selected coastal stations in Asia, indicating a break of latitude trend around Tokyo area, and established the latitude scaling factors to the north and south of the Tokyo area data. The seasonal trend was investigated during the winter-spring 2016 in precipitation samples confirming the higher spring tritium compared with winter continental tritium values. The altitude effect on tritium and stable (18O and 2H) isotopes was observed in Hokkaido snowpack, which had tritium concentrations ranging between 4.08 and 5.93 TU during March-April, and demonstrated two trends for western and central Hokkaido mountain ranges. Using established latitude and altitude scaling factors with the long-term continuous time-series of monthly Tokyo area tritium we estimated the annual weighted tritium at 110 meteorological stations in Japan with monthly precipitation demonstrating the applicability of this approach for future tritium-tracer studies across Asia.",Water resources and nitrate discharges in relation to agricultural land uses in an intensively irrigated watershed.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096341,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Application of integrated hydrological models to manage water resources and non-point agricultural pollutants are increasingly used in decision-making processes. In this study SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate the water balance and nitrate pollution in an intensively irrigated agricultural catchment (Flumen River in Monegros, Aragon, NE Spain). Rainfall comprised only 45% of the inputs of water in the Flumen watershed and the rest is contributed through irrigation canals from two other rivers outside the Flumen watershed. Green water storage and green water flow are the dominant components of the water balance in the watershed, which is related to the important contribution of water for irrigation. In general, green water storage and green water flow are quite similar in the subwatersheds dominated by irrigation agriculture that are located in the central part of the watershed. A similar pattern was observed for blue water, with high amounts in the central irrigated subwatersheds compared to the non-irrigated subwatersheds. Consequently, nitrate infiltration in the aquifer was higher in the inner irrigated subwatersheds (100-250 kg N ha-1 year-1) but much lower than the lateral flow rates estimated in the non-irrigated subwatersheds (1400-2000 kg N ha-1 year-1). Two scenarios simulating the effects of expected climate change factors in this zone were performed. A reduction in the availability of water for irrigation will transform the area from irrigated crops to cereal. In this case the water flow of River Flumen at the outlet of the watershed is reduced by 15%. If a reduction of 40% nitrate fertilization is applied, the nitrate exported to Flumen River would decreased by 28%. These results suggest that dosing irrigation water and fertilizers in accordance with crop requirements would contribute to buffer peaks of water and nitrate discharges and to a more efficient agricultural use of the resources.",A cascade of biological invasions and parasite spillback in man-made Lake Kariba.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096340,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Parasite spillback, the infection of a non-indigenous organism by a native parasite, is a highly important although understudied component of ecological invasion dynamics. Here, through the first analysis of the parasite fauna of lymnaeid gastropods of Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe). We illustrate how the creation of an artificial lake may lead to a cascade of biological invasions in which an invasive aquatic plant promotes the proliferation of invasive gastropods, which in turn alters the epidemiology of trematodiases of potential medical and veterinary importance. Using a new multiplex Rapid Diagnostic PCR assay, we assessed the prevalence of Fasciola sp. infections in the gastropod populations. Both gastropod hosts and trematode parasites were identified using DNA barcoding. We provide the first record of the invasive North-American gastropod Pseudosuccinea columella in Lake Kariba. This species was found at 14 out of 16 sampled sites and its abundance was strongly positively correlated with the abundance of the invasive South-American water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). About 65% of the P. columella specimens analysed were infected with a hitherto unknown Fasciola species. Phylogenetic analyses indicate close affinity to Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, which cause fasciolosis, an important liver disease affecting both ruminants and humans. In addition, another non-native Lymnaeid species was found: a Radix sp. that clustered closely with a Vietnamese Radix species. Radix sp. hosted both amphistome and Fasciola trematodes. By linking an invasion cascade and parasite spillback, this study shows how both processes can act in combination to lead to potentially important epidemiological changes.",Comparing two CF+DEA methods for assessing eco-efficiency from theoretical and practical points of view.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096339,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Nowadays, sustainability has become of increasing concern in policy and the decision making of stakeholders. Companies have been increasing their attention to their environmental performance. In order to measure sustainability performance, different approaches have been proposed. The joint application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), called LCA+DEA, is used to assess eco-efficiency, which is to produce more with less environmental impact and with fewer resources. In this manuscript, we compare two methods that implement the LCA+DEA approach, the five-step and four-step methods, focused on Carbon Footprint (CF), called CF+DEA. These methods have not been compared previously. This comparison will encompass the theoretical and practical points of view according to efficiency indices, best practices, and targets for the CF emissions. To perform this comparison, we use a case study of raspberry producers in Chile. From a practical point of view, we have observed that both methods have achieved the main objective of reducing CF. Moreover, results show similar eco-efficiency scores; the targets given by the five-step method are less demanding than those given by the four-step method. In this sense, the four-step method provides a higher average CF reduction. This is due to the inclusion of CF as an undesirable output in the DEA assessment and the use of an output-oriented DEA model. Additionally, in including the CF within the DEA assessment, the four-step method reflects better the definition of eco-efficiency. Following these results, it is advisable to implement the targets provided by the five-step method for a short term and then the targets provided by the four-step method for a mid-term or long term.",Agriculture versus wastewater pollution as drivers of macroinvertebrate community structure in streams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096338,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Water pollution is ubiquitous globally, yet how the effects of pollutants propagate through natural ecosystems remains poorly understood. This is because the interactive effects of multiple stressors are generally hard to predict. Agriculture and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are often major sources of contaminants for streams, but their relative importance and the role of different pollutants (e.g. nutrients or pesticides) are largely unknown. Using a 'real world experiment' with sampling locations up- and downstream of WWTPs, we studied how effluent discharges affected water quality and macroinvertebrate communities in 23 Swiss streams across a broad land-use gradient. Variation partitioning of community composition revealed that overall water quality explained approximately 30% of community variability, whereby nutrients and pesticides each independently explained 10% and 2%, respectively. Excluding oligochaetes (which were highly abundant downstream of the WWTPs) from the analyses, resulted in a relatively stronger influence (3%) of pesticides on the macroinvertebrate community composition, whereas nutrients had no influence. Generally, the macroinvertebrate community composition downstream of the WWTPs strongly reflected the upstream conditions, likely due to a combination of efficient treatment processes, environmental filtering and organismal dispersal. Wastewater impacts were most prominently by the Saprobic index, whereas the SPEAR index (a trait-based macroinvertebrate metrics reflecting sensitivity to pesticides) revealed a strong impact of arable cropping but only a weak impact of wastewater. Overall, our results indicate that agriculture can have a stronger impact on headwater stream macroinvertebrate communities than discharges from WWTP. Yet, effects of wastewater-born micropollutants were clearly quantifiable among all other influence factors. Improving our ability to further quantify the impacts of micropollutants requires highly-resolved water quality and taxonomic data with adequate spatial and temporal sampling. These improvements would help to better account for the underlying causal pathways that drive observed biological responses, such as episodic contaminant peaks and dispersal-related processes.","Vertical distribution of benthic diatoms in a large reservoir (Alqueva, Southern Portugal) during thermal stratification.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096337,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Freshwater diatom communities are known to respond to a wide range of environmental factors, however, the depth gradient is usually neglected and few studies are available, especially in large reservoirs. During the ALqueva hydro-meteorological EXperiment (ALEX) field campaign, diatom communities were studied in the margins and in three platforms (from the surface to the bottom of the reservoir) located in the limnetic zone of the Alqueva reservoir, one of the largest artificial lakes in western Europe. A detailed meteorological and physico-chemical characterization of the reservoir was carried out from June to September in Summer 2014, when the reservoir was stratified, to relate these variables with diatom assemblages. Despite the large dimensions of the reservoir, no differences in the water physico-chemical characteristics and diatom descriptors were detected among platforms. Small changes in diatom assemblages, ecological guilds, taxa richness and Shannon diversity index were observed between sampling campaigns. Nevertheless, differences in diatoms were detected along a depth gradient, both in terms of diatom assemblages and ecological guilds. Taxa richness, Shannon diversity index, Pielou's evenness and Specific Pollution sensitivity Index (SPI) also differed with depth, with the lowest values of all indices detected at surface samples, increasing with depth, reaching the highest values at 20 m for taxa richness, Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness indices.","Safe utilization of polluted soil by arsenic, cadmium and lead through an integrated sericultural measure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096336,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Effective remediation technologies to remediate multiple heavy metal contaminated farmlands are lacking. To make full use of farmlands and control its consequent health risks, we planted mulberry trees in arsenic (As)-cadmium (Cd)-lead (Pb) co-contaminated soils at four different sites; then reared silkworms on leaves harvested from these mulberry trees; and finally used the silkworm excrement to in situ remediate the As, Cd, and Pb polluted paddy soil. Mulberry leaves and stalks showed weak abilities to accumulate As, Cd, and Pb. As and Pb tended to accumulate in silkworm pupae and silkworm excrement, respectively, posing a potential health risk when they were used as pharmaceutical materials or foods. However, using the leaves of mulberry trees planted in Cd-contaminated soils to rear silkworms had a low health risk. Silkworm excrement significantly reduced the As, Cd and Pb concentrations in rice grains, with As and Cd concentration being lower but for Pb being higher their respective national limit standards. In conclusion, based on the rational utilization of resources such as silkworm excrement, pupae, and cocoons, the integrated measure in this study could effectively reduce the environmental health risks resulting from multiple As, Cd, and Pb contamination.",Variation in toxicity and ecological risks associated with some oil sands groundwaters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096335,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"The surface mining of oil sands deposits requires the removal of groundwater to stabilize the deposit (depressurization) and make it safe for mining. The chemistry and toxicity of deep groundwaters (from 45 to 144 m below an active mining operation) were characterized to determine if the release of groundwaters would pose a risk to a receiving aquatic environment. Concentrations of conventional chemicals such as nutrients and metals were generally below CCME chronic guidelines. Concentrations of oil sands naphthenic acids (NAs) varied depending on the method of measurement and were routinely >1 mg L-1. Groundwaters rarely caused lethality to fish and invertebrates in standard acute and chronic toxicity tests. Algal cell production was negatively correlated with chlorides and potentially negatively with NAs. Other chronic toxicity variations were less obviously correlated with measured chemistry. The groundwaters had moderately-high oxygen demand (2 to 33 mg L-1), likely associated with nutrients and organic substances, and thus have the potential to enrich receiving surface water environments if left untreated and depending on the receiving environment. This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive (3 year) pairing of water chemistry and toxicity data on groundwaters collected from aquifer depressurization wells below an active oil sands operation. These data will contribute to a better understanding of the environmental risk these waters potentially pose, and ultimately, to the improvement of water management strategies and the reduction of the overall surface mining footprint of oil sands operations.",Identification of vulnerable regions to soil loss under the dynamic saturation process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096334,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"This study presents a theoretical framework based on power law distribution to identify the vulnerable regions to soil loss in Susu river basin at Cameron Highlands, Malaysia by using the geomorphologic factors from Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Drainage area is used to describe the runoff aggregation structure of the watershed which represents the magnitude of discharge. Stream power is also used to describe the energy expenditure pattern of the watershed. They are fitted to power law distribution by means of the maximum likelihood to estimate the threshold for soil loss. The landscape stability condition is assessed through the mechanism of channel initiation. Two regions in the slope area plot are recognized as the regimes susceptible to soil loss, in that discharge, local slope and energy are sufficient for the initiation of soil movement. The result is further improved by incorporating the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) aiming to locate vulnerable regions to soil loss under the dynamic saturation process. The final result indicates that the vulnerable regions expand from perennial reaches to ephemeral reaches as saturation process develops. It implies the transition of runoff generation from groundwater in perennial reaches to surface runoff in ephemeral reaches. Identification of soil loss vulnerable regions under the dynamic saturation process helps in planning of the mitigation measures for soil erosion."

For immobilization of the trace metals the amendments zerovalent iron grit, natural zeolite, and Divergan® were used. Trace metal total and mobile contents were determined and bacterial communities were assessed after a SIP experiment with 13C-labelled wheat root by Ion-Torrent Sequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and two trace metal resistant genes for copper and cadmium (copA and czcA gene). The results show that the remediation effect of the three amendments is still stable after five years. The mobile trace metal contents were significantly (≤0.001) reduced in all treatments, except the Cu content in the zeolite treatment. A higher diversity in active metabolizing and growing soil bacteria was observed in remediated soils as compared to the non-remediated control, especially for the Divergan® treatment. The bacterial genera Kribbella, Glycomyces, Inquilinus, Nocardioides, and Lysobacter are the most significantly enriched genera in the 13C fractions of the treated samples. The occurrence of bacterial families, which could be identified carrying efflux-mediated metal resistance genes for Cd/Zn and Cu, were reduced in the remediated soils as compared to the non-remediated control. The most abundant bacterial family for the copA and the czcA gene is Xanthomonadaceae. The pH-value and the trace metal concentration could be identified as key drivers of bacterial community composition, and functions in trace metal contaminated soils and remediated soils.",Microplastic contamination in an urban estuary: Abundance and distribution of microplastics and fish larvae in the Douro estuary.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096322,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Estuaries are productive environments used by many fish as nursery grounds. The initial stages of fishes are highly vulnerable to (a)biotic factors, and anthropogenic pressures, influencing fish larvae assemblages along the estuary. Microplastics (MPs < 5 mm) are particularly dangerous to early life stages of fishes because their ingestion can induce gut blockage, limiting food intake or exposing organisms to contamination due to MPs capacity to absorb pollutants. Present work aimed to investigate the contamination of an urban impacted estuary (Douro estuary, NW Portugal) by MPs, and study the abundance and distribution of MPs and fish larvae in this estuary. Monthly sampling surveys were performed from December 2016 to December 2017, in nine stations along the estuary. Sub-surface planktonic horizontal trawls were performed to collect fish larvae and MPs. Planktonic samples were sorted, and fish larvae identified. MPs density was determined using a protocol optimized in our laboratory. A total of 1498 fish larvae belonging to 32 taxa were collected, with a mean density of 11.66 fish larvae 100 m-3. During the spring-summer period, it was observed the typical increase in the density and diversity of the larval assemblage. Diversity was generally low, with the high dominance of very few taxa, namely the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps. Different types of MPs were found, namely fibers, soft/hard plastic, colorful/transparent plastic, in a total of 2152 particles, with a mean density of 17.06 MPs 100 m-3. Hard MPs and fibers were the most predominant types, representing 83% of the total MPs collected. In some months the number of MPs surpassed the number of fish larvae, with an average ratio of 1.0 fish larvae:1.5 MPs. Such results are concerning, highlighting that a higher availability of MPs may facilitate their ingestion by fish and therefore increase possible impacts in these communities.","Impact of organic matter and meteorological factors on the long-term trend, seasonality, and gas/particle partitioning behavior of atmospheric PBDEs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096321,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"We extended our knowledge of the impact of organic matter (OM) and meteorological factors on the long-term trend, seasonality and gas/particle partitioning behavior of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). In Lake Chaohu, PBDEs had an increasing trend, with a doubling time of 13.4 years at the urban site, and a decreasing trend, with a halving time of 6.1 years at the rural site. At the urban site, the negative association of OM with most congeners indicated that the graphene-like carbonaceous components might carry or release PBDEs, and the negative association of long-term rain fall and wind speed with most congeners was suggested to dilute or increase the transport speed of PBDEs in the atmosphere. At the rural site, the negative association with PM10 and positive association with OM indicated that the PBDEs-buried OM was mainly from non-local sources. Restricted to the temperature seasonality, the frequency of PBDE congeners decreased with seasonality from 64% and 43% to 50% and 43% at the urban and rural sites, respectively. The slope of the simplified Pankow adsorption model in samples with larger absolute OM content (>10 μgC m-3) was steeper than that with lower absolute OM content (<5 μgC m-3), indicating that OM facilitated the gas-particle partitioning equilibrium. Interestingly, the theoretic partitioning coefficients were much lower than the measured ones for less brominated BDEs, whereas the highly brominated BDEs did the opposite. The theoretic partitioning coefficient should be further modified by considering the molecular weight distribution of the OM and the corresponding activity coefficients of the target compound in a specific type of OM phase.","Methane dynamics and thermal response in impoundments of the Rhine River, Germany.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096320,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"River impoundments have been identified as important emission hot spots of the greenhouse gas methane. In this study, we investigated methane dynamics of five river impoundments within a two year period using a variety of methods ranging from sediment incubations for measuring methane formation rates (MF), automatic bubble-traps and echo-sounding surveys to assess ebullition fluxes, and estimated diffusive methane fluxes via dissolved concentrations in the water and calculated transport coefficients via wind speed. MF was found to be predominantly acetoclastic, and higher porewater acetate concentrations were associated with higher MF. Moreover, sediment MF showed consistent depth profiles, and when depth-integrated, MF was comparable to bubble-trap ebullition time-series measurements. Thermal response analysed for our systems and a wide range of literature data demonstrated a consistent mean value, but a large range of temperature coefficient Q10 (1.6 to 7.0) for different studies. Annual mean ebullition rates varied over more than one order of magnitude from site to site (0.03 to 1.85 mgCH4 l-1 d-1), demonstrating that river impoundments are not all hot-spots. Future work should investigate the role of sediment delivery, deposition patterns and management on methane emissions by ebullition.",Geodiversity and geoheritage: Detecting scientific and geographic biases and gaps through a bibliometric study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096319,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Many scientists have recognized that there is diversity in nature, including biodiversity, geodiversity, and pedodiversity. Studies in biodiversity date back as far as the 1700s, but geodiversity and pedodiversity studies are much more recent, dating to the late 1970s to early 1980s. Given that we are now approaching 40 years of geodiversity and geoheritage work, this study was undertaken to determine areas that have been well addressed and where current gaps are. This was accomplished by reviewing the publications in the journal ""Geoheritage"", the Scopus and Google Scholar databases, and established geoparks according to UNESCO records. It was found that geodiversity studies typically do not include the findings or utilize the techniques of biodiversity and pedodiversity research, despite the fact that common definitions of geodiversity include soils. Including the findings and techniques of bio- and pedodiversity would expand geodiversity work. Likewise, geoheritage preservation sites are not geographically balanced, with European countries, Brazil, Australia, and China creating the large majority. The European and East Asian countries, especially China, have dominated in the establishment of geoparks. The most pressing need in future studies is more balanced geographic distribution, as the current strong slant towards a limited portion of the world cannot adequately capture (on the research front) and preserve (on the geoparks front) global geodiversity. Finally, there is a need investigate whether the spatial patterns of biodiversity are idiosyncratic or are also a characteristic of abiotic resources, permitting the standardization of diversity research methods. This review contends that there are intriguing similarities in biodiversity, geodiversity, and pedodiversity patterns that should be explored, something that would benefit all of these research areas.",Rapid detection of cadmium and its distribution in Miscanthus sacchariflorus based on visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096318,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Monitoring the effectiveness of Miscanthus sacchariflorus to meet the basic requirements for environmental remediation projects is an important step in determining its use as a productive bioenergy crop for phytoremediation. Conventional chemical methods for the determination of cadmium (Cd) contents involve time-consuming, monotonous and destructive procedures and are not suitable for high-throughput screening. In the present study, visible and near-infrared hyperspectral imaging technology combined with chemometric methods was used to assess the Cd concentrations in M. sacchariflorus. The total Cd concentrations in different plant tissues were measured using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer. Partial least-squares regression and least-squares support vector machine were implemented to estimate Cd contents from spectral reflectance. Successive projections algorithm and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) methodology were used for selecting optimal wavelength. The CARS-partial least-squares regression model resulted in the most accurate predictions of Cd contents in M. sacchariflorus leaves, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.87 and a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 97.78 for the calibration set, and an R2 value of 0.91 and a RMSE value of 75.95 for the prediction set. The CARS-least-squares support vector machine model resulted in the most satisfactory predictions of Cd contents in roots, with R2 values of 0.95 (RMSE, 0.92 × 103) for the calibration set and 0.90 (RMSE, 1.64 × 103) for the prediction set. Finally, the Cd concentrations in different plant tissues were visualized on the prediction maps by predicted spectral features on each hyperspectral image pixel. Thus, visible and near-infrared imaging combined with chemometric methods produces a promising technique to evaluate M. sacchariflorus' Cd phytoremediation capability in high-throughput metal-contaminated field applications.",Long-term exposure to high temperature associated with the incidence of major depressive disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096317,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Temperature was reported to have acute effects on mental disorders. However, the effect of long-term temperature exposure is unclear, especially in warmer regions. This research aimed to evaluate the association between long-term exposure to temperature and the incidence of major depressive disorder (MDD). A retrospective population-based study was conducted using Taiwan nationwide Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005. Subjects without MDD diagnosis were followed from 2003 to 2013 for MDD occurrence. Weather factors including temperature (°C), sunshine duration (hrs/day), and precipitation (mm/day) were 11-year average of daily data collected from weather monitoring stations of Taiwan Central Weather Bureau. Cox proportional hazard model was performed to examine the association between MDD incidence and weather factors. Covariates including age, gender, and insurance amount were adjusted. A total of 9,539,752 person-years were followed. People residing in regions with long-term temperature of 20-23 °C had the lowest risk of developing MDD. Risk for MDD incidence was higher among residents in regions with average temperature > 23 °C, at 7% increase per 1 °C increment (95% CI = 2-12%). The elderly was more vulnerable to such impact of heat exposure. For the elderly, males were more susceptible to heat-related MDD than females (HR = 1.18 vs. 1.14). However, the younger group showed a reverse finding (i.e. females 1.07 > males 1.04). Long-term residence in regions with extreme cold or heat may increase the risk of MDD incidence, especially higher temperature. Under global warming, these findings have great health implications and warrant further confirmation.",Quantifying relationships between urban land use and flow frequency of small Missouri streams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096316,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 20,"Flow frequency is an important hydrologic statistic to consider in environmental flows assessment. However, there is a paucity of focused interdisciplinary hydrologic assessments that quantify human development influence on flow frequency of small streams (drainage area < 282 km2). Relationships between urban land use and land cover (LULC) and flow frequency were assessed for general trends at current gauged watersheds (n = 32) of Missouri, USA. Urban land use - flow frequency relationships changed from linear in developed areas with <50% total impervious surfaces (i.e. low density urban areas), to non-linear in developed areas with >50% total impervious surfaces (i.e. high density urban areas). Urban land use influence on flow frequency was not detected in events below median flow (0.02510 < R2 > 0.03356; n = 32). Conversely, urban land use - flow frequency relationships were relatively strong above median flow (0.55500 < R2 > 0.78703; n = 32). Further, explained variance generally increased to meso-scale flows (0.58350 < R2 > 0.82470; n = 32), and then, decreased during high flows (0.34912 < R2 > 0.61805; n = 32). More specifically, the greatest observed influence of urban land use on flow frequency increased from a 0.2 to 1 year return period in low density urban areas, to a 1 to 2 year return period in high density urban areas in small Missouri streams. Thus, results indicate that management efforts should focus on reducing the frequency of 1 year events in low density urban land use areas, and 2 year events in high density urban areas to secure environmental services of small urban streams in Missouri, USA. These results hold important implications for other regions globally, where urban land use has increased the frequency of streamflow response.",Impact of body mass index on survival in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis: Analysis of data from the Insan Memorial End-Stage Renal Disease Registry of Korea (1985-2014).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096315,Kidney research and clinical practice,2019 06 12,Significant increases in the prevalence of obesity have been observed among patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD).

This study aims to identify the determinants of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) in T2DM patients with CKD in Fiji in 2018. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at Sigatoka Sub-divisional Hospital (SSH) in Fiji in July-August, 2018 using a self-structured questionnaire to test KAP of 225 patients. The inclusion criteria were confirmed T2DM patients (Fijian citizens) with CKD, aged 30 years or above and attending Special Out-Patient's Department (SOPD) at SSH. Independent t-test and ANOVA was used to test differences between demographic variable and practice score while non-parametric tests were used for knowledge and attitude. Spearman correlation and multiple linear regressions were conducted. All tests were set at 5% level of significance. Results: From 249 questionnaires distributed, 225 responded thus response rate was 95%. The mean KAP level was high: knowledge, 23.3/30 (SD±3.25); attitude, 23.1/30 (SD±2.73) and practice, 7.1/10 (SD±2.04). A high level of knowledge was seen in those with university-level education (p<0.001), unemployed (p=0.05) and high average monthly income (p=0.03). Those aged 61-70 years had a 0.53-point lower attitude score (p=0.05) than other age categories, while those >70 years had a 1.78-point lower attitude score (p=0.01) than other age categories. Fijians of Indian descent (FID) had lower attitude (p=0.002) and higher practice (p=0.001) scores. Conclusion: Patients with both T2DM and CKD at SSH have high levels of KAP. The determinants of KAP have been shown and thus, this study identified high-risk groups for low KAP, which can become the focus of future public health intervention."

As the initiator of the coagulation cascade, the transmembrane glycoprotein tissue factor (TF) has been intensely investigated for its role in cancer-associated thrombosis and cancer progression. TF expression is regulated by both specific oncogenes and environmental factors, and it is shown to regulate primary growth and metastasis formation in a variety of cancer models. In clinical studies, TF has been shown to be overexpressed in most cancer types and is strongly associated with disease progression. While TF clearly associates with cancer progression, a prominent role for TF in the development of cancer-associated thrombosis is less clear. The current concept is that cancer-associated thrombosis is associated with the secretion of tumor-derived TF-positive extracellular vesicles in certain tumor types. To date, many therapeutic strategies to target TF-both in preclinical and clinical phase-are being pursued, including targeting TF or the TF:FVIIa complex by itself or by exploiting TF as a docking molecule to deliver cytotoxic compounds to the tumor. In this review, the authors summarize the current understanding of the role of TF in both cancer progression and cancer-associated thrombosis, and discuss novel insights on TF as a therapeutic target as well as a biomarker for cancer progression and VTE.","Shear-, Sound-, and Light-Sensitive Nanoparticles for Thrombolytic Drug Delivery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096310,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 05 16,"Thrombotic diseases, as potentially induced by blood clots or vascular embolization, frequently occur with high rates of mortalities worldwide. Current drug thrombolysis, a primary clinical therapy, may increase fatal risk of hemorrhage when thrombolysis agents become systemically distributed. Given current thrombolysis limitations, some novel drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles have been recently exploited to achieve a more controlled release of loaded thrombolytic agents, able to respond to environmental changes, and resulting in a safer thrombolysis. In this review, the authors outline and discuss some prominent examples of early and recent thrombolytic agent delivery systems using controlled release by physical stimuli (shear, sound and light). Shear-sensitive systems are designed to exploit the specific biomechanical feature of thrombosis, that is, the increased blood shear stress. Sound- and light-sensitive systems reflect ""remote control"" of drug release by responding to external ultrasound or light stimulus.

Although oral anticoagulation is effective in preventing VTE episodes, bleeding complications are a major concern that may lead to treatment avoidance. Statin therapy, which is widely used for prevention of arterial cardiovascular disease, is a promising alternative treatment for VTE prophylaxis, as the drug may affect hemostasis without increasing the risk of bleeding. In the past years, clinical studies have suggested that statins can interfere with blood coagulation and, in turn, reduce the risk of VTE. These effects, however, are still regarded with skepticism, as the underlying mechanisms by which statins may affect hemostasis in humans are not clear and data showing that statin therapy reduces VTE risk mostly came from observational studies, while only one randomized trial was conducted to evaluate this issue. In this review, the authors summarize the currently available evidence regarding the effect of statin therapy on coagulation and on VTE prevention. Recent randomized data showed that statin therapy, in particular rosuvastatin, leads to decreased levels of coagulation factors in patients with prior VTE. This evidence provides a reasonable basis for interventional studies necessary to establish the efficacy of statins on reducing the risk of incident and recurrent VTE.",Hemostatic Abnormalities in Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096308,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 05 16,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the most frequent cause of dementia. It is known that vascular risk factors play an important role in the development and progression of this condition. Alterations in vascular walls represent documented findings in patients with AD and other dementias affecting elderly people.

In this review, the authors provide an updated overview of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and emerging methodologies. NGS has tremendously improved sequencing output while being more time and cost-efficient in comparison to Sanger sequencing. The authors describe short-read sequencing approaches, such as sequencing by synthesis, ion semiconductor sequencing, and nanoball sequencing. Third-generation long-read sequencing now promises to overcome many of the limitations of short-read sequencing, such as the ability to reliably resolve repeat sequences and large genomic rearrangements. By combining complementary methods with massively parallel DNA sequencing, a greater insight into the biological context of disease mechanisms is now possible. Emerging methodologies, such as advances in nanopore technology, in situ nucleic acid sequencing, and microscopy-based sequencing, will continue the rapid evolution of this area. These new technologies hold many potential applications for hematological disorders, with the promise of precision and personalized medical care in the future.","Tissue Factor and Cancer: Regulation, Tumor Growth, and Metastasis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096306,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 06 10,"There is a strong relationship between tissue factor (TF) and cancer. Many cancer cells express high levels of both full-length TF and alternatively spliced (as) TF. TF expression in cancer is associated with poor prognosis. In this review, the authors summarize the regulation of TF expression in cancer cells and the roles of TF and asTF in tumor growth and metastasis. A variety of different signaling pathways, transcription factors and micro ribonucleic acids regulate TF gene expression in cancer cells. The TF/factor VIIa complex enhances tumor growth by activating protease-activated receptor 2 signaling and by increasing the expression of angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor. AsTF increases tumor growth by enhancing integrin β1 signaling. TF and asTF also contribute to metastasis via multiple thrombin-dependent and independent mechanisms that include protecting tumor cells from natural killer cells. Finally, a novel anticancer therapy is using tumor TF as a target to deliver cytotoxic drugs to the tumor. TF may be useful in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer.",Tumors: Wounds That Do Not Heal-A Historical Perspective with a Focus on the Fundamental Roles of Increased Vascular Permeability and Clotting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096305,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 05 16,"Similarities between solid tumor stroma generation, wound healing, chronic inflammation, and associated inflammatory diseases have prompted interest from the time of Virchow. However, it was not until the 1970s that these entities were shown to share important molecular mechanisms. Foundational to all of them is the initiating role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) in increasing vascular permeability to plasma and plasma proteins. Extravasated plasma activates the tissue factor clotting pathway, leading to extravascular deposition of a fibrin gel. Fibrin serves initially as a provisional stroma that provides a favorable substrate for the attachment and migration of tumor cells, as well as host fibroblasts, endothelial, and inflammatory cells. Fibrin and its degradation products have proangiogenic activity with important roles in the generation of new blood vessels and connective tissue stroma. Over time, fibrin is degraded and replaced by vascular and subsequently by dense, relatively avascular collagenous connective tissue, the end-product referred to as desmoplasia in tumors and scar in healed wounds. Fibrin and the mature stroma that replaces it provide a diffusion barrier to chemotherapy and a structural barrier that inflammatory cells must cross to reach tumor cells. Plasma solutes of varying size cross the endothelial cells lining capillaries and venules of normal tissues and ""mother"" vessels of tumors and wounds by different anatomical pathways. VEGF-A levels fall back to normal as wounds heal but remain perpetually elevated in solid tumors. Thus, tumors may heal centrally but continually initiate new healing activity as they grow and invade surrounding normal tissues.",Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events with Aspirin: Toward More Harm than Benefit-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096304,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2019 05 16,"Primary prevention of cardiovascular events with aspirin remains controversial, as the risk of bleeding might outweigh the benefits. Recently, new evidence has emerged from the ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events), ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes), and ASPREE (Effect of Aspirin on Cardiovascular Events and Bleeding in the Healthy Elderly) trials. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of aspirin's efficacy and safety in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in healthy individuals and in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, and separately in those with diabetes. The Medline database was searched, without time restrictions, for relevant human trials published in English up to December 10, 2018, and additional trials were identified from reference lists. Data on efficacy (cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction) and safety (major bleeding) were extracted for analysis. In total, 20 randomized trials were identified. Separate meta-analyses were performed on 10 trials including 144,930 individuals, who were healthy or had cardiovascular risk factors, and on 4 trials including 20,326 individuals with diabetes. In healthy individuals and individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, aspirin reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction by 21% (p < 0.001), but had no effect on cardiovascular death (p = 0.52), and increased the risk of major bleeding by 48% (p < 0.001). In individuals with diabetes, aspirin had no effect on nonfatal myocardial infarction (p = 0.93) or cardiovascular death (p = 0.92) and increased the risk of bleeding by 49% (p = 0.13).

Via internet, information can be easily retrieved and participative applications allow new types of interaction. The healthcare system is directly affected because information and communication represent a relevant part of it. The present contribution is intended to describe this development and its impact on otorhinolaryngology. The use of the internet for the research of health-related information is continuously increasing since several years and has meanwhile achieved significant importance. In the clinical context, other information sources still have a higher relevance. Laypeople mostly use the search engine of Google when performing health-related research. Even if the reliability of the presented information is difficult to assess, alternative offers that are specialized on valid healthcare information could not prevail. Anecdotic or incorrect information are regularly observed. Numerous trials investigated the quality of healthcare information on web pages. The methodical spectrum reaches from formula-depending readability testing via structured assessment tools up to certificates. The result shows that healthcare information on internet sites is often difficult to understand for the general population. Nearly all social media contain healthcare information and their relevance is increasing. Nonetheless, there is only few scientific knowledge on the characteristics and the effect of healthcare information in social media. The availability of online healthcare information requires new understanding of health literacy. The concept of digital literacy (eHealth literacy) contains among others the readability, media competence, IT knowledge, and basic scientific knowledge. The implementation of those skills depends on individual and social factors such as education, socio-economic status, and age. Investigations revealed a low healthcare literacy in a high percentage of the patients.The distribution of the internet also modifies the relationship between physician and patient. Well-informed patients request being involved in medical decisions. Physicians have a particular responsibility regarding the consultation of medical laypeople by weighting and verifying information. By actively participating, physicians should contribute to digitization in medicine for the benefit of their patients. Medical associations are particularly invited to contribute to this process.",Medical Apps in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096301,Laryngo- rhino- otologie,2019 05 16,"The implementation of mobile information and communication technology in the field of health services, e. g. in the form of apps, is becoming increasingly important. Unfortunately, the necessary quality criteria are often mising. Thus, it seems important, that in addition to an app controlling authority highly qualified health care professionals participate in the development of these applications. For reasons of liability, however, the physician must exercise great caution in the selection and recommendation of medical apps, especially considering, that only a few apps are certified as medical devices. There are a large number of medical apps on the market, with only a small proportion being assigned to the field of otorhinolaryngology. The areas of audiology, sleep medicine and allergology are most frequently represented. Althouhgh there is increasing scientific work on this topic in the field of otorhinolaryngology, there is a lack of scientific evidence of contents and results, as is generally the case of medical apps. However, there are other possibilities for users to rate medical apps regarding defined qualitiy criteria such as functionality, scientific integrity, but also data privacy. None of the apps assessed by such a evaluation tool met all the required quality criteria, but the applied instrument helped to better assess the application. However, it was possible to consider the quality criteria in the developmental process of an medical app for the field of otorhinolaryngoglogy.

Inflammatory reactions after surgical interventions distant from the vascularised limbus and without opening of the anterior chamber of the eye are usually very muted, because of the corneal immune and angiogenic privilege. A milestone in the therapy and prophylaxis of inflammation after corneal surgery has been the use of topical glucocorticoids since the 1950s. When these are used, it is important to consider the cataractogenic effect of long-term use, the possibility of steroid-induced increase in intraocular pressure (so-called steroid response), the increased risk for microbial infection and the inhibition of epithelialisation. The available glucocorticoids differ in their ability to penetrate into the eye (prednisolone best), their immunosuppressive activity (dexamethasone best) and their ability to induce a steroid response (loteprednol etabonate and fluorometholone least). Preservative-free formulations are only available for dexamethasone. The different properties must be taken into account when choosing the ""best"" glucocorticoid: If there is a risk of delay in epithelialisation of the wound, topical steroids should be avoided or if necessary, phosphate- and preservative-free dexamethasone should be used with caution. If efficiency in the posterior cornea or in the anterior chamber is important, e.g. after penetrating keratoplasty, prednisolone acetate should be used. If a steroid response is known, loteprednol etabonate or fluorometholone should be used. When allogeneic tissue is transplanted, long-term topical glucocorticoid use over 24 months or longer is necessary. After high-risk keratoplasty with allogeneic donor tissue, supplemental systemic immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors or mycophenolate mofetil over 6 to 12 months is recommended.",[Perioperative Anti-inflammatory Treatment in Glaucoma Surgery].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096283,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,2019 05 16,"Many clinical studies have demonstrated the benefit of topical anti-inflammatory medication before and after glaucoma surgery, especially for trabeculectomy, and that they improve the long term outcome.

Systemic steroid or oral immunomodulation have significant impact on the outcome in uveitic glaucoma, but not in other glaucoma subtypes. Additional topical treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories is an option in combined cataract-glaucoma surgery. Anti-inflammatory treatment after selective laser trabeculoplasty is not necessary, but relieves pain after argon laser trabeculoplasty and laser cyclophotocoagulation.

Although they are rare, some possible complications of these procedures remain relevant for surgeons and patients. Macular edema in cataract surgery and sterile infections of the cornea after refractive corneal surgery can lower the visual outcome significantly. Such complications can occur due to activation of inflammation cascades as a result of local tissue manipulation during the surgery. Even though the incidence is very low, there are affected patients as a result of the high number of performed surgeries. Therefore, lowering those numbers with perioperative application of local eye drops is critical. Studies show a lower risk of macular edema, anterior chamber inflammation and postoperative pain in patients treated with perioperative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). That is why a treatment with corticosteroid and NSAID drops should be prescribed. After lamellar corneal surgery, a local steroid application is recommended to lower the incidence of haze and deep lamellar keratitis (DLK).",Evaluation of Preoperative Pain Using PROMIS Pain Interference in Knee Surgery Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096280,The journal of knee surgery,2019 05 16,"Given that pain relief is often the primary goal of orthopaedic surgery, an accurate assessment of pain is paramount.

We hypothesized that there would be a strong correlation between PI and NPS, with minimal floor and ceiling effects; and that a worse PI score would be associated with a worse general health profile. The sample consisted of 412 patients undergoing knee surgery at an urban academic center. Patients were preoperatively administered measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Bivariate and multivariable statistical analyses were performed to identify significant independent predictors. The mean PI score was 60.3 ± 7.2 and had no floor or ceiling effects, whereas NPS demonstrated a greater percentage of patients scoring at the extremes of the measure. Worse PI scores were associated with older age, higher body mass index (BMI), greater comorbidity, lower income, smoking, female gender, Hispanic ethnicity, Black race, unemployment, opioid use, lower expectations, and greater American Society of Anesthesiologists score (p < 0.05). Compared with other procedures, total knee arthroplasty was associated with worse PI scores and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was associated with better PI scores. Furthermore, PI demonstrated significant associations with a wide range of HRQOL measures. After controlling for confounding variables, worse PI was independently associated with older age, lower income, higher BMI, and smoking.","[Medicine and Economy: Measures for a Science Based, Patient-Centred and Resource Conscious Care.

Among all the treatment options for the treatment of DAVFs, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a safe and effective modality. SRS provides a minimally invasive therapy for patients who harbor less aggressive DAVFs without cortical vein drainage (CVD), but who suffer from intolerable headache, bruit, or ocular symptoms. For more aggressive DAVFs with CVD associated with immediate risks of hemorrhage, initial treatment with endovascular embolization or surgery for the prompt elimination of the aggressive components of DAVFs is necessary. In such cases, radiosurgery may serve as a secondary treatment for further management of residual nidus after initial intervention. The latent period for the effects of radiation to occur and the longer time for cure compared to surgery and endovascular therapy remains a major drawback for radiosurgery. However, the gradual obliteration of a DAVF after radiosurgery can avoid the immediate risk of aggravated venous hypertension or infarction, which sometimes complicates endovascular embolization and surgery.",Radiosurgery for Central Neurocytoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096256,Progress in neurological surgery,2019 05 20,"The classification of central neurocytoma (CN) by the WHO was upgraded to grade 2 in 1993 as it was recognized that at least some of these tumors can exhibit more aggressive behavior.

Indeed, some atypical variants have been reported and residual postsurgical tumor is believed to have the potential for malignant transformation. Although gross total resection is usually curative for CN (5-year survival rate 99%), it is achieved in nearly 30-50% of cases due to its central location.

Leksell stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is offered as salvage therapy in patients with recurrent or residual malignant gliomas. SRS is well tolerated and is associated with a relatively low risk of adverse radiation effects in malignant glial tumor patients who otherwise have relatively few options. SRS allows the surgeon more flexibility in terms of surgical options and may enhance quality of life for patients postoperatively.

Because of the variable risk of subacute bleeding, their management options have been controversial. The annual risk of an incidentally detected CM bleeding is <0.5% each year. Leksell radiosurgery is used for a subgroup of patients who have repeatedly bled. In general, CM best considered for stereotactic radiosurgery are deep seated and do not pre-sent to a pial or ependymal surface where microsurgical corridors for removal are feasible.

Several grading scales attempting to predict the outcome for specific patients have previously been proposed and validated, and are outlined here. These have largely been based on both AVM and patient characteristics and attempt to predict obliteration. However, the most practical and clinically oriented goal in the management of AVMs is the prospective avoidance of neurological sequelae manifesting in the form of stroke or death, regardless of AVM obliteration. Long-term outcomes following SRS have demonstrated stroke or death rates of 1.5-2.0% per year for the first 5 years after SRS, followed by 0.2-0.4% annual risk thereafter. This focus on the avoidance of stroke or death is additionally crucial for direct comparisons to non-interventional natural history data.

Patients who are refractory to medical management can explore surgical intervention. Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) and radiofrequency thalamotomy (RFT) are surgical procedures for intractable tremor that target the ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus to relieve contralateral tremor. For patients who are not candidates for surgical procedures, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive management option for tremor relief. SRS has been used for the elderly, those considered high surgical risk for other surgical procedures, those who are unresponsive to either DBS or RFT, and those who prefer a less invasive option. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is performed using a central dose of 130-140 Gy delivered to the VIM nucleus of the thalamus. The critical aspect of the dose planning procedure is the selection of the target, which requires a neurosurgeon experienced with movement disorder surgery. More than 90% of patients experience improvements in their tremor and quality of life after radiosurgical thalamotomy. Adverse radiation effects rates are low (4%). In selected cases, staged bilateral procedure can also be performed to relieve bilateral refractory tremor.

Since that time our center has installed each succeeding Gamma Knife device developed. During an initial 30-year experience we performed more than 14,750 patient procedures. In addition to patient care our Center's goal was to develop a major teaching and clinical research program that eventually led to the training of more than 2,500 physicians and medical physicists, the publication of more than 600 peer-reviewed clinical outcome research studies, and 4 books.

While its etiology is likely multifactorial, immune system dysfunction has increasingly been implicated in its development. As hallucinations and delusions occur frequently and prominently in autoimmune encephalitis (AE), numerous studies have sought to determine whether a small subset of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia possess anti-neuronal antibodies implicated in AE. Exploring this possibility is of clinical relevance, as identifying individuals with AE who have been misdiagnosed as having a primary psychotic disorder may allow for the implementation of appropriate immune-related therapies as early as possible in the course of the illness, in order to optimize outcomes, reduce illness chronicity, and minimize adverse events. This qualitative review serves to provide an overview of the existing literature on this topic, as well as to update previously published reviews. Although there is some evidence to suggest that in rare cases AE may be misdiagnosed as a primary psychotic disorder, particularly early in the course of the illness, numerous methodological differences between studies likely account for the highly variable findings, and interpretation of the results is particularly limited by a paucity of cerebrospinal fluid data. Moreover, the prevalence of misdiagnosis in chronic and treatment-resistant populations remains understudied. This is particularly problematic, as treatment resistance may represent an enriched population with respect to the presence of anti-neuronal antibodies, and given that such patients have few evidence-based treatment options available to them beyond clozapine.",Radiosurgery for Behavioral Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096225,Progress in neurological surgery,2019 05 20,"Psychiatric illnesses create great suffering for patients and the medical solution is sometimes limited.

Sitting enables PET scanning under more natural conditions for the subjects and also helps with making the scanners smaller. It is unclear, however, how much the degree of head motion when sitting differs from the supine posture commonly employed in clinical PET. In this report, we describe development of a markerless and contactless head motion tracking system and a study of healthy volunteers in several different postures to determine the optimum posture for brain PET. We used Kinect® (Microsoft) and developed software that can measure head motion with about 1 mm (translation) and less than 1° (rotation) accuracy. In the volunteer study, we measured the amount of head motion, with and without head fixation, in supine, normal sitting, and reclining postures. The results indicated that the normal sitting posture without head fixation had the largest head movement, and that the reclining and supine postures were similarly effective for minimizing head movement (average head movement of about 0.5 mm during 1 min). We also visualized the influence that head motion had on images for each pose by simulating the actual motions obtained from the volunteer study using a digital Hoffman phantom. Comparisons with the original image showed that the extent to which motion was reduced in the reclining and supine postures were quantitatively equivalent. The head motions of the volunteer studies were also reproduced using a mannequin head on a motorized stage to assess how well the proposed motion measurement system worked when used for motion correction. The results indicated that even though the system improved image quality for all postures, the reclining and supine postures could provide better image quality than the normal sitting posture.",Fabrication of size-controllable human mesenchymal stromal cell spheroids from micro-scaled cell sheets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096204,Biofabrication,2019 06 07,"Recently, stromal cell spheroids have been actively studied for use in tissue regeneration. In this study, we report a method for the fabrication of size-controllable stromal cell spheroids in different sizes from micro-scaled cell sheets (μCS) using thermosensitive hydrogels and investigated their effects on stromal cell function. Mesenchymal stromal cells isolated from different tissues such as human turbinate tissue, bone marrow, and adipose tissue were adhered selectively to each micro-pattern (squares with widths of 100 and 400 μm) on the surface of the hydrogel and formed μCS. The diameters of the spheroids were modulated by the size of the patterns (45 ± 5 and 129 ± 4 μm in diameter for the 100 and 400 μm micro-patterns, respectively) and the seeding density (129 ± 4, 149 ± 6, and 163 ± 6 μm for 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0 × 104 cells cm-2, respectively, on 400 μm micro-pattern). In addition, the spheroids were successfully fabricated regardless of stromal cell origin, and the diameter of the spheroids was also affected by cell spreading area on a cell culture dish. Stemness markers were highly expressed in the spheroids regardless of the spheroid size. Furthermore, an increase in E-cadherin and decrease in N-cadherin gene expression showed the stable formation of spheroids of different sizes. Gene expression levels of hypoxia inducible factors and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor were increased (13.2 ± 1.4, 325 ± 83.4 and 534.3 ± 121.5 pg ng-1 DNA in a monolayer, and 100 and 400 μm micro-patterned spheroids, respectively) proportional to the diameters of the spheroids. The size of spheroids were maintained even after injection, cryopreservation and 7 d of suspension culture with high viability (∼90%). In conclusion, this novel technique to fabricate spheroids with controlled size could be widely applied in various applications that require a controlled size in regenerative medicine.",An evidence of local structural disorder across spin-reorientation transition in DyFeO3: an extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096203,Journal of physics.

For this purpose we studied by XAFS the evolution of the local atomic structure around Fe and Dy as function of temperature (10-300 K) in a DyFeO3 sample having the SRT around 50-100 K. For sake of comparison we studied a YFeO3 sample having no SRT. The analysis of the extended region has revealed an anomalous trend of Fe-O nearest neighbour distribution in DFO revealing (i) a weak but significant compression with increasing temperature above the SRT and (ii) a peculiar behavior of mean square relative displacement (MSRD) [[Formula: see text]] of Fe-O bonds showing an additional static contribution in the low temperature region, below the SRT. These effects are absent in the YFO sample supporting these anomalies related to the SRT.

Current techniques use non-linear optimizations only to reach a local minimum and not a globally optimal solution, limiting application to cases with small spatial displacements. Various semi-dense feature-based methods drawing inspiration from mammalian systems as the basis for 2D visual processing have been implemented for automated wide baseline registration and object detection applications with great success. Extension to the 3D case, which has been shown to enable highly efficient coarse global image search, in theory could be adapted also to allow precise semi-dense global optimization. The algorithm described in this paper, dubbed Constrained Robust Affine Feature Transform (CRAFT), incorporates paradigms from various computer-vision techniques to combine aspects of the human visual pathway with proven non-linear optimization methods to automate general deformable registration with unprecedented robustness. This hybrid technique is able to estimate registration confidence and can serve as the basis of machine perception of medical images for machine learning."

Osteopontin (OPN) is an important factor involved in atherogenesis, and hyperglycemia enhances the transcriptional activity of FoxO1 which is closely association with insulin resistance and diabetes. Here we showed that plasma OPN levels were significantly elevated in type 2 diabetic patients and positively correlated with glycated albumin (GA). The more atherosclerotic lesions were observed in the aorta of diabetic apoE-/- mice analyzed by Sudan IV staining. High glucose increased both the mRNA and protein expression levels of OPN and inhibited the phosphorylation of FoxO1 in RAW 264.7 cells. Overexpression of wild type or constitutively active mutant FoxO1 promoted the expression levels of OPN, while the dominant-negative mutant FoxO1 decreased slightly the expression of OPN. Conversely, knockdown of FoxO1 reduced the expression of OPN. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that high glucose and overexpression of FoxO1 enhanced the activities of the OPN promoter region nt -1918 ~ -713. Furthermore, the interactions between FoxO1 and the OPN promoter were confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP). Our results suggest that high glucose upregulates OPN expression via FoxO1 activation, which would play a critical role in the development of diabetic atherogenesis.",Determinants Of The Growth Hormone Nadir During Oral Glucose Tolerance Test In Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096183,European journal of endocrinology,2019 05 16,"Growth hormone (GH) nadir (GHnadir) during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is an important tool in diagnosing acromegaly, but data evaluating the need to adjust cut-offs to biological variables utilizing todays assay methods are scarce.

Approximately 50% of patients with HH are diazoxide resistant. However, marked diazoxide sensitivity resulting in severe hyperglycaemia is extremely uncommon and not reported previously in the context of HH due to HNF4A mutation. We report a novel observation of exceptional diazoxide sensitivity in a patient with HH due to HNF4A mutation. A female infant presented with severe persistent neonatal hypoglycaemia and was diagnosed with HH. Standard doses of diazoxide (5 mg/kg/day) resulted in marked hyperglycaemia (maximum blood glucose 21.6 mmol/L) necessitating discontinuation of diazoxide. Lower dose of diazoxide (1.5 mg/kg/day) successfully controlled HH in the proband, which was subsequently confirmed to be due to a novel HNF4A mutation. At 3 years of age, the patient maintains age appropriate fasting tolerance on low dose diazoxide (1.8 mg/kg/day) and has normal development. Diagnosis in proband's mother and maternal aunt, both of whom carried HNF4A mutation and had been diagnosed with presumed type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively, was revised to maturity-onset diabetes of young (MODY). Proband's 5-year-old maternal cousin, also carrier of HNF4A mutation, had transient neonatal hypoglycaemia. To conclude, patients with HH due to HNF4A mutation may require lower diazoxide than other group of patients with HH. Educating the families about the risk of marked hyperglycaemia with diazoxide is essential. The clinical phenotype of HNF4A mutation can be extremely variable. Learning points: Awareness of risk of severe hyperglycaemia with diazoxide is important and patients/families should be accordingly educated. Some patients with HH due to HNF4A mutations may require lower than standard doses of diazoxide.

There is a direct relationship between the degree of severity of hypercalcaemia and miscarriage risk, with miscarriage being more common in those patients with a serum calcium greater than 2.85 mmol/L. Neonatal complications include hypocalcemia. Herein, we present a case series of three women who were diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy. Case 1 was diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) in pregnancy and required a bilateral neck exploration and subtotal parathyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy due to symptomatic severe hypercalcaemia. Both case 2 and case 3 were diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma and required a unilateral parathyroidectomy in the second trimester. This case series highlights the work-up and the tailored management approach to patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy. Learning points: Primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy is associated with a high incidence of associated maternal fetal and neonatal complications directly proportionate to degree of maternal serum calcium levels. Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy and was used in the management of all three cases in this series. It is recommended when serum calcium is persistently greater than 2.75 mmol/L and or for the management of maternal or fetal complications of hypercalcaemia. Surgical management, when necessary is ideally performed in the second trimester. Primary hyperparathyroidism is genetically determined in ~10% of cases, where the likelihood is increased in those under 40 years, where there is relevant family history and those with other related endocrinopathies. Genetic testing is a useful diagnostic adjunct and can guide treatment and management options for patients diagnosed with primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy, as described in case 1 in this series, who was diagnosed with MEN1 syndrome. Women of reproductive age with primary hyperparathyroidism need to be informed of the risks and complications associated with primary hyperparathyroidism in pregnancy and pregnancy should be deferred and or avoided until curative surgery has been performed and calcium levels have normalised.",Hypo-activity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex relates to increased reaction time variability in patients with schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096180,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 06 11,"Increased reaction time intra-subject variability (RT-ISV) in fast decision tasks has been confirmed in patients with schizophrenia and has been hypothesized to result from a deficit in the control of attention. Here, an attentional task and functional brain imaging were used to probe the neural correlates of increased RT-ISV in schizophrenia. Thirty patients and 30 age and sex matched controls performed the Eriksen flanker spatial attention task with concurrent measurement of brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The behavioral measures included accuracy, mean, standard deviation of RT (RTSD), coefficient of variation of RT (RTCV) and ex-Gaussian model of RT distribution parameters (mu, sigma and tau). Larger mean RT and Ex-Gaussian mu was observed for patients compared to controls. The group difference was larger for incongruent (attentionally demanding) versus congruent trials confirming a deficit in the control of spatial attention for patients. Significant increase in RT-ISV measures (RTSD, sigma and tau) for patients compared to controls was observed and was not modulated by trial congruency. Attention modulation (congruency effect) resulted in activation of bilateral frontal and parietal areas that was not different between patients and controls. Right middle frontal, right superior temporal and bilateral cingulate areas were more active in controls compared to patients independent of congruency. Activation in ROIs extracted from attention (congruency) and group related areas correlated with RT-ISV measures (especially RTCV and tau). Hypo-activation of the right middle frontal area correlated with increased tau specifically in patients. Hypo-activity of the right prefrontal cortex predicted increased RT-ISV in schizophrenia. This effect was unrelated to the effects of spatial attention and might be linked to a deficit in the inhibitory control of action for these patients.",Cost-Effectiveness of Docetaxel and Paclitaxel for Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer: Adaptation of a Model-Based Economic Evaluation From the United Kingdom to South Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096179,Value in health regional issues,2019 06 12,"Transferability of economic evaluations to low- and middle-income countries through adaptation of models is important; however, several methodological and practical challenges remain. Given its significant costs and the quality-of-life burden to patients, adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer was identified as a priority intervention by the South African National Department of Health.

In the current study, we describe the development of the VM-REACT (Verbal Memory REcAll Computerized Test), which assesses verbal memory recall abilities using a computerized, automated version. Four different list versions of the test were applied on a cohort of 798 healthy adults (ages 20-80). Recall and learning scores were computed and compared to existing gender- and age-matched published norms for a similar paper-and-pencil test. Performance was similar to existing age-matched norms for all but the two oldest age groups. These adults (ages 60-80) outperformed their age-matched norms. Processing speed, initiation speed, and number of recall errors are also reported for each age group. Our findings suggest that VM-REACT can be utilized to study verbal memory abilities in a standardized and time efficient manner, and thus holds great promise for assessment in the 21st century."

Firstly, the toxicities of the photocatalyst, normal paraffine hydrocarbons and their combination towards the microalgae were evaluated in terms of cell growth and chlorophyll content. The capability of algae to absorb the nanoparticles in the aqueous phase was confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy. Then, the hydrocarbon removal efficiencies of the algae, photocatalyst and the combined photocatalyst-algae system were studied by measuring the residual hydrocarbon content of the samples. Results indicated that despite of the growth inhibitory effects of n-alkanes and nanoparticles on the examined algae, both of them could survive in the system. Dunaliella tertiolecta was more affected by normal paraffins while Chlorella vulgaris was more sensitive to ZnO nanoparticles. Both of the studied species were capable of hydrocarbon removal and the efficiency of Chlorella vulgaris was superior. The combination of algae and nanoparticles was also proved to have a synergistic effect on degradation of the hydrocarbon content of the medium. The obtained removal efficiencies for initial hydrocarbon concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.5% (v/v) were 100%, 78% and 42% for Dunaliella tertiolecta-ZnO and 100%, 93% and 88% for Chlorella vulgaris- ZnO system, respectively.

This inverse S-shaped distortion pattern is similar to that observed in a wide variety of proportion judgment tasks (see Hollands & Dyre, 2000, for review). In proportion judgment tasks, distortion patterns tend not to be fixed but rather to depend on the reference points to which the targets are compared. Here, we tested the novel hypothesis that probability distortion in decision making under risk might also be influenced by reference points-in this case, references implied by the probability range. Adult participants were assigned to either a full-range (probabilities from 0-100%), upper-range (50-100%), or lower-range (0-50%) condition, where they indicated certainty equivalents for 176 hypothetical monetary gambles (e.g., ""a 50% chance of $100, otherwise $0""). Using a modified cumulative prospect theory model, we found only minimal differences in probability distortion as a function of condition, suggesting no differences in use of reference points by condition, and broadly demonstrating the robustness of distortion pattern across contexts. However, we also observed deviations from the curve across all conditions that warrant further research.",Ethyl glucuronide hair testing: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096163,Forensic science international,2019 06 03,"Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a minor, non-oxidative ethanol metabolite that can be detected in several matrices (e.g. blood, urine, hair, meconium) for variable periods of time. Quantification of EtG in hair (hEtG) has established itself, over recent years, as one of the most reliable biomarkers of long-term alcohol consumption habits, with the Society of Hair Testing (SoHT) offering cut-off values for assessment of both abstinence and heavy drinking (>60 g/day). Despite its high diagnostic performance, however, issues concerning inter- and intra-laboratory variability as well as data interpretation are still being investigated and represent the ultimate barrier to widespread acceptance of hEtG in the forensic context. The aim of this review is to summarize currently available analytical methods of hEtG testing, provide a framework to understand current hEtG cut-offs and their possible upcoming changes (in particular, a lower abstinence cut-off has been proposed for the 2019 revision of the SoHT consensus), and offer a schematic but exhaustive overview of the pitfalls in result reproducibility and interpretation that may limit applications of hEtG testing in the forensic context. Ultimately, the purpose of the authors is not to undermine the reliability of hEtG as an alcohol use marker, but rather to enhance it by promoting familiarization with all aspects related to it, from ethanol pharmacokinetics and EtG incorporation into hair, to sample preparation and analytical methods, to specific cases warranting close attention and additional tests for correct interpretation of hEtG results.",ROS-responsive nanoparticles based on amphiphilic hyperbranched polyphosphoester for drug delivery: Light-triggered size-reducing and enhanced tumor penetration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096162,Biomaterials,2019 05 21,"Up to now, limited tumor penetration and poor therapeutic efficiency of drug-loaded nanoparticles are still the major challenges in nanomedicines for cancer chemotherapy. In photodynamic therapy, photosensitizers are often used to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species to kill cancer cells. Here, we report a kind of ROS-responsive nanoparticles with light-triggered size-reducing for enhanced tumor penetration and in vivo drug delivery to improve therapeutic efficiency. The nanoparticles were constructed by the self-assembly of an amphiphilic hyperbranched polyphosphoester containing thioketal units and photosensitizers, which is synthesized through the self-condensing ring-opening polymerization of a novel cyclic phosphate monomer and then end-capped with photosensitizer Chlorin e6. These nanoparticles have an initial averaged diameter of ∼210 nm, which can be used as drug carriers to load camptothecin with relatively stable in blood circulation. The CPT-loaded nanoparticles can be concentrated in tumor tissues through the long blood circulation and enhanced permeability and retention effect. Upon 660 nm laser irradiation on tumor tissues, the Ce6s in nanoparticles can effectively generate ROS to kill cancer cells meanwhile cleave the thioketal units to sequentially reduce the size of nanoparticles, which facilitate them more efficient tumor penetration with a programmable release of CPT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the above results. Such ROS-responsive nanoparticles with light-triggered size-reducing provided a feasible approach to improve drug tumor penetration and achieve satisfied therapeutic efficacy.",Patient-centered care factors and access to care: a path analysis using the Andersen behavior model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096161,Public health,2019 06 11,"Using the Andersen behavioral model, we examined the complex relationships among geographic access to care, financial disadvantage, patient-centered care factors, and access to care outcomes.",Frequent homozygous deletions of the CDKN2A locus in somatic cancer tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096160,Mutation research,2019 05 27,"Here we present and describe data on homozygous deletions (HD) of human CDKN2 A and neighboring regions on the p arm of Chromosome 9 from cancer genome sequences deposited on the online Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database. Although CDKN2 A HDs have been previously described in many cancers, this is a pan-cancer report of these aberrations with the aim to map the distribution of the breakpoints. We find that HDs of this locus have a median range of 1,255,650bps. When the deletion breakpoints were mapped on both the telomere and centromere proximal sides of CDKN2A, most of the telomere proximal breakpoints concentrate to a narrow region of the chromosome which includes the gene MTAP.. The centromere proximal breakpoints of the deletions are distributed over a wider chromosomal region. Furthermore, gene expression analysis shows that the deletions that include the CDKN2A region also include the MTAP region and this observation is tissue independent. We propose a model that may explain the origin of the telomere proximal CDKN2A breakpoints Finally, we find that HD distributions for at least three other loci, RB1, SMAD4 and PTEN are also not random.",Understanding mechanobiology in cultured endothelium: A review of the orbital shaker method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096159,Atherosclerosis,2019 05 27,"A striking feature of atherosclerosis is its highly non-uniform distribution within the arterial tree. This has been attributed to variation in the haemodynamic wall shear stress (WSS) experienced by endothelial cells, but the WSS characteristics that are important and the mechanisms by which they lead to disease remain subjects of intensive investigation despite decades of research. In vivo evidence suggests that multidirectional WSS is highly atherogenic. This possibility is increasingly being studied by culturing endothelial cells in wells that are swirled on an orbital shaker. The method is simple and cost effective, has high throughput and permits chronic exposure, but interpretation of the results can be difficult because the fluid mechanics are complex; hitherto, their description has largely been restricted to the engineering literature. Here we review the findings of such studies, which indicate that putatively atherogenic flow characteristics occur at the centre of the well whilst atheroprotective ones occur towards the edge, and we describe simple mathematical methods for choosing experimental variables that avoid resonance, wave breaking and uncovering of the cells. We additionally summarise a large number of studies showing that endothelium cultured at the centre of the well expresses more pro-inflammatory and fewer homeostatic genes, has higher permeability, proliferation, apoptosis and senescence, and shows more endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition than endothelium at the edge. This simple method, when correctly interpreted, has the potential to greatly increase our understanding of the homeostatic and pathogenic mechanobiology of endothelial cells and may help identify new therapeutic targets in vascular disease.",Allostery in G protein-coupled receptors investigated by molecular dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096158,Current opinion in structural biology,2019 06 15,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are allosteric signaling machines that trigger distinct functional responses depending on the particular conformational state they adopt upon binding. This so-called GPCR functional selectivity is prompted by ligands of different efficacy binding at orthosteric or allosteric sites on the receptor, as well as by interactions with intracellular protein partners or other receptor types. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide important mechanistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic insights into these interactions at a level of molecular detail that is necessary to rightly inform modern drug discovery.

We assessed mental capacity for treatment decisions in 215 psychiatry inpatients (176 voluntary and 39 involuntary) in four psychiatry admission units in Ireland using both legal criteria (Ireland's Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015) and clinical criteria (the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment; MacCAT-T). Over one third of participants (34.9%) lacked mental capacity for treatment decisions according to the legal criteria. Mental incapacity was associated with involuntary admission status, being unemployed, a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related disorder, and older age. Patients who lacked mental capacity according to the legislation scored significantly lower on all subscales of the MacCAT-T than patients who had mental capacity. We conclude that mental capacity assessments based on legal criteria correlate closely with those based on clinical criteria. These findings support current legal definitions of mental incapacity in Ireland and other jurisdictions with similar legislation (e.g. England and Wales).",MiR-4319 hinders YAP expression to restrain non-small cell lung cancer growth through regulation of LIN28-mediated RFX5 stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096145,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is demonstrated as one of the most common malignant tumors and accounts for about 25% of cancer-related deaths each year. Extensive bodies of studies have manifested that microRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in the development of numerous malignant tumors by involving in modulation of cell biological processes. Although miR-4319 has been validated to execute tumor suppressor properties in triple-negative breast cancer, explorations on the function and latent mechanism of miR-4319 participating in NSCLC are still unclear. In this study, we proved that miR-4319 acted as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC progression via restraining cell proliferation and migration as well as boosting apoptosis. Further, miR-4319 bound with LIN28 and negatively regulated the expression of LIN28. Our data unveiled that LIN28 promoted RFX5 mRNA stability and miR-4319 led to the destabilization of RFX5 by targeting LIN28. In addition, RFX5 motivated the transcription of YAP and enhanced expression of YAP abolished the miR-4319 upregulation-mediated suppressive regulation of NSCLC tumorigenesis. In conclusion, miR-4319 dampened YAP expression to mitigate the tumorigenesis of NSCLC through inhibiting LIN28-mediated RFX5 stability, which offered an insight into the molecular mechanism underlying miR-4319 in NSCLC development.",Interleukin-11 treatment protected against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096144,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Inflammation and immune responses are crucial factors associated with the onset and progression of stroke.

In this study, eleven stability metrics were derived from radiosonde soundings collected in eastern China for the time period of 2015-2018 and then applied as independent predictors to explore their potential in favoring the prediction of PM2.5. The statistical results show that the in situ PM2.5 concentration measurements correlated well with these stability metrics, especially at monthly and seasonal timescales. In contrast, correlations at the daily timescale differed markedly between stability metric and also varied with seasons. Nevertheless, the modeling results indicate that incorporating these stability metrics into the PM2.5 modeling framework rendered small contribution to PM2.5 prediction accuracy, yielding an increase of R2 by < 5% and a reduction of RMSE by < 1 μg/m3 on average. Compared with other stability indices, the inversion depth and intensity appeared to have relative larger benefiting potential.

Due to the excellent combination of its properties, it could be used for evaluating iontophoretic transdermal delivery of variety of drugs, regardless of pKa, pH or presence of auxiliary ions. Applicability of PVA Cryogel for drug delivery purposes was compared to those of polyacrylic acid/polyvinyl alcohol (PAA/PVA) and polyacrylic acid/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PAA/PVP) adhesive interpenetrating networks. Swelling properties of PVA Cryogel were shown to be almost independent on pH and NaCl concentration, while swelling of PAA-based gels was significantly affected. Addition of PVA and PVP to PAA decreased swelling degrees and increased adhesivity and compression moduli. Iontophoretic experiments were performed using a donor gel/skin/receptor gel configuration; current density and delivery duration were varied. Dexamethasone sodium phosphate was used as model drug molecule. PVA Cryogel was used for investigating the influence of NaCl concentration, which can alter the amount of current carried by the drug ions and, therefore, the delivery rate. By using PVA Cryogel it was possible to easily determine the amount of drug permeated through the skin into the receptor gel, the amount retained by the skin and the amount remained in the donor hydrogel. Decreasing NaCl concentration in PVA Cryogel resulted in higher total amounts of drug delivered and significantly enhanced drug permeation through the lower layers of the skin into the receptor hydrogel.",Shear rheological properties of acid hydrolyzed insoluble proteins from Chlorella protothecoides at the oil-water interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096137,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 27,"Microalgae are promising protein sources due to their overall high protein content. The low aqueous-solubility of microalgae proteins, however, limits their application in food, pharmaceutical or personal care systems, unless solubility is enhanced by e.g. hydrolysis. In this study, we examined the interfacial rheological properties at the oil-water interface of insoluble microalgae protein-rich fraction from Chlorella protothecoides and their hydrolysates prepared by hydrolysis in hydrochloric acid at 65 °C (Hydrolysates 65) and 85 °C (Hydrolysates 85). Results showed increased interfacial activity of the insoluble microalgae protein-rich fraction after hydrolysis: Hydrolysates 65 and Hydrolysates85 had higher interfacial storage Gi' and loss moduli Gi″ compared to the untreated insoluble microalgae protein-rich fraction. Increasing amounts of soluble protein fragments mixed with insoluble protein particles in hydrolysates stabilized interfacial layers. The influence of pH on the interfacial behavior of samples was also determined and revealed that Gi' and Gi″ values of treated and untreated protein fractions decreased as pH increased beyond their isoelectric points due to increasing electrostatic repulsions between adsorbed protein fragments and aggregates. The high viscoelasticity of the acid-hydrolyzed insoluble microalgae protein-rich fraction at the oil-water interface indicates a high potential for them to be useful in stabilizing emulsion-based products.",Measuring the permeability of thin solid layers of natural waxes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096136,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 27,"Previous experimental work has shown that microcapsule walls, made by solidification of a molten wax, are unexpectedly permeable.

However, little information is available about the bioconcentration and tissue distribution of FQs in fish. In the present study, we investigated the uptake and depuration of eight FQs (balofloxacin (BAL), enoxacin (ENO), enrofloxacin (ENR), fleroxacin (FLE), lomefloxacin (LOM), moxifloxacin (MOX), ofloxacin (OFL), sparfloxacin (SPA)) in common carp under controlled laboratory conditions. The results showed that all target FQs could accumulate in fish tissues, and had a similar tendency over time during the whole uptake and depuration periods. The uptake rate constant (k1), depuration rate constant (k2) and half-lives (t1/2) were in the ranges of 0.007-3.599 L/(kg·d), 0.051-0.283 d-1 and 2.4-10.7 d, respectively. The ranges of bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were 0.24-39.55 L/kg, 0.21-24.97 L/kg and 0.04-1.07 L/kg in liver, kidney and muscle, respectively. BCFs of eight FQs decreased in the order: MOX > ENR > ENO ≈ BAL ≈ FLE ≈ OFL ≈ LOM ≈ SPA, which may be correlated with the substituents at positions 7 and 8 of the basic quinolone nucleus and the metabolic capacity. Besides, BCFs were relative with pH-adjusted distribution coefficient (log D), suggesting that molecular status of ionizable compounds strongly influenced the bioconcentration processes. The present study provides important insights for understanding the bioconcentration and tissues distribution of FQs.","Interactions between noroviruses, the host, and the microbiota.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096124,Current opinion in virology,2019 06 11,"In recent years, appreciation has been growing for the role that the microbiota plays in interactions between the host and various pathogens, including norovirus. Proviral and antiviral effects of the microbiota have been observed for both human and murine noroviruses, and it has become clear that direct effects of microbes and their metabolites as well as indirect effects of commensals on the host are key in modulating pathogenesis. In particular, a common thread has emerged in the ability of members of the microbiota to regulate the host interferon response, thereby modulating norovirus infection.

Epidemiological studies report a varying percentage of incidences from 2 to 56% in men and <1-60% in women. Venous insufficiency is most often caused by the damage to the valves and walls of the veins. The mechanism of varicose vein formation is complex. It is, however, based on hypotensive blood vessels, hypoxia, and other mechanisms associated with inflammation. This work describes mechanisms related to the formation and development of the varicose vein. It discusses risk factors, pathogenesis of chronic venous disease, markers of the epithelial and leukocyte activation, state of hypoxia and inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and oxidative stress. Additionally, this paper describes substances of plant origin used in the treatment of venous insufficiency. It also considers the structure of the molecules, their properties, and their mechanisms of action, the structure-activity relationship and chemical properties of flavonoids and other substances. The flavonoids include quercetin derivatives, micronized purified flavonoid fraction (Daflon), natural pine bark extract (Pycnogenol), and others such as triterpene saponine, extracts from Ruscus aculeatus and Centella asiatica, Ginkgo biloba extract, coumarin dereivatives that are used in chronic venous insufficiency.

Initial screening revealed that most of the synthesized compounds displayed better inhibitory effect on glioma cell proliferation compared to parent ursolic acid. The mechanism of inhibitory effect of the most potent compound 6d on glioma cells was investigated in detail. Treatment with compound 6d significantly (p < 0.001) reduced U251 and C6 cell proliferation at 48 h. The growth of U251 and C6 glioma cells was reduced to minimum level (17 and 21%) on treatment with 10 μM concentration of compound 6d. Treatment of the U251 cells with 10 μM concentration of compound 6d caused a significant (p < 0.05) inhibition of cAMP level. In U251 cell cultures treatment with compound 6d at 10 μM concentration enhanced proportion of apoptotic cells to 69.32% compared to 2.34% in the control cultures. The compound 6d treatment of U251 cells for 48 h caused arrest of cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase with consequent decrease of cell population in G2/M and S phases. The results from TEM showed that compound 6d treatment of U251 cells for 48 h caused blebbing of the cell membranes, chromatin condensation, appearance of foamy cytoplasmic material and autophagic vacuoles. The results from SEM revealed that compound 6d treatment of U251 cells caused a marked inhibition of microvilli and extensions on the cell surfaces. Thus present study demonstrates that compound 6d inhibits glioma cell growth, induces apoptosis and arrest cell cycle through metabolic pathway down-regulation.

Moreover, the presence of earthworms could promote the nitrogen mineralization and nitrification process in vermicomposting. Earthworms increased the activity of ammonia monooxygenase and abundance of amoA-nitrifier and reduced its diversity, whereas they reduced the density of nirS-denitrifying bacteria but enhanced its diversity. Nitrosospira was the dominant amoA-nitrifier and earthworms stimulated its growth in the vermicomposting.

Upon fermentation of 100% solid loading pretreated hydrolysate, the H2 yield of 72.5 mL/g-pretreated RS was calculated based on substrate consumption, which enabled 49.5% higher reducing sugar transfer to H2 through material balance. FTIR and XRD analysis further demonstrated that the cold NaOH/Urea pretreatment at 100% (w/v) could effectively disrupt the lignin structure and decrease the cellulose crystallinity.

Herein, a qualitative proteomic method is presented for the identification of recombinant human insulin and all marketed biosynthetic analogues -insulin lispro, aspart, glulisine, glargine, detemir and degludec- via tryptic digestion and identification of proteotypic peptides for each insulin. Individual insulins were first denatured under reducing conditions and the cysteine residues blocked by iodoacetamide. The proteins were then digested with trypsin and the peptide products separated by reversed phase liquid chromatography on an Ascentis® Express ES-C18 column and detected by positive polarity ESI-MS/MS. The digestion peptides were characterized using a multiplexed MRM approach that monitors the fragmentation of the doubly charged unlabeled precursor ion of each peptide into a collection of signature y and b ions. The MRM transitions for the individual peptides were optimized to allow maximal ionization on a standard triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. All products of the digestion procedure for all insulins were detected with adequate signal intensity except for the C-terminal B30Thr whenever it was present and cleaved and the tryptic B1-3 tripeptide of insulin glulisine. The unique proteotypic peptides identified for each of the insulin analogues coupled with their signature y and b ions permitted the unambiguous verification of all sequence variations and chemical modifications. The elution of the A polypeptide chain for all insulins and the tryptic peptides of the B chain, with the exception of a very few, occurred around the same time point. This underscores the close similarity in the physicochemical properties between the digestion peptides and is consistent with the subtle variations in amino acid sequence among the various insulins. Therefore, the identification and distinction of the different types of insulin based solely on the chromatographic retention time of their respective proteolytic products can be deceptive without proper mass spectrometric analysis and may result in false positives."

The anti-NSE immobilized BP-TFG biosensor has been implemented to detect NSE biomarkers demonstrating ultrahigh sensitivity with limit of detection down to 1.0 pg/mL, which is 4 orders magnitude lower than NSE cut-off value of small cell lung cancer. The enhanced sensitivity of BP-TFG is 100-fold higher than graphene oxide or AuNPs based biosensors. We believe that BP-fiber optic configuration opens a new bio-nano-photonic platform for the applications in healthcare, biomedical, food safety and environmental monitoring.",Centrosomal Actin Assembly Is Required for Proper Mitotic Spindle Formation and Chromosome Congression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096079,iScience,2019 06 10,"Cytoskeletal cross talk between actin filaments and microtubules is a common mechanism governing the assembly of cellular structures, i.e., during filopodia formation or cilia organization. However, potential actin-microtubule interactions during mammalian cell divisions are less well understood. At mitotic entry, centrosomes propagate the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby aligning individual chromosomes to the metaphase plate, a process coined chromosome congression. Here, we identify actin filament assembly spatially defined at centrosomes contemporaneously with spindle microtubules forming during prometaphase. We show that pharmacological Arp2/3 complex inhibition as well as overexpression of the Arp2/3 complex inhibitory protein Arpin decreased spindle actin. As a consequence, mitotic spindle formation is impaired, which resulted in disorganized chromosome congression and ultimately mitotic defects in non-transformed cells. Thus centrosomal Arp2/3 complex activity plays a role in the maintenance of genomic integrity during mitosis.",The TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway activation in cochlear inflammation of rats with noise-induced hearing loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096078,Hearing research,2019 06 16,"The TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in innate immunity and inflammation induced by trauma. The present study aimed to investigate possible TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway activation in the cochlea associated with acoustic trauma that might induce cochlear inflammation. A total of 72 rats were exposed to white noise at 120 dB SPL for 8 h per day repeated over 2 successive days. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were measured in animals before noise exposure and 0 d (PE0), 1 d (PE1), 3 d (PE3), 7 d (PE7), and 14 d (PE14) after noise exposure. At each defined time point, animals were sacrificed, and cochleae were collected to evaluate the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88, cytoplasmic NF-κB p65, IκBα, TNF-α, and IL-1β using western blotting and NF-κB p65 transcriptional activity using an NF-κB p65 Transcription Factor Assay Kit. Cochlear localizations of TLR-4, TNF-α and IL-1β were analyzed using immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded slices. The nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 was evaluated using immunofluorescence staining in paraffin-embedded slices. DNA fragmentation was measured with a TUNEL assay in paraffin-embedded slices. We found a stable permanent threshold shift after noise exposure. After noise exposure, expression levels of TLR-4, MyD88, IκBα, TNF-α, and IL-1β were significantly upregulated (PE3); DNA binding activity of NF-κB p65 was also significantly enhanced (PE3), while the cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 levels were unchanged. TLR-4, TNF-α, and IL-1β immunostaining intensities were substantially enhanced in spiral ganglion cells and spiral ligament fibrocytes after noise exposure (PE3). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the TLR-4/NF-κB signaling pathway is activated in noise-exposed cochleae and that it participates in noise-induced cochlear inflammation.",Phenylpropanoid glycosides from the fruit of Lycium barbarum L. and their bioactivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096077,Phytochemistry,2019 06 13,"Fifteen phenylpropanoid glycosides, including six undescribed compounds were isolated from the fruit of Lycium barbarum L. (Solanaceae) (goji or wolfberry). Their structures were identified by detailed spectroscopic analyses. Seven known compounds were firstly isolated from the genus Lycium, in which the 1D and 2D NMR data of one compound were reported for the first time. Notably, two undescribed compounds were a pair of rare tautomeric glycoside anomers characterized by the presence of free anomeric hydroxy. Antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities of all these compounds were assessed using DPPH radical scavenging, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and α-glucosidase inhibitory assays, respectively. These compounds showed different levels of oxygen radical absorbance capacity, and some isolates exhibited potent antioxidant activity with greater ORAC values than the positive control (EGCG).",Electrophoretic deposition of photocatalytic materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096076,Advances in colloid and interface science,2019 06 13,"Powdered photocatalytic materials have been successfully applied for the degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants as well as for hydrogen production and CO2 photo-reduction. However, the development of strategies for the preparation of photoactive coatings is a hot topic since it is a promising step for its use in photocatalytic reactors on an industrial scale. Electrophoretic deposition is a versatile technique capable to produce coatings of nanoparticles at a relative low cost and with an excellent quality and control of the deposited material. This work summarizes the fundamental aspects of the electrophoretic deposition process, as well as the latest contributions in the deposition of several photocatalytic materials including TiO2 and other UV-photocatalysts like ZnO, ZnS, SrTiO3 and PbMoO4 in addition to visible-light-driven photocatalysts such as Bi2O3, CdS, CdSe, g-C3N4, among others. Furthermore, the morphological features of the coatings along with the repercussion in the photocatalytic performance are issues discussed in the present review, based on the effect of the multiple parameters of the electrophoretic process such as the applied voltage, the deposition time, the inter-electrode distance, the concentration of the particles, the solvents and additives.",The importance of being amorphous: calcium and magnesium phosphates in the human body.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096075,Advances in colloid and interface science,2019 06 11,"This article focuses on the relevance of amorphous calcium (and magnesium) phosphates in living organisms. Although crystalline calcium phosphate (CaP)-based materials are known to constitute the major inorganic constituents of human hard tissues, amorphous CaP-based structures, often in combination with magnesium, are frequently employed by Nature to build up components of our body and guarantee their proper functioning. After a brief description of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) formation mechanism and structure, this paper is focused on the stabilization strategies that can be used to enhance the lifetime of the poorly stable amorphous phase. The various locations of our body in which ACP (pure or in combination with Mg2+) can be found (i.e. bone, enamel, small intestine, calciprotein particles and casein micelles) are highlighted, showing how the amorphous nature of ACP is often of paramount importance for the achievement of a specific physiological function. The last section is devoted to ACP-based biomaterials, focusing on how these materials differ from their crystalline counterparts in terms of biological response.",Icephobic surfaces: Definition and figures of merit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096074,Advances in colloid and interface science,2019 06 13,"Icephobic surfaces have a critical footprint on human daily lives ranging from aviation systems and infrastructures to energy systems, but creation of these surfaces for low-temperature applications remains elusive. Non-wetting, liquid-infused and hydrated surfaces have inspired routes for development of icephobic surfaces. However, high freezing temperature, high ice adhesion strength and subsequent ice accretion, low mechanical durability, and high production cost have restricted their practical applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive definition for icephobicity through thermodynamics, heat transfer and mechanics of ice/water-material interface and elucidate physic-based routes through which nano-scale could help to achieve exceptional icephobic surfaces. Based on conservation laws, mathematical models are developed that accurately predict ice growth rate on various substrates and wind conditions. Through physics of fracture at ice-icephobic material interface, we cast a standard method for ice adhesion measurement that has the potential to eliminate discrepancies between reported ice adhesion from different laboratories. To assure long-time performance of icephobic surfaces, durability metrics need to be defined. We provide standard methods to examine mechanical, chemical, and environmental durability of icephobic surfaces. In the developed comprehensive framework on icephobicity in this review, performance of state-of-the-art icephobic surfaces are compared and main deficiencies in this field are highlighted.",Effects of milk fat globule membrane and its various components on neurologic development in a postnatal growth restriction rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096073,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is a component of breast milk that consists of glycosylated membrane-bound proteins, polar lipids and carbohydrates originating from the mammary gland plasma membrane.

Previously, we developed an inactivated vaccine viz., formalin-inactivated VHSV mixed with squalene as adjuvant which was effective in conferring protective immunity (58-76% relative percentage survival) against VHSV but the mode of administration was intraperitoneal injection which is not feasible for small sized fingerling fish. To overcome this limitation, we presently focused on replacing the injection route of vaccine delivery by oral and immersion routes. In this context, we encapsulated the inactivated VHSV vaccine with chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs-IV) by water-in-oil (W/O) emulsification method. After encapsulation, two sets of in vivo vaccination trials were conducted viz., preliminary trial-I and final trial-II. In preliminary trial-I, olive flounder fingerlings (10.5 ± 1.7 g) were vaccinated with CNPs-IV by different delivery strategies involving oral and immersion routes (single/booster dose) followed by challenge with VHSV (1 × 106 TCID50 virus/fish) to evaluate an effective method amongst different applied delivery strategies. Subsequently, a final trial-II was conducted to better understand the immune mechanism behind the efficacy of the employed delivery strategy and also to further improvise the delivery mechanism with prime-boost (primary immersion and oral boosting) combination in order to improve the transient anti-VHSV response in the host. Evaluation of RPS analysis in trial-I revealed higher RPS of 46.7% and 53.3% in the CNPs-IV (immersion) and CNPs-IV (immersion/immersion) groups, respectively compared to 0% RPS in the CNPs-IV (oral) group and 20% RPS in the CNPs-IV (oral/oral) group when calculated against 100% cumulative mortality percentage in the NVC (non-vaccinated challenged) control group, whereas, in the trial-II, RPS of 60% and 66.6% were obtained for CNPs-IV (immersion/immersion) and CNPs-IV (immersion/oral) groups, respectively. In addition, specific (anti-VHSV) antibody titre in the fish sera, skin mucus and intestinal mucus of the immunized groups were significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced following vaccination. Furthermore, CNPs-IV immunized fish showed significant (p < 0.05) upregulation of different immune gene transcripts (IgM, IgT, pIgR, MHC-I, MHC-II, IFN-γ, and Caspase3) compared to control, in both the systemic (kidney) and mucosal (skin and intestine) immune compartments of the host post immunization as well as post challenge. To conclude, mucosal immunization with CNPs-IV vaccine can orchestrate an effective immunization strategy in organizing a coordinative immune response against VHSV in olive flounder thereby exhibiting higher protective efficacy to the host with minimum stress.",Expression and functional characterization of a mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1) from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in host defense against bacterial infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096060,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 31,"Mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a multifunctional serine protease, plays an important role in innate immunity which is capable of activating the lectin pathway of the complement system and also triggering coagulation cascade system. In this study, a MASP-1 homolog (OnMASP-1) was identified from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and characterized at expression and inflammation functional levels. The open reading frame (ORF) of OnMASP-1 is 2187 bp of nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of 728 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence has 6 characteristic structures, including two C1r/C1s-Uegf-BMP domains (CUB), one epidermal growth factor domain (EGF), two complement control protein domains (CCP) and a catalytic serine protease domain (SP). Expression analysis revealed that the OnMASP-1 was highly expressed in the liver, and widely exhibited in other tissues containing intestine, spleen and kidney. In addition, the OnMASP-1 expression was significantly up-regulated in spleen and head kidney following challenges with Streptococcus agalactiae and Aeromonas hydrophila. The up-regulations of OnMASP-1 mRNA and protein expression were also demonstrated in hepatocytes and monocytes/macrophages in vitro stimulation with S. agalactiae and A. hydrophila. Recombinant OnMASP-1 protein was likely to participate in the regulation of inflammatory and migration reaction by monocytes/macrophages. These results indicated that OnMASP-1, playing an important role in innate immunity, was likely to involve in host defense against bacterial infection in Nile tilapia.",2-Transmembrane C-type lectin from oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense participates in antibacterial immune response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096059,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 31,"As a type of pattern-recognition proteins (PRRs), C-type lectins (CTLs) perform important functions in non-self recognition and clearance of pathogens in innate immunity. In this study, a unique 2-transmembrane CTL (designated as Mn-2TM-cLec) with a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) was isolated from Macrobrachium nipponense. The full-length cDNA of Mn-2TM-cLec consisted of 3265 bp with an 837 bp open reading frame encoding a protein with 278 amino acids. Mn-2TM-cLec was ubiquitously distributed in various tissues of normal prawn, particularly in the hemocytes, hepatopancreas, and gills. The expression of Mn-2TM-cLec was significantly up-regulated in the gills and hepatopancreas after the prawns were challenged with Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. RNA interference knock-down of Mn-2TM-cLec gene decreased the transcription levels of three antimicrobial peptides (anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) 1, ALF2, and Crustin (Crus) 1) after V. parahaemolyticus infection. The recombinant CRD of Mn-2TM-cLec could bind lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycans, and diverse bacterial strains and agglutinate S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In addition, the rCRD enhanced the clearance of V. parahaemolyticus injected in prawns. In summary, Mn-2TM-cLec might act as a PRR to participate in the prawn immune defense against pathogens through its antimicrobial activity.",Combining white matter diffusion and geometry for tract-specific alignment and variability analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096057,NeuroImage,2019 05 16,"We present a framework for along-tract analysis of white matter (WM) fiber bundles based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and tractography. We introduce the novel concept of fiber-flux density for modeling fiber tracts' geometry, and combine it with diffusion-based measures to define vector descriptors called Fiber-Flux Diffusion Density (FFDD). The proposed model captures informative features of WM tracts at both the microscopic (diffusion-related) and macroscopic (geometry-related) scales, thus enabling improved sensitivity to subtle structural abnormalities that are not reflected by either diffusion or geometrical properties alone. A key step in this framework is the construction of an FFDD dissimilarity measure for sub-voxel alignment of fiber bundles, based on the fast marching method (FMM). The obtained aligned WM tracts enable meaningful inter-subject comparisons and group-wise statistical analysis. Moreover, we show that the FMM alignment can be generalized in a straight forward manner to a single-shot co-alignment of multiple fiber bundles. The proposed alignment technique is shown to outperform a well-established, commonly used DTI registration algorithm. We demonstrate the FFDD framework on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) diffusion MRI dataset, as well as on two different datasets of contact sports players. We test our method using longitudinal scans of a basketball player diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury, showing compatibility with structural MRI findings. We further perform a group study comparing mid- and post-season scans of 13 active football players exposed to repetitive head trauma, to 17 non-player control (NPC) subjects. Results reveal statistically significant FFDD differences (p-values<0.05) between the groups, as well as increased abnormalities over time at spatially-consistent locations within several major fiber tracts of football players.",Bone penetration of Daptomycin in diabetic patients with bacterial foot infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096056,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 05 16,"Daptomycin has shown clinical efficacy in diabetic foot infections (DFI).

Eosinophil granule-derived cationic proteins are known to be involved in the mucosal damage and development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness during allergic airway inflammation. In view of these background information, we have carried out a series of studies to investigate the effect of cationic proteins on these C-fiber afferents and the mechanism(s) possibly involved; a summary of these studies is presented in this mini-review. Intra-tracheal instillation of either eosinophil granule-derived (e.g., major basic protein, MBP) or synthetic cationic proteins (e.g., poly-l-lysine) induced a sporadic, but intense and lingering discharge of pulmonary C-fibers, and greatly enhanced the chemical and mechanical sensitivities of these afferents in anesthetized rats. The stimulatory and sensitizing effects of these proteins were completely nullified when their cationic charges were neutralized or removed. Furthermore, in isolated rat bronchopulmonary capsaicin-sensitive neurons, eosinophil granule cationic proteins induced a direct and long-lasting (>60 min) but reversible sensitizing effect on their responses to chemical and electrical stimulations. More importantly, our study showed that these cationic proteins exerted an inhibitory effect on the sustained delayed-rectifier voltage-gated K+ current and the A-type, fast-inactivating K+ current; these actions were at least in part responsible for the sensitizing effect in these neurons. In awake mice, intra-tracheal instillation of MBP also induced a slowly developing (peaking in 2-3 days), progressive and sustained (lasting for 3-7 days) elevation of the cough responses to inhaled irritant gases. Taken together, these findings suggest that the enhanced sensitivity of bronchopulmonary C-fibers induced by the eosinophil granule cationic proteins may be a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic infiltration of the airways.",Report of Spontaneous Internal Carotid Dissection in a Patient with Turner Syndrome with a Systematic Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096034,World neurosurgery,2019 05 16,Spontaneous isolated carotid artery (CA) or vertebral artery (VA) dissection in the absence of coarctation has rarely been reported in the literature.

Surprisingly, after the Second World War, the psychiatrist Friedrich Panse who had been a member of the Nazi party initiated Guttmann's academic rehabilitation up to his nomination as emeritus professor of Cologne University in 1964. The present article recounts the difficult academic restitution and poses the question why Guttmann sought to re-establish connections to Germany, a country that had expelled him so harshly some decades before.",Accredited Endovascular Surgical Neuroradiology Programs: Current Specialty Composition and Academic Impact Using the h Index.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096030,World neurosurgery,2019 06 10,"Concerns exist that neurosurgery might fail to lead the field of endovascular surgical neuroradiology (ESN), as other specialties are allowed to train and practice ESN.

It is nevertheless necessary to modify bacterial nanocellulose to achieve materials with desired properties and thus with broader areas of application. The aim here was to influence the 3D structure of BNC by genetic modification of the cellulose producing K. hansenii strain ATCC 53582. Two genes encoding proteins with homology to the MotA and MotB proteins, which participate in motility and energy transfer, were selected for our studies. A disruption mutant of one or both genes and their respective complementation mutants were created. The phenotype analysis of the disruption mutants showed a reduction in motility, which resulted in higher compaction of nanocellulose fibers and improvement in their mechanical properties. The data strongly suggest that these genes play an important role in the formation of BNC membrane by Komagataeibacter species.",Mechanical insufflation/exsufflation improves respiratory mechanics in critical care: Randomized crossover trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096012,Respiratory physiology & neurobiology,2019 06 12,"This study evaluated the ventilatory and haemodynamic effects of the mechanical insufflator-exsufflator (MI-E) in critically ill patients. Sixteen mechanically ventilated patients performed three protocols: MI-E (-30/+30 cmH2O) plus endotracheal suctioning; 50S: MI-E (-50/+50 cmH2O) plus endotracheal suctioning; and isolated endotracheal suctioning (IES). The protocols were applied randomly in all subjects, with 3 -h intervals in between. Peak airway pressure (Ppeak), plateau pressure (Pplat), airway resistance (Raw), static compliance (Cst), heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and amount of removed secretions were evaluated before (PRE), immediately after (POST) and 10 min after (10' POST) each protocol. The 50S protocol reduced Ppeak and Raw and increased Cst immediately after its application. Moreover, this protocol provided the largest amount of removed secretions and held SBP, DBP and SpO2 at basal values. The MI-E at high pressures promotes benefits to respiratory mechanics, is more effective in removing pulmonary secretions and it does not lead to hemodynamic repercussions.",Redox TRPs in diabetes and diabetic complications: Mechanisms and pharmacological modulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096011,Pharmacological research,2019 06 16,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have shown to be involved in a wide variety of physiological functions and pathophysiological conditions. Modulation of TRP channels reported to play a major role in number of disorders starting from central nervous system related disorders to cardiovascular, inflammatory, cancer, gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. Recently, a subset of TRP ion channels called redox TRPs gained importance on account of their ability to sense the cellular redox environment and respond accordingly to such redox stimuli. Diabetes, the silent epidemic of the world is increasing at an alarming rate in spite of novel therapeutic interventions. Moreover, diabetes and its associated complications are reported to arise due to a change in oxidative status of cell induced by hyperglycemia. Such a change in cellular oxidative status can modulate the activities of various redox TRP channels (TRPA1, TRPC5, TRPMs and TRPV1). Targeting redox TRPs have potential in diabetes and diabetic complications like neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, retinopathy, cystopathy, and encephalopathy. Thus in this review, we have discussed the activities of different redox sensing TRPs in diabetes and diabetic complications and how they can be modulated pharmacologically, so as to consider them a potential novel therapeutic target in treating diabetes and its comorbidity.",GDF-11 prevents cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by maintaining the sarcoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria communication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096010,Pharmacological research,2019 06 16,"Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) is a novel factor with controversial effects on cardiac hypertrophy both in vivo and in vitro. Although recent evidence has corroborated that GDF11 prevents the development of cardiac hypertrophy, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. In our previous work, we showed that norepinephrine (NE), a physiological pro-hypertrophic agent, increases cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels accompanied by a loss of physical and functional communication between sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria, with a subsequent reduction in the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and mitochondrial metabolism. In order to study the anti-hypertrophic mechanism of GDF11, our aim was to investigate whether GDF11 prevents the loss of SR-mitochondria communication triggered by NE. Our results show that: a) GDF11 prevents hypertrophy in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes treated with NE. b) GDF11 attenuates the NE-induced loss of contact sites between both organelles. c) GDF11 increases oxidative mitochondrial metabolism by stimulating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. In conclusion, the GDF11-dependent maintenance of physical and functional communication between SR and mitochondria is critical to allow Ca2+ transfer between both organelles and energy metabolism in the cardiomyocyte and to avoid the activation of Ca2+-dependent pro-hypertrophic signaling pathways.",Treatment of bone and joint infections caused by Enterobacter cloacae with a fluoroquinolone-cotrimoxazole combination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096009,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 05 16,"Although the frequency of bone and joint infection caused by Enterobacter spp is increasing, studies regarding the optimal antibiotic therapy are scarce.

Between 2010 and 2017, 30 patients with bone and joint infection caused by E. cloacae were treated with a fluoroquinolone-cotrimoxazole combination for 8 to 12 weeks. The type of infection was infection of an internal fixation device in 26 cases (87%), pseudarthrosis with chronic osteomyelitis in 2 cases (6.6%), and infection of knee and ankle prosthetic devices in 2 cases (6.6%). The cure rate of the fluoroquinolone-cotrimoxazole combination was 80% by intention-to-treat with a mean follow-up of 29.3± 19.1 months. The fluoroquinolone-cotrimoxazole combination for 8 to 12 weeks is effective for the treatment of bone and joint infection caused by E. cloacae.","Nitric oxide and abscisic acid protects against PEG-induced drought stress differentially in Brassica genotypes by combining the role of stress modulators, markers and antioxidants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096008,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,2019 06 16,"The present study was designed to see the effect of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) and abscisic acid (ABA) and their interaction on physiological and biochemical activities in leaves and roots of two Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) cultivars [cv. Pusa Jagannath (PJN) and Varuna (VAR)] exposed to polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced drought stress. Seven days old hydroponically grown seedlings were treated with PEG (10%), sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor [NO (100 μM)] and abscisic acid [ABA (10 μM)], using different combinations as: Control, ABA, NO, PEG, PEG + ABA, PEG + NO, and PEG + NO + ABA. Results revealed that in response to PEG-induced drought stress leaf relative water content, chlorophyll, carotenoid and protein content decreased with increased production of O2-●, MDA, H2O2, cysteine content and non-enzymatic antioxidants (including proline, flavonoid, phenolic, anthocyanin, and ascorbic acid), whereas, the enzymatic antioxidants (including SOD, CAT, APX, GR) showed the response range from no effect to increase or decrease in certain enzymes in both Brassica cultivars. The application of NO or/and ABA in PEG-stressed cultivars showed that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants responded differently to attenuate oxidative stress in leaves and roots of both cultivars. Overall, PJN had the antioxidant protection mainly through the accumulation of non-enzymatic antioxidants, whereas VAR showed tolerance by the enhancement of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities. Altogether, the study concluded that the independent NO and its interaction with ABA (PEG + NO and PEG + NO + ABA) were much effective than independent ABA (PEG + ABA) in lowering PEG-drought stress in Brassica cultivars.",Asparaginyl endopeptidase induces endothelial permeability and tumor metastasis via downregulating zonula occludens protein ZO-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096007,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 24,"Zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) is a key component of tight junctions that govern the function of the endothelial barrier against tumor metastasis. Factors secreted by tumor cells contribute to the maintenance of tumor vascular networks. How tumor cell-derived protein signals regulate ZO-1 expression is unclear. Here, we explored the effect of tumor cell-secreted asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) on the permeability of endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment. First, we confirmed the existence of AEP in conditioned medium (CM) from AEP-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells. Treatment with CM from AEP-overexpressing tumor cells increased the permeability and tumor cell transversal of an endothelial monolayer. Furthermore, CM from AEP-overexpressing tumor cells suppressed endothelial ZO-1 expression, as well as ZO-1-associated nucleic acid binding protein ZONAB. In addition, the level of phosphorylated STAT3 was increased by treatment with AEP-containing CM. A mutation of RGD or blocking integrin αvβ3 with antibody recovered the ZO-1 downregulation induced by AEP. In vivo, a lung metastatic mouse model showed increased endothelial permeability in the AEP-overexpressing group compared with the control group. An orthotopic tumor transplantation model was established using AEP-overexpression and compared with mice receiving control 4T1 cells. Compared with controls, overexpression of AEP increased lung metastatic foci and area, as well as vascular instability in primary tumors or lung metastatic sites. Moreover, endothelial ZO-1 was decreased in the AEP-overexpressing group. Taken together, our data show that tumor cell-derived AEP increases the permeability of endothelial barriers. Interactions between RGD and endothelial integrin αvβ3 mediate this effect by downregulating ZO-1.",Patient-reported symptoms during and after direct acting antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis C: The PROP UP Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31096006,Journal of hepatology,2019 05 16,A comprehensive analysis of changes in symptoms and functioning during and after direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) has not been conducted for patients treated in real-world clinical settings.

Therefore, the management of epileptic disorders should not only be restricted to the achievement of seizure-freedom but must also be able to counteract its related comorbidities. Experimental animal models of epilepsy represent a valid tool not only to study epilepsy but also its associated comorbidities. The WAG/Rij rat is a well-established genetically-based model of absence epilepsy with depressive-like comorbidity, in which learning and memory impairment was also recently reported. Aim of this study was to clarify whether this cognitive decline is secondary or not to absence seizures and/or depressive-like behavior. The behavioral performance of untreated and ethosuximide-treated (300 mg/kg/day; 17 days) WAG/Rij rats at 6 and 12 months of age were assessed in several tests: forced swimming test, objects recognition test, social recognition test, Morris water maze and passive avoidance. According to our results, it seems that cognitive impairment in this strain, similarly to depressive-like behavior, is secondary to the occurrence of absence seizures, which might be necessary for the expression of cognitive impairment. Furthermore, our results suggest an age-dependent impairment of cognitive performance in WAG/Rij rats, which could be linked to the age-dependent increase of spike wave discharges. Consistently, it is possible that absence seizures, depressive-like behavior and cognitive deficit may arise independently and separately in lifetime from the same underlying network disease, as previously suggested for the behavioral features associated with other epileptic syndromes.","Chronic caffeine exposure in adolescence promotes diurnal, biphasic mood-cycling and enhanced motivation for reward in adult mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095992,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 09,"Adolescent's consumption of caffeine and caffeinated beverage is increasing, yet little is known about the consequences of chronic caffeine exposure during the critical development period of adolescence. In the present study, we investigated the effect of beginning chronic caffeine consumption in adolescence on locomotor, mood, sensorimotor gating, and reward seeking behaviors through adolescence and in adulthood. During the light cycle, caffeine exposed mice exhibited hypoactivity in a novel open-field box and increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, while maintaining normal home cage locomotor activity. In contrast, during the dark cycle caffeine exposed mice displayed normal locomotor activity in a novel open-field box with hyperactive home cage activity. Interestingly, we found that caffeine exposed mice also showed enhanced prepulse inhibition during the light cycle whereas they displayed a deficit of prepulse inhibition during the dark cycle. Reward seeking for sucrose was higher in caffeine exposed than control mice during the light cycle. Additionally, when granted 24 -h access to ethanol as adults, caffeine exposed mice consumed more ethanol in the absence of acute caffeine use. Altogether, mice that consumed chronic caffeine beginning in adolescence had increased reward seeking and exhibited a circadian-dependent pattern of mood fluctuations in adulthood.","Voluntary alcohol access during adolescence/early adulthood, but not during adulthood, causes faster omission contingency learning.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095991,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 10,"In omission contingency training, rodents learn to suppress their natural tendency to approach or touch a reward-predictive cue (termed ""autoshaping"" or ""sign-tracking"" responses) if the approach/touching responses lead to the omission of the reward. Previous research has shown that high levels of alcohol exposure (through alcohol vapor exposure) or adolescent alcohol consumption (with some versions of the omission contingency task) can lead to faster omission contingency learning. However, the alcohol exposure procedures and/or omission contingency task parameters differed between these different demonstrations. It was unclear whether the same voluntary alcohol consumption procedures during adolescence/early adulthood and/or adulthood would lead to faster omission contingency learning in one or both age groups. Here, rats received 6 weeks of chronic intermittent access to 20% alcohol or water from PND 26-66 (adolescence/early adulthood in Exp. 1) or PND 68-108 (adulthood in Exp. 2) and began behavioral training (autoshaping training followed by omission contingency training) several days later. We found no evidence that alcohol access at either age altered the number of trials with a sign-tracking response on the levers during autoshaping training. However, alcohol access during adolescence/early adulthood, but not during adulthood, led to faster learning to withhold responding on the lever under omission contingencies during the subsequent phase. We also found no evidence that the level of alcohol consumption was correlated with sign-tracking behavior in the autoshaping phase or with the suppression of lever-pressing during the omission contingency phase. Our results suggest that adolescent/early adult rats have increased vulnerability, compared with adults, to some long-term behavioral effects of voluntary alcohol consumption.",Hunger and satiety determine foraging decissions in land snails: Evidence from the invasive species Theba pisana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095990,Behavioural processes,2019 06 10,"The foraging behaviour of gastropod molluscs usually involves complex decisions that provide a model for the study of high-order cognitive processes. Land snails tested for food-finding in the laboratory, however, have shown an invariable feeding pattern: novel foods are mostly missed (i.e. just found by chance) whilst familiar foods, due to a type of conditioned attraction, are always located and ingested. This effect, known as Food-attraction conditioning, has led to the conclusion that, regardless of their hunger level, land snails are both willing to eat anything at any moment and also blind to the odours of novel foods. An alternative account of these findings emerges from the fact that the snails are usually tested whilst in a moderate state of hunger, so that they benefit from feeding on known foods but not from taking the risk of feeding on those that are unknown. The present experiments suggest that it is the case. Snails of the invasive species Theba pisana were tested for food-finding according to their seasonal cycle in a laboratory located in their native Mediterranean region. Subjects collected at the beginning of their aestivation period succeed in locating novel food items after being deprived for a long period (45 days), but ignored a conditioned food when they were sated with this food at the end of their lethargy. The results allow us to conclude that the feeding behaviour of snails is the product of a complex cost-benefit analysis in which their motivational state and the stimuli they perceive (and the memory of such stimuli), are evaluated. Finally, we anticipate that these results will be of use in increasing the efficiency of current baits employed for the protection of crops.",Antiviral efficiency of a coumarin derivative on spring viremia of carp virus in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095989,Virus research,2019 06 09,"Spring viraemia of carp (SVC) in aquaculture is challenging because there are few preventative measures and/or treatments. The previous study demonstrated that an antiviral coumarin derivative, 7-(4-(4-methyl-imidazole))-coumarin (C2), inhibits spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) infection by targeting Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway in fish cells. Thus, we hypothesized whether C2 may be used as a potential therapeutic agent for controlling SVCV infection in aquaculture. In this study, SVCV infectivity was significantly inhibited in vitro in a dose-dependent manner by preincubation with C2. C2 was verified against SVCV in zebrafish, in which the mortality and viral titer in fish body were decreased. Like other coumarins, C2 was stable with a prolonged inhibitory half-life (3.5 days) at 15 °C in the early stage of SVCV infection. The results show that horizontal transmission of SVCV was reduced by C2 in a static cohabitation challenge model, especially for recipient fish in injection treatment, which suggested that C2 may be suitable as a possible therapeutic agent for SVCV in aquaculture. Overall, this study provides the new insight that a small molecule antiviral drug can be used to control rhabdovirus infection in fish aquacultures.","The footprints of mitochondrial impairment and cellular energy crisis in the pathogenesis of xenobiotics-induced nephrotoxicity, serum electrolytes imbalance, and Fanconi's syndrome: A comprehensive review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095988,Toxicology,2019 06 08,"Fanconi's Syndrome (FS) is a disorder characterized by impaired renal proximal tubule function. FS is associated with a vast defect in the renal reabsorption of several chemicals. Inherited and/or acquired conditions seem to be connected with FS. Several xenobiotics including many pharmaceuticals are capable of inducing FS and nephrotoxicity. Although the pathological state of FS is well described, the exact underlying etiology and cellular mechanism(s) of xenobiotics-induced nephrotoxicity, serum electrolytes imbalance, and FS are not elucidated. Constant and high dependence of the renal reabsorption process to energy (ATP) makes mitochondrial dysfunction as a pivotal mechanism which could be involved in the pathogenesis of FS. The current review focuses on the footprints of mitochondrial impairment in the etiology of xenobiotics-induced FS. Moreover, the importance of mitochondria protecting agents and their preventive/therapeutic capability against FS is highlighted. The information collected in this review may provide significant clues to new therapeutic interventions aimed at minimizing xenobiotics-induced renal injury, serum electrolytes imbalance, and FS.",Development of a rapid viability polymerase chain reaction method for detection of Yersinia pestis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095987,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 06 11,"Due to the occurrence of natural plague outbreaks and its historical usage as a biological weapon, Yersinia pestis is considered one of the high-priority biological threat agents. It can remain viable in certain environments including water for >100 days. Because of its slow-growth characteristic, it usually takes three or more days to detect and confirm the identity of viable Y. pestis cells by PCR, serological, or biochemical assays when using the traditional microbiological plate-culture-based analysis, and that too, assuming faster growing microbes present in a water sample do not mask the Y. pestis colonies and interfere with analysis. Therefore, a rapid-viability Polymerase Chain Reaction (RV-PCR) method was developed for detection of Y. pestis. The RV-PCR method combines 24 h-incubation broth culture in a 48-well plate, and pre- and post-incubation differential PCR analyses, thereby allowing for rapid and high-throughput sample analysis compared with the current plate culture method. One chromosomal and two plasmid gene target-based real-time PCR assays were down-selected, showing ca. 10 genome equivalent detection; the chromosomal assay was then used for RV-PCR method development. A 101-cell level (10-99 cells) sensitivity of detection was demonstrated even with complex sample backgrounds including known PCR inhibitors (ferrous sulfate and humic acid), as well as metal oxides and microbes present in Arizona Test Dust (ATD). The method sensitivity was maintained in the presence of dead Y. pestis cells up to 104 cells per sample. While affording high-throughput and rapid sample analysis, the 48-well plate format used in this method for sample enrichment significantly reduced labor requirements and generation of BioSafety Level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory waste as compared to the usual microbiological plate-culture-based methods. This method may serve as a model for other vegetative bacterial pathogens.",Circulating mesenchymal stem cells in sulfur mustard-exposed patients with long-term pulmonary complications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095986,Toxicology letters,2019 06 09,"Sulfur mustard (SM) is a toxic agent that causes acute and long-term pulmonary complications. Recent evidence has shown the impact of SM on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These cells have a critical role in repairing the damaged tissues. In this study, we evaluated the mobilization of MSCs in SM-exposed patients with long-term pulmonary complications. Fifty-nine SM-injured patients with prolonged pulmonary complications and 20 healthy individuals were included. Patients were classified based on taking drugs, having comorbidities, and severity of respiratory consequence. MSCs with phenotype of CD45-CD44+CD29+CD105+ were evaluated in peripheral blood using flow cytometry. Circulating MSCs were lower in SM-exposed patients compared to the control group (0.93 vs. 2.72 respectively, P = 0.005). No significant difference was observed in the MSC count between patients taking corticosteroids or antibiotics and those patients not taking them. Comorbidities like liver and kidney diseases had changed the count of MSCs in SM-exposed subjects. In addition, the frequency of MSCs did not show any association with the severity of long-term pulmonary complications. In conclusion, SM-exposure causes a decline in the frequency of circulating MSCs in survivors. The lower number of the peripheral MSC population in SM-exposed patients was not affected by taking corticosteroids or antibiotics, but comorbidities are probably involved in MSC frequency. The decreases observed in the number of circulating MSCs was not associated with the severity of the pulmonary complications; however, further studies in mustard lung models are required to demonstrate the therapeutic or pathologic role of MSCs in SM injuries.",Molecular Alterations and Effects of Acute Dehydroepiandrosterone Treatment Following Brief Bilateral Common Carotid Artery Occlusion: Relevance to Transient Ischemic Attack.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095985,Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Transient ischemic attack (TIA) represents brief neurological dysfunction of vascular origin without detectable infarction. Despite major clinical relevance characterization of post-TIA molecular changes using appropriate experimental model is lacking and no therapeutic agent has been established yet. Neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) arose as one of the candidates for cerebral ischemia treatment but its effects on TIA-like condition remain unknown. Seeking an animal model applicable for investigation of molecular alterations in mild ischemic conditions such as TIA, 15-min bilateral common carotid artery occlusion with 24-h reperfusion was performed to induce ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury in adult male Wistar rats. Additionally, effects of 4-h post-operative DHEA treatment (20 mg/kg) were investigated in physiological and I/R conditions in hippocampus (HIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The study revealed absence of sensorimotor deficits, cerebral infarcts and neurodegeneration along with preserved HIP and PFC overall neuronal morphology and unaltered malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione level following I/R and/or DHEA treatment. I/R induced nitric oxide burst in HIP and PFC was accompanied with increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase protein level exclusively in HIP. DHEA had no effects in physiological conditions, while increase of Bax/Bcl2 ratio and dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential in treated I/R group suggested DHEA-mediated exacerbation of post-ischemic changes that might lead to pro-apoptotic events in HIP. Interestingly, DHEA restored I/R-induced NO to the control level in PFC. Obtained results indicated that I/R may serve as an appropriate model for investigation of molecular changes and treatment outcome following mild ischemic conditions such as TIA."

Recent studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) aimed at increasing the excitability of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can reduce appetite, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, and response variability is large. The aim of this study was to determine whether individual differences in Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism can influence tDCS effects on appetite. Thirty-eight adult women with obesity, classified as carriers or non-carriers of the Met allele, underwent a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled tDCS intervention involving three phases: Phase I, target engagement (immediate effects of tDCS on working memory performance), Phase II, tDCS only (10 sessions, two weeks), and Phase III, tDCS + hypocaloric diet: (6 sessions, two weeks, 30% energy intake reduction, inpatient). Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models and mixed ANCOVA. Appetite was evaluated using visual analogue scales. We found that Met-carriers receiving active tDCS were the only participants who experienced a significant reduction of appetite over time. Conversely, Met non-carriers maintained high levels of appetite during the intervention; this effect was driven by a delayed paradoxical rise in appetite after stimulation. Working memory task performance at phase I correlated with subsequent appetite change in a COMT-dependent manner: speed improvements during the task predicted appetite increase in Met carriers and appetite reduction in Met non-carriers. Our findings suggest that genotype differences impacting dopamine levels influence prefrontal tDCS effects on appetite. This source of variability should be considered in the design of future studies.",Determining the Optimal Dose of Infliximab for Treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095972,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,2019 05 16,Little data exist guiding infliximab dosing in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).,Lack of association between serum IL-9 levels and Behçet's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095970,Immunology letters,2019 06 14,"Considering the role of interleukin (IL)-9 and IL-9-producing Th9 cells in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, this study aimed to evaluate serum IL-9 levels in patients with Behçet's disease (BD) compared to healthy subjects and to assess whether there is an association between serum IL-9 levels and disease characteristics in BD.",Plasma matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs and aging and lifelong exercise adaptations in ventricular and arterial stiffness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095969,Experimental gerontology,2019 06 13,"The age-associated increase in cardiac and central arterial stiffness is attenuated with lifelong (>25 years) endurance exercise in a dose-dependent manner. Remodelling of the extracellular matrix of cardiovascular structures may underpin these lifelong exercise adaptations in structural stiffness. The primary aim was to examine whether matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) levels are associated with aging and lifelong exercise-related changes in cardiac and central arterial stiffness. Plasma MMPs and TIMPs, left ventricular (LV) (LV stiffness constant) and central arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity) were examined in healthy adults stratified into five groups based on age and lifelong weekly exercise frequency: (1) young sedentary adults (28-50 years), and older adults (>60 years) who had performed either: (a) sedentary (0-1 sessions/week), (b) casual (2-3 sessions/week), (c) committed (4-5 sessions/week) or (d) athletic (≥6 sessions/week) frequency of exercise. MMP-1 was significantly lower in young compared to older sedentary (p = 0.049). Except for TIMP-2 (p = 0.018 versus committed) and the ratio of MMP-2/TIMP-4 (p = 0.047 versus committed), MMP and TIMP expression was not significantly different in lifelong exercise groups (≥casual) compared to the older sedentary group.

For efficient production of cyanophycin, considerable efforts have been exerted to characterize cyanophycin synthetases (CphAs) and optimize fermentations and downstream processes. In this paper, we review the characteristics of diverse CphAs from cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacteria. Furthermore, strategies for cyanophycin production in microbial strains, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, Ralstonia eutropha, Rhizopus oryzae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heterologously expressing different cphA genes are reviewed. Additionally, chemical and material properties of cyanophycin and its derivatives produced through biological or chemical modifications are reviewed in the context of their industrial applications.

Significant suppression of the overexpressed acetylcholinesterase and lipid peroxidation, marked reduction of nitrite, oxidative stress and TNF-α levels and noticeable improvement in cognitive and locomotor functions were observed after treatment with the newly synthesized steroids 2-4a-d in the LPS-treated animal models. Higher neuroprotective effects were produced by some of the pyrazolinyl steroids in comparison to the reference drugs celecoxib and dexamethasone. N'-(4-fluorobenzenesulfonyl) derivative 4c showed the most promising effects on all the analyzed parameters and is the most potent molecule among all compounds of this series. Acute toxicity studies on the most active steroids 2-4c at 50 mg/kg did not reveal any toxic effects on animals, however hepatitis and chronic nephritis were observed in histological examination of liver and kidney of mice after 28 days of treatment.

The recently developed accommodating volume-constant age-dependent optical (AVOCADO) model can accurately describe the separate GRIN distributions in the axial and radial directions. Our study uses a finite element method to simulate the accommodation process and calculate the GRIN redistribution based on the AVOCADO model for 25-, 35- and 45-year-old lenses. The parameter p describes the steepness of the GRIN profile towards the lens periphery. The results show that axial p values increase with age. Under accommodation, the axial p value increases, while the radial p value decreases. We also use a ray tracing method to evaluate the optical performance of the lens. The aim of this paper is thus to provide an anatomically finite mechanical lens model with separate axial and radial refractive index profiles for a better understanding of accommodation at different ages.",Time dependent dual effect of anti-inflammatory treatments on sarin-induced brain inflammation: Suggested role of prostaglandins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095963,Neurotoxicology,2019 06 15,"A common consequence of exposure to organophosphate nerve agents is the centrally mediated seizure activity that appears even after conventional treatment with atropine and oximes. We have previously demonstrated a major inflammatory response with subsequent brain damage which was correlated with the duration of the sarin-induced seizures (Chapman et al., 2006). In the present work seizures were induced by the nerve agent sarin (1.2 LD50) insufficiently treated 1 min later by atropine and trimedoxime bromide (TA), with additional midazolam treatment either 5 or 30 min after continuous seizure activity. The efficacy of both steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as other drugs that were reported as beneficial in neuroprotection, were evaluated for their contribution as adjunct treatment against sarin induced seizures and the ensuing inflammatory brain damage. Results show that both steroids and NSAIDs were harmful when administered during convulsions, and steroids were at best ineffective if administered at their termination. However, if administered at termination of convulsions, the NSAID ibuprofen, the selective COX 2 inhibitor nimesulide and the PLA2 inhibitor quinacrine were partially effective in reducing brain inflammatory markers. Administration of exogenous analogs of prostaglandins (PGE2) immediately following sarin-induced convulsions was found to have a beneficial effect in reducing brain inflammatory markers measured at 24 h and one week post sarin exposure. These findings support the hypothesis that elevated levels of PGE2 have a beneficial role immediately following sarin induced seizures, and that early inhibition of PGE2 production by both steroids and NSAID is contraindicative.",The effects of proteasome on baseline and methamphetamine-dependent dopamine transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095962,Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2019 06 09,"The Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is a major multi-catalytic machinery, which guarantees cellular proteolysis and turnover. Beyond cytosolic and nuclear cell compartments, the UPS operates at the synapse to modulate neurotransmission and plasticity. In fact, dysregulations of the UPS are linked with early synaptic alterations occurring in a variety of dopamine (DA)-related brain disorders. This is the case of psychiatric conditions such as methamphetamine (METH) addiction. While being an extremely powerful DA releaser, METH impairs UPS activity, which is largely due to DA itself. In turn, pre- and post- synaptic neurons of the DA circuitry show a high vulnerability to UPS inhibition. Thus, alterations of DA transmission and UPS activity are intermingled within a chain of events underlying behavioral alterations produced by METH. These findings, which allow escaping the view of a mere implication of the UPS in protein toxicity-related mechanisms, indicate a more physiological role for the UPS in modulating DA-related behavior. This is seminal for those plasticity mechanisms which underlie overlapping psychiatric disorders such as METH addiction and schizophrenia."

Biomembranes,2019 06 11,"In the search for new antimicrobial molecules, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a viable alternative to conventional antibiotics, as they physically disrupt the bacterial membranes, leading to membrane disruption and eventually cell death. In particular, the group of linear α-helical cationic peptides has attracted increasing research and clinical interest. The AMP P5 has been previously designed as a cationic linear α-helical sequence, being its antimicrobial and hemolytic properties also evaluated. In this work, we analyzed the feasibility of using P5 against a carbapenem-resistant clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most common and risky pathogens in clinical practice. After antimicrobial activity confirmation in in vitro studies, synergistic activity of P5 with meropenem was evaluated, showing that P5 displayed significant synergistic activity in a time kill curve assay. The ability of P5 to permeabilize the outer membrane of P. aeruginosa can explain the obtained results. Finally, the antibiofilm activity was investigated by viability analysis (MTT assay), crystal violet and confocal imaging, with P5 displaying mild biofilm inhibition in the range of concentrations tested. Regarding biofilm disruption activity, P5 showed a higher efficacy, interfering with biofilm structure and promoting bacterial cell death. Atomic force microscope images further demonstrated the peptide potential in P. aeruginosa biofilm eradication, confirming the promising application of P5 in multi-resistant infections therapeutics.",Loss of carotenoids from membranes of Pantoea sp. YR343 results in altered lipid composition and changes in membrane biophysical properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095944,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Biomembranes,2019 06 11,"Bacterial membranes are complex mixtures of lipids and proteins, the combination of which confers biophysical properties that allows cells to respond to environmental conditions. Carotenoids are sterol analogs that are important for regulating membrane dynamics. The membrane of Pantoea sp. YR343 is characterized by the presence of the carotenoid zeaxanthin, and a carotenoid-deficient mutant, ΔcrtB, displays defects in root colonization, reduced secretion of indole-3-acetic acid, and defects in biofilm formation. Here we demonstrate that the loss of carotenoids results in changes to the membrane lipid composition in Pantoea sp. YR343, including increased amounts of unsaturated fatty acids in the ΔcrtB mutant membranes. These mutant cells displayed less fluid membranes in comparison to wild type cells as measured by fluorescence anisotropy of whole cells. Studies with artificial systems, however, have shown that carotenoids impart membrane rigidifying properties. Thus, we examined membrane fluidity using spheroplasts and vesicles composed of lipids extracted from either wild type or mutant cells. Interestingly, with the removal of the cell wall and membrane proteins, ΔcrtB vesicles were more fluid than vesicles made from lipids extracted from wild type cells. In addition, carotenoids appeared to stabilize membrane fluidity during rapidly changing temperatures. Taken together, these results suggest that Pantoea sp. YR343 compensates for the loss of carotenoids by changing lipid composition, which together with membrane proteins, results in reduced membrane fluidity. These changes may influence the abundance or function of membrane proteins that are responsible for the physiological changes observed in the ΔcrtB mutant cells.","Individual stress responses to Sarcoptes scabiei infestation in Iberian ibex, Capra pyrenaica.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095943,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 06 15,"In this study we have monitored the stress of Iberian ibex at individual level within the course of an experimental infection with Sarcoptes scabiei mites.

We used linear mixed models to explore the effects of host sex and age, clinic (mange status) and time (number of days post-infection) on the concentration of faecal 11-k. The most parsimonious model included clinic, time and host age, which explained 76.6% of the variance of the response variable. Moreover, the concentration of faecal 11-k varied greatly between individuals.

This entrapment was responsible for a basilar artery dissection, which led to an ischemic stroke in the pons. The patient was managed with medical treatment, mainly to avoid a progression towards an ischemic stroke. It consisted of heparin therapy followed by antiplatelet therapy which finally resulted in a successful outcome. In BA entrapment most of the patients who had a favorable outcome received antithrombotic therapy.

The purpose of this study was to test if Zip2, an important zinc importer, plays a role in I/R injury in mouse hearts and explore the mechanism by which Zip2 expression is regulated. Zip2 expression was increased at reperfusion in in vivo mouse hearts, an effect that was abolished by ZnCl2, indicating Zip2's attempt to compensate for zinc loss at reperfusion. Further studies showed that upregulation of Zip2 expression was reversed by either pharmacological or genetic inhibition of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), whereas STAT3 overexpression increased Zip2 expression, indicating that STAT3 accounts for Zip2 upregulation. In support, reperfusion enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705), which was blocked by ZnCl2, implying that STAT3 is activated in response to zinc loss. To determine the role of Zip2 in I/R injury, we assessed I/R injury by genetically disrupting Zip2 expression. Knockout of Zip2 genes (Zip2+/- and Zip2-/-) exacerbated I/R injury by increasing infarct size as well as the serum LDH, troponin I (cTnI), and CK-MB activities. In contrast, delivery of Zip2 genes reduced I/R injury. Delivery of STAT3 genes increased STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced I/R injury. However, delivery of the dominant negative STAT3 mutant did not reduce I/R injury. Moreover, delivery of STAT3 genes failed to reduce I/R injury in Zip2-/- mice. Zip2 upregulated upon reperfusion via STAT3 is cardioprotective and this upregulation may serve as an important intrinsic protective mechanism by which the heart is resistant to I/R injury. The factors involved in the zinc homeostasis (zinc and Zip2) are responsible STAT3 activation and its subsequent cardioprotective action."

The cause of sporadic cases is usually difficult to ascertain. Viruses that might be related to breast cancer are human papillomaviruses and herpes viruses. Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has also been a suspect. MMTV is a milk-transmitted beta retrovirus, a form of single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that inserts a copy of its genome into the DNA of a host cell, thus altering the cell's genome. MMTV DNA sequences have been found in 36% of human breast tumor samples and 24% of non-cancerous breast tissue. The sequences were 98% similar to the MMTV envelope (env) gene. But a search for MMTV sequences within the human genome found no env sequences, although there were sequences from the MMTV GAGdUTPase and POL genes. Therefore, env sequences from breast tumors and normal breast tissue identified in other studies may have come from an MMTV infection. Humans apparently acquire MMTV infection from one species of mice, Mus domesticus. MMTV transmission from mice to humans may explain the relationship of breast cancer to high socioeconomic status. Many infectious diseases are associated with low income and poverty. The association is usually detrimental, but not always. During the 20th century, improved sanitation delayed exposure to the poliovirus and onset of infection in middle and upper class children. These children contracted paralytic polio, while children from low-income families living in poor neighborhoods and substandard housing, infected in infancy, were spared. Humoral immunity passively transferred from the mother protected them from paralytic polio, and they remained immune for life. A similar relationship may exist with MMTV. High income and affluence are linked to increasedbreastcancer incidence. Girls of high socioeconomic status living in affluent, clean homes would have delayed exposure to Mus domesticus and MMTV.

This study was performed to detect the activation of autophagy in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells treated with Aβ, aiming to investigate the potential protective mechanism of RPE cells against Aβ stress. Human ARPE-19 cells were treated with soluble Aβ1-42 oligomer. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess the formation of autophagic compartments; immunofluorescence was used to detect the subcellular localization of LC3; and western blot was used to detect the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the expression of p62. Activated autophagy in Aβ-treated ARPE-19 cells was detected by three methodologies: 1) generation of autophagic compartments by transmission electron microscopy, 2) altered expression pattern of LC3 by immunofluorescence, and 3) elevated light-chain-3 II (LC3-II) and decreased p62 expression by western blot. These results suggest that Aβ could induce autophagy in RPE cells, which provided a potential protective mechanism for the retina cells that encountered Aβ deposition.",Predictive ability of DWI/ADC and DCE-MRI kinetic parameters in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions and in building a prediction model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095923,Discovery medicine,2019 05 16,"To analyze DWI/ADC and DCE-MRI kinetic parameters on breast MRI between benign and malignant lesions, to obtain independent predictors of malignancy, and to build a possible future predictive model.",Overweight and Obesity Among School Bus Drivers in Rural Arkansas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095920,Preventing chronic disease,2019 05 16,"Obesity is a major public health concern.

Frequency of soda consumption (times per week) declined from 2011 through 2014 by 16.5% but returned to 2011 levels in 2015 and 2016; trends did not differ by education or income. The proportion of the population that consumed soda did not change among adults with less than a high school diploma or equivalent, but declined significantly among those with at least a high school diploma.

To facilitate the system wide identification of miRNA targets a variety of system wide methods, such as proteomics, have been implemented. Here we describe the utilization of quantitative label-free proteomics and bioinformatics to identify the most significant changes to the proteome upon expression of the miR-23a-27a-24-2 miRNA cluster. In light of recent work leading to the hypothesis that only the most pronounced regulatory events by miRNAs may be physiologically relevant, our data reveals that label-free analysis circumvents the limitations of proteomic labeling techniques that limit the maximum differences that can be quantified. The result of our analysis identifies a series of novel candidate targets that are reduced in abundance by more than an order of magnitude upon the expression of the miR-23a-27a-24-2 cluster."

Although progress has been made in understanding cannabinoid binding and receptor activation, detailed knowledge of the dynamics involved in the activation mechanism of CB1 is lacking. Here, we use recently determined CB1 crystal structures to analyze its transition from inactive to active state by performing unbiased microsecond-length molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, totaling 32 μs, with and without bound potent cannabinoid agonist CP-55940. CB1 activation is characterized by an upward axial movement of transmembrane (TM) helix 3, inward movement of TM7, and outward movement of TM6. These conformational changes collectively allow Gi protein docking, although fully active states of the receptor occur only transiently during MD simulations. Additionally, positive allosteric modulation of CB1 by anionic phospholipids is found to increase action of the bound agonist.

Here, we show that OrthoRep is fully compatible with all Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains tested, demonstrate that the orthogonal plasmid can encode genetic material of at least 22 kb, and report a CRISPR/Cas9-based method for expedient genetic manipulations of OrthoRep. It was previously reported that the replication system upon which OrthoRep is based is only stable in respiration-deficient S. cerevisiae strains that have lost their mitochondrial genome (ρ0 strains). However, here we trace this biological incompatibility to the activity of the dispensable toxin/antitoxin system encoded on the wild-type orthogonal plasmid. Since the toxin/antitoxin system is replaced by genes of interest in any OrthoRep application, OrthoRep is a generally compatible platform for continuous in vivo evolution in S. cerevisiae.",Evaluation of in vitro effects of selected physical and chemical agents on detected in Poland Acanthamoeba strains – factors of increasing threats for public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095904,Annals of parasitology,2019 06 06,"Acanthamoeba keratitis, the vision-threatening corneal disease reported with increasing frequency in Poland is difficult to treat due to extremely high resistance of the amoeba cysts to chemicals.

These strains were in vitro examined in terms of their sensitivity/resistance to selected chemicals and tolerance to temperature changes. Samples of the strains cultivated in vitro under bacteria-free conditions were monitored during different growth phases. Higher amoebic population dynamics was observed in both pathogenic Acanthamoeba strains during transfer to 37°C. Agents tested influenced population dynamics in different degree; they showed amoebostatic or amoebicidal effects, however a tendency toward induction of encystment also appeared.

The resulting increased energy intake thereby causes weight gain. According to food balance sheets published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, while the absolute protein content of the US food supply has increased since the early 1970s, the fraction of available calories from protein has decreased by ~1% because of greater increases in available carbohydrate and fat. Counterintuitively, even such a small decrease in the protein fraction of the food supply has the potential to result in relatively large increases in energy intake according to the protein leverage model. Therefore, while the protein leverage effect is unlikely to fully explain the obesity epidemic, its potential contribution should not be ignored.",Evaluation of neuroanatomy web-resources for undergraduate education: Educators' and students' perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095897,Anatomical sciences education,2019 05 16,"Despite, the development of novel teaching strategies and the abundance of adjunct teaching web-resources, students and early career physicians have continuously reported difficulties in learning and clinically applying neuroanatomy. Differences in instructional design of these resources, the lack of assessment of their capacity to meet intended educational goals and a poor understanding of the user's perspective may have hindered their success in increasing understanding and retention of neuroanatomical knowledge. To decipher the limitations of existing web-resources, an online search for neuroanatomy web-resources was performed and distilled through a strict filtration rubric. A selection of resources were analyzed by a panel of educators and rated using Likert-scales, focusing on the identification of features influencing their usefulness in learning the anatomy of the spinal pathways. The top three ranked web-resources were subsequently evaluated by a panel of medical and neuroscience students to assess how specific features aided in their learning of the subject. This detailed analysis has identified features of neuroanatomy web-resources that are valued by both educators and users with regards to instructional design. One resource was rated highest by end-users and educators on a series of Likert-scale questions in terms of clarity of explanation, step-wise teaching design, summarization of information, control of instructional-pace, integration with neurophysiology, neuroradiology and clinical correlates, deployment of a wide array of pedagogical tools and factors for visualizing neuroanatomical inter-relationships. These results have provided a novel user perspective on the influence of specific elements of neuroanatomy web-resources to improve instructional design and enhance learner performance.

Despite their increasing applications, lasers also tend to pose occupational hazards to operators, ancillary personnel, individuals undergoing laser therapies. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of different doses of 532 nm continuous wave laser on rat skin. The present study demonstrated that higher fluences of 532 nm CW laser induces significant tissue damage through induction of TNF α, COX-2, p53, PARP 1, caspase3 which in turn leads to tissue damage and cell death. Furthermore, level of heat shock proteins, pAkt were found up-regulated as a cope up response to laser-induced stress. On the basis of the findings, irradiation with 532 nm CW laser up to 2.5 J/cm2 was found within the safe exposure limits. Thus, it is probably the first attempt to demonstrate the tissue damage induced by 532 nm CW laser on skin, which may help in choosing safe laser dose for certain skin-based applications and evolving methods to ameliorate laser-inflicted injuries.

Within populations, individuals vary, however the mechanisms underlying this variation in performance are largely unknown. Thus, it remains to be determined what genetic factors cause an individual to have high learning ability and what factors determine how well an individual will remember what they have learned. To genetically dissect learning and memory performance, we used the Drosophila synthetic population resource (DSPR), a multiparent mapping resource in the model system Drosophila melanogaster, consisting of a large set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that naturally vary in these and other traits. Fruit flies can be trained in a ""heat box"" to learn to remain on one side of a chamber (place learning) and can remember this (place memory) over short timescales. Using this paradigm, we measured place learning and memory for ~49 000 individual flies from over 700 DSPR RILs. We identified 16 different loci across the genome that significantly affect place learning and/or memory performance, with 5 of these loci affecting both traits. To identify transcriptomic differences associated with performance, we performed RNA-Seq on pooled samples of seven high performing and seven low performing RILs for both learning and memory and identified hundreds of genes with differences in expression in the two sets. Integrating our transcriptomic results with the mapping results allowed us to identify nine promising candidate genes, advancing our understanding of the genetic basis underlying natural variation in learning and memory performance.",Optical surface guidance for submillimeter monitoring of patient position during frameless stereotactic radiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095866,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2019 06 12,To evaluate the accuracy of monitoring intrafraction motion during stereotactic radiotherapy with the optical surface monitoring system.

In the present study, we determined the cDNA sequences of small heat shock protein 10 (sHSP10) and sHSP17.1 from C. ehrenbergii, and examined the physiological changes and transcriptional responses of the genes after exposure to thermal shock and toxicants treatments. The open reading frame (ORF) of CeHSP10 was 300 bp long, encoding 99 amino acid (aa) residues (10.53 kDa) with a GroES chaperonin conserved site of 22 aa. The CeHSP17.1 had a 468 bp ORF, encoding 155 aa with a conserved C-terminal α-crystallin domain. For heat stress, cells presented pigment loss and possible chloroplast damage, with an up-regulation in the expression of both sHSP10 and sHSP17.1 genes. As for the heavy metal stressors, an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species was registered in a dose dependent manner, with a significant up-regulation of both sHSP10 and sHSP17.1 genes. These results suggest that sHSP genes in C. ehrenbergii may play a role in responses to stress environments, and they could be used as an early detection parameter as biomarker genes in molecular toxicity assessments.",An Isolable Silicon Analogue of a Ketone that Contains an Unperturbed Si=O Double Bond.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095845,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 16,"Despite tremendous efforts to synthesize isolable compounds with an Si=O bond, silicon analogues of ketones that contain an unperturbed Si=O bond have remained elusive for more than 150 years. Herein, we report the synthesis of an isolable silicon analogue of a ketone that exhibits a three-coordinate silicon center and an unperturbed Si=O bond, thus representing the first example of a genuine silanone. Most importantly, this silanone does not require coordination of Lewis bases and acids and/or the introduction of electron-donating groups to stabilize the Si=O bond. The structure and properties of this unperturbed Si=O bond were examined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations.

Homolysis also occurs in solution by photochemical excitation. Transfer of the photogenerated CF3. radicals to both aryl and alkyl carbon atoms was also confirmed. The observed behaviour was rationalized by considering the electronic structure of the involved species, which all show ligand-field inversion. Moreover, the homolytic pathway constitutes experimental evidence for the marked covalent character of the M-C bond. The relative stability of these M-C bonds was evaluated by energy-resolved mass spectrometry (ERMS) and follows the order Cu<Ag≪Au.

The low-flux light irradiation concentrates aniline on the catalyst, accelerating the catalytic cross-coupling by several orders even at a very low overall aniline concentration (1.0×10-3 mol/L). A tentative mechanism is that Au2Co NPs absorb light, generating an intense fringing electromagnetic field and hot electrons. The sharp field-gradient (plasmonic optical force) can selectively enhance adsorption of light-polarizable aniline molecules on the catalyst. The light irradiation thereby alters the aniline/alkyne ratio at the NPs surface, switching product selectivity.

This cocrystal system was characterized by absorption spectroscopy, variable-temperature steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, single crystal X-ray diffraction as well as first-principles calculations. Those data reveal that intermolecular CT in cocrystal narrows the single-triplet energy gap and therefore facilitates the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) for TADF. These finding open up a new way for future design and development of novel TADF materials."

Here we report on a successful attempt to overcome this limitation, fabricating highly active and non-deactivating Ru/TiO2 catalysts by morphology-engineering of the TiO2 support. Using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with mainly {001}, {100} or {101} facets exposed, we show that after an initial activation period Ru/TiO2-{100} and Ru/TiO2-{101} are very stable, while Ru/TiO2-{001} deactivates continuously. Employing different operando / in situ spectroscopies and ex situ characterizations, we show that differences in the catalytic stability are related to differences in the metal-support interactions (MSIs). The stronger MSIs on the defect-rich TiO2-{100} and TiO2-{101} supports not only stabilize flat Ru nanoparticles, while on TiO2-{001} hemispherical particles develop, but also lead to electronic modifications of Ru surface atoms, reflected by a stronger bonding of adsorbed CO on those catalysts than on Ru/TiO2-{001}. Consequences for the performance of these catalysts are discussed.","Invited review: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, agriculture, and food-A case of shifting cultivation and history.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095820,Global change biology,2019 06 13,"Since 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced five Assessment Reports (ARs), in which agriculture as the production of food for humans via crops and livestock have featured in one form or another. A constructed database of the ca. 2,100 cited experiments and simulations in the five ARs was analyzed with respect to impacts on yields via crop type, region, and whether adaptation was included. Quantitative data on impacts and adaptation in livestock farming have been extremely scarce in the ARs. The main conclusions from impact and adaptation are that crop yields will decline, but that responses have large statistical variation. Mitigation assessments in the ARs have used both bottom-up and top-down methods but need better to link emissions and their mitigation with food production and security. Relevant policy options have become broader in later ARs and included more of the social and nonproduction aspects of food security. Our overall conclusion is that agriculture and food security, which are two of the most central, critical, and imminent issues in climate change, have been dealt with an unfocussed and inconsistent manner between the IPCC five ARs. This is partly a result of not only agriculture spanning two IPCC working groups but also the very strong focus on projections from computer crop simulation modeling. For the future, we suggest a need to examine interactions between themes such as crop resource use efficiencies and to include all production and nonproduction aspects of food security in future roles for integrated assessment models.",Zika virus: Molecular responses and tissue tropism in the mammalian host.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095819,Reviews in medical virology,2019 05 16,"Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have raised alarm because of reports of congenital Zika virus syndrome in infants. The virus is also known to cause the debilitating Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. As a result, extensive research has been carried out on the virus over the past few years. To study the molecular responses of viral infectivity in mammals, in vitro two-dimensional and three-dimensional cellular models have been employed. The in vivo models of mouse, pig, chicken, and nonhuman primates are primarily used to investigate the teratogenicity of the virus, to study effects of the virus on specific tissues, and to study the systemic effects of a proposed antiviral agent. The virus exhibits wide tissue tropism in the mammalian host. The major host tissues of viral persistence and propagation are neural tissue, ocular tissue, testicular tissue and placental tissue. An understanding of the function of viral components, viral replication cycle, and the molecular responses elicited in the host tissues is imperative for designing antiviral treatment strategies and for development of vaccines. This review provides an update on ZIKV research models and mammalian host responses with respect to ZIKV tissue infection.","Dislocations that Decrease Size Mismatch within the Lattice Leading to Ultrawide Band Gap, Large Second-Order Susceptibility, and High Nonlinear Optical Performance of AgGaS2.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095818,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 06 07,"The essence of rational design syntheses of functional inorganic materials lies in understanding and control of crystal structures that determine the physical properties. AgGaS2 has the highest figure of merit for IR nonlinear optical interactions to date, but suffers low laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT). The partial Li substitution of Ag atoms is now shown to push up the bottom of the conduction band and flatten the top of the valence band, leading to an ultrawide band gap of 3.40 eV (record high for AgGaS2 , indicating a transparency edging nearly 180 nm shorter than that of AgGaS2 ), which gives Li0.60 Ag0.40 GaS2 a LIDT 8.6 times stronger when AgGaS2 is compared. Li0.60 Ag0.40 GaS2 exhibits 1.1 times stronger nonlinear susceptibility, which is because the energy-favorable Li substitution gradually decreases the sulfur dislocation in the lattice, which allows a better geometric superposition of nonlinear optical tensors.",Alpha satellite DNA-repeat OwlAlp1 forms centromeres in Azara's owl monkey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095817,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,2019 06 07,"Centromeres play crucial roles in faithful chromosome segregation and genome integrity. In simian primates, centromeres possess tandem array of alpha satellite DNA (also referred to as alphoid DNA). Average sizes of alpha satellite repeat units vary between species, for example, 171 bp in human and 343-344 bp in many platyrrhini species (New World monkeys). Interestingly, Azara's owl monkey (Aotus azarae), a platyrrhini species, possesses alpha satellite DNA of two distinct unit sizes, OwlAlp1 (185 bp) and OwlAlp2 (344 bp), both of which present as megasatellite DNAs in the genome. It is, however, unknown which repeat sequence is responsible for functional centromere formation. To investigate the localization of centromeres in vivo, we carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay using Azara's owl monkey cells. We found that CENP-A, a histone H3 variant essential for centromere formation, was enriched at OwlAlp1, but not at OwlAlp2. Moreover, CENP-A was detected only at constricted regions of chromosomes by immunofluorescent microscopy. In contrast, trimethylation of histone H3-K9 (H3K9me3), a marker of heterochromatin, was enriched at both OwlAlp1 and OwlAlp2. Our results show that the shorter alpha satellite repeat, OwlAlp1, is selectively used for centromere formation in this monkey.",Accumulation of soil carbon under elevated CO2 unaffected by warming and drought.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095816,Global change biology,2019 05 16,"Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2 ) and climate change may substantially alter soil carbon (C) dynamics and thus feedback to future climate. However, only very few field experiments world-wide have combined eCO2 with both warming and changes in precipitation in order to study the potential combined effects of changes in these fundamental drivers of C cycling in ecosystems. We exposed a temperate heath/grassland to eCO2 , warming, and drought, in all combinations for 8 years. At the end of the study, soil C stocks were on average 0.927 kg C m-2 higher across all treatment combinations with eCO2 compared to ambient CO2 treatments (equal to an increase of 0.120 ± 0.043 kg C m-2 y-1 ), and showed no sign of slowed accumulation over time. However, if observed pre-treatment differences in soil C are taken into account, the annual rate of increase caused by eCO2 may be as high as 0.177 ± 0.070 kg C m-2 y-1 . Further, the response to eCO2 was not affected by simultaneous exposure to warming and drought. The robust increase in soil C under eCO2 observed here, even when combined with other climate change factors, suggests that there is continued and strong potential for enhanced soil carbon sequestration in some ecosystems to mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations under future climate conditions. The feedback between land C and climate remains one of the largest sources of uncertainty in future climate projections, yet experimental data under simulated future climate, and especially including combined changes, are still scarce. Globally coordinated and distributed experiments with long-term measurements of changes in soil C in response to the three major climate change-related global changes, eCO2 , warming, and changes in precipitation patterns, are therefore urgently needed.

The Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) neuron is an established model system to explore molecular mechanisms of dendrite morphogenesis. The total number of dendritic branch terminals is one of the frequently employed parameters to characterize dendritic arborization complexity of class IV neurons. This parameter gives a useful phenotypic readout of arborization during neurogenesis, and it is typically determined by laborious manual analyses of numerous images. Ideally, an automated analysis would greatly reduce the workload; however, it is challenging to automatically discriminate dendritic branch terminals from signals of surrounding tissues in whole-mount live larvae. Here, we describe our newly developed software, called DeTerm, which automatically recognizes and quantifies dendrite branch terminals via an artificial neural network. Once we input an image file of a neuronal dendritic arbor and its region of interest information, DeTerm is capable of labeling terminals of larval class IV neurons with high precision, and it also provides positional data of individual terminals. We further show that DeTerm is applicable to other types of neurons, including mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells.

We also explored whether these influences were shared with attentional control, a putative mechanism for symptom comorbidity. We found evidence for common genetic and nonshared environmental influences on the covariation among attentional control, ADHD, and anxiety symptoms, supporting the putative role of attentional control as a mechanism by which comorbid problems may develop. Genetic factors also accounted for symptom co-occurrence after controlling for covariation with attentional control, suggesting the presence of additional unmeasured mechanisms.",Hepatitis E during pregnancy: Maternal and foetal case-fatality rates and adverse outcomes-A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095813,Journal of viral hepatitis,2019 06 14,"Hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy can have severe consequences for mother and child, such as vertical transmission, fulminant hepatic failure, even foetal or maternal mortality. The aim of this systematic review is to describe maternal, foetal and neonatal case-fatality rates as well as the prevalence of adverse outcomes in relation to hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy. A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane and CINAHL. Search terms included Pregnant, Women, Maternal, Infant, Foetal, Neonatal and Hepatitis E virus. Data were extracted using predefined data collection forms. All studies were quality assessed, either by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or by an adapted assessment scale for cross-sectional studies. We found 23 eligible studies, all observational, which were included in this systematic review with a total of 1338 cases. The median maternal, foetal and neonatal case-fatality rates were 26% (IQR 17%-41%), 33% (IQR 19%-37%) and 8% (IQR 3%-20%), respectively. Adverse outcomes such as fulminant hepatic failure, preterm labour, postpartum haemorrhage, low birth weight and vertical transmission were reported. The two studies that reported the highest prevalence of fulminant hepatic failure also reported the highest case-fatality rates. The median prevalence of fulminant hepatic failure was 45.3%. This systematic review found a high case-fatality rate among pregnant women infected with hepatitis E virus and a high rate of adverse outcomes among these women and their children.

While C. albicans is predominatly diploid, it can tolerate aneuploidy as a survival strategy under stress. Aurora kinase B homolog Ipl1 is a critical ploidy regulator that controls microtubule dynamics and chromosome segregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we show that Ipl1 in C. albicans has a longer activation loop than that of the well-studied ascomycete S. cerevisiae. Ipl1 localizes to the kinetochores during the G1/S phase and associates with the spindle during mitosis. Ipl1 regulates cell morphogenesis and is required for cell viability. Ipl1 monitors microtubule dynamics which is mediated by separation of spindle pole bodies. While Ipl1 is dispensable for maintaining structural integrity and clustering of kinetochores in C. albicans, it is required for the maintenance of bilobed distribution of clustered kinetochores along the mitotic spindle. Depletion of Ipl1 results in erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments leading to aneuploidy due to which the organism can survive better in the presence of fluconazole. Taking together, we suggest that Ipl1 spatiotemporally ensures bilobed kinetochore distribution to facilitate bipolar spindle assembly crucial for ploidy maintenance in C. albicans."

Phase precession is a form of temporal coding evidencing this mechanism and is degraded following systemic pharmacological disruption of cholinergic signaling. However, whether neural assemblies are commensurately degraded, as would be predicted from a clocking mechanism hypothesis, remains unknown. To address this, we recorded the spiking activity of hippocampal place cells as rats completed laps on a circle track for chocolate drink before versus during the influence of a systemic muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. We compared the integrity of hippocampal ensembles using three approaches. The first approach used cross-correlogram (CCG) analyses to ask if the relative spike-timing between pairs of cells became less reliable. The second used a general linear model based analysis to ask whether the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons became any less predictive of the spiking activity of single neurons. Finally, the third approach used a reconstruction analysis to ask if the population activity was any less informative regarding the environmental position of the animal and whether theta sequences were impaired. The results of all three analyses paint a consistent picture: systemic cholinergic disruption did not degrade assembly integrity. These data demonstrate that place cell assemblies do not depend upon high quality phase precession.",An Autotransferable g-C3 N4 Li+ -Modulating Layer toward Stable Lithium Anodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095799,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 16,"Commercial deployment of lithium anodes has been severely impeded by the poor battery safety, unsatisfying cycling lifespan, and efficiency. Recently, building artificial interfacial layers over a lithium anode was regarded as an effective strategy to stabilize the electrode. However, the fabrications reported so far have mostly been conducted directly upon lithium foil, often requiring stringent reaction conditions with indispensable inert environment protection and highly specialized reagents due to the high reactivity of metallic lithium. Besides, the uneven lithium-ion flux across the lithium surface should be more powerfully tailored via mighty interfacial layer materials. Herein, g-C3 N4 is employed as a Li+ -modulating material and a brand-new autotransferable strategy to fabricate this interfacial layer for Li anodes without any inert atmosphere protection and limitation of chemical regents is developed. The g-C3 N4 film is filtrated on the separator in air using a common alcohol solution and then perfectly autotransferred to the lithium surface by electrolyte wetting during normal cell assembly. The abundant nitrogen species within g-C3 N4 nanosheets can form transient LiN bonds to powerfully stabilize the lithium-ion flux and thus enable a CE over 99% for 900 cycles and smooth deposition at high current densities and capacities, surpassing most previous works.",Forest disturbance and vector transmitted diseases in the lowland tropical rainforest of central Panama.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095798,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,2019 05 28,"To explore possible changes in the community attributes of haematophagous insects as a function of forest disturbance.

Their photophysics relies on the microenvironment, with regard to transition energies as well as quenching of triplet states. Here we firmly establish the splitting of the Q and Soret bands into x and y polarized bands for the isolated molecules in vacuo, and resolve vibronic features. Storage-ring experiments reveal that dissociation of photoexcited charge-tagged complexes occurs over several milliseconds, but with two different time constants. A fast decay is ascribed to dissociation after internal conversion and a slow decay to the population of a triplet state that acts as a bottleneck. Support for the latter is provided by pump-probe experiments, where a second laser pulse probes the long-lived triplet state.",Methanol content in homemade alcohol from a province in North Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095796,Drug and alcohol review,2019 05 16,Methanol poisonings pose a major risk especially where illegal alcohol is consumed.

Here, we have successfully used the SBDD approach viz. virtual high-throughput screening to identify potential inhibitors against the Ketoacyl synthase (KS) domain of Fatty acid synthase (FASN). Overexpression of FASN, and subsequent enhancement of de novo lipogenesis is a key survival strategy of cancer cells. Hence, targeting lipid metabolism using FASN inhibitors has been considered as a promising method to induce metabolic stress, thereby posing a survival disadvantage to cancer cells. In the present study, we have successfully identified eight FASN inhibitors from Asinex Elite database by implementing in silico tools. Five of the hit compounds share a common ring structure, which enables characteristic binding interactions with FASN-KS. Among them, in vitro validation showed that SFA 22637550 possesses significant FASN inhibitory activity and antiproliferative effect in human cancer cells of various origins. The maximum sensitivity was exhibited towards HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells (IC50 = 28 µM).

Unequal access to diagnostic and treatment services is observed: coping strategies are developed by patients and their families taking into account the available financial and social capital. Importantly, we could not identify a typical path for cancer patients as cancer patients act in an environment of great uncertainty-in terms of their prognosis and in terms of the cost of treatment.

Results show positive associations between county-level percent of the population enrolled in the SSI program and health care and social assistance employment and wages with strong associations identified for social assistance employment.

The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with a little capacity of coding proteins is playing an increasingly important role in the cancer paradigm. Accumulating evidences demonstrate that lncRNAs have crucial connections with breast cancer prognosis while the studies of lncRNAs in breast cancer are still in its primary stage. In this study, we collected 1052 clinical patient samples, a comparatively large sample size, including 13 159 lncRNA expression profiles of breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) from The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify prognosis-related lncRNAs. We randomly separated all of these clinical patient samples into training and testing sets. In the training set, we performed univariable Cox regression analysis for primary screening and played the model for Robust likelihood-based survival for 1000 times. Then 11 lncRNAs with a frequency more than 600 were selected for prediction of the prognosis of BRCA. Using the analysis of multivariate Cox regression, we established a signature risk-score formula for 11 lncRNA to identify the relationship between lncRNA signatures and overall survival. The 11 lncRNA signature was validated both in the testing and the complete set and could effectively classify the high-/low-risk group with different OS. We also verified our results in different stages. Moreover, we analyzed the connection between the 11 lncRNAs and the genes of ESR1, PGR, and Her2, of which protein products (ESR, PGR, and HER2) were used to classify the breast cancer subtypes widely. The results indicated correlations between 11 lncRNAs and the gene of PGR and ESR1. Thus, a prognostic model for 11 lncRNA expression was developed to classify the BRAC clinical patient samples, providing new avenues in understanding the potential therapeutic methods of breast cancer."

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular response that occurs within the menisci following a surgical injury that allows bleeding into the joint space, and then to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on this molecular response. Cell viability studies following acute controlled exposure to blood and blood plus DEX were also conducted. Forty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were randomly allocated into control, sham, surgical, and surgical + dexamethasone groups (each group n=6). Animals were sacrificed at 48 hours and 9 weeks, and menisci were harvested. The mRNA expression levels for key inflammatory, and degradative proteins, as well as mRNA levels for autophagy pathway molecules were quantified, and statistically significant changes were described. Meniscal cell viability was calculated by incubating groups of medial and lateral menisci in autologous blood, or autologous blood plus DEX for 48 hours (each group n=4; total of 8 medial and 8 lateral menisci), and then conducting a histological live/dead assay. Results indicated a significant reduction in only medial meniscal cell viability when the tissue was exposed to blood in combination with DEX. A single administration of DEX following surgery significantly suppresses the elevated molecular expression for key inflammatory and degradative markers within menisci at 48 hours and 9 weeks post-surgery. In vitro, autologous blood did not affect cell viability, but addition of DEX uniquely impacted the medial menisci. This article is protected by copyright.

Seventy-three infertile men with OAT and 20 normozoospermic volunteers participated in the study. To investigate sDF and methylation patterns of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene promoters, TUNEL assay and methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) were used. The mean sDF ratio for the patients was calculated as 22.50%. The calculated cut-off value for sDF ratio was 17.0% in ROC curve analysis. Regarding sDF, a significant difference between the normozoospermic group and the OAT group with abnormal semen parameters (p < 0.001) was found. sDF demonstrated a significant effect on the semen parameters and negative correlations on sDF ratios and sperm motility, concentration and morphology. There was no statistically significant association between sDF and the methylation status of the promoter of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

However, whether the cell death of SSC also plays a vital role in the human being remains unknown. To explore the necroptosis of SSC, the activation marker of necroptosis, phosphorylated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (pMLKL) in testes was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Meanwhile, a total of 81 semen samples were divided based on the sperm concentration (>15, 10-15, 5-10 and 0-5 million/ml) to study the relationships between pMLKL levels and sperm counts. We found that the pMLKL was increased in the ageing human testes (p < 0.05). Moreover, the seminal pMLKL expression was decreased in groups with sperm concentration 0-5 and 5-10 million/ml when compared with normal sperm concentration in young men (p < 0.05). Further analysis revealed that pMLKL showed an age-related increased expression in men aged 22-60 years with normal sperm concentration. These data demonstrated that the necroptosis of SSC was important for the spermatogenic function and would raise in advance on the point of testicular hypofunction. In conclusion, the pMLKL may serve as a potential biologically seminal indicator for the spermatogenic function in men.",Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors is associated with higher infection rates in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia-A prospective international multicenter trial on behalf of the BFM-SG and the EBMT-PDWP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095771,American journal of hematology,2019 05 29,"Severe infections (SI) significantly impact on non-relapse mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

A recently synthesized double-stranded helical oligomer covalently bridged by rotary boronate esters (BBDD) was shown to undergo helix-inversion that might serve as platform to design rotor systems. However, the detailed helix-inversion mechanism could not be investigated experimentally. Direct molecular dynamics simulations based on density-functional tight-binding energies and gradients computed on-the-fly reveal that disentanglement to the unraveled form and following exchange of the twisted terminal trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups are prerequisites for the observed helix-inversion. The potential of mean force confirms that the originally assumed ""concurrent"" rotation of the boronate esters and the helix-inversion involves shorter time scale ""step-wise"" processes, triggered by the disentanglement and exchange of the TMS groups. These results indicate that inversion dynamics of double-helical molecules such as BBDD may be controllable by chemical fine-tuning of the terminal groups. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",EAACI Guidelines on Allergen Immunotherapy: House dust mite-driven allergic asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095767,Allergy,2019 05 16,"Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) has been in use for the treatment of allergic disease for more than 100 years. Asthma treatment relies mainly on corticosteroids and other controllers recommended to achieve and maintain asthma control, prevent exacerbations, and improve quality of life. AIT is underused in asthma, both in children and in adults. Notably, patients with allergic asthma not adequately controlled on pharmacotherapy (including biologics) represent an unmet health need. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology has developed a clinical practice guideline providing evidence-based recommendations for the use of house dust mites (HDM) AIT as add-on treatment for HDM-driven allergic asthma. This guideline was developed by a multi-disciplinary working group using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. HDM AIT was separately evaluated by route of administration and children and adults: subcutaneous (SCIT) and sublingual AIT (SLIT), drops, and tablets. Recommendations were formulated for each. The important prerequisites for successful treatment with HDM AIT are (a) selection of patients most likely to respond to AIT and (b) use of allergen extracts and desensitization protocols of proven efficacy. To date, only AIT with HDM SLIT-tablet has demonstrated a robust effect in adults for critical end points (exacerbations, asthma control, and safety). Thus, it is recommended as an add-on to regular asthma therapy for adults with controlled or partially controlled HDM-driven allergic asthma (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). HDM SCIT is recommended for adults and children, and SLIT drops are recommended for children with controlled HDM-driven allergic asthma as the add-on to regular asthma therapy to decrease symptoms and medication needs (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).",Rapid electrophoretic recovery of DNA from dried blood spots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095765,Electrophoresis,2019 05 29,"Large-scale genetic screening of neonatal dried blood spots for episomal DNA has a great potential to lower patient mortality and morbidity through early diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies.

In the present study, we developed and optimized a rapid methodology using only 50 V and heat to extract episomal DNA from dried blood spots prepared from diagnostic cord blood samples. This electric field DNA extraction is the first methodology to use an electric field to extract episomal DNA from a dried blood spot. This 25-minute procedure has one of the lowest times for the extraction of episomal DNA found within the literature and this novel procedure not only negates the need for costly treatment and wash steps, but reduces the time of manual procedures by more than 30 min while retaining the 75-80% of the yield.

The immune response is driven and modulated by protein-attached glycans that mediate cell-cell interactions, pathogen recognition and cell activation. Therefore, abnormal glycosylation can be associated with deranged immune responses. Within human diseases presenting immunological defects are Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG), a family of around 130 rare and complex genetic diseases. In this review, we have identified 23 CDG with immunological involvement, characterised by an increased propensity to - often life-threatening - infection. Inflammatory and autoimmune complications were found in 7 CDG types. CDG natural history(ies) and the mechanisms behind the immunological anomalies are still poorly understood. However, in some cases, alterations in pathogen recognition and intracellular signalling (e.g. TGF-β1, NFAT and NF-κB) have been suggested. Targeted therapies to restore immune defects are only available for PGM3-CDG and SLC35C1-CDG. Fostering research on glycoimmunology may elucidate the involved pathophysiological mechanisms and open new therapeutic avenues, thus improving CDG patients' quality of life.

Currently, four genetic defects have been described causing impairment of thiamine transport and metabolism: SLC19A2 dysfunction leads to diabetes mellitus, megaloblastic anaemia and sensory-neural hearing loss, whereas SLC19A3, SLC25A19 and TPK1-related disorders result in recurrent encephalopathy, basal ganglia necrosis, generalized dystonia, severe disability and early death. In order to achieve early diagnosis and treatment, biomarkers play an important role. SLC19A3 patients present a profound decrease of free-thiamine in CSF and fibroblasts. TPK1 patients show decreased concentrations of thiamine pyrophosphate in blood and muscle. Thiamine supplementation has been shown to improve diabetes and anaemia control in Rogers' syndrome patients due to SLC19A2 deficiency. In a significant number of patients with SLC19A3, thiamine improves clinical outcome and survival, and prevents further metabolic crisis. In SLC25A19 and TPK1 defects, thiamine has also led to clinical stabilization in single cases. Moreover, thiamine supplementation leads to normal concentrations of free-thiamine in the CSF of SLC19A3 patients.

The present study investigated the sensory-immune interaction in resting alveolar bone and healing socket by surgical sensory denervation. Bone histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry showed that sensory denervation resulted in moderate suppression of bone remodeling, with a proinflammatory milieu manifested by increased neutrophil recruitment and possible alternations in macrophage phenotypes along the resting bone surface. This denervation effect intensified when bone remodeling was triggered by tooth extraction, as revealed by disrupted temporospatial variations in macrophage subpopulations and neutrophil infiltration, which were closely associated with a dramatic decline in socket bone filling and residual ridge height. Antagonism of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) brought about similar antianabolic and proinflammatory effects as sensory denervation, suggesting that sensory nerves may monitor the bony milieu by CGRP. Depletion of macrophages, rather than neutrophils, ruled out CGRP effects, illustrating that macrophages were the primary immune mechanism that linked sensory innervation, innate immunity, and bone. The data support that sensory innervation is required for control of innate immune responses and maintenance of bone homeostasis. Sensory neuropeptides, such as CGRP, are a possible target for the development of proanabolic treatments in bone disease by modulating innate immune responses.",Calcitriol suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced alveolar bone damage in rats by regulating T helper cell subset polarization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095745,Journal of periodontal research,2019 05 16,"Although the immunomodulatory properties of calcitriol in bone metabolism have been documented for decades, its therapeutic role in the management of periodontitis remains largely unexplored.

I highlight different spheres in which intimacy may take place such as the emotional, sexual, intellectual, or familial. I propose a starting point in which the therapist, in a collaborative manner, helps the partners articulate their yearnings and priorities in order to negotiate a shared vision. In Part Two, Conceptualizing Intimacy, I suggest an experiential definition that gives room for each partner's subjective meanings, yet consider diverse relational processes that may need to be addressed for a resilient ebb and flow of intimate experiences. In Part Three, Sexual Intimacy, I outline conditions in which sex is more likely to be experienced as intimate rather than nonintimate. Finally, in Part Four, I describe Therapeutic Principles to guide the therapist in taking couples from reactivity to dialogue to negotiations of intimacy.

Most cells that escape primary tumors are unable to establish metastatic lesions, which suggests that target organ microenvironments are hostile for tumor cells. This implies that BCa cells must achieve a process of speciation to adapt to the new conditions imposed in the new organ. Bone has unique characteristics that can be exploited by cancer cells: it undergoes constant remodeling and comprises diverse environments (including osteogenic, perivascular and hematopoietic stem cell niches). This allows colonizing cells to take advantage of numerous adhesion molecules, matrix proteins and soluble factors that facilitate homing, survival and, eventually, metastatic outgrowth. However, in most cases, metastatic lesions enter into a latency state that can last months, years, or even decades, before forming a clinically detectable macrometastasis. This dormant state challenges the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy. Detecting which tumors are more prone to metastasize to bone and developing new specific therapies that target bone metastasis represent urgent clinical needs. Here, we review the biological mechanisms of BCa bone metastasis and provide the latest options of treatments and predictive markers that are currently in clinical use or are being tested in clinical assays.","Structural complexity in the hatchery rearing environment affects activity, resting metabolic rate and post-release behaviour in brown trout Salmo trutta.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095737,Journal of fish biology,2019 05 29,"The effects of structural enrichment in the hatchery rearing environment of brown trout Salmo trutta was linked to post-release performance.

Recently, SBRT has been studied in the management of the primary tumor in nonsurgical patients with localized renal cell carcinoma. Excellent local control rates and low rates of treatment-related toxicity were reported with single-fraction (26 Gy) and multi-fraction (36 to 45 Gy in 3 fractions or 40 to 50 Gy in 5 fractions) regimens.

Here, I aim to stimulate research in this area by reviewing empirical examples of such processes from the psychology literature. Indeed, psychology researchers have been actively investigating genetic variation in the environments that individuals experience-a phenomenon termed ""gene-environment correlation"" (rGE)-since the 1970s. rGE emerges from genetic variation in individuals' behavior and personality traits, which in turn affects the environments that they experience. I highlight concepts and examples from this literature, emphasizing the relevance to quantitative geneticists working on wild, nonhuman organisms. I point out fruitful areas of crossover between these disciplines, including how quantitative geneticists can test ideas about rGE in wild populations.",Simultaneous Determination of Cocaine and Metabolites in Human Plasma Using Solid Phase Micro-Extraction Fiber Tips C18 and UPLC-MS/MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095712,Journal of analytical toxicology,2019 05 16,"The determination of cocaine (COC) and its metabolites ecgonine methyl ester (EME), benzoylecgonine (BZE), norcocaine (NCOC) and cocaethylene (CE) in human plasma is relevant in clinical and forensic toxicology. An efficient extraction and clean-up of plasma specimens for the simultaneous determination of BZE along with COC and basic metabolites is challenging due to their widely different polarities and ionization characteristics. Recently, biocompatible SPME LC tips C18 became commercially available. We applied SPME LC tips C18 to the simultaneous extraction of COC, BZE, EME, NCOC, and CE by direct immersion of the fiber in plasma diluted with a buffer at pH 8.0. Analytes were desorbed from the fiber to methanol containing formic acid and injected into a UPLC-MS/MS system. The assay was linear from 5 to 500 ng mL-1. Precision assays presented CV% in the range of 2.22 to 10.54%, and accuracy was in the range of 93.4-108.1%. The assay requires minimal quantities of plasma and organic solvents, allowing multiple extractions in parallel. Biocompatible SPME is a promising alternative for preparing biological samples prior to drug measurement by UPLC-MS/MS.",Pregabalin and Its Involvement in Coronial Cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095711,Journal of analytical toxicology,2019 05 16,"Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and analgesic designed to treat neuropathic pain and partial seizure disorders and has been available in Australia as a prescription medication since 2005. Studies have found high rates of polydrug use associated with pregabalin and it is reportedly used recreationally for its euphoric and relaxing effects as well as to self-manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. A robust analytical method for the analysis of pregabalin using protein precipitation and LC/MS/MS was developed, validated and employed in routine case work. In recent years a substantial increase in pregabalin detections in coronial case submissions had been noted. This study examines the case characteristics and outcomes of 332 coronial cases submitted to the laboratory and analyzed for pregabalin between 2015 and 2017. Pregabalin was identified in approximately 5% of all coronial cases submitted during this time. A high rate of concurrent drug use with pregabalin was evident with the predominant classes being opioids, benzodiazepines and anti-depressants. Post-mortem blood pregabalin concentrations ranged from <0.05 to 140 mg/kg (median 5.5 mg/kg); however, limited interpretation of levels could be achieved as the drug was rarely identified in the absence of other drugs. Cause of death (COD) was found to be drug related in 58% of all cases, with mixed drug toxicity specifically mentioned as related to COD in 40% of cases."

However, although the number might be large, most NPS have a low prevalence of use, so keeping screening libraries updated with the relevant analytical targets becomes a challenge. One way to ensure sufficient screening coverage is to use shared high resolution-mass spectrometry (HR-MS) databases, such as HighResNPS.com: a free, online, spreadsheet-format, crowd-sourced HR-MS database for NPS screening. The aims of this study were (i) to present the database to the scientific community and (ii) to verify that the HighResNPS database can be utilized in suspect screening workflows for LC-HR-MS instruments and software from four different instrument vendors. A sample was spiked with 10 NPS, and participating laboratories then analyzed the sample with their respective HR-MS vendor platforms and the HighResNPS database. The HighResNPS data were obtained via a spreadsheet converted to fit the import specifications of the different vendor platforms. Suspect screening was performed using LC-HR-MS vendor platforms from Thermo Fisher, Waters, Bruker and Agilent. All 10 NPS were identified in at least three workflows used for the four different vendor platforms. Multiple users have submitted data to HighResNPS for the same NPS, which resulted in multiple true-positive identifications for these NPS. Suspect screening with LC-HR-MS can be based on diagnostic fragment ions reported by users of different vendor platforms and can support NPS identification in biological samples and/or seizure analyses when no reference standard is available in-house. The present work clearly demonstrates that HighResNPS data is compatible with instruments and screening software from at least four different vendor platforms. The database can thus serve as a useful add-on in LC-HR-MS screening workflows.",Hexanol-Based Supramolecular Solvents Tool for the Determination of 11 Illicit Phenethylamines in Oral Fluid by LC-MS/MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095695,Journal of analytical toxicology,2019 05 16,"Monitoring of new phenethylamine designer drugs in oral fluid (OF) is a crucial aim in workplace testing and driving under the influence of drug programs. In this study a simple and very quick method for the quantification of 11 illicit drugs in OF, which gave negative results to immunoassay tests, is proposed. Sample treatment and extraction of analytes were simultaneously achieved by applying supramolecular solvents (SUPRAS) tool. Chromatographic separation and compounds quantification were carried out by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Efficacy of cleaning-up/extraction of this SUPRAS approach was fully confirmed by recovery and matrix effect results. The entire analytical procedure was validated following the international guidelines. The SUPRAS extraction coupled with LC-MS/MS resulted in powerful tool for the control of phenethylamines abuse, with rapid run time and minimal sample preparation. The use of this methodology could be easily extended to monitoring of other drugs of abuse.",Urinary Excretion Profile of 11-Nor-9-Carboxy-Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) Following Smoked and Vaporized Cannabis Administration in Infrequent Cannabis Users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095692,Journal of analytical toxicology,2019 05 16,"As cannabis has become more accessible, use of alternative methods for cannabis administration such as vaporizers has become more prevalent. Most prior controlled pharmacokinetic evaluations have examined smoked cannabis in frequent (often daily) cannabis users. This study characterized the urinary excretion profile of 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH), the primary analytical outcome for detection of cannabis use, among infrequent cannabis users following controlled administration of both smoked and vaporized cannabis. Healthy adults (N = 17), with a mean of 398 (range 30-1,825) days since last cannabis use, smoked and vaporized cannabis containing 0, 10, and 25 mg of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) across six outpatient sessions. Urinary concentrations of THCCOOH were measured at baseline and for 8 h after cannabis administration. Sensitivity, specificity, and agreement between three immunoassays (IA) for THCCOOH (with cutoffs of 20, 50, and 100 ng/mL) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) results (confirmatory concentration of 15 ng/mL) were assessed. THCCOOH concentrations peaked 4-6 h after cannabis administration. Median maximum concentrations (Cmax) for THCCOOH were qualitatively higher after administration of vaporized cannabis compared to equal doses of smoked cannabis. Urine THCCOOH concentrations were substantially lower in this study relative to prior examinations of experienced cannabis users. The highest agreement between IA and GC/MS was observed at the 50 ng/mL IA cutoff while sensitivity and specificity were highest at the 20 and 100 ng/mL IA cutoffs, respectively. Using federal workplace drug-testing criteria (IA cutoff of 50 ng/mL and GC/MS concentration ≥15 ng/mL) urine specimens tested positive in 47% of vaporized sessions and 21% of smoked sessions with active THC doses (N = 68). Urinary concentrations of THCCOOH are dissimilar after administration of smoked and vaporized cannabis, with qualitatively higher concentrations observed after vaporization. Infrequent users of cannabis may excrete relatively low concentrations of THCCOOH following acute inhalation of smoked or vaporized cannabis.","Dispersal of the Mosquito Aedes vigilax (Diptera: Culicidae) From Urban Estuarine Wetlands in Sydney, Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095691,Journal of medical entomology,2019 05 16,"Aedes vigilax (Skuse) is a pest and vector species associated with coastal wetlands and the abundance of this mosquito has been identified as contributing to increased risk of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. As urban development continues to encroach on these coastal wetlands, pest and public health impacts are becoming of increasing concern and in the absence of broadscale mosquito control. Urban planners are looking to buffer zones and other land use planning options to minimize contact between mosquitoes and humans but gaps in the understanding of dispersal ranges of mosquitoes hamper the adoption of these strategies. A mark-release-recapture experiment was conducted to measure the dispersal of this mosquito from an urban estuarine wetland in Sydney, Australia. An estimated total of over 150,000 wild caught female mosquitoes were marked with fluorescent dust and then released. A network of 38 traps was then operated for 5 d within an area of 28 km2. A total of 280 marked mosquitoes was recaptured, representing less than 1% of the estimate 250,000 marked mosquitoes released. Marked mosquitoes were recaptured up to 3 km from the release point, providing an insight into the dispersal range of these mosquitoes. The mean distance traveled by marked mosquitoes was 0.83 km, a result reflecting the greater proportion of marked mosquitoes recaptured near release point. The findings of this study indicate that effective buffer zones between estuarine wetlands and high-density urban developments would be an impractical approach to minimizing pest and public health impacts associated with this mosquito.",Communicating About Animal Research with the Public.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095690,ILAR journal,2019 05 16,"Animals play a key role in biomedical research and other areas of scientific inquiry. But public opinion plays a key role in influencing how this area of science is regulated and funded. Nevertheless, scientists have historically been reticent to speak openly about their animal research or to open their animal facilities to the public in any way. Consequently, most of the available information has come from those opposed to animal research. This imbalance has led to suspicion and lagging public support for this work. To reverse this effect, efforts are now being made in many parts of the world to increase openness and transparency in this sector. The authors firmly believe that encouraging more institutions to join this movement, focused on better and greater communication, is essential to preserve the research community's ""permission"" to perform justifiable studies involving animals. For the purposes of this article, we consider ""the public"" to include that cross-section of society who may be asked their views in opinion poll studies and who may vote in elections. It also includes other influential groups such as the media, scientists working in other disciplines, animal welfare groups, and politicians who may shape regulatory frameworks. Public opinion on this issue matters. The majority of funding for biomedical research comes, either directly or indirectly, from the public purse. In the case of pharmaceutical research, funding derives from selling medicines to consumers. We therefore all have a vested interest in this funding. Furthermore, legislation that covers the use of animals in research is permissive-it allows scientists to do things that might otherwise contravene animal welfare laws. But this permission is normally contingent on complying with strict protective measures designed to ensure the work stays within the ethical framework that public opinion has deemed appropriate. Open and transparent communication is the best way to promote public understanding. There is thus a responsibility on all those involved in animal research, whether scientists, animal care staff, physicians, veterinarians, members of ethics committees, or managers and leaders, to support and promote public awareness and trust in this work. Circumstantial evidence shows that, with such open dialogue, there is decreased targeting and harassment of individuals and job pride and satisfaction for all involved is improved.",Post-exposure administration of a Yersinia pestis live vaccine potentiates second-line antibiotic treatment against pneumonic plague.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095689,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 05 16,"Pneumonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, is a rapidly progressing contagious disease. In the plague mouse model, a single immunization with the EV76 live attenuated Y. pestis strain rapidly induced the expression of hemopexin and haptoglobin in the lung and serum, both of which are important in iron sequestration. Immunization against a concomitant lethal Y. pestis respiratory challenge was correlated with temporary inhibition of disease progression. Combining EV76-immunization and second-line antibiotic treatment, which are individually insufficient, led to a synergistic protective effect that represents a proof of concept for efficient combinational therapy in cases of infection with antibiotic-resistant strains.",Dietary Factors in Prevention of Pediatric Escherichia coli Infection: A Model Using Domestic Piglets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095688,ILAR journal,2019 05 16,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the major etiological agent causing acute watery diarrhea that is most frequently seen in young children in lower-income countries. The duration of diarrheal symptom may be shortened by antibiotic treatment, but ETEC is relative refractory to common antibiotics. Burgeoning evidence suggests bioactive components that naturally occur in human milk (e.g., lysozyme and oligosaccharides) and plants (e.g., nondigestible carbohydrates and phytochemicals) contain antimicrobial functions are promising preventive measures to control ETEC infection. Although the exact protective mechanisms may vary for each compound and are still not completely understood, they generally act to (1) competitively inhibit the binding of pathogenic bacteria and toxins to gut epithelium; (2) directly kill pathogens; and (3) stimulate and/or enhance host mucosal and systemic immune defense against pathogenic microorganisms. An appropriate ETEC-challenge animal model is critical to evaluate the effect and unveil the mechanism of bioactive compounds in prevention of enteric infection. Despite wide application in biomedical research, rodents do not usually manifest typical clinical signs of enteric infections. The remarkable differences in digestive physiology, immune response, and gut microbiota between rodents and human beings necessitate the use of alternative animal models. Pigs are closely related to humans in terms of genomes, physiology, anatomy of gastrointestinal tracts, digestive enzymes, components of immune system, and gut microbiota. Like human infants and young children, nursing and nursery piglets are more susceptible to ETEC infection and reproduce the clinical signs as observed in humans. Hence, the ETEC-challenge piglet represents a valuable translational model to study pathogenesis and evaluate dietary factors (e.g., milk bioactive compounds, nondigestible carbohydrates, and phytochemicals) as preventive measures for ETEC infection in pediatrics.",Keeping the Engine Running: The Relevance and Predictive Value of Preclinical Models for CAR-T Cell Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095687,ILAR journal,2019 05 16,"The cellular immunotherapy field has achieved important milestones in the last 30 years towards the treatment of a variety of cancers due to improvements in ex-vivo T cell manufacturing processes, the invention of synthetic T cell receptors, and advances in cellular engineering.

Here, we demonstrated the presence of PAUF at the intracellular level and its multiple effects on cancer progression. An initial decline of PAUF expression was observed at early stages of colorectal cancer followed by an increase at the metastastic site. PAUF was located at different cellular compartments: membrane-associated vesicles, endosomes, microtubule-associated vesicles, cell growth cones and the cell nucleus. PAUF loss in two colorectal cancer cell lines caused severe alterations in the cell phenotype and cell cycle, including tetraploidy, extensive genomic alterations, micronuclei, and increased apoptosis. An exhaustive analysis of the PAUF interactome using different proteomic approaches revealed the presence of multiple components of the cell cycle, mitotic checkpoint, Wnt pathway and intracellular transport. Among the interacting proteins we found ZW10, a moonlighting protein with a dual function in membrane trafficking and mitosis. In addition, PAUF silencing was associated to APC loss and increased β-catenin nuclear expression. Altogether, our results suggest that PAUF depletion increases aneuploidy, promotes apoptosis and activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in colorectal cancer cells facilitating cancer progression. In summary, PAUF behaves as a multifunctional protein, with different roles in cancer progression according to the extra- or intracellular expression, suggesting a therapeutic value for colorectal cancer.",Central Composite Design for Dispersive Liquid-liquid Microextraction of 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol in Human Serum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095673,Journal of chromatographic science,2019 05 16,"The human body's vitamin D levels are determined by measuring the level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D3 (25-OH-vitamin D3) in human serum.

The densitometric analysis was carried out in absorbance mode at 215 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed a good linear relationship for Brexpiprazole over a concentration range of 200-1,600 ng band-1. The limit of detection and limit of quantification for Brexpiprazole was found to be 66 and 200 ng band-1. To find out the possible degradation pathway, forced degradation studies were performed. The stock solutions of Brexpiprazole (1,000 μg mL-1) were subjected to acid and alkali hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, dry heat degradation and photo degradation. The drug was found to be susceptible to acid and alkali hydrolysis, chemical oxidation, photo degradation and dry heat. The degraded product peaks were well resolved from the pure drug peak with significant difference in their Rf values. Stressed samples were analyzed using developed HPTLC method.

In this study, we report the role of 14-3-3 in coordinating cytoskeletal dynamics during phagocytosis in a professional phagocytic protist Entamoeba histolytica, the etiological agent of human amebiasis. There are three isoforms of 14-3-3 protein in amoeba and here we have investigated Eh14-3-3 Protein 3 (EhP3). Live and fixed cell imaging studies revealed the presence of this protein throughout the parasite phagocytosis process, with high rate of accumulation at the phagocytic cups and closed phagosomes. Conditional suppression of EhP3 expression caused significant defects in phagocytosis accompanied by extensive diminution of F-actin at the site of cup formation. Downregulated cells also exhibited defective recruitment of an F-actin stabilizing protein, EhCoactosin at the phagocytic cups. In addition, mass spectrometry based analysis further revealed a large group of EhP3-associated proteins, many of these proteins are known to regulate cytoskeletal architecture in E histolytica. The dynamics of these proteins may also be controlled by EhP3.

Biocorrosion was evaluated by counting the number and the coverage of corrosion tubercles on coupons and also by ESEM imaging of the coupon surface. Three experimental coating additives significantly reduced the formation of corrosion tubercles: surfactin, magnesium peroxide and the quorum quenching lactonase by 31%, 36% and 50%, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that these decreases in corrosion were associated with significant changes in the composition of bacterial communities on the steel surfaces. These results demonstrate the potential of highly stable quorum quenching lactonases to provide a reliable, cost-effective method to treat steel structures and prevent biocorrosion.","Simultaneous bioconversion of lignocellulosic residues and oxodegradable polyethylene by Pleurotus ostreatus for biochar production, enriched with phosphate solubilizing bacteria for agricultural use.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095642,PloS one,2019 06 10,"A simultaneous treatment of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) and low density oxodegradable polyethylene (LDPEoxo) was carried-out using Pleurotus ostreatus at microcosm scale to obtain biotransformed plastic and oxidized lignocellulosic biomass. This product was used as raw matter (RM) to produce biochar enriched with phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Biochar potential as biofertilizer was evaluated in Allium cepa culture at greenhouse scale. Experiments including lignocellulosic mix and LDPEoxo were performed for 75 days in microcosm. Biotransformation progress was performed by monitoring total organic carbon (TOC), CO2 production, laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and lignin peroxidase (LiP) enzymatic activities. Physical LDPEoxo changes were assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and static contact angle (SCA) and chemical changes by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results revealed P. ostreatus was capable of LCB and LDPEoxo biotransformation, obtaining 41% total organic carbon (TOC) removal with CO2 production of 2,323 mg Kg-1 and enzyme activities of 169,438 UKg-1, 5,535 UKg-1 and 5,267 UKg-1 for LiP, MnP and Lac, respectively. Regarding LDPEoxo, SCA was decreased by 84%, with an increase in signals at 1,076 cm-1 and 3,271 cm-1, corresponding to C-O and CO-H bonds. A decrease in signals was observed related to material degradation at 2,928 cm-1, 2,848 cm-1, agreeing with CH2 asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching, respectively. PSB enriched biochar favored A. cepa plant growth during the five-week evaluation period. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an in vitro circular production model, where P. ostreatus was employed at a microcosmos level to bioconvert LCB and LDPEoxo residues from the agroindustrial sector, followed by thermoconversion to produce an enriched biochar with PSB to be used as a biofertilizer to grow A. cepa at greenhouse scale.",Burden of fungal asthma in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095641,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Asthma is one of the neglected diseases in Africa with a high prevalence.

We investigated whether HIV-2 reservoirs might follow the peculiar distribution reported in models of attenuated HIV-1/SIV infections, i.e. limited infection of central-memory CD4 T lymphocytes (TCM). Antiretroviral-naive HIV-2 infected individuals from the ANRS-CO5 (12 non-progressors, 2 progressors) were prospectively included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were sorted into monocytes and resting CD4 T-cell subsets (naive [TN], central- [TCM], transitional- [TTM] and effector-memory [TEM]). Reactivation of HIV-2 was tested in 30-day cultures of CD8-depleted PBMCs. HIV-2 DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Cell surface markers, co-receptors and restriction factors were analyzed by flow-cytometry and multiplex transcriptomic study. HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals and was quantifiable in TTM from 4 individuals (median: 2.25 log10 copies/106 cells [IQR: 1.99-2.94]) but in TCM from only 1 individual (1.75 log10 copies/106 cells). HIV-2 DNA levels in PBMCs (median: 1.94 log10 copies/106 PBMC [IQR = 1.53-2.13]) positively correlated with those in TTM (r = 0.66, p = 0.01) but not TCM. HIV-2 reactivation was observed in the cells from only 3 individuals. The CCR5 co-receptor was distributed similarly in cell populations from individuals and donors. TCM had a lower expression of CXCR6 transcripts (p = 0.002) than TTM confirmed by FACS analysis, and a higher expression of TRIM5 transcripts (p = 0.004). Thus the low HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and a limited infection of TCM associated to a lower expression of a potential alternative HIV-2 co-receptor, CXCR6 and a higher expression of a restriction factor, TRIM5. These findings shed new light on the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection suggesting mechanisms close to those reported in other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection models.",Color morphology of Diaphorina citri influences interactions with its bacterial endosymbionts and 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095639,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Diaphorina citri is a vector of 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus,' (CLas), associated with Huanglongbing, (HLB, or citrus greening) disease in citrus. D. citri exhibits three different color morph variants, blue, gray and yellow. Blue morphs have a greater capacity for long-distance flight as compared to non-blue morphs, but little else is known about how color morphology influences vector characteristics. In this study, we show that the color morphology of the insect is derived from pigmented cells of the fat body. Blue morphs acquire a lower level of CLas in their bodies from infected trees as compared to their gray and yellow conspecifics, referred to in this paper collectively as non-blue morphs. Accordingly, CLas titer in citrus leaves inoculated by non-blue insects was 6-fold higher than in leaves inoculated by blue insects. Blue color morphs harbored lower titers of Wolbachia and 'Candidatus Profftella armatura,' two of the D. citri bacterial endosymbionts. Expression of hemocyanin, a copper-binding oxygen transport protein responsible for the blue coloration of hemolymph of other arthropods and mollusks, was previously correlated with blue color morphology and is highly up-regulated in insects continuously reared on CLas infected citrus trees. Based on our results, we hypothesized that a reduction of hemocyanin expression would reduce the D. citri immune response and an increase in the titer of CLas would be observed. Surprisingly, a specific 3-fold reduction of hemocyanin-1 transcript levels using RNA silencing in blue adult D. citri morphs had an approximately 2-fold reduction on the titer of CLas. These results suggest that hemocyanin signaling from the fat body may have multiple functions in the regulation of bacterial titers in D. citri, and that hemocyanin is one of multiple psyllid genes involved in regulating CLas titer.",Social selection in historical time: The case of tuberculosis in South Korea after the East Asian financial crisis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095637,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The perspectives of social selection and causation have long been debated. Social selection theory is as ""social"" as social causation theory, since all diseases are social and no biological process occurs outside society. To identify the social selection pathway and historical juncture affected by socioeconomic and political changes, we investigated the reciprocal impact of suffering from tuberculosis (TB) on the current socioeconomic position (SEP), stratified by childhood SEP. We also examined the extent to which the social consequences of ill health changed since the East Asian economic downturn. Data were collected for 2007-2012 from the Korea National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. To identify associations between TB history and current household income (HHI), we constructed an ordinal logistic regression model adjusted for covariates, including age, gender, educational attainment, and job status. We adopted a recursive regression model to examine trend changes in this association from 1980-2012 to 2003-2012. Of 28,136 participants, 936 had experienced TB. In the first ordinal logistic regression, the TB group was more likely to have lower HHI than the non-TB group. The odds ratios (ORs) increased from 1.30 (1980-2012) to 1.86 (2003-2012) for the TB group, increasing their probability of having low HHI. Among the low childhood SEP group, the TB group's probability of having low HHI was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.57) during 1980-2012, which increased to 2.01 (95% CI: 1.37-2.95) during 2003-2012. For the high childhood SEP group, the TB group's OR range fluctuated, similar to that for the non-TB group. The results support the social selection pathway from TB history to adverse impact on current SEP. Our study identified downward social mobility due to TB history among the low childhood SEP group. Moreover, negative social consequences deteriorated since the East Asian economic crisis.",Validity of WHO's near-miss approach in a high maternal mortality setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095635,PloS one,2019 06 10,"To evaluate the validity of WHO's near-miss approach in a low-resource, high maternal mortality setting.",Molecular identification of late and terminal Pleistocene Equus ovodovi from northeastern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095634,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The extant diversity of horses (family Equidae) represents a small fraction of that occurring over their evolutionary history. One such lost lineage is the subgenus Sussemionus, which is thought to have become extinct during the Middle Pleistocene. However, recent molecular studies and morphological analysis have revealed that one of their representatives, E. ovodovi, did exist in Siberia during the Late Pleistocene. Fossil materials of E. ovodovi have thus far only been found in Russia. In this study, we extracted DNA from three equid fossil specimens excavated from northeastern China dated at 12,770-12,596, 29,525-28,887 and 40,201-38,848 cal. yBP, respectively, and retrieved three near-complete mitochondrial genomes from the specimens. Phylogenetic analyses cluster the Chinese haplotypes together with previously published Russian E. ovodovi, strongly supporting the assignment of these samples to this taxon. The molecular identification of E. ovodovi in northeastern China extends the known geographical range of this fossil species by several thousand kilometers to the east. The estimated coalescence time of all E. ovodovi haplotypes is approximately 199 Kya, with the Chinese haplotypes coalescing approximately 130 Kya. With a radiocarbon age of 12,770-12,596 cal. yBP, the youngest sample in this study represents the first E. ovodovi sample dating to the terminal Pleistocene, moving the extinction date of this species forwards considerably compared to previously documented fossils. Overall, comparison of our three mitochondrial genomes with the two published ones suggests a genetic diversity similar to several extant species of the genus Equus.",Prediction of recidivism in a long-term follow-up of forensic psychiatric patients: Incremental effects of neuroimaging data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095633,PloS one,2019 06 10,"One of the primary objectives in forensic psychiatry, distinguishing it from other psychiatric disciplines, is risk management. Assessments of the risk of criminal recidivism are performed on a routine basis, as a baseline for risk management for populations involved in the criminal justice system. However, the risk assessment tools available to clinical practice are limited in their ability to predict recidivism. Recently, the prospect of incorporating neuroimaging data to improve the prediction of criminal behavior has received increased attention. In this study we investigated the feasibility of including neuroimaging data in the prediction of recidivism by studying whether the inclusion of resting-state regional cerebral blood flow measurements leads to an incremental increase in predictive performance over traditional risk factors. A subsample (N = 44) from a cohort of forensic psychiatric patients who underwent single-photon emission computed tomography neuroimaging and clinical psychiatric assessment during their court-ordered forensic psychiatric investigation were included in a long-term (ten year average time at risk) follow-up. A Baseline model with eight empirically established risk factors, and an Extended model which also included resting-state regional cerebral blood flow measurements from eight brain regions were estimated using random forest classification and compared using several predictive performance metrics. Including neuroimaging data in the Extended model increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from .69 to .81, increased accuracy from .64 to .82 and increased the scaled Brier score from .08 to .25, supporting the feasibility of including neuroimaging data in the prediction of recidivism in forensic psychiatric patients. Although our results hint at potential benefits in the domain of risk assessment, several limitations and ethical challenges are discussed. Further studies with larger, carefully characterized clinical samples utilizing higher-resolution neuroimaging techniques are warranted."

In pigs, the weaning transition represents a drastic changes event leading to high risk of gut dysbiosis, which in most cases results in economic losses for swine industry. The blood type antigens expressed on mucosal surfaces can act as receptors for bacterial adhesion and the hypothesis of possible associations between blood groups and intestinal microbial profiles has been tested in human with contrasting results. Nevertheless, no studies testing the blood type as possible shaping factor for gut microbiota are available for pigs. The results of our previous study suggested the porcine AO blood types system as a possible factor influencing the microbiota composition. In the present study, the changes in fecal microbiota of 12 piglets were followed from 7 days after birth to 2 weeks post-weaning, testing the hypothesis that blood types may impact on its structure. No effects attributable to the difference in blood groups were detected, however, the sampling site (faeces) and the low statistical power might have masked the hypothesized impact. The data clearly showed the rearrangement of the bacterial ecosystem triggered by weaning transition; mainly consisting of a shift from a Bacteroidaceae-Enterobacteriaceae dominated community, to a Prevotellaceae-Ruminococcaceae dominated community. The functional analysis by metagenomic predictions suggested a role of the high levels of long-chain fatty acid in swine milk as energy source for Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli), in suckling piglets. This study provides a first insight for further investigations; indicating the need for larger sample size, preferably derived from intestinal mucosa, to test the potential effect of blood groups on gut microbiota profiles, and for analyses aimed at assessing the long-chain fatty acids degradation activity within the intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets, with particular attention to the role of E. coli.","Complete genome sequencing and evolutionary analysis of HCV subtype 6xg from IDUs in Yunnan, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095618,PloS one,2019 06 10,"HCV genotype 6 (HCV-6) typically circulates in Southeast Asia and exhibits the highest genetic diversity among the eight HCV genotypes.

Although the use of supplements with omega-3 fatty acids has been associated with reduced risk and lessened AD pathology, it still remains elusive whether such a treatment could affect dystrophic neurites (DNs) formation and microglia/macrophage behavior in the early phase of disease. We analyzed the effects of short-term (3 weeks) fish oil supplementation on DNs formation, tau hyperphosphorylation, Amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Aβ42) levels and microglial/macrophage response to AD pathology in the parietal cortex of 4-month-old 5xFAD mice, a mouse model of AD. The present study shows for the first time that short-term FO supplementation applied in presymptomatic stage of AD, alters the behaviour of microglia/macrophages prompting them to establish a physical barrier around amyloid plaques. This barrier significantly suppresses DNs formation through the reduction of both Aβ content and tau hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, the short-term FO treatment neither suppresses inflammation nor enhances phagocytic properties of microglia/macrophages in the response to Aβ pathology, the effects most commonly attributed to the fish oil supplementation. Our findings suggest that fish oil consumption may play an important role in modulating microglial/macrophage response and ameliorating the AD pathology in presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease.",Influence of sexual appeal in roadside advertising on drivers' attention and driving behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095616,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Sexual appeals are widely used in advertising to attract consumers' attention.

Study I was a nationwide survey (N = 1095) which revealed that drivers subjectively perceive sexual contents in roadside advertising as distracting and dangerous. Study II was a modified version of the Attentional Network Test (N = 1063) which proved that in cognitive tasks reaction time increases in line with the sexual content of advertisements. Study III was a simulator study (N = 55) which confirmed that driving characteristics change when sexually-oriented advertisements are located along the road.

When the size of dielectric grain boundaries are comparable to the THz wavelengths, spectral features can be obscured due to electromagnetic scattering. In this study, we first investigate this granular scattering effect in identification of chemicals with THz spectral absorption features. We then will propose a signal processing technique in the so-called ""quefrency"" domain to improve the ability to resolve these spectral features in the diffuse scattered THz images. We created a pellet with α-lactose monohydrate and riboflavin, two biologically significant materials with well-known vibrational spectral resonances, and buried the pellet in a highly scattering medium. THz transmission measurements were taken at all angles covering the half focal plane. We show that, while spectral features of lactose and riboflavin cannot be distinguished in the scattered image, application of cepstrum filtering can mitigate these scattering effects. By employing our quefrency-domain signal processing technique, we were able to unambiguously detect the dielectric resonance of lactose in the diffused scattering geometries. Finally we will discuss the limitation of the new proposed technique in spectral identification of chemicals.",Prevalence of intimate partner violence against women in Sweden and Spain: A psychometric study of the 'Nordic paradox'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095614,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The high prevalence of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) in countries with high levels of gender equality has been defined as the ""Nordic paradox"". In this study we compared physical and sexual IPVAW prevalence data in two countries exemplifying the Nordic paradox: Sweden (N = 1483) and Spain (N = 1447). Data was drawn from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights Survey on violence against women. To ascertain whether differences between these two countries reflect true differences in IPVAW prevalence, and to rule out the possibility of measurement bias, we conducted a set of analyses to ensure measurement equivalence, a precondition for appropriate and valid cross-cultural comparisons. Results showed that in both countries items were measuring two separate constructs, physical and sexual IPVAW, and that these factors had high internal consistency and adequate validity. Measurement equivalence analyses (i.e., differential item functioning, and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis) supported the comparability of data across countries. Latent means comparisons between the Spanish and the Swedish samples showed that scores on both the physical and sexual IPVAW factors were significantly higher in Sweden than in Spain. The effect sizes of these differences were large: 89.1% of the Swedish sample had higher values in the physical IPVAW factor than the Spanish average, and this percentage was 99.4% for the sexual IPVAW factor as compared to the Spanish average. In terms of probability of superiority, there was an 80.7% and 96.1% probability that a Swedish woman would score higher than a Spanish woman in the physical and the sexual IPVAW factors, respectively. Our results showed that the higher prevalence of physical and sexual IPVAW in Sweden than in Spain reflects actual differences and are not the result of measurement bias, supporting the idea of the Nordic paradox.",Impairing the maintenance of germinative cells in Echinococcus multilocularis by targeting Aurora kinase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095613,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 06 10,"The tumor-like growth of the metacestode larvae of the tapeworm E. multilocularis causes human alveolar echinococcosis, a severe disease mainly affecting the liver.

To this end, we extracted single lines from German poems that all include a word designating high or low dominance, such as large or small, strong or weak, etc. Based on insights from previous studies, we expected to find more vowels with a relatively short distance between the first two formants (low formant dispersion) in the immediate context of words expressing high physical or social dominance than in the context of words expressing low dominance. Our findings support this hypothesis, suggesting that neighboring words can form iconic dyads in which the meaning of one word is sound-iconically reflected in the phonetic properties of adjacent words.

Their combinatorial interplay in higher organisms maintains homeostasis and governs cell identity by finely controlling and regulating tissue-specific gene expression. Despite the rich literature on the importance of cooperative TFs for deciphering the mechanisms of individual regulatory programs that control tissue specificity in several organisms such as human, mouse, or Drosophila melanogaster, to date, there is still need for a comprehensive study to detect specific TF cooperations in regulatory processes of cattle tissues. To address the needs of knowledge about specific combinatorial gene regulation in cattle tissues, we made use of three publicly available RNA-seq datasets and obtained tissue-specific gene (TSG) sets for ten tissues (heart, lung, liver, kidney, duodenum, muscle tissue, adipose tissue, colon, spleen and testis). By analyzing these TSG-sets, tissue-specific TF cooperations of each tissue have been identified. The results reveal that similar to the combinatorial regulatory events of model organisms, TFs change their partners depending on their biological functions in different tissues. Particularly with regard to preferential partner choice of the transcription factors STAT3 and NR2C2, this phenomenon has been highlighted with their five different specific cooperation partners in multiple tissues. The information about cooperative TFs could be promising: i) to understand the molecular mechanisms of regulating processes; and ii) to extend the existing knowledge on the importance of single TFs in cattle tissues.",Intermediate-onset colorectal cancer: A clinical and familial boundary between both early and late-onset colorectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095598,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Comparative studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) according to the age of onset have found differences between early-onset CRC (EOCRC) and late-onset CRC (LOCRC).

We performed a retrospective comparative study of the clinicopathological and familial features, as well as of the symptoms and their duration, of a total of 272 subjects diagnosed with CRC classified into three groups according to the age-of-onset (98 EOCRC, 83 IOCRC and 91 LOCRC). The results show that from a clinicopathological point of view, IOCRC shared certain features with EOCRC (gender, prognosis), and with LOCRC (multiple primary CRCs), whereas it also had characteristics that were specific for IOCRC (mean number of associated polyps). A gradual progression was observed from EOCRC to LOCRC from a greater family aggregation to sporadic cases, in parallel with a change of Lynch Syndrome cases to the sporadic microsatellite instability pathway, with the IOCRC being a boundary group that is more related to EOCRC. With respect to symptoms, duration and correlation with stages, IOCRC appeared more similar to EOCRC. Clinically, IOCRC behaves as a transitional group between EOCRC and LOCRC, with features in common with both groups, but also with IOCRC-specific features.

By design, approximately half were active smokers and the rest were never smokers. Our analyses demonstrated that IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 were significantly stimulated as a function of urinary arsenic levels in models adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status and PAH-DNA adducts. After correcting for false detection rate (FDR), only IL-1b remained statistically significant. We found a U-shaped dose response relationship between urinary arsenic and IL-1b. On the other hand, PAH-DNA adducts were associated with an inhibition of TCP and appeared as an inverted U-shape curve. Dose response curves were non-monotonic for PAH-DNA adduct exposures and suggested that cytokine secretion of IFNg, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-10 and IL17A followed a complex pattern. In the majority of donors, there was a trend towards a decrease in cytokine associated with PAH-DNA adducts. We did not observe any interaction between urinary arsenic and PAH-DNA adducts on immune parameters. Our results indicate that long-term exposures to arsenic and PAH have independent, non-monotonic associations with TCP and cytokine production.",Mueller-matrix-based polarization imaging and quantitative assessment of optically anisotropic polycrystalline networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095594,PloS one,2019 06 10,We introduce a Mueller-matrix imaging polarization-based approach for the quantitative digital screening of the polycrystalline structure of fibrillary-based biological tissues in vitro. The morphometric evaluation of histological sections of myocardium was performed utilizing the high-order statistical moments calculated based on the spatial distribution of linear and circular birefringence and dichroism obtained experimentally. We demonstrate that spatial distributions of phase of light and optical anisotropy of scattering inherent to fibrillar networks of myocardium at different necrotic stages can be effectively used as a quantitative marker of stages of myosin fibril degradation. Processing the images of phase of light scattered in biological tissues with high order statistical analysis provides a functional tool for the quantitative characterization of necrotic conditions of the myocardium.,Retrospective analysis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis management and outcome at a tertiary care hospital in the UK.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095593,PloS one,2019 06 10,"This study aimed to analyse retrospectively management and outcomes of the diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFOM) multi-disciplinary team at St Thomas' Hospital, London.",Exposure to outdoor air pollution and its human health outcomes: A scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095592,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Despite considerable air pollution prevention and control measures that have been put into practice in recent years, outdoor air pollution remains one of the most important risk factors for health outcomes. To identify the potential research gaps, we conducted a scoping review focused on health outcomes affected by outdoor air pollution across the broad research area. Of the 5759 potentially relevant studies, 799 were included in the final analysis. The included studies showed an increasing publication trend from 1992 to 2008, and most of the studies were conducted in Asia, Europe, and North America. Among the eight categorized health outcomes, asthma (category: respiratory diseases) and mortality (category: health records) were the most common ones. Adverse health outcomes involving respiratory diseases among children accounted for the largest group. Out of the total included studies, 95.2% reported at least one statistically positive result, and only 0.4% showed ambiguous results. Based on our study, we suggest that the time frame of the included studies, their disease definitions, and the measurement of personal exposure to outdoor air pollution should be taken into consideration in any future research. The main limitation of this study is its potential language bias, since only English publications were included. In conclusion, this scoping review provides researchers and policy decision makers with evidence taken from multiple disciplines to show the increasing prevalence of outdoor air pollution and its adverse effects on health outcomes.",A robust Pearson correlation test for a general point null using a surrogate bootstrap distribution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095591,PloS one,2019 06 10,"In this note we present a robust bootstrap test with good Type I error control for testing the general hypothesis H0: ρ = ρ0.

We show that the bootstrap based test is robust to a variety of distributional scenarios in terms of proper Type I error control.",Changes in patient satisfaction related to their perceived health state during implementation of improved integrated care for older persons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095590,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Patient satisfaction with the general practitioner (GP) is lower in older persons with a higher level of complexity of health problems. This study investigates whether, in these older persons, changes in satisfaction with their GP, on receiving improved integrated care, is related to their perceived health state.Using the Integrated Systematic Care for Older People (ISCOPE) trial (aimed at improving person- centered integrated care) this study compared changes in satisfaction with the GP in older persons (aged ≥75 years) with a high level of complex health problems on receiving integrated care, stratified for perceived health state at baseline. Satisfaction with the GP was registered on a 5-point Likert scale. Perceived health state was estimated with the Older Persons and Informal Caregivers Survey-Composite End Point (TOPICS-CEP) at baseline, stratified into 33% percentiles. Differences in satisfaction change between the intervention and usual care/control groups (overall and stratified for perceived health state) are presented by percentages of 'very satisfied' participants and improving or deteriorating 1 or more points on the Likert scale. At baseline, the intervention (n = 151) and control group (n = 603) were mainly female (75%) and living alone (62%); mean age was 83 years. Medical status, perceived health state and characteristics of participants were similar. Overall, at baseline 44.4% of respondents in the intervention group were 'very satisfied' compared with 37.1% at follow-up, (difference -7.3%). In the control group, 'very satisfied' at baseline was 32% and at follow up 29.2% (difference -2.8%). The p-value for this difference in change is 0.56. After stratification for TOPICS-CEP the results were the same.

Understanding online human behavior and its relevance beyond the digital boundaries is still an open challenge. Here we show that online social interactions during a massive voting event can be used to build an accurate map of real-world political parties and electoral ranks for Italian elections in 2018. We provide evidence that information flow and collective attention are often driven by a special class of highly influential users, that we name ""augmented humans"", who exploit thousands of automated agents, also known as bots, for enhancing their online influence. We show that augmented humans generate deep information cascades, to the same extent of news media and other broadcasters, while they uniformly infiltrate across the full range of identified groups. Digital augmentation represents the cyber-physical counterpart of the human desire to acquire power within social systems."

Culturally, it is defined by the Late Middle Paleolithic succession, and by Early Upper Paleolithic complexes like the Châtelperronian (southwestern Europe), the Protoaurignacian, and the Early Aurignacian. Up to now, the southern boundary for the transition has been established as being situated between France and Iberia, in the Cantabrian façade and Pyrenees. According to this, the central and southern territories of Iberia are claimed to have been the refuge of the last Neanderthals for some additional millennia after they were replaced by anatomically Modern Humans on the rest of the continent. In this paper, we present the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition sequence from Cova Foradada (Tarragona), a cave on the Catalan Mediterranean coastline. Archaeological research has documented a stratigraphic sequence containing a succession of very short-term occupations pertaining to the Châtelperronian, Early Aurignacian, and Gravettian. Cova Foradada therefore represents the southernmost Châtelperronian-Early Aurignacian sequence ever documented in Europe, significantly enlarging the territorial distribution of both cultures and providing an important geographical and chronological reference for understanding Neanderthal disappearance and the complete expansion of anatomically Modern Humans.","OTOF mutation analysis with massively parallel DNA sequencing in 2,265 Japanese sensorineural hearing loss patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095577,PloS one,2019 06 10,"The OTOF gene (Locus: DFNB9), encoding otoferlin, is reported to be one of the major causes of non-syndromic recessive sensorineural hearing loss, and is also reported to be the most common cause of non-syndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD). In the present study, we performed OTOF mutation analysis using massively parallel DNA sequencing (MPS). The purpose of this study was to reveal the frequency and precise genetic and clinical background of OTOF-related hearing loss in a large hearing loss population. A total of 2,265 Japanese sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) patients compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance (including sporadic cases) from 53 otorhinolaryngology departments nationwide participated in this study. The mutation analysis of 68 genes, including the OTOF gene, reported to cause non-syndromic hearing loss was performed using MPS. Thirty-nine out of the 2,265 patients (1.72%) carried homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the OTOF gene. It is assumed that the frequency of hearing loss associated with OTOF mutations is about 1.72% of autosomal recessive or sporadic SNHL cases. Hearing level information was available for 32 of 39 patients with biallelic OTOF mutations; 24 of them (75.0%) showed profound hearing loss, 7 (21.9%) showed severe hearing loss and 1 (3.1%) showed mild hearing loss. The hearing level of patients with biallelic OTOF mutations in this study was mostly severe to profound, which is consistent with the results of past reports. Eleven of the 39 patients with biallelic OTOF mutations had been diagnosed with ANSD. The genetic diagnosis of OTOF mutations has significant benefits in terms of clinical decision-making. Patients with OTOF mutations would be good candidates for cochlear implantation; therefore, the detection of OTOF mutations is quite beneficial for patients, especially for those with ANSD.",Injection of cocaine is associated with a recent HIV outbreak in people who inject drugs in Luxembourg.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095576,PloS one,2019 06 10,An outbreak of HIV infections among people who inject drugs (PWID) started in 2014 in Luxembourg.,The bacterial communities of the small intestine and stool in children with short bowel syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095575,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Short bowel syndrome (SBS) presents an increasing problem in pediatrics. SBS often results from surgical resection of necrotic bowel following necrotizing enterocolitis or treatment of anatomic gastrointestinal defects. SBS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and creates substantial burdens for patients, families, and the health system. Recent reports have demonstrated that the fecal microbiome of children with SBS is significantly different from healthy control and severe intestinal microbial imbalances is associated with poor growth. We hypothesized that children with SBS and adverse clinical features such as PN dependent, shorter bowel length and lack of ileocecal valve would demonstrate more gut dysbiosis compare with the SBS non-PN dependent. An improved understanding of SBS pathogenesis would enhance management and potentially suggest new interventions. We studied microbial communities of SBS and control non-SBS patients from the jejunum, obtained endoscopically or by ostomy aspiration, and stool. We enrolled SBS patients who did and did not require parenteral nutrition (PN), as a surrogate marker for the seriousness of their disease. We studied the microbiota using high-throughput DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and statistical analyses. We found that microbial diversity was significantly greater in jejunal aspirate than in stool samples in SBS patients, unlike non-SBS patients; that SBS patients receiving enteral feeds had greater diversity, and that SBS patients on PN and enteral feeds had lower differences in diversity in jejunal vs. stool samples. We found a trend toward increased diversity in patients with an intact ileocecal valve, and found that certain taxa were more abundant in the certain sample types, and in SBS patients vs. non-SBS patients. SBS patients have lower microbial diversity, especially patients with more severe disease, patients requiring PN, and those lacking an ileocecal valve. SBS patients, particularly those with more complex characteristics, exhibit differences in their intestinal microbiota. Particular individual taxa were over- and under-represented in patients with more unfavorable disease. While diminished diversity and alterations in microbiota composition are likely consequences of SBS, future efforts aimed at increasing microbial diversity and interventions targeting specific microbiota characteristics might constitute a testable approach to ameliorate some clinical SBS clinical consequences.",Factors influencing wild chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) relative abundance in an agriculture-swamp matrix outside protected areas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095574,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Human population growth and anthropogenic activities are exacerbating pressures on biodiversity globally. Land conversion is aggravating habitat fragmentation and non-human primates are increasingly compelled to live in forest-agricultural mosaics. In Sierra Leone, more than half of the wild chimpanzee population (Pan troglodytes verus) occurs outside protected areas and competes for resources with farmers. Our study area, in the Moyamba district in south-western Sierra Leone, is practically devoid of forest and is dominated by cultivated and fallow fields, swamps and mangroves. In this region, traditional slash-and-burn agriculture modifies annually the landscape, sparing swamps and mangroves and semi-domesticated oil palms (Elaeis guineensis). This study aimed to explore ecological and anthropogenic factors influencing chimpanzee relative abundance across this highly degraded and human-impacted landscape. Between 2015 and 2016, we deployed 24 camera traps systematically across 27 1.25x1.25 km grid cells. Cameras were operational over a period of 8 months. We used binomial iCAR models to examine to what extent anthropogenic (roads, settlements, abandoned settlements and human presence) and habitat variables (swamps, farmland and mangroves) shape chimpanzee relative abundance. The best model explained 43.16% of the variation with distance to roads and swamps emerging as the best predictors of chimpanzee relative abundance. Our results suggest that chimpanzees avoid roads and prefer to maintain proximity to swamps. There was no significant effect of settlements, abandoned settlements, mangroves or human presence. It appears that chimpanzees do not avoid areas frequented by people; although, our findings suggest temporal avoidance between the two species. We highlight the importance of studying chimpanzee populations living in anthropogenic habitats like agricultural-swamp matrixes to better understand factors influencing their distribution and inform conservation planning outside protected areas.",Cervical and systemic concentrations of long acting hormonal contraceptive (LARC) progestins depend on delivery method: Implications for the study of HIV transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095572,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Progestin-only long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are increasingly popular among women seeking contraception; however, recent epidemiological studies suggest that systemically administered medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) may increase HIV acquisition. In order to determine the exact mechanisms underlying increases in transmission specific to MPA use and to test safer, alternative contraceptive progestin types and delivery methods, in vitro modeling studies must be performed. To achieve this, it is imperative that accurate hormone concentrations be utilized when modeling progestin-mediated outcomes, as the down-stream effects are dose-dependent. The local concentrations of progestins to which the lower female genital tract tissues are exposed after initiation of LARCs are unknown, but they likely differ from peripheral concentrations, dependent upon the progestin type and delivery method. Here, we measured in vivo endocervical and plasma concentrations of (1) systemically-delivered depo MPA (DMPA), (2) levonorgestrel (LNG) delivered via intrauterine system (IUS) and (3) etonogestrel (ETG) delivered via vaginal ring in women who recently initiated contraception treatment. Levels of ETG and LNG in cervical secretions were 100-200 fold higher than plasma levels. In contrast, measurable MPA levels were approximately 10-fold higher in plasma compared to cervical secretions. These results will inform the design of accurate in vitro studies on the influence of progestins on epithelial cells, tissue explants, and peripheral blood cells, to be able to better predict in vivo outcomes. Subsequent observations will aid in determining how MPA might influence HIV acquisition and may facilitate identification of optimal progestin-containing LARC alternatives for women at high risk for HIV infection.",Predicting and containing epidemic risk using on-line friendship networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095571,PloS one,2019 06 10,"To what extent can online social networks predict who is at risk of an infection? Many infections are transmitted through physical encounter between humans, but collecting detailed information about it can be expensive, might invade privacy, or might not even be possible. In this paper, we ask whether online social networks help predict and contain epidemic risk. Using a dataset from a popular online review service which includes over 100 thousand users and spans 4 years of activity, we build a time-varying network that is a proxy of physical encounter between its users (the encounter network) and a static network based on their reported online friendship (the friendship With computer simulations, we compare stochastic infection processes on the two networks, considering infections on the encounter network as the benchmark. First, we show that the friendship network is useful to identify the individuals at risk of infection, despite providing lower accuracy than the ideal case in which the encounters are known. This limited prediction accuracy is not only due to the static nature of the friendship network because a static version of the encounter network provides more accurate prediction of risk than the friendship network. Then, we show that periodical monitoring of the infection spreading on the encounter network allows to correct the infection predicted by a process spreading on the friendly staff ndship network, and achieves high prediction accuracy. Finally, we show that the friendship network contains valuable information to effectively contain epidemic outbreaks even when a limited budget is available for immunization. In particular, a strategy that immunizes random friends of random individuals achieves the same performance as knowing individuals' encounters at a small additional cost, even if the infection spreads on the encounter network.",Imported strongyloidiasis: Data from 1245 cases registered in the +REDIVI Spanish Collaborative Network (2009-2017).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095570,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 06 10,"Imported strongyloidiasis is increasingly being diagnosed in non-endemic areas.

By tailoring drug choice to infection genotype, doctors can improve treatment efficacy while limiting costs of inappropriate antibiotic prescription. Here, we combine epidemiological theory and data to assess the potential of resistance diagnostics (RD) innovations in a public health context, as a means to limit or even reverse selection for antibiotic resistance. POC-RD can be used to impose a nonbiological fitness cost on resistant strains by enabling diagnostic-informed treatment and targeted interventions that reduce resistant strains' opportunities for transmission. We assess this diagnostic-imposed fitness cost in the context of a spectrum of bacterial population biologies and find that POC-RD have a greater potential against obligate pathogens than opportunistic pathogens already subject to selection under ""bystander"" antibiotic exposure during asymptomatic carriage (e.g., the pneumococcus). We close by generalizing the notion of RD-informed strategies to incorporate carriage surveillance information and illustrate that coupling transmission-control interventions to the discovery of resistant strains in carriage can potentially select against resistance in a broad range of opportunistic pathogens."

How the various inhibitory cell types contribute to neuronal information processing, however, is not resolved. Here, we propose a functional role for a widespread network motif consisting of parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. Following the idea that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, we suggest that mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells translates weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes of somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we show that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled.",Evolution of major histocompatibility complex gene copy number.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095555,PLoS computational biology,2019 06 10,"MHC genes, which code for proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, show remarkable copy-number variation both between and within species. However, the evolutionary forces driving this variation are poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate whether evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome can be shaped by the number of pathogen species the host population encounters (pathogen richness). Our model assumed that while increasing a range of pathogens recognised, expressing additional MHC variants also incurs costs such as an increased risk of autoimmunity. We found that pathogen richness selected for high MHC copy number only when the costs were low. Furthermore, the shape of the association was modified by the rate of pathogen evolution, with faster pathogen mutation rates selecting for increased host MHC copy number, but only when pathogen richness was low to moderate. Thus, taking into account factors other than pathogen richness may help explain wide variation between vertebrate species in the number of MHC genes. Within population, variation in the number of unique MHC variants carried by individuals (INV) was observed under most parameter combinations, except at low pathogen richness. This variance gave rise to positive correlations between INV and host immunocompetence (proportion of pathogens recognised). However, within-population variation in host immunocompetence declined with pathogen richness. Thus, counterintuitively, pathogens can contribute more to genetic variance for host fitness in species exposed to fewer pathogen species, with consequences to predictions from ""Hamilton-Zuk"" theory of sexual selection.",Securing the future of research computing in the biosciences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095554,PLoS computational biology,2019 06 10,"Improvements in technology often drive scientific discovery. Therefore, research requires sustained investment in the latest equipment and training for the researchers who are going to use it. Prioritising and administering infrastructure investment is challenging because future needs are difficult to predict. In the past, highly computationally demanding research was associated primarily with particle physics and astronomy experiments. However, as biology becomes more quantitative and bioscientists generate more and more data, their computational requirements may ultimately exceed those of physical scientists. Computation has always been central to bioinformatics, but now imaging experiments have rapidly growing data processing and storage requirements. There is also an urgent need for new modelling and simulation tools to provide insight and understanding of these biophysical experiments. Bioscience communities must work together to provide the software and skills training needed in their areas. Research-active institutions need to recognise that computation is now vital in many more areas of discovery and create an environment where it can be embraced.

This property is reflected at the cellular level by the ability to generate action potentials in two distinct firing modes, called tonic firing and low-threshold bursting. Although the general properties of TC neurons are known, we still lack a detailed characterization of their morphological and electrical properties in the VB thalamus. The aim of this study was to build biophysically-detailed models of VB TC neurons explicitly constrained with experimental data from rats. We recorded the electrical activity of VB neurons (N = 49) and reconstructed morphologies in 3D (N = 50) by applying standardized protocols. After identifying distinct electrical types, we used a multi-objective optimization to fit single neuron electrical models (e-models), which yielded multiple solutions consistent with the experimental data. The models were tested for generalization using electrical stimuli and neuron morphologies not used during fitting. A local sensitivity analysis revealed that the e-models are robust to small parameter changes and that all the parameters were constrained by one or more features. The e-models, when tested in combination with different morphologies, showed that the electrical behavior is substantially preserved when changing dendritic structure and that the e-models were not overfit to a specific morphology. The models and their analysis show that automatic parameter search can be applied to capture complex firing behavior, such as co-existence of tonic firing and low-threshold bursting over a wide range of parameter sets and in combination with different neuron morphologies.",Developing New Zealand's medical workforce: realising the potential of longitudinal career tracking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095546,The New Zealand medical journal,2019 05 16,"For over a decade, the Medical Schools Outcomes Database and Longitudinal Tracking Project (MSOD) has collected data from medical students in Australia and New Zealand.

Environmental bacteria or toxic disinfection by-product (DBP) compounds may indeed be recovered in waters even after disinfection. We evaluated the water quality from 26 outdoor seasonal SPs of the Versilia district, according to requirements of Regional Decree 54R/2015. In spring 2017, supply and reinstatement waters were collected after shock hyperchlorination (10 mg/L) while in summertime, a second sampling of waters before entering the pools, as well as in the pools, was performed after SPs were open to the public. In all samples, microbiological and chemical parameters were determined as defined by Directive 98/83/EC and the Italian Health Ministry. Microbiological data were within suggested limits. The first chemical analyses showed that in 35% of the feeding-pool seawater samples, the halogenated organic compounds were higher than the maximum permissible concentrations (30 μg/L). Pool waters were then dechlorinated and re-treated with hydrogen peroxide (10 mg/L) to ensure the abatement of DBPs (from 164 ± 107 to 0.9 ± 0.8 μg/L; p = 0.002). Results highlighted the need of self-controlled procedures for the SPs waters to prevent waterborne diseases and suggested hydrogen peroxide as the most appropriate disinfection method.","Occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals in raw, finished, and drinking water from seven large river basins in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095522,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the drinking water is a growing concern in China. In this study, we determined the concentration and distribution of 59 selected pharmaceuticals in raw, finished, and tap water samples from 79 drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) in 15 cities, encompassing seven large river basins in China, using solid-phase extraction pretreatment and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Forty-seven pharmaceuticals were detected in raw water samples, with detection rates of 1.27-96.20% and average concentrations of 0.09-128.87 ng/L. Forty-three pharmaceuticals were detected in finished water samples, with detection rates of 1.27-96.20% and average concentrations of 0.07-59.17 ng/L. Forty-two pharmaceuticals were detected in tap water samples, with detection rates of 1.27-94.94% and average concentrations of 0.07-58.43 ng/L. Purification methods implemented by DWTPs are capable of removing some pharmaceuticals from water treatment systems; however, low concentrations of pharmaceuticals were detected in drinking water, raising concerns about the possible human health implications of long-term exposure to low-dose pharmaceuticals. The detection and quantification of pharmaceuticals in municipal water samples presented in this study represent the most extensive analysis of commonly used pharmaceuticals and personal care products located in Chinese river basins.",Emerging pathogens and deliberate attacks on European water supplies: a scenario planning workshop.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095521,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"Microbiological contamination of drinking water supplies is an ever-present concern for water utility managers. Most such threats are routine, well-recognised and described. Therefore, they can usually be prevented using standard protection measures. Incidents involving emerging pathogens and malicious attacks are inherently less predictable. In a multi-stage process over one day, participants with backgrounds in microbiology, medicine, infrastructure, data analysis, environmental or public health and facility management developed qualitative scenarios on potential threats posed by either an emergent pathogen in or a microbiological attack on drinking water supplies in a European country. Participants were guided via structured activities to identify key factors that would impact the magnitude and severity of such an emergency. Plausible variant states for each key factor were determined, and participants constructed sequences of events to create scenario outlines. Five scenarios in outline form are reported which incorporate genuine possible future events as well as pathogens of international concern. Common features that would exacerbate all scenarios were under-investment in public services, inadequate water quality testing, and monitoring and lack of resources to keep water supplies safe. Participant evaluation of their scenario planning experience was broadly very positive and the scenario planning process was received as credible and relevant.",Toward a comprehensive explanatory model of reliance on alternatives to the tap: evidence from California's retail water stores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095520,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"Building on a recent increase in scholarly attention to the problem of tap water mistrust and resulting negative health impacts, we examine the relationship between neighborhood reliance on tap water alternatives and a range of explanatory factors. We model retail water store locations as a proxy for reliance on tap water alternatives in urbanized neighborhoods across California. Our study is unique in its inclusion of variables representing both compliance with primary and secondary water quality standards by publicly regulated drinking water systems serving particular neighborhoods, other water system attributes and the socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods. The location of retail water stores in urbanized neighborhoods does not appear strongly related to observed measures of water quality. Secondary contamination shows a weak relationship to tap alternative reliance, and primary contamination was not correlated with higher levels of tap alternative reliance. On the other hand, our research suggests that other socioeconomic factors, particularly country of birth, are associated with the prevalence of more water stores. Increasing reliance on tap water likely requires measuring and addressing secondary contamination found in distributional systems and premise plumbing, and more aggressive public education campaigns.","Occurrence of norovirus genogroups I and II in recreational water from four beaches in Belém city, Brazilian Amazon region.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095519,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"This study aimed to investigate the presence of norovirus (NoV) in recreational waters of four estuarine beaches located in Mosqueiro Island, Belém city, Brazilian Amazon, during two years of monitoring (2012 and 2013). NoV particles were concentrated on filtering membrane by the adsorption-elution method and detected by semi-nested RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and sequencing. NoV positivity was observed in 37.5% (39/104) of the surface water samples, with genogroup GI (69.2%) occurring at a higher frequency than GII (25.7%), with a cocirculation of both genogroups in two samples (5.1%). This virus was detected in all sampling points analyzed, showing the highest detection rate at the Paraíso Beach (46.2%). Statistically, there was a dependence relationship between tide levels and positive detection, with a higher frequency at high tide (46.7%) than at low tide (25%) periods. Months with the highest detection rates (April 2012 and April/May 2013) were preceded by periods of higher precipitation (March 2012 and February/March 2013). Phylogenetic analysis showed the circulation of the old pandemic variant (GII.4-US_95-96) and GI.8. The NoV detection demonstrated viral contamination on the beaches and evidenced the health risk to bathers, mainly through recreational activities such as bathing, and highlighted the importance of including enteric viruses research in the recreational water quality monitoring.",Variations in sensitivity to chlorine in Ecuador and US consumers: implications for community water systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095518,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"Successful implementation of chlorination for disinfecting community water systems in developing countries faces obstacles, with rejection of chlorinous flavor as a significant factor. Determining consumers' abilities to accurately detect chlorine in treated water is important to identifying acceptable chlorination levels that are also effective for water disinfection. Chlorine detection sensitivity was tested in untrained Ecuadorian consumers with limited prior experience with chlorinated water and US consumers with extensive prior experience with chlorinated water. Water samples with free chlorine concentrations up to 3.0 mg/L were presented for flavor testing. Ecuadorian consumers showed higher sensitivity, being able to detect chlorination at 2.0 and 3.0 mg/L, while US consumers did not reliably detect chlorine presence for any concentration levels. Additionally, Ecuadorian consumers' rejection of water samples depended on chlorination, showing a statistically significant increase in rejections of samples with chlorine concentrations above 1.0 mg/L. On the other hand, although US consumers rejected more samples overall, their tendency to reject did not vary as a function of chlorination levels. This study demonstrated that limited experience with chlorination is a critical factor for accurate chlorine flavor detection in drinking water.",Finding Sarcocystis spp. on the Tioman Island: 28S rRNA gene next-generation sequencing reveals nine new Sarcocystis species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095517,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"The Tioman Island of Malaysia experienced acute muscular sarcocystosis outbreaks from 2011 to 2014. So far, a previous study based on the 18S rRNA gene sequencing has reported S. singaporensis, S. nesbitti and Sarcocystis sp. YLL-2013 in water samples acquired from the island, thus confirming the waterborne nature of this emerging parasitic disease. This study aimed to improve the detection methods for Sarcocystis, in order to have a clearer picture of the true diversity of Sarcocystis species in Tioman. A new primer set (28S R7F-28S R8 Deg R) was designed to amplify the 28S rRNA gene of Sarcocystis. Subsequently, Sarcocystidae was detected in 65.6% (21/32) of water samples and 28% (7/25) of soil samples acquired between 2014 and 2015 from Tioman. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) on 18 of the positive samples was then performed using amplicons generated from the same primer set. This yielded 53 potentially unique Sarcocystidae sequences (290 bp), of which nine of the most abundant, prevalent and unique sequences were named herein. In contrast, NGS of the 18S rRNA gene V9 hypervariable region of 10 selected samples detected only two Sarcocystis species (160 bp). S. mantioni was the most ubiquitous sequence found in this study.",Sign-constrained linear regression for prediction of microbe concentration based on water quality datasets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095516,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"This study presents a novel methodology for estimating the concentration of environmental pollutants in water, such as pathogens, based on environmental parameters. The scientific uniqueness of this study is the prevention of excess conformity in the model fitting by applying domain knowledge, which is the accumulated scientific knowledge regarding the correlations between response and explanatory variables. Sign constraints were used to express domain knowledge, and the effect of the sign constraints on the prediction performance using censored datasets was investigated. As a result, we confirmed that sign constraints made prediction more accurate compared to conventional sign-free approaches. The most remarkable technical contribution of this study is the finding that the sign constraints can be incorporated in the estimation of the correlation coefficient in Tobit analysis. We developed effective and numerically stable algorithms for fitting a model to datasets under the sign constraints. This novel algorithm is applicable to a wide variety of the prediction of pollutant contamination level, including the pathogen concentrations in water.",Application of high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing to identify fecal contamination sources and to complement the detection of fecal indicator bacteria in rural groundwater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095515,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"Residents in rural communities across Canada collect potable water from aquifers. Fecal contaminants from sewage and agricultural runoffs can penetrate aquifers, posing a public health risk. Standard methods for detecting fecal contamination test for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), but the presence of these do not identify sources of contamination. In contrast, DNA-based diagnostic tools can achieve this important objective. We employed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and high-throughput DNA sequencing to trace fecal contamination sources in Wainfleet, a rural Ontario township that has been under the longest active boil water advisory in Canada due to FIB contamination in groundwater wells. Using traditional methods, we identified FIBs indicating persistent fecal pollution in well waters. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to profile groundwater microbial communities and identified Campylobacteraceae as a fecal contamination DNA marker in septic tank effluents (STEs). We also identified Turicibacter and Gallicola as a potential cow and chicken fecal contamination marker, respectively. Using human specific Bacteroidales markers, we identified leaking septic tanks as the likely primary fecal contamination source in some of Wainfleet's groundwater. Overall, the results support the use of sequencing-based methods to augment traditional water quality testing methods and help end-users assess fecal contamination levels and identify point and non-point pollution sources.",Virulence determinants in genetically heterogeneous populations of Aeromonads recovered from an urban lagoon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095514,Journal of water and health,2019 05 16,"The diversity and distribution of Aeromonas spp. associated with virulence profiles from the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon were investigated using phylogenetic analysis of gyrB/rpoB gene sequences for speciation. The concatenated gyrB/rpoB gene sequences clustered into five species: Aeromonas punctata/caviae (n = 37), A. hydrophila (n = 10), A. dhakensis (n = 16), A. jandaei (n = 1) and A. enteropelogenes/trota (n = 3). The virulence genes (atc/aerA/hlyA/asp/amp) resulted in 19 virulence profiles, distributed heterogeneously among the five Aeromonas species. Out of the 67 isolates, 16% presented five distinct profiles carrying four virulence genes and 7% showed all genes investigated. The hemolytic genes were detected as follows: act 54% (37/67), aerA 36% (24/67), hlyA 26% (18/67) and proteolytic genes such as asp 36% (24/57) and amp in 85% (57/67) were widely distributed in lagoon sampling stations. Meanwhile, 88% (59/67) and 92% (62/67) of the isolates showed hemolytic and proteolytic activity, respectively. Our results demonstrated that concatenated sequences of the gyrB and rpoB genes showed to be an adequate approach for the Aeromonas speciation and prevalence. The high heterogeneity of virulence genes among the species resulted in several virulence profiles, as well as high percentages of hemolytic and proteolytic activity, demonstrating the necessity of further epidemiological surveys of Aeromonas species pathogenicity in an aquatic recreational lagoon."

Such a network represents a family of scaled log-sum exponential functions, here named log-sum-exp (LSET). Under a suitable exponential transformation, the class of LSET functions maps to a family of generalized posynomials GPOST, which we similarly show to be universal approximators for log-log-convex functions. A key feature of an LSET network is that, once it is trained on data, the resulting model is convex in the variables, which makes it readily amenable to efficient design based on convex optimization. Similarly, once a GPOST model is trained on data, it yields a posynomial model that can be efficiently optimized with respect to its variables by using geometric programming (GP). The proposed methodology is illustrated by two numerical examples, in which, first, models are constructed from simulation data of the two physical processes (namely, the level of vibration in a vehicle suspension system, and the peak power generated by the combustion of propane), and then optimization-based design is performed on these models.",Resonant Frequency Skin Stretch for Wearable Haptics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095499,IEEE transactions on haptics,2019 05 20,"Resonant frequency skin stretch uses cyclic lateral skin stretches matching the skin's resonant frequency to create highly noticeable stimuli, signifying a new approach for wearable haptic stimulation. Three experiments were performed to explore biomechanical and perceptual aspects of resonant frequency skin stretch. In the first experiment, effective skin resonant frequencies were quantified at the forearm, shank, and foot. In the second experiment, perceived haptic stimuli were characterized for skin stretch actuations across a spectrum of frequencies. In the third experiment, haptic classification ability was determined as subjects differentiated haptic stimulation cues while sitting, walking, and jogging. Results showed that subjects perceived stimulations at, above, and below the skin's resonant frequency differently: stimulations lower than the skin resonant frequency felt like distinct impacts, stimulations at the skin resonant frequency felt like cyclic skin stretches, and stimulations higher than the skin resonant frequency felt like standard vibrations. Subjects successfully classified stimulations while sitting, walking, and jogging, and classification accuracy decreased with increasing speed, especially for stimulations at the shank. This work could facilitate more widespread use of wearable skin stretch. Potential applications include gaming, medical simulation, and surgical augmentation, and for training to reduce injury risk or improve sports performance.",Discriminative Ratio of Spectral Power and Relative Power Features Derived via Frequency-Domain Model Ratio (FDMR) with Application to Seizure Prediction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095498,IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,2019 05 20,"The ratio of spectral power in two different bands and relative band power have been shown to be sometimes more discriminative features than the spectral power in a specific band for binary classification of a time-series for seizure prediction. Using auto-regressive modeling, this paper, for the first time, theoretically explains that, for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases, the ratio features may sometimes amplify the discriminability of one of the two states in a time-series as compared to a band power. This paper, also for the first time, introduces a novel frequency-domain model ratio (FDMR) that can be used to select the two frequency bands. The FDMR computes the ratio of the frequency responses of the two auto-regressive model filters that correspond to two different states. It is shown that the ratio implicitly cancels the effect of change of variance of the white noise that is input to the auto-regressive model in a non-stationary environment for high SNR conditions. It is also shown that under certain sufficient but not necessary conditions the ratio of spectral power and the relative band power can be better discriminators than band power.",A Unified Novel Neural Network Approach and a Prototype Hardware Implementation for Ultra-Low Power EEG Classification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095497,IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,2019 05 16,"This paper introduces a novel electroencephalogram (EEG) data classification scheme together with its implementation in hardware using an innovative approach. The proposed scheme integrates into a single, end-to-end trainable model a spatial filtering technique and a neural network based classifier. The spatial filters, as well as, the coefficients of the neural network classifier are simultaneously estimated during training. By using different time-locked spatial filters, we introduce for the first time the notion of ""attention"" in EEG processing, which allows for the efficient capturing of the temporal dependencies and/ or variability of the EEG sequential data. One of the most important benefits of our approach is that the proposed classifier is able to construct highly discriminative features directly from raw EEG data and, at the same time, to exploit the function approximation properties of neural networks, in order to produce highly accurate classification results. The evaluation of the proposed methodology, using public available EEG datasets, indicates that it outperforms the standard EEG classification approach based on filtering and classification as two separated steps. Moreover, we present a prototype implementation of the proposed scheme in state-of-the-art reconfigurable hardware; our novel implementation outperforms by more than an order of magnitude, in terms of power efficiency, the conventional CPU-based approaches.","Topological metrizations of trees, and new quartet methods of tree inference.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095496,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2019 05 20,"Topological phylogenetic trees can be assigned edge weights in several natural ways, highlighting different aspects of the tree.

Generalizing models that include all those rearrangements while admitting computational tractability are rare. In this paper we study such a rearrangement model, namely the inverse tandem duplication random loss (iTDRL) model, where an iTDRL duplicates and inverts a continuous segment of a gene order followed by the random loss of one of the redundant copies of each gene. The iTDRL rearrangement has currently been proposed by several authors suggesting it to be a possible mechanisms of mitochondrial gene order evolution. We initiate the algorithmic study of this new model of genome rearrangement by proving that a shortest rearrangement scenario that transforms one given gene order into another given gene order can be obtained in quasilinear time. Furthermore, we show that the length of such a scenario, i. e., the minimum number of iTDRLs in the transformation, can be computed in linear time.",Prioritizing type 2 diabetes genes by weighted PageRank on bilayer heterogeneous networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095494,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2019 05 20,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The interacting mixed effects of genetics and environments build possible interpretable pathogenesis. Thus, finding causal diabetes genes is crucial in its clinical diagnosis and medical treatment. Currently, network-based method becomes a powerful tool of systematically analyzing complex diseases, such as the identification of candidate disease genes. In this paper, we propose a bioinformatics framework of prioritizing type 2 diabetes genes by leveraging the modified PageRank algorithm on bilayer biomolecular networks consisting an ensemble gene-gene regulatory network and an integrative protein-protein interaction network. We specifically weigh the networks by differential mutual information for measuring the context specificities between genes and between proteins by transcriptomic and proteomic paired datasets respectively. After formulating the network into two components of known disease genes and the other normal healthy genes, we rank the diabetes genes and others by bringing the orders in the bilayer network via an improved PageRank algorithm. We conclude that these known disease genes achieve significantly higher ranks compared to these random-select normal genes, and the ranks are robust and consistent in multiple validation scenarios. In functional analysis, these high-ranked genes are identified to perform relevant risks and dysfunctions of diabetes.",A Global and Local Enhanced Residual U-Net for Accurate Retinal Vessel Segmentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095493,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2019 05 20,"Retinal vessel segmentation is a critical procedure towards the accurate visualization, diagnosis, early treatment and surgery planning of ocular diseases. Recent deep learning-based approaches have achieved impressive performance in retinal vessel segmentation. However, they usually apply global image pre-processing and take the whole retinal images as input during network training, which have two drawbacks for accurate retinal vessel segmentation. First, these methods lack the utilization of the local patch information. Second, they overlook the geometric constraint that retina only occurs in a specific area within the whole image or the extracted patch. As a consequence, these global-based methods suffer in handling details, such as recognizing the small thin vessels, discriminating the optic disk, etc. To address these drawbacks, this study proposes a Global and Local enhanced residual U-nEt (GLUE) for accurate retinal vessel segmentation, which benefits from both the globally and locally enhanced information inside the retinal region. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which consistently improves the segmentation accuracy over a conventional U-Net and achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art.",LSTM-Based End-to-End Framework for Biomedical Event Extraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095491,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,2019 05 16,"Biomedical event extraction plays an important role in the extraction of biological information from large-scale scientific publications.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an end to-end model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) to optimize biomedical event extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of biomedical event extraction. We achieve average F1-scores of 59.68%, 58.23% and 57.39% on the BioNLP09, BioNLP11 and BioNLP13's Genia event datasets, respectively.

Identification of essential proteins from Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has become a hot topic in recent years. Traditionally biological experimental based approaches are time-consuming and expensive, although lots of computational based methods have been developed in the past years; however, the prediction accuracy is still unsatisfied. In this research, by introducing the protein sub-cellular localization information, we define a new measurement for characterizing the protein's subcellular localization essentiality, and a new data fusion based method is developed for identifying essential proteins, named TEGS, based on integrating network topology, gene expression profile, GO annotation information and protein subcellular localization information. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method TEGS, we evaluate its performance on two Saccharomycescerevisiae datasets and compare with other seven state-of-the-art methods (DC, BC, NC, PeC, WDC, SON and TEO) in terms of true predicted number, jackknife curve and precision-recall curve.

It consists of more than 80k images of 14 scenes combining different facets: CMOS sensor noise, real sampling at four resolution levels, nine scene motion types, two photometric conditions, and lossy video coding at five levels. As such, the database exceeds existing benchmarks by an order of magnitude in quality and quantity. This paper also benchmarks 19 popular single-image and multi-frame algorithms on our data. The benchmark comprises a quantitative study by exploiting ground truth data and qualitative evaluations in a large-scale observer study.

However, field losses due to biotic stresses are currently estimated to be between 10 and 20% worldwide. The risk of resistance and strict pesticide legislation necessitate innovative agronomical practices to adequately protect crops in the future, such as the identification of new substances with novel modes of action. In the present study, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was used to characterize Rheum rhabarbarum root extracts that were primarily composed of the stilbenes rhaponticin, desoxyrhaponticin, and resveratrol. Minor components were the flavonoids catechin, epicatechin gallate, and procyanidin B1. Specific polyphenolic mixtures inhibited mycelial growth of several phytopathogenic fungi and oomycetes. Foliar spray applications with fractions containing stilbenes and flavonoids inhibited spore germination of powdery mildew in Hordeum vulgare with indications of synergistic interactions. Formulated extracts led to a significant reduction in the incidence of brown rust in Triticum aestivum under field conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana mutant and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction studies suggested that the stilbenes induce salicylic acid-mediated resistance. Thus, the identified substances of Rheum roots represent an excellent source of antifungal agents that can be used in horticulture and agriculture.",Extending the Reach of Pediatric Emergency Preparedness: A Virtual Tabletop Exercise Targeting Children's Needs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095469,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2019 05 16,"Virtual tabletop exercises (VTTXs) simulate disaster scenarios to help participants improve their emergency-planning capacity.

We examined whether eccentric training prevents skeletal muscle weakness in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat, a widely used animal model for RA. AIA was induced in the knees of Wistar rats by injection of complete Freund's adjuvant. To induce eccentric contractions (ECCs), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (45 V) was applied to the plantar flexor muscles simultaneously with forced dorsiflexion of the ankle joint (0-40˚) and was given every 6 s. ECC exercise was applied every other day for a total of 11 sessions and consisted of 4 sets of 5 contractions. There was a significant reduction in in vitro maximum Ca2+-activated force in skinned fibers in gastrocnemius muscle from AIA rats. These changes were associated with reduced expression levels of contractile proteins (i.e., myosin and actin), increased levels of inflammation-redox stress-related biomarkers (i.e., TNF-α, malondialdehyde-protein adducts, NADPH oxidase 2, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase), and autolyzed active calpain-1 in AIA muscles. ECC training markedly enhanced the steady-state levels of αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein, and its binding to the myofibrils and prevented the AIA-induced myofibrillar dysfunction, reduction in contractile proteins, and inflammation-oxidative stess insults. Our findings demonstrate that ECC training preserves myofibrillar function without muscle damage in AIA rats, which is at least partially attributable to the protective effect of αB-crystallin on the myofibrils against oxidative stress-mediated protein degeneration. Thus, ECC training can be a safe and effective intervention counteracting the loss of muscle strength in RA patients.",Deep ocean minerals inhibit IL-6 and IGFIIR hypertrophic signalling pathways to attenuate diabetes-induced hypertrophy in rat hearts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095463,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",2019 05 16,"We previously reported that deep sea water (DSW) prolongs the life span of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats by the compensatory augmentation of the insulin like growth factor (IGF)-I survival signalling and inhibition of apoptosis. Here, we investigated the effects of DSW on cardiac hypertrophy in diabetic rats. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in rats by using STZ (65 mg/kg) administered via IP injection. DSW was prepared by mixing DSW mineral extracts and desalinated water. Different dosages of DSW-1X (equivalent to 37 mg Mg2+/kg/day), 2X (equivalent to 74 mg Mg2+/kg/day) and 3X (equivalent to 111 mg Mg2+ mg/kg/day) were administered to the rats through gavages for 4 weeks. Cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by the heart weight to body weight ratio and the cardiac tissue cross-sectional area after haematoxylin and eosin staining. The protein levels of the cardiac hypertrophy signalling molecules were determined by Western blot. Our results showed that the suppressive effects of the DSW treatment on STZ-induced cardiac hypertrophy were comparable to those of MgSO4 administration and that the hypertrophic marker brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was decreased by DSW. In addition, DSW attenuated both the eccentric hypertrophy signalling pathway, IL-6-MEK-STAT3, and the concentric signalling pathway, IGF-II-PKCa-CaMKII, in DM rat hearts. The cardiac hypertrophy associated activation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and the upregulation of the transcription factor GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) were also negated by treatment with DSW. The results from this study suggest that DSW could be a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiac hypertrophy."

Although the critical implications of mitophagy have been emphasized in a variety of neurological disorders, it remains ambiguous how neurons control the quality of axonal mitochondria. By employing an oxygen-glucose-deprivation and reperfusion (OGD-Rep) model in cultured neurons, our recent results clearly documented the prompt recovery of retrograde transport of axonal mitochondria to neuronal soma. Moreover, by selectively labeling axonal mitochondria, we found that these axonal mitochondria appear in neuronal soma and are eliminated via autophagosomes in priority. This mitochondrial movement from axon to soma has a critical contribution to overall neuronal mitophagy under ischemia. Because forced expression of an anchoring protein, SNPH (Syntaphilin), significantly blocks mitophagy, and aggravates mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal injury. Conversely, promoted retrograde mitochondrial movement facilitates neuronal mitophagy and attenuates ischemic neuronal demise. In conclusion, we propose stimulating the somatic autophagy of axonal mitochondria after ischemic insults. These findings may provide further insight into how neurons control the mitochondrial quality in pathological conditions and offer novel strategies to cure neurological disorders.",California Healthy Places Index: Frames Matter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095451,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2019 05 16,"We describe the California Healthy Places Index (HPI) and its performance relative to other indexes for measuring community well-being at the census-tract level.

The molecular method enabled identification of infrequent ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (filamentous and yeasts) and the asexual morph of Byssothecium obiones and Phaeosphaeria halima. The occurrence and ecological role of the most frequent fungi on different S. maritima substrates seem to depend on the phase of plant life cycle, and specifically on the availability and microenvironmental conditions of each plant substrate. Specifically, By. obiones, Natantispora retorquens, and Lulworthia sp. 1 were involved in the decay of lower-middle culms, Buergenerula spartinae of middle culms and leaves, P. halima, Phaeosphaeria spartinicola, and Stagonospora sp. 1 of middle-upper leaves, and Mycosphaerella sp.

However, the effects of capsaicin on osteosarcoma have not been studied extensively. In the current study, we explore the molecular mechanism of capsaicin-mediated tumor suppressive function in osteosarcoma. We found that capsaicin-induced apoptosis and the activation of transient receptor potential receptor vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human osteosarcoma MG63 cells in vitro. Blocking TRPV1 using capsazepine attenuated the capsaicin-induced cytotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In addition, the results demonstrated that capsaicin induced the activation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p53 and C-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In addition, Compound C (antagonist of AMPK) attenuated the activation of p53, which appeared to be TRPV1 independent. Taken together, the present study suggests that capsaicin effectively causes cell death in human osteosarcoma MG63 cells via the activation of TRPV1-dependent (mitochondrial dysfunction, and overproduction of ROS and JNK) and TRPV1-independent (AMPK-p53) pathways. Thus, capsaicin may be a potential anti-osteosarcoma agent.",Hsa_circ_0101432 promotes the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by adsorbing miR-1258 and miR-622.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095447,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 05 16,"The present research was major in investigating the regulation association among hsa_circ_0101432 (has_circ_RPPH1), miR-1258, miR-622 and MAPK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we explored the mechanism underlying pathogenesis of HCC.

Age at time of exposure to radiation is known to influence biological outcomes for many end points. The effect of dose and age at exposure upon the occurrence of radiogenic cardiovascular disease is poorly understood. The goal of this work was to determine the response of male WAG/RijCmcr rats at 6 months of age to gamma rays, and at 6 months or 6 weeks of age to X rays, using clinically relevant biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and kidney injury. Overall, there were significant radiation-induced effects on the levels of bicarbonate (P = 0.0016), creatinine (P = 0.0002), calcium (P = 0.0009), triglycerides (P = 0.0269) and blood urea nitrogen, albumin, protein, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total cholesterol and HDL (all P < 0.0001). Of those variables with a significant radiation-dose effect, there were significant modifications by age at time of exposure for bicarbonate (P = 0.0033), creatinine (P = 0.0015), AST (P = 0.0040), total cholesterol (P = 0.0006) and blood urea nitrogen, calcium, albumin, protein, alkaline phosphatase and HDL (all P < 0.0001). Cardiac perivascular collagen content was significantly increased in rats that were 8.0 Gy X-ray irradiated at 6 weeks of age (P < 0.047) but not at 6 months of age. While systemic blood pressure was elevated in both cohorts after 8.0 Gy X-ray irradiation (compared to age-matched sham-irradiated controls), the magnitude of the increase above baseline was greater in the younger rats (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that dose and age at time of irradiation determine the timeline and severity of cardiac and renal injury.",DMAPT is an Effective Radioprotector from Long-Term Radiation-Induced Damage to Normal Mouse Tissues In Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095445,Radiation research,2019 05 16,"While radiotherapy is widely used in cancer treatment, the benefits can be limited by radiation-induced damage to neighboring healthy tissues. We previously demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory compound dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT) selectively induces radiosensitivity in prostate tumor tissue from transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP), while simultaneously protecting healthy tissues from 6 Gy whole-body radiation-induced apoptosis. Here, we examined the radioprotective effect of DMAPT on fibrosis in normal tissues after a partial-body fractionated radiation protocol that more closely mimics the image-guided fractionated radiotherapy protocols used clinically. Male C57BL/6J mice,16 weeks old, received 20 Gy fractionated doses of X rays (2 Gy daily fractions, five days/week for two weeks) or sham irradiation to the lower abdomen, with or without a 20 mGy dose to mimic an image dose. In addition, mice received thrice weekly DMAPT (100 mg/kg by oral gavage) or vehicle control from 15 weeks of age until time of analysis at 6 weeks postirradiation. In the absence of exposure to radiation, there were no significant differences observed in the tissues of DMAPT and vehicle-treated mice (P > 0.05). DMAPT treatment significantly reduced radiation-induced testis weight loss by 60.9% (P < 0.0001), protected against a decrease in the seminiferous tubule diameter by 42.1% (P < 0.0001) and largely preserved testis morphology. Inclusion of the image dose had no significant effect on testis mass, seminiferous tubule diameter or testis morphology. DMAPT reduced radiation-induced fibrosis in the corpus cavernous region of the penis (98.1% reduction, P = 0.009) and in the muscle layer around the bladder (80.1% reduction, P = 0.0001). There was also a trend towards reduced collagen infiltration into the submucosal and muscle layers in the rectum. These results suggest that DMAPT could be useful in providing protection from the radiation-induced side effects of impotence and infertility, urinary incontinence and fecal urgency resulting from prostate cancer radiotherapy. DMAPT is a very well-tolerated drug and can conveniently be delivered orally without strict time windows relative to radiation exposure. Protection of normal tissues by DMAPT could potentially be useful in radiotherapy of other cancer types as well.",PARP3 comes to light as a prime target in cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095444,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 06 14,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 3 (PARP3) is the third member of the PARP family that catalyze a post-translational modification of proteins to promote, control or adjust numerous cellular events including genome integrity, transcription, differentiation, cell metabolism or cell death.

To clarify the benefits of SSS for comprehension, 2 eye-tracking experiments aimed to detect the extent to which signs are actively processed in this mode of communication. Method Participants were 36 deaf adolescents, including cochlear implant users and native deaf signers. Experiment 1 attempted to shift observers' foveal attention to the linguistic source in SSS from which most information is extracted, lip movements or signs, by magnifying the face area, thus modifying lip movements perceptual accessibility (magnified condition), and by constraining the visual field to either the face or the sign through a moving window paradigm (gaze contingent condition). Experiment 2 aimed to explore the reliance on signs in SSS by occasionally producing a mismatch between sign and speech. Participants were required to concentrate upon the orally transmitted message. Results In Experiment 1, analyses revealed a greater number of fixations toward the signs and a reduction in accuracy in the gaze contingent condition across all participants. Fixations toward signs were also increased in the magnified condition. In Experiment 2, results indicated less accuracy in the mismatching condition across all participants. Participants looked more at the sign when it was inconsistent with speech. Conclusions All participants, even those with residual hearing, rely on signs when attending SSS, either peripherally or through overt attention, depending on the perceptual conditions.

Areas covered: This review summarizes the synthetic antimicrobials that are currently in development for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, focusing on antibiotics in the final phases of clinical development and on the strategies employed by novel synthetic antimicrobial peptides. Expert opinion: Several novel synthetic antimicrobials are currently in the pipeline, and it appears that new antimicrobial peptides or mimetics will soon be made available, expanding the opportunities to treat nosocomial pneumonia. However, the approval process for use in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia is arduous. Given that significant investments by pharmaceutical companies have ended in failure to obtain the approval of regulatory agencies, novel platforms for antimicrobial discovery are needed.

Background:
 Typically, closed-loop control (CLC) studies excluded patients with significant hypoglycemia. We evaluated the effectiveness of hybrid CLC (HCLC) versus sensor-augmented pump (SAP) in reducing hypoglycemia in this high-risk population. 
Methods:
 Forty-four subjects with type 1 diabetes, 25 women, 37 ± 2 years old, HbA1c 7.4% ± 0.2% (57 ± 1.5 mmol/mol), diabetes duration 19 ± 2 years, on insulin pump, were enrolled at the University of Virginia (N = 33) and Stanford University (N = 11). Eligibility: increased risk of hypoglycemia confirmed by 1 week of blinded continuous glucose monitor (CGM); randomized to 4 weeks of home use of either HCLC or SAP. Primary/secondary outcomes: risk for hypoglycemia measured by the low blood glucose index (LBGI)/CGM-based time in ranges. 
Results:
 Values reported: mean ± standard deviation. From baseline to the final week of study: LBGI decreased more on HCLC (2.51 ± 1.17 to 1.28 ± 0.5) than on SAP (2.1 ± 1.05 to 1.79 ± 0.98), P < 0.001; percent time below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) decreased on HCLC (7.2% ± 5.3% to 2.0% ± 1.4%) but not on SAP (5.8% ± 4.7% to 4.8% ± 4.5%), P = 0.001; percent time within the target range 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10 mmol/L) increased on HCLC (67.8% ± 13.5% to 78.2% ± 10%) but decreased on SAP (65.6% ± 12.9% to 59.6% ± 16.5%), P < 0.001; percent time above 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) decreased on HCLC (25.1% ± 15.3% to 19.8% ± 10.1%) but increased on SAP (28.6% ± 14.6% to 35.6% ± 17.6%), P = 0.009. Mean glucose did not change significantly on HCLC (144.9 ± 27.9 to 143.8 ± 14.4 mg/dL [8.1 ± 1.6 to 8.0 ± 0.8 mmol/L]) or SAP (152.5 ± 24.3 to 162.4 ± 28.2 [8.5 ± 1.4 to 9.0 ± 1.6]), P = ns. 
Conclusions:
 Compared with SAP therapy, HCLC reduced the risk and frequency of hypoglycemia, while improving time in target range and reducing hyperglycemia in people at moderate to high risk of hypoglycemia.",Adjunct Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes: A Survey to Uncover Unmet Needs and Patient Preferences Beyond HbA1c Measures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095422,Diabetes technology & therapeutics,2019 06 10,"
Background:
 Adjunct therapy can help patients with type 1 diabetes achieve glycemic goals while potentially mitigating some of the side effects of insulin.

Methods:
 A quantitative survey was sent to 2084 adults with type 1 diabetes in November 2017. ""Jobs-to-be-done"" and conjoint analyses were performed on survey responses to identify unmet needs and the importance of treatment-associated benefits and risks to patients. A 5-point Likert scale measured the importance and satisfaction with patients' current therapy, and with gaps relating to unmet needs. In the conjoint analysis, patients were asked to choose between ""packages"" of attributes of two doses of adjunct therapy (200 and 400 mg) and placebo, based on established benefits and side effects. 
Results:
 A total of 1313 patients (63%) responded. The greatest unmet needs identified were simplifying treatment, lowering/maintaining glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), reducing mental effort, and increasing time in range (TIR). Conjoint analysis showed that reductions in body weight and TIR had the highest attribute importance (25% and 18%, respectively). The majority (93%) of patients had a preference for the adjunct therapy (either dose) over placebo. 
Conclusions:
 This survey highlights the importance of measures beyond HbA1c, such as treatment simplification and TIR, and patient preference for adjunct therapies that help address unmet needs in type 1 diabetes treatment.","Rac-GTPase promotes fibrotic TGF-β1 signaling and chronic kidney disease via EGFR, p53, and Hippo/YAP/TAZ pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095421,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2019 05 16,"Rac-GTPases are major regulators of cytoskeletal remodeling and their deregulation contributes to numerous pathologies. Whether or how Rac promotes tubulointerstitial fibrosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is currently unknown. We showed that the major profibrotic cytokine, TGF-β1 promoted rapid Rac1-GTP loading in human kidney 2 (HK-2) human renal epithelial cells. A Rac-specific chemical inhibitor, EHT 1864, blocked TGF-β1-induced fibrotic reprogramming in kidney epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Stable Rac1 depletion in HK-2 cells, moreover, eliminated TGF-β1-mediated non-SMAD pathway activation [e.g., Src, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p53] and subsequent plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), connective tissue growth factor, fibronectin, and p21 induction. Rac1 and p22phox knockdown abrogated free radical generation by TGF-β1 in HK-2 cells, consistent with the role of Rac1 in Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase signaling. TGF-β1-induced renal epithelial cytostasis was also completely bypassed by Rac1, p22phox, p47phox, and PAI-1 silencing. Rac1b isoform expression was robustly induced in the fibrotic kidneys of mice and humans. Intraperitoneal administration of EHT 1864 in mice dramatically attenuated ureteral unilateral obstruction-driven EGFR, p53, Rac1b, yes-associated protein/transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif activation/expression, dedifferentiation, cell cycle arrest, and renal fibrogenesis evident in vehicle-treated obstructed kidneys. Thus, the Rac1-directed redox response is critical for TGF-β1-driven epithelial dysfunction orchestrated, in part, via PAI-1 up-regulation. Rac pathway inhibition suppressed renal oxidative stress and maladaptive repair, identifying Rac as a novel therapeutic target against progressive CKD.-Patel, S., Tang, J., Overstreet, J.

It may affect the welfare of animals due to heat loss, thereby possibly impacting food and water intake to maintain body temperature. In this context, infrared thermography seems to be a suitable method of measuring heat emissions from the surface of objects. Sexually mature male domestic chinchillas were divided into two groups: ""non-fur chewers"", exhibiting normal behaviour (n = 25), and ""fur chewers"" displaying fur-chewing behaviour (n = 23). Food and water intake (mean ± SD) measured in the control animals amounted to 20.7 ± 4.52 g and 15.9 ± 3.45 mL, while in fur-chewing chinchillas were 25% and 33% higher, respectively. Metabolic energy intake, were calculated 2.2 and 2.8 W for the control and fur-chewing animals, respectively. Heat flux through chewed areas was 6.06 mW cm-2, which is 2.8 times higher than through undamaged chinchilla fur. To sum up, thermal imagingexplicitly shows that fur-chewing causes increased heat loss. Disturbances in the maintenance of thermal homeostasis may be an additional factor that reduces the welfare of these animals.","The Abbreviated Injury Scale is well described: A letter to the Editor re: Loftis et al., ""Evolution of the Abbreviated Injury Scale: 1990-2015"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095419,Traffic injury prevention,2019 06 06,"Objective: A recent study published in this journal has provided a description and summary of changes made to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) through the 5 latest versions.

To assess whether increasing health aid investments affected public opinion of the United States in recipient populations. Methods. We linked health aid data from the United States to nationally representative opinion poll surveys from 45 countries conducted between 2002 and 2016. We exploited the abrupt and substantial increase in health aid when the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) were launched to assess unique changes in opinions of the United States following program onset. We also ascertained increased exposure to health aid from the United States by systematically searching for mentions of US health aid programs in popular press. Results. Favorability ratings of the United States increased within countries in proportion to health aid and were significantly higher after implementation of PEPFAR and PMI. Higher US health aid was associated with more references to that aid in the popular press. Conclusions. Our study was the first, to our knowledge, to show that US investments in health aid improved the United States' image abroad. Public Health Implications.

When grouped together, these neurological conditions impact an estimated 100 million individuals in the United States and up to a billion people worldwide, making drug discovery efforts imperative. However, recent research and development efforts for these neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have been exceedingly disappointing and typify the challenges associated with translating in vitro and cell-based discoveries to successful preclinical models and subsequent human clinical trials. Our viewpoint is that neuronal progenitor cells and neurons derived from inducible pluripotent stem cells afford an innovative translational bridge, with higher pathological relevancy than previous cellular models.

However, it can be difficult to know where to begin because treatment protocols and evidence-based treatment studies are lacking. A good place to start in any tinnitus and hyperacusis clinic is to incorporate a group educational session. Method Here, we outline our approach to establishing a hyperacusis group educational session that includes specific aspects of getting to know each patient to best meet their needs, understanding the problems associated with hyperacusis, explaining the auditory system and the relationship of hyperacusis to hearing loss and tinnitus, describing the influence of hyperacusis on daily life, and introducing treatment options. Subjective responses from 11 adults with hyperacusis, who participated in a recent clinical group education session, were discussed to illustrate examples from actual patients. Conclusions Due to the devastating nature of hyperacusis, patients need to be reassured that they are not alone and that they can rely on audiologists to provide support and guidance. A group approach can facilitate the therapeutic process by connecting patients with others who are also affected by hyperacusis, and by educating patients and significant others on hyperacusis and its treatment options.

Method A 1-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study design was used to assess self-ratings of confidence in knowledge and skills. The mean age for 50 graduate students participating in this study was 25.32 years ( SD = ±3.77, range: 22-37 years). Participants completed a pre- and postevent questionnaire in which they rated their level of confidence for specific knowledge and skills. Three case scenarios represented by standardized parents were developed, and 8 students volunteered to participate in implementing the 1-3-6 EHDI timeline, whereas others participated as observers. All participants participated in the briefing and debriefing sessions immediately before and after each scenario. Participants were asked to rate their readiness for interprofessional education/practice and their satisfaction of the educational experience after the last case scenario. Results Overall, the pre- and postsimulation event questionnaire revealed a significant improvement in the participants' self-rated confidence levels in knowledge and skills. The mean difference between pre- and postevent scores was 0.78 ( p < .01). The mean interprofessional learning was 2.13 (range: 1.16-2.57, SD = ±0.24) based on a Likert scale, where 1 = strongly agree and 5 = strongly disagree. The mean satisfaction level was 4.37 (range: 3.94-4.72, SD = ±0.24) based on a Likert scale, where 1 = not satisfied and 5 = very satisfied. Conclusions The results demonstrated the value of using interprofessional simulation training among audiology and speech-language pathology students to improve their confidence in knowledge and skills.

The extent of response has been found to depend on factors such as the nature and the number of responsive functionalities incorporated into these particles. In this work, the length of oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side chains associated with the polymers has been shown to greatly influence the responsive behavior of polymeric nanoparticles. The integrity of these OEG-based polymeric assemblies was found to depend not only on the chemical cross-links but also on the physical cross-links in these aggregates in cases where the polymer chains bear long OEG side chains. The physical cross-linking in longer OEG side chain containing polymeric nanogels is present in the form of crystalline domains. Our results here highlight that these ethylene glycol-based hydrophilic units are not to be ignored as spectator units with water-solubilization characteristics but must be analyzed in the context of assembly stabilization and triggerability with the targeted stimulus.",Synthesis of α-Fluorinated Imides via Direct Fluorohydroxylation of Ynamides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095399,Organic letters,2019 06 12,"A practical synthesis of α-fluorinated imides via the catalyst-free fluorohydroxylation of ynamides is developed.

B,2019 06 11,"Amyloid fibrils are locally ordered protein aggregates that self-assemble under a variety of physiological and in vitro conditions. Their formation is of fundamental interest as a physical chemistry problem and plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease, Type II diabetes, and other human diseases. As the number of known amyloid fibril structures has grown, the need has arisen for a nomenclature for describing and classifying fibril types, as well as a theoretical description of the physics that gives rise to the self-assembly of these structures. Here, we introduce a systematic nomenclature and coarse-graining methodology for describing the topology of fibrils and other protein aggregates, along with a computational methodology for simulating protein aggregation. Both have mathematical underpinnings in graph theory and statistical mechanics and are consistent with available experimental data on the fibril structure and aggregation kinetics. Our graph representation of the fibril topology enables us to define a network Hamiltonian based on connectivity patterns among monomers rather than detailed intermolecular interactions, greatly speeding up the simulation of large ensembles. Our simulation strategy is capable of recapitulating the formation of all currently known amyloid fibril topologies found in the Protein Data Bank, as well as the formation kinetics of fibrils and oligomers.","Covalent Inhibitors of Protein-Protein Interactions Targeting Lysine, Tyrosine, or Histidine Residues.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095386,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 13,"We have recently reported a series of Lys-covalent agents targeting the BIR3 domain of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) using a benzamide-sulfonyl fluoride warhead.

Moreover, we tested aqueous, plasma stability, cell permeability, and cellular efficacy of the most effective agents. These studies identified aryl-fluoro sulfates as likely the most suitable electrophiles to effectively form covalent adducts with Lys, Tyr, and His residues, given that these agents were cell permeable and stable in aqueous buffer and in plasma.

The analogues with carbamide groups exhibited great antinecroptotic activities, and compound 42 showed >60-fold selectivity for RIPK3 than RIPK1. It blocked necrosome formation by specifically inhibiting the phosphorylation of RIPK3 in necroptotic cells. In a tumor necrosis factor-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome model, it significantly protected mice from hypothermia and death at a dose of 5 mg/kg, which was much more effective than TAK-632.

B,2019 05 30,"The radicals formed by muonium (Mu) addition to four nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine) have been characterized by avoided level-crossing muon spin resonance (ALC-μSR). Mu is considered to be a light isotope of the hydrogen atom, and the muoniated radicals observed by ALC-μSR are isotopomers of the radicals initially produced by H addition to the nucleobases. The observed radicals have been assigned by considering the relative energies of the possible radicals reported in the literature and comparing the experimental muon and proton hyperfine coupling constants with values from previously reported electron paramagnetic resonance and ab initio calculations that have been scaled to account for the larger magnetic moment of the muon and its lighter mass compared with the proton. Mu addition is observed to occur only at secondary carbons of the purine rings in adenine and guanine. Mu adds to C8 and C2 of adenine with the relative amount being ∼70:30%, and Mu adds exclusively to C8 of guanine. Mu addition is predominantly to the secondary carbons of the pyrimidine ring in cytosine (C5 and C6 with relative yields ∼80:20%) with a small amount of addition at N3.

The calculations reveal that the presence of metal ions shifts the conformational equilibrium more toward the compact ordered Aβ structures. Such compact ordered structures stabilized by distant nonlocal contacts between two crucial hydrophobic segments, hp1 and hp2, primarily through two important hydrophobic aromatic residues, Phe-19 and Phe-20, are expected to trigger the aggregation process at a faster rate by populating and stabilizing the aggregation prone structures. Formation of a significant number of such distant contacts in the presence of Na+ ions has also been found to result in breaking of the N-terminal helix. On the contrary, binding of Zn2+ ion to Aβ peptide is highly specific, which stabilizes the N-terminal helix instead of breaking it. This explains why the aggregation rate of Aβ peptides is higher in the presence of divalent Zn2+ ions than monovalent Na+ ions. Relatively higher overall stability of the most populated Aβ peptide monomers in the presence of Zn2+ ions has been found to be associated with specific Zn2+-Aβ binding and significant free energy gain.",Quantitative Proteomics Analysis of Barley-Based Liquid Feed and the Effect of Protease Inhibitors and NADPH-Dependent Thioredoxin Reductase/Thioredoxin (NTR/Trx) System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095381,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 06 10,"Liquid feeding strategies have been devised with the aim of enhancing grain nutrient availability for livestock. It is characterized by a steeping/soaking period that softens the grains and initiates mobilization of seed storage reserves. The present study uses 2D gel-based proteomics to investigate the role of proteolysis and reduction by thioredoxins over a 48 h steeping period by monitoring protein abundance dynamics in barley-based liquid feed samples supplemented with either protease inhibitors or NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin (NTR/Trx). Several full-length storage proteins were only identified in the water-extractable fraction of feed containing protease inhibitors, illustrating significant inhibition of proteolytic activities arising during the steeping period. Application of functional NTR/Trx to liquid feed reductively increased the solubility of known and potentially new Trx-target proteins, e.g., outer membrane protein X, and their susceptibility to proteolysis. Thus, the NTR/Trx system exhibits important potential as a feed additive to enhance nutrient digestibility in monogastric animals.","Principal Component Analysis of a Conotoxin Delineates the Link among Peptide Sequence, Dynamics, and Disulfide Bond Isoforms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095380,The journal of physical chemistry.

The polymer shell dynamics obtained by in situ SAXS analysis and numerical simulation of the solvent composition allowed us to map the interaction energy between the particles at early state of solvent mixing, 30 ms behind the crossing point. We found that the rate of hydrophobic collapse depends on water concentration, ranging between 100 and 500 nm/s. Importantly, we confirmed that the polymer shell collapses prior to the commencement of clustering.",Steering the Achiral into Chiral with a Self-Assembly Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095365,ACS nano,2019 06 11,"Chirality transfer from self-assembly of achiral titanyl phthalocyanine (TiOPc) to its top-sitting TiOPc molecule has been successfully achieved. The TiOPc molecules first assemble into a porous network on Au(111) that contains periodic chiral voids, each being fenced by four axially rotating TiOPc molecules in upward adsorption geometry where their ending O atoms exclusively point away from the substrate. The additional top-sitting TiOPc molecule turns out to be chiral upon adsorption on a chiral void with its ending O atom toward the substrate. The chirality of the top-sitting TiOPc is associated with a charge transfer between its indole rings and the ending O atoms of the underlying TiOPc molecules that form the chiral void, resulting in asymmetric electronic density of the indole rings in the top-sitting molecule and accordingly the chirality of the molecular orbitals. Such a scenario also validates other planar achiral metallophthalocyanines such as copper phthalocyanine that become chiral upon adsorption on the chiral voids in the underlying TiOPc assembly, indicating that the chirality transfer mechanism from assembly to the top-sitting molecule is not uncommon.",Efficient Removal of Ultrafine Particles from Diesel Exhaust by Selected Tree Species: Implications for Roadside Planting for Improving the Quality of Urban Air.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095364,Environmental science & technology,2019 06 11,"Human exposure to airborne ultrafine (≪1 μm) particulate pollution may pose substantial hazards to human health, particularly in urban roadside environments where very large numbers of people are frequently exposed to vehicle-derived ultrafine particles (UFPs). For mitigation purposes, it is timely and important to quantify the deposition of traffic-derived UFPs onto leaves of selected plant species, with particularly efficient particle capture (high deposition velocity), which can be installed curbside, proximal to the emitting vehicular sources. Here, we quantify the size-resolved capture efficiency of UFPs from diesel vehicle exhaust by nine temperate-zone plant species, in wind tunnel experiments. The results show that silver birch (79% UFP removal), yew (71%), and elder (70.5%) have very high capabilities for capture of airborne UFPs. Metal concentrations and metal enrichment ratios in leaf leachates were also highest for the postexposure silver birch leaves; scanning electron microscopy showed that UFPs were concentrated along the hairs of these leaves. For all but two species, magnetic measurements demonstrated substantial increases in the concentration of magnetic particles deposited on the leaves after exposure to the exhaust particulates. Together, these new data show that leaf-deposition of UFPs is chiefly responsible for the substantial reductions in particle numbers measured downwind of the vegetation. It is critical to recognize that the deposition velocity of airborne particulate matter (PM) to leaves is species-specific and often substantially higher (∼10 to 50 times higher) than the ""standard"" Vd values (e.g., 0.1-0.64 cm s-1 for PM2.5) used in most modeling studies. The use of such low Vd values in models results in a major under-estimation of PM removal by roadside vegetation and thus misrepresents the efficacy of selected vegetation species in the substantial (≫20%) removal of PM. Given the potential hazard to health posed by UFPs and the removal efficiencies shown here (and by previous roadside measurements), roadside planting (maintained at or below head height) of selected species at PM ""hotspots"" can contribute substantially and quickly to improve in urban air quality and reductions in human exposure. These findings can contribute to the development and implementation of mitigation policies of traffic-derived PM on an international scale.",Formation of Giant and Small Cyclic Complexes from a Flexible Tripeptide Ligand Controlled by Metal Coordination and Hydrogen Bonds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095363,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 12,"Formation of giant cyclic complexes by the assembly of small, flexible units is demonstrated by connecting 14 artificial tripeptides (1) with 14 Ni(II) ions. Although tripeptide 1 is very flexible because of the presence of three CH2 groups in the main chain, it formed a tetradecanuclear cyclic complex ([114Ni14]28+) with a large cavity (diameter: ca. 2 nm). In this structure, three tripeptides are coordinated to each Ni(II) center by three different coordination sites in 1, forming a mesh-like structure. Crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the conformation of 1 was controlled by the formation of metal coordination bonds and intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Because of the structural flexibility, the cyclic framework formed both circular and ellipsoidal structures in the crystalline state, depending on the packing structure. In addition, by the conditions of the assembly process, the size of the cavities could be tuned either with a small decrement (dodecanuclear complex [112Ni12]24+) or a large decrement (octanuclear complexes [(1-3H+)4Ni8]4+), in which ""shrunk"" cavities with a 10-fold difference in diameter (<0.2 nm) were formed by tuning the tripeptide conformation through additional metal coordination to the tripeptide framework. Dynamic light scattering and mass spectrometry studies indicated that the giant cyclic complexes were also present in the solution state.",Canalicular Junctions in the Osteocyte Lacuno-Canalicular Network of Cortical Bone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095362,ACS nano,2019 06 11,"The osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) is essential for bone remodeling because osteocytes regulate cell recruitment. This has been proposed to occur through liquid-flow-induced shear forces in the canaliculi. Models of the LCN have thus far assumed that it contains canaliculi connecting the osteocyte lacunae. However, here, we reveal that enlarged spaces occur at places where several canaliculi cross; we name these spaces canalicular junctions. We characterize them in detail within mice cortical bone using synchrotron nanotomography at two length scales, with 50 and 130 nm voxel size, and show that canalicular junctions occur at a density similar to that of osteocyte lacunae and that canalicular junctions tend to cluster. Through confocal laser scanning microscopy, we show that canalicular junctions are widespread as we have observed them in cortical bone from several species, even though the number density of the canalicular junctions was not universal. Fluid flow simulations of a simple model system with and without a canalicular junction clearly show that liquid mass transport and flow velocities are altered by the presence of canalicular junctions. We suggest that these canalicular junctions may play an important role in osteocyte communication and possibly also in canalicular fluid flow. Therefore, we believe that they constitute an important component in the bone osteocyte network.",Topical Diacerein Ointment for Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: A Review,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095348,Skin therapy letter,2019 05 29,"Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare mucocutaneous fragility disorders often presenting in infancy and early childhood with painful blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. The severity of EB blister burden varies by disease subtype. Studies have shown that patients with generalized severe epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a variant characterized by extreme fragility, develop blisters in the setting of overproduced, mutated K14 protein, a component of the intermediate filament integral in keratinocyte stability, and constitutive activation of interleukin (IL)-1 , a pro-inflammatory cytokine that promotes the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Diacerein, a rhein prodrug and anthraquinone, has been shown to reduce expression of K14 and inhibit IL-1 converting enzyme. In clinical trials, topical 1% diacerein was shown to be an effective and safe, non-invasive treatment for patients suffering from EBS.

Thus, novel strategies to treat or prevent invasive mycosis, such as cryptococcosis, are highly desirable. One strategy is the use of immunomodulators of polysaccharide nature isolated from mushrooms. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the immunostimulatory activity of β-(1,3)-glucan-containing exopolysaccharides (EPS) from the edible mushrooms Auricularia auricula in phagocytes and mice infected with Cryptococcus neoformans. EPS triggered macrophages and dendritic cell activation upon binding to Dectin-1, a pattern recognition receptor of the C-type lectin receptor family. Engagement of Dectin-1 culminated in pro-inflammatory cytokine production and cell maturation via its canonical Syk-dependent pathway signaling. Furthermore, upon EPS treatment, M2-like phenotype macrophages, known to support intracellular survival and replication of C. neoformans, repolarize to M1 macrophage pattern associated with enhanced production of the microbicidal molecule nitric oxide that results in efficient killing of C. neoformans. Treatment with EPS also upregulated transcript levels of genes encoding products associated with host protection against C. neoformans and Dectin-1 mediated signaling in macrophages. Finally, orally administrated β-glucan-containing EPS from A. auricular enhanced the survival of mice infected with C. neoformans. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that EPS from A. auricula exert immunostimulatory activity in phagocytes and induce host protection against C. neoformans, suggesting that polysaccharides from this mushroom may be promising as an adjuvant for vaccines or antifungal therapy.",Radiogenomics Consortium Genome-Wide Association Study Meta-analysis of Late Toxicity after Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095341,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2019 05 16,10-20% of patients develop long-term toxicity following radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

On short timescales, between-sex genetic correlations (rmf) for shared traits may constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism by preventing males and females from responding independently to sex-specific selection. However, over longer timescales, rmf may evolve, thereby facilitating the evolution of dimorphism. Although it has been suggested that sexually antagonistic selection may reduce rmf, we lack a general theory for the evolution of rmf and its multivariate analog, the between-sex genetic covariance matrix (B). Here, we derive a simple analytical model for the within-generation change in B due to sex-specific directional selection. We present a single-trait example demonstrating that sex-specific directional selection may either increase or decrease between-sex genetic covariance, depending on the relative strength of selection in each sex and on the current value of rmf. Although sexually antagonistic selection can reduce between-sex covariance, it will only do so when selection is much stronger in one sex than in the other. Counterintuitively, sexually antagonistic selection that is equal in strength in the two sexes will maintain positive between-sex covariance. Selection acting in the same direction on both sexes is predicted to reduce between-sex covariance in many cases. We illustrate our model numerically using empirical measures of sex-specific selection and between-sex genetic covariance from two populations of sexually dimorphic brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) and discuss its importance for understanding the resolution of intralocus sexual conflict.",Inclusion of Vitamin A Intake Data Provides Improved Compartmental Model-Derived Estimates of Vitamin A Total Body Stores and Disposal Rate in Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095324,The Journal of nutrition,2019 05 16,Sampling times and study duration impact estimates of kinetic parameters and variables including total body stores (TBS) and disposal rate (DR) when compartmental analysis is used to analyze vitamin A kinetic data.,Endocrine disruption alters developmental energy allocation and performance in Rana temporaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095322,Integrative and comparative biology,2019 05 16,"Environmental change exposes wildlife to a wide array of environmental stressors that arise from both anthropogenic and natural sources. Many environmental stressors with the ability to alter endocrine function are known as endocrine disruptors, which may impair the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis resulting in physiological consequences to wildlife. In this study, we investigated how the alteration of thyroid hormone (TH) levels due to exposure to the environmentally relevant endocrine disruptor sodium perchlorate (SP; inhibitory) and exogenous L-thyroxin (T4; stimulatory) affects metabolic costs and energy allocation during and after metamorphosis in a common amphibian (R. temporaria). We further tested for possible carry-over effects of endocrine disruption during larval stage on juvenile performance. Energy allocated to development was negatively related to metabolic rate and thus, tadpoles exposed to T4 could allocate 24% less energy to development during metamorphic climax than control animals. Therefore, the energy available for metamorphosis was reduced in tadpoles with increased TH level by exposure to T4. We suggest that differences in metabolic rate caused by altered TH levels during metamorphic climax and energy allocation to maintenance costs might have contributed to a reduced energetic efficiency in tadpoles with high TH levels. Differences in size and energetics persisted beyond the metamorphic boundary and impacted on juvenile performance. Performance differences are mainly related to strong size-effects as altered TH levels by exposure to T4 and SP significantly affected growth and developmental rate. Nevertheless, we assume that juvenile performance is influenced by a size-independent effect of achieved TH. Energetic efficiency varied between treatments due to differences in size allocation of internal macronutrient stores. Altered TH levels as caused by several environmental stressors lead to persisting effects on metamorphic traits and energetics and, thus, caused carry-over effects on performance of froglets. We demonstrate the mechanisms through which alterations in abiotic and biotic environmental factors can alter phenotypes at metamorphosis and reduce lifetime fitness in these and likely other amphibians.","'Close confinement tells very much upon a man': Prison Memoirs, Insanity and the Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Prison.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095321,Journal of the history of medicine and allied sciences,2019 05 16,"This article explores prisoners' observations of mental illness in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century British prisons, recorded in memoirs published following their release. The discipline of separate confinement was lauded for its potential to improve prisoners' minds, inducing reflection and reform, when it was introduced in the 1840s, but in practice led to high levels of mental breakdown. In order to maintain the integrity of the prison system, the prison authorities played down incidences of insanity, while prison chaplains lauded the beneficent influence of cellular isolation. In contrast, as this article demonstrates, prisoners' memoirs offer insights into the prevalence of mental illness in prison, and its poor management, as well as inmates' efforts to manage mental distress. As the prison system became more closed, uniform and penal after the 1860s, the volume of such publications increased. Oscar Wilde's evocative prison writings have attracted considerable attention, but he was only one of many prison authors criticizing the penal system and decrying the damage it inflicted on the mind. Exploration of prison memoirs, it is argued, enhances our understanding of experiences of mental disorder in the underexplored context of the prison, highlighting the prisoners' voice, agency and advocacy of reform.",Follicular regulatory T cells are associated with β-cell autoimmunity and the development of type 1 diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095320,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2019 05 16,"Impaired follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells enhance T follicular helper (Tfh) cells activity, resulting in the expansion of autoreactive B cells and autoantibody production.

Within in vitro batches (n = 4), 12 substrates were incubated and in vitro true nutrient digestibility was evaluated. For study 2, 5 ruminally cannulated beef steers (BW = 520 ± 30 kg) were used in a 5 × 4 unbalanced Latin square using a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments: a) diet quality (high = HQ; and low = LQ); and b) enzyme inclusion (0 or 0.75 mL/kg of diet DM). Steers were fed ad-libitum during 4 21-d periods consisting of (14-d of adaptation and 7-d of collections). An enzyme × substrate was observed (P < 0.01), in which DM, OM, and NDF disappearance of sorghum grain increased with enzymes addition.

Thyroid hormone (TH) treatment, administered shortly after injury, has been shown to promote neural protection in rodent TBI models. The mechanism of TH protection, however, is not established. We used mouse primary cortical neurons to investigate the effectiveness and possible pathways of T3-promoted cell survival after exposure to hypoxic injury. Cultured primary cortical neurons were exposed to hypoxia (0.2% oxygen) for 7 hours with or without T3 (5 nM). T3 treatment enhanced DNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmc) levels and attenuated the hypoxia-induced increase in DNA 5-methylcytosine (5-mc). In the presence of T3, mRNA expression of Tet family genes was increased and DNA methyltransferases, (Dnmt) 3a and Dnmt3b, were downregulated, compared to conditions in the absence of T3. These T3-induced changes decreased hypoxia-induced DNA de novo methylation, which reduced hypoxia-induced neuronal damage and apoptosis. We utilized RNA-seq to characterize T3-regulated genes in cortical neurons under hypoxic conditions and identified 22 genes that were upregulated and 15 genes that were downregulated. Krupple-like factor 9 (KLF9), a multifunctional transcription factor that plays a key role in CNS development, was highly upregulated by T3 treatment in hypoxic conditions. Knockdown of the KLF9 gene resulted in early apoptosis and abolished the beneficial role of T3 in neuronal survival. KLF9 mediates, in part, the neuronal protective role of T3.

Though the migration behavior of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner)(Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has been well-studied, little is known about the extent of intra-specific variation between northward- and southward-migrating individuals. In this study, we captured H. armigera adults along the species' migration route during 2017-2018 to determine seasonal variability in their morphology, flight capability, and reproductive performance. Northward migrants have broader, longer bodies and are 1.33 times heavier than southward migrants, hinting at a comparatively higher allocation of resources in the abdomen. Accordingly, the former migrants engaged in longer flights, had greater reproductive capacity and a longer lifespan than southward ones. As northward migrants originate from favorable environmental conditions, their fitness is higher than that of the southward cohorts that develop on less favorable host plants and in perhaps more adverse climatic or ecological conditions. Northward H. armigera migrants thus possess an advantageous morphology that benefits habitat colonization and resource exploitation.

We reviewed the effect of palm olein with other oils on serum lipid in healthy adults. We searched in MEDLINE and CENTRAL: Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1975 to January 2018 for randomized controlled trials of ≥2 wk intervention that compared the effects of palm olein (the liquid fraction of palm oil) with other oils such as coconut oil, lard, canola oil, high-oleic sunflower oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and soybean oil on changes in serum lipids. Nine studies were eligible and were included, with a total of 533 and 542 subjects on palm olein and other dietary oil diets, respectively. We extracted and compared all the data for serum lipids, such as total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and TC/HDL cholesterol ratio. When comparing palm olein with other dietary oils, the overall weighted mean differences for TC, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and the TC/HDL cholesterol ratio were -0.10 (95% CI: -0.30, 0.10; P = 0.34), -0.06 (95% CI: -0.29,0.16; P = 0.59), 0.02 (95% CI: -0.01, 0.04; P = 0.20), 0.01 (95% CI: -0.05, 0.06; P = 0.85), and -0.15 (95% CI: -0.43, 0.14; P = 0.32), respectively. Overall, there are no significant differences in the effects of palm olein intake on lipoprotein biomarkers (P > 0.05) compared with other dietary oils.

In the pediatric, the prevalence of HT is around 3.5%, and it in creases progressively with age. The ideal method for diagnosis is the measurement of blood pressure (BP) with auscultatory instruments. As published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), BP should be measured in children over 3 years of age once a year, and in children under 3 years of age, if it presents risk factors. Once HT has been confirmed, the evaluation should be directed towards the detection of a causative disease and the search for risk factors associated with primary HTN. The goal of treating primary and secondary HTN in pediatrics is to achieve a level of BP that decreases the risk of target organ damage. The therapeutic options include: treatment according to specific etiology, non-pharmacological and pharmacological.

Fabrication of CNC composites typically involves extrusion of CNC suspensions and gels in a variety of solvents, in the presence of additives such as polymers and curing agents. Most studies so far have focused on aqueous CNC gels, yet the behavior of CNC-polymer gels in organic solvents is important to their wider processability. Here, we study the rheological behavior of composite polymer-CNC gels in dimethylformamide, which include additives for both UV and thermal crosslinking. Using rheometry coupled with in situ infrared spectroscopy, we show that under external shear, CNC-polymer gels display progressive and irreversible failure of the hydrogen bond network that is responsible for their pronounced elastic properties. In the absence of cross-linking additives, the polymer-CNC gels show an instantaneous but partial recovery of their viscoelasticity upon cessation of flow, whereas, the presence of additives allows the gels to recover over much longer timescale via van der Waals interactions. By exploring a broad range of shear history and CNC concentrations, we construct master curves for the temporal evolution of the viscoelastic properties of the polymer-CNC gels, illustrating universality of the observed dynamics with respect to gel composition and flow conditions. We find that polymer-CNC composite gels display a number of the distinctive features of colloidal glasses and, strikingly, that their response to the flow conditions encountered during processing can be tuned by chemical additives. These findings have implications for processing of dense CNC-polymer composites in solvent casting, 3D printing, and other manufacturing techniques.",Synchronous screening of multiplexed biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease by a length-encoded aerolysin nanopore-integrated triple-helix molecular switch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095138,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 13,"Herein, we developed a versatile strategy for the synchronous screening of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by incorporating the high-resolution discrimination of an aerolysin nanopore to length-encoded oligonucleotides and the signal transduction of a triple-helix molecular switch (TMS).

In the presence of target miR-122, the attachment of miR-122 to its complementary DNA results in the unblocking of the toehold and branch migration domains in the TWJ, activating the strand displacement reaction (SDR) accompanied by the proximity between the G-rich DNA probe and DNA-AgNC probe; thus a remarkably enhanced fluorescence signal of AgNCs can be obtained owing to the G-rich fluorescence enhancement mechanism. The results reveal that this biosensor exhibits superb specificity and high sensitivity toward miR-122 with a detection limit of 0.030 nM. In addition, the practicality of the biosensor is demonstrated by analyzing miR-122 in three cell lines with satisfactory results. Furthermore, by the utilization of the toehold-mediated SDR and DNA-AgNC conjugates, this proposed strategy offers the advantages of rapidness, convenience, low cost, and simplified operation without the need for biological labeling and the addition of enzymes.

Previous research has shown that ionotropic ATP signaling through excitatory and calcium-permeable P2X receptor channels plays a critical role in pathological pain generation and maintenance. In this paper, we review several hypotheses on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying TN. We further discuss pathways or agents that can target P2X expression in TN, thereby affecting pain induction and maintenance.",The impact of aging on neurophysiological entrainment to a metronome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095111,Neuroreport,2019 06 06,"In music, entrainment to the beat allows listeners to make predictions about upcoming events. Previous work has shown that neural oscillations will entrain to the beat of the music or rhythmic stimuli. Despite the fact that aging is known to impact both auditory and cognitive processing, little is known about how aging affects neural entrainment to rhythmic stimuli. In this study, younger and older participants listened to isochronous sequences at a slower and faster rate while EEG data was recorded. Steady-state evoked potentials had amplitude peaks at the stimulus rate and its harmonics. Steady-state evoked potentials at the stimulus rate and the first harmonic was attenuated in older adults compared to younger adults. Additionally, no amplitude difference was found for the second and third harmonics in older adults, while there was a decrease in amplitude in younger adults. This age-related decline in the entrainment specificity of the brain responses to the stimulus rate, suggests that aging may decrease the ability to entrain to stimuli in the environment, and further suggests that older adults may be less able to inhibit neural entrainment that is not directly related to the incoming stimulus.",Disabling Gβγ-SNAP-25 interaction in gene-targeted mice results in enhancement of long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095110,Neuroreport,2019 06 06,"Three SNARE proteins, SNAP-25, syntaxin 1A, and VAMP2 or synaptobrevin 2, constitute the minimal functional machinery needed for the regulated secretion of neurotransmitters. Dynamic changes in the regulated release of neurotransmitters are associated with the induction of long-term plasticity at central synapses. In-vitro studies have validated the C-terminus of SNAP-25 as a target for inhibitory Gi/o-coupled G-protein coupled receptors at a number of synapses. The physiological consequences of the interaction between Gi/o proteins and SNAP-25 in the context of activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity are not well understood. Here, we report direct ex-vivo evidence of the involvement of the C-terminus of SNAP-25 in inducing long-term potentiation of synaptic strength at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses using a gene-targeted mouse model with truncated C-terminus (carboxyl terminus) of SNAP-25. It has been shown previously that truncation of the three extreme C-terminal residues in SNAP-25[INCREMENT]3 homozygote mice reduces its interaction with the inhibitory Gβγ subunits two-fold. In in-vitro hippocampal slices, we show that these SNAP-25[INCREMENT]3 mice express significantly larger magnitude of long-term potentiation at hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses.",Nucleus reuniens of the midline thalamus of a rat is specifically damaged after early postnatal alcohol exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095109,Neuroreport,2019 06 06,"Individuals diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders often show behavioral impairments in executive functioning. Mechanistic studies have implicated coordination between the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus (through thalamic nucleus reuniens) as essential for such executive functions. This study is the first to report the long-term neuroanatomical alterations to the ventral midline thalamus after alcohol exposure on postnatal days 4-9 (a rodent model of binge drinking during the third-trimester of human pregnancy). Alcohol added to a milk formula was administered to female Long-Evans rat pups on postnatal days 4-9 (5.25 g/kg/day of ethanol, intragastric intubation). Control animals were intubated without the administration of liquid. In adulthood, brains were immunohistochemically labeled for a neuronal marker (NeuN) conjugated with Cy3 fluorophore and stained with Hoechst33342 to visualize nuclei. Total non-neuronal cell number (NeuN/Hoechst) and neuron number (NeuN/Hoechst), and total volume were estimated using unbiased stereology in two neighboring midline thalamic nuclei: reuniens and rhomboid. Estimates were analyzed using linear mixed modeling to account for animal and litter as clustering variables. A 21% reduction in the total neuron number (resulting in altered neuron-to-non-neuron ratio) and an 18% reduction in total volume were found exclusively in thalamic nucleus reuniens in rats exposed to ethanol. Non-neuronal cell number was not changed in reuniens. No ethanol-induced changes on any measures were observed in rhomboid nucleus. These specific neuroanatomical alterations provide a necessary foundation for further examination of circuit-level alterations that occur in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.",Lesion of the dorsal hippocampus alters the time-course evolution of corticosterone rise in the ventral hippocampus after stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095108,Neuroreport,2019 06 06,"We previously showed that an acute stress-induced an early corticosterone rise in the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and a delayed one in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Congruently, we hypothesized that the dHPC may influence the time-course evolution of poststress glucocorticoid rise in the vHPC. To probe this issue, we performed ibotenic acid lesions of the dHPC and measured by microdialysis the time-course evolution of corticosterone rise in the vHPC after an acute stress delivery. In nonstress condition, we showed that the dHPC lesion induced a significant increase of corticosterone both in plasma and in the vHPC. In addition, an acute stress (electric footshocks) induced a faster and more sustained corticosterone rise in the vHPC of dHPC-lesioned animals, as compared to sham-operated ones. This study provides new found evidence to the effect that the dHPC lesion alters the time-course evolution of corticosterone rise within the vHPC after stress.",JBPOS0101 attenuates amyloid-β accumulation and memory loss in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095107,Neuroreport,2019 06 06,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain. Defects in Aβ clearance or the interference of Aβ homeostasis could result in Aβ aggregation. JBPOS0101 has been studied for its antiepileptic activity. It showed a neuroprotective effect and prevented memory deficits in lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus rats. In this study, we tested the effect of JBPOS0101 in an AD model. We showed that JBPOS0101 attenuated the accumulation of Aβ in 5XFAD mouse brains. Moreover, the treatment of JBPOS0101 rescued the deficits in learning and memory in 5XFAD mice. These data suggest that JBPOS0101 could be a potential therapeutic drug candidate for AD.",The antiapoptotic and antioxidative stress effects of Zhisanzhen in the Alzheimer's disease model rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095106,Neuroreport,2019 05 16,"Zhisanzhen, a type of acupuncture method, has been commonly used in the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders in clinics in China. The aim of this study was to confirm the effect of Zhisanzhen on Alzheimer's disease and the associated mechanism. We used D-galactose and Aβ1-40 injections to establish a rat model of AD. Rats were divided into four groups: normal group, AD group, AD+manual acupuncture (control) group, and AD+manual acupuncture (Zhisanzhen) group. Zhisanzhen was used to treat the AD model rats. We found that Zhisanzhen improved behavioral performance, reduced oxidative stress, increased the neurotransmitter acetylcholine concentration, reduced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons, and down-regulated the expression of apoptosis-related genes and proteins. Compared with those in the AD group, these parameters were clearly different in the Zhisanzhen control group (P<0.05). These results suggest that Zhisanzhen can markedly enhance learning and memory and reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in AD model rats, which may be related to the role of Zhisanzhen in increasing chAT and Ache activity, decreasing oxidative stress and inhibiting neuronal apoptosis.",Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum DNA and RNA in Semen of a Syphilis Patient Without Genital or Anal Lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095105,Sexually transmitted diseases,2019 05 16,Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum DNA and RNA were detected in a semen specimen of a syphilis patient with no genital or anal sores and no clinically evident orchitis.

The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Committee on Nutrition (CoN) performed a review of the literature with the aim to provide guidance on how to feed infants born LMPT, and identify gaps in the literature and research priorities.Only limited data from controlled trials are available. Late preterm infants have unique, often unrecognized, vulnerabilities that predispose them to high rates of nutritionally related morbidity and hospital readmissions. They frequently have feeding difficulties that delay hospital discharge, and poorer rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration compared with term infants. This review also identified that moderately preterm infants frequently exhibit postnatal growth restriction.The ESPGHAN CoN strongly endorses breast milk as the preferred method of feeding LMPT infants and also emphasizes that mothers of LMPT infants should receive qualified, extended lactation support, and frequent follow-up. Individualized feeding plans should be promoted. Hospital discharge should be delayed until LMPT infants have a safe discharge plan that takes into account local situation and resources.In the LMPT population, the need for active nutritional support increases with lower gestational ages. There may be a role for enhanced nutritional support including the use of human milk fortifier, enriched formula, parenteral nutrition, and/or additional supplements, depending on factors, such as gestational age, birth weight, and significant comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess the benefits (improved nutrient intakes) versus risks (interruption of breast-feeding) of providing nutrient-enrichment to the LMPT infant.",Physical Activity Promotion: Highlights from the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095090,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019 05 16,This article describes effective interventions to promote regular physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior that were identified as part of the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.,Effects of Physical Activity in Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Umbrella Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095089,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019 05 22,"We conducted a systematic umbrella review to evaluate the literature relating to effects of physical activity on pain, physical function, health-related quality of life, comorbid conditions and osteoarthritis (OA) structural disease progression in individuals with lower-extremity OA.",Physical Activity to Prevent and Treat Hypertension: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095088,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019 05 16,This systematic umbrella review examines and updates the evidence on the relationship between physical activity (PA) and blood pressure (BP) presented in the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report.,"Physical Activity, Injurious Falls, and Physical Function in Aging: An Umbrella Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095087,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019 05 22,"To review and update the evidence of the relationship between physical activity, risk of fall-related injury, and physical function in community-dwelling older people that was presented in the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report (PAGAC Report).",Benefits of Physical Activity during Pregnancy and Postpartum: An Umbrella Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095086,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019 05 22,"This study aimed to summarize the evidence from the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report, including new evidence from an updated search of the effects of physical activity on maternal health during pregnancy and postpartum.",Physical Activity and Health in Children Younger than 6 Years: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095085,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,2019 05 22,"Physical activity is known to provide important health benefits in school-age youth.
