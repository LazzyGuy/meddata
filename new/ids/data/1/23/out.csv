Findings indicated that burnout was primarily driven by work-related factors including frequently feeling overwhelmed with job-related duties, inadequate organizational support, and direct exposure to graphic materials involving children. Moreover, having a higher degree of compassion satisfaction and being non-White significantly mitigated symptoms of burnout. Qualitative findings indicated that FIs regularly experienced varied and personalized feelings of burnout and utilized a variety of coping methods to combat their stressors. FIs in this study also made individual suggestions regarding how their respective agencies can assist in the coping process.

In contrast, only the subset of individuals with insulin resistance and/or diabetes receives cardiovascular benefits with fibrates. In this context, previous observations from our laboratory suggested that atorvastatin induced an increase in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), whereas fenofibrate had the opposite effects in rabbits. Therefore, we determined the mass, morphology, and vascularization of VAT in New Zealand white rabbits (n = 6/group) that received 0.33 or 2.6 mg/kg/d of atorvastatin or fenofibrate, respectively, during 2 months. As expected, the cholesterol from the atorvastatin group was lower after treatment, while triglycerides decreased in the fenofibrate group. The mass of VAT from the fenofibrate group was 46% lower compared to the controls, meanwhile atorvastatin was associated with a larger diameter of adipocytes (+65%) than that of the control and fenofibrate groups. Fibroblast growth factor 2 ( FGF2) gene expression was lower in the fenofibrate group than in the control group (-54%). By contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) gene expression in fenofibrate-treated rabbits was 110% higher than in the control group. In agreement with the gene expression, the marker of angiogenesis platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 was slightly but significantly higher (+10%) in rabbits treated with fenofibrate than in controls, as determined by immunohistochemistry. These results suggest that fenofibrate is associated with a favorable remodeling of VAT, that is, reduced mass and increased vascularization in normolipemic rabbits; in contrast, atorvastatin induced a nonfavorable remodeling of VAT. These results may be related to the cardiovascular benefits of fenofibrate and the increased risk of T2D in high-risk patients induced by atorvastatin.","Implementation, Uptake, and Culture Change: Results of a Key Informant Study of a Workplace Mental Health Training Program in Police Organizations in Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056932,Canadian journal of psychiatry.

This biosorbent has been utilized as a viable effective biosorbent in the removing of methylene blue hydrate (MB), malachite green oxalate(MG), methyl violet 2B(MV) dyes from synthetic wastewater. The biosorbents were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Various parameters such as contact time, solution concentration, pH and amount of biosorbent were investigated in order to evaluate the potential of the nanomaterials immobilized on natural wastes as sorbing biomaterials for the cationic dyes. Study on sorption kinetic and the sorption isotherm was carried out and best fitting models for the rate kinetics and isotherms were suggested. Langmuir isotherm was observed to be compatible with the isotherm models. The STSPF in the raw form showed the best dye sorption capacity of 43.67 mg/g for MG, 25.32 mg/g for MV, and 126.60 mg/g for MB.

In this work, the polysaccharide isolated from the corm of Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott or taro tuber (CEM) was utilized for removing methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution by batch adsorption method. The CEM adsorbent was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The solution pH and adsorbent dose have been found to have a significant positive correlation with the adsorptive removal efficiency of CEM for MB dye. The removal efficiency of CEM was found to be 72.35% under the optimum conditions; 20 mg/L initial concentration of dye, 120 mg of adsorbent dose, solution pH 8.5, 311.2 K temperature and 80 min contact time. The adsorption of MB onto CEM followed best the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics. The adsorption was thermodynamically favorable and was endothermic in nature. The desorption/adsorption data justifiably indicated the reuse capability of CEM adsorbent for MB adsorption. Hence, CEM may be regarded as an eco-friendly and cost-effective natural adsorbent for MB dye removal from aqueous solution."

Each lipid molecule stays within one leaflet of the bilayer before it undergoes a transition or flip-flop to the other leaflet. The corresponding flip-flop times are very different for different lipid species and vary over several orders of magnitude. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the consequences of this separation of time scales for compositionally asymmetric bilayers. We first study bilayers with two lipid components that do not undergo flip-flops on the accessible time scales. In such a situation, one must distinguish a bilayer state in which both leaflets have the same preferred area from another state in which each leaflet is tensionless. However, when we add a third lipid component that undergoes frequent flip-flops, the bilayer relaxes towards the state with tensionless leaflets, not to the state with equal preferred leaflet areas. Furthermore, we show that bilayers with compositional asymmetry acquire a significant spontaneous curvature even if both leaflets are tensionless. Our results can be extended to lipid bilayers with a large number of lipid components provided at least one of these components undergoes frequent flip-flops. For cellular membranes containing lipid pumps, the leaflet tensions also depend on the rates of protein-induced flip-flops.",Discovery of FAHFA-Containing Triacylglycerols and Their Metabolic Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056915,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 13,"FAHFAs are a class of bioactive lipids, which show great promise for treating diabetes and inflammatory diseases. Deciphering the metabolic pathways that regulate endogenous FAHFA levels is critical for developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, it remains unclear how FAHFAs are metabolized in cells or tissues. Here, we investigate whether FAHFAs can be incorporated into other lipid classes and identify a novel class of endogenous lipids, FAHFA-containing triacylglycerols (FAHFA-TGs), which contain a FAHFA group esterified to the glycerol backbone. Isotope-labeled FAHFAs are incorporated into FAHFA-TGs when added to differentiated adipocytes, which implies the existence of enzymes and metabolic pathways capable of synthesizing these lipids. Induction of lipolysis (i.e., triacylglycerol hydrolysis) in adipocytes is associated with marked increases in nonesterified FAHFA levels, demonstrating that FAHFA-TGs breakdown is a regulator of cellular FAHFA levels. To quantify FAHFA levels in FAHFA-TGs and determine their regioisomeric distributions, we developed a mild alkaline hydrolysis method that liberates FAHFAs from triacylglycerols for easier detection. FAHFA-TG concentrations are greater than 100-fold than that of nonesterified FAHFAs, indicating that FAHFA-TGs are a major reservoir of FAHFAs in cells and tissues. The discovery of FAHFA-TGs reveals a new branch of TG and FAHFA metabolism with potential roles in metabolic health and regulation of inflammation.",Bio-Inspired Flexible Fluoropolymer Film for All-Mode Light Extraction Enhancement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056914,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 30,"Enhancing the light extraction efficiency is a prevalent but vital challenge for most solid-state lighting technologies, especially for deep ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (DUV-LEDs). In this paper, inspired by the microstructure of the butterfly's eye, we propose and fabricate a flexible fluoropolymer film (FFP film) to tackle this issue for all-mode, full-wavelength light extraction enhancement for most solid-state lighting technologies compatibly. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with one mounted with a smooth FFP film, the light output power of DUV-LED is enhanced up to 26.7% by mounting the FFP film with 325 nm radius nanocones at a driving current of 200 mA. Importantly, thanks to the super-flexible feature of the FFP film, it can both cover the top surface and sidewalls of the DUV-LED chip, leading to the improvement of transverse electric and transverse magnetic mode light extraction by 20.5 and 21.8%, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulations of the electric field distribution of DUV-LEDs with the FFP film reveal the underlying physics. The present strategy is proposed from the view of the packaging level, which is cost-effective, able to be manufactured at a large scale, and compatible with the solid-state lighting technologies.",Macrofluidic Device for Preparative Concentration Based on Epitachophoresis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056913,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"We have developed a new separation device to concentrate and collect ions from several milliliter sample volumes to microliter fractions. Unlike most conventional platforms, this device has circular architecture. The electrophoretic migration operates from the outer perimeter toward the center. Separations can be performed both in continuous (zone electrophoresis) and discontinuous (moving boundary) electrolyte systems. We use a discontinuous electrolyte system comprising a leading and a terminating electrolyte to concentrate samples containing small organic anions and DNA fragment. The agarose gel stabilizes the boundary between the leading and terminating electrolytes. The milliliter volume sample is mixed with the terminating electrolyte and migrates through the gel toward the center. The concentrated total sample is collected in microliter fraction at the center. The potential for preparative concentration of DNA is demonstrated using a DNA ladder. Because zone migration accelerates as it moves toward the center, we named this method Epitachophoresis from the Greek word ""επιταχυνω (epitachýnο)"", meaning ""acceleration"".

In this Review, the majority of reported studies and developments of electrochemical affinity biosensors for cyanotoxins are critically reviewed and discussed. Essential background information about cyanobacterial toxins and electrochemical biosensors is combined with the rapidly moving development of electrochemical biosensors for these toxins.

They are to comply with the increasingly stringent requirements set by stakeholders, such as the automotive industry and manufacturers of hydrogen safety systems, where sensor deactivation is a severe but widely unaddressed problem. In response, we report intrinsically deactivation-resistant nanoplasmonic hydrogen sensors enabled by a rationally designed ternary PdAuCu alloy nanomaterial, which combines the identified best intrinsic attributes of the constituent binary Pd alloys. This way, we achieve extraordinary hydrogen sensing metrics in synthetic air and poisoning gas background, simulating real application conditions. Specifically, we find a detection limit in the low ppm range, hysteresis-free response over 5 orders of magnitude hydrogen pressure, subsecond response time at room temperature, long-term stability, and, as the key, excellent resistance to deactivating species like carbon monoxide, notably without application of any protective coatings. This constitutes an important step forward for optical hydrogen sensor technology, as it enables application under demanding conditions and provides a blueprint for further material and performance optimization by combining and concerting intrinsic material assets in multicomponent nanoparticles. In a wider context, our findings highlight the potential of rational materials design through alloying of multiple elements for gas sensor development, as well as the potential of engineered metal alloy nanoparticles in nanoplasmonics and catalysis.","Role of Liposome Size, Surface Charge, and PEGylation on Rheumatoid Arthritis Targeting Therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056910,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, progressive autoimmune disease. The vascular permeability of inflamed joints in RA makes it a natural candidate for passive targeting, similar to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in solid tumors. Thus, various therapeutic drugs have been encapsulated in nanocarriers to achieve longer in vivo circulation times and improve RA targeting. Although liposomes are the most widely used nanocarriers for RA treatment, the effects of physical and chemical characteristics of liposomes, such as particle sizes, surface charge, polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain length, and PEG concentration, on their passive RA targeting effect have not been fully elucidated. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of physical and chemical properties of liposomes on circulation time and conducted preliminary studies on their passive targeting mechanisms. A series of liposomes with different particle sizes (70, 100, 200, and 350 nm), surface charges (positive, negative, slight positive, and slight negative), PEG chain lengths (1, 2, and 5 kDa), and concentrations (5, 10, and 20% w/w of total lipid) were prepared by lipid film dispersion and extrusion. The pharmacokinetics of liposomes with different formulas were evaluated with a fluorescence microplate reader. A collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model was utilized to mimic RA pathological conditions and to evaluate the targeting and efficacy of liposomes with different properties using a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system. Uptake of fluorescent liposomes by various synovial cells was measured by flow cytometry. The results indicated that liposomes with 100 nm diameter, a slight negative charge, and 10% incorporation of 5 kDa PEG had better in vivo circulation time and inflamed joint targeting than did other liposomes. Dexamethasone (Dex) was encapsulated into optimized liposomes as an active ingredient for RA treatment. Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrated that Dex liposomes could significantly improve the antiarthritic efficacy of Dex in a CIA mouse model of RA. This study also found that the retention mechanism of RA was mainly increased because of the uptake of liposomes by fibroblasts and macrophages in inflamed joints. This study provides a persuasive explanation for passive RA targeting by liposomes and advances our ability to treat RA with nanomedicine.",Lead and Arsenic in Shed Deciduous Teeth of Children Living Near a Lead-Acid Battery Smelter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056909,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 23,"Lead (Pb) is a potent neurotoxicant with no safe level of exposure. Elevated levels of Pb and arsenic (As) are found in the air and soil near facilities that recycle lead-acid batteries in the United States. In urban Los Angeles County, California, a facility processed ∼11 million batteries per year and operated for decades without proper environmental review. Measuring Pb and As in shed deciduous teeth is a promising technique to assess prenatal and early life exposure. In this pilot study coined the ""Truth Fairy"" Project, 50 shed deciduous teeth from 43 children living their entire lives within 2 miles of the smelter were analyzed to understand retrospective exposure to toxic metals using a community-driven research approach. Concentrations of Pb and As in teeth were assessed using laser-ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Soil Pb concentrations were determined using spatial kriging of surface soil measurements. The mean prenatal calcium normalized Pb levels in teeth samples (reported as a ratio 208Pb:43Ca) was 4.104 × 10-4 (SD 4.123 × 10-4), and the mean postnatal 208Pb:43Ca level was 4.109 × 10-4 (SD 3.369 × 10-4). Adjusted for maternal education and batch, we observe positive significant relationship between prenatal teeth Pb per 100 ppm increase in soil Pb (β = 3.48, 95% CI 1.11, 5.86). The Truth Fairy study suggests prenatal and early life exposure to toxic metals is associated with legacy soil contamination in an urban community near a smelter.",Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching in β-Lactam-Interacting Proteins Is Modulated by the Structure of Intermediates and Final Products of the Acylation Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056908,ACS infectious diseases,2019 05 15,"In most bacteria, β-lactam antibiotics inhibit the last cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis by acylation of the active-site Ser of d,d-transpeptidases belonging to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) family. In mycobacteria, cross-linking is mainly ensured by l,d-transpeptidases (LDTs), which are promising targets for the development of β-lactam-based therapies for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. For this purpose, fluorescence spectroscopy is used to investigate the efficacy of LDT inactivation by β-lactams but the basis for fluorescence quenching during enzyme acylation remains unknown. In contrast to what has been reported for PBPs, we show here using a model l,d-transpeptidase (Ldtfm) that fluorescence quenching of Trp residues does not depend upon direct hydrophobic interaction between Trp residues and β-lactams. Rather, Trp fluorescence was quenched by the drug covalently bound to the active-site Cys residue of Ldtfm. Fluorescence quenching was not quantitatively determined by the size of the drug and was not specific of the thioester link connecting the β-lactam carbonyl to the catalytic Cys as quenching was also observed for acylation of the active-site Ser of β-lactamase BlaC from M. tuberculosis. Fluorescence quenching was extensive for reaction intermediates containing an amine anion and for acylenzymes containing an imine stabilized by mesomeric effect, but not for acylenzymes containing a protonated β-lactam nitrogen. Together, these results indicate that the extent of fluorescence quenching is determined by the status of the β-lactam nitrogen. Thus, fluorescence kinetics can provide information not only on the efficacy of enzyme inactivation but also on the structure of the covalent adducts responsible for enzyme inactivation.","Heterogenized Molecular Catalysts: Vibrational Sum-Frequency Spectroscopic, Electrochemical, and Theoretical Investigations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056907,Accounts of chemical research,2019 05 23,"Rhenium and manganese bipyridyl tricarbonyl complexes have attracted intense interest for their promising applications in photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction in both homogeneous and heterogenized systems. To date, there have been extensive studies on immobilizing Re catalysts on solid surfaces for higher catalytic efficiency, reduced catalyst loading, and convenient product separation. However, in order for the heterogenized molecular catalysts to achieve the combination of the best aspects of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, it is essential to understand the fundamental physicochemical properties of such heterogeneous systems, such as surface-bound structures of Re/Mn catalysts, substrate-adsorbate interactions, and photoinduced or electric-field-induced effects on Re/Mn catalysts. For example, the surface may act to (un)block substrates, (un)trap charges, (de)stabilize particular intermediates (and thus affect scaling relations), and shift potentials in different directions, just as protein environments do. The close collaboration between the Lian, Batista, and Kubiak groups has resulted in an integrated approach to investigate how the semiconductor or metal surface affects the properties of the attached catalyst. Synthetic strategies to achieve stable and controlled attachment of Re/Mn molecular catalysts have been developed. Steady-state, time-resolved, and electrochemical vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopic studies have provided insight into the effects of interfacial structures, ultrafast vibrational energy relaxation, and electric field on the Re/Mn catalysts, respectively. Various computational methods utilizing density functional theory (DFT) have been developed and applied to determine the molecular orientation by direct comparison to spectroscopy, unravel vibrational energy relaxation mechanisms, and quantify the interfacial electric field strength of the Re/Mn catalyst systems. This Account starts with a discussion of the recent progress in determining the surface-bound structures of Re catalysts on semiconductor and Au surfaces by a combined vibrational SFG and DFT study. The effects of crystal facet, length of anchoring ligands, and doping of the semiconductor on the bound structures of Re catalysts and of the substrate itself are discussed. This is followed by a summary of the progress in understanding the vibrational relaxation (VR) dynamics of Re catalysts covalently adsorbed on semiconductor and metal surfaces. The VR processes of Re catalysts on TiO2 films and TiO2 single crystals and a Re catalyst tethered on Au, particularly the role of electron-hole pair (EHP)-induced coupling on the VR of the Re catalyst bound on Au, are discussed. The Account also summarizes recent studies in quantifying the electric field strength experienced by the catalytically active site of the Re/Mn catalyst bound on a Au electrode based on a combined electrochemical SFG and DFT study of the Stark tuning of the CO stretching modes of these catalysts. Finally, future research directions on surface-immobilized molecular catalyst systems are discussed."

In this work, we demonstrate a new route to achieve magnetic manipulation of a giant NTE in (Mn0.95Ni0.05)CoGe via strong magnetostructural (MS) coupling around room temperature (∼275 to ∼345 K). The MS coupling is realized through the weak bonding between the nonmagnetic CoGe-network and the magnetic Mn-sublattice. Application of a magnetic field changes the NTE in (Mn0.95Ni0.05)CoGe significantly: in particular, a change of Δ L/ L along the a axis of absolute value 15290(60) × 10-6-equivalent to a -31% reduction in NTE-is obtained at 295 K in response to a magnetic field of 8 T.",Microstructured Porous Pyramid-Based Ultrahigh Sensitive Pressure Sensor Insensitive to Strain and Temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056895,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 30,"An ultrahigh sensitive capacitive pressure sensor based on a porous pyramid dielectric layer (PPDL) is reported. Compared to that of the conventional pyramid dielectric layer, the sensitivity was drastically increased to 44.5 kPa-1 in the pressure range <100 Pa, an unprecedented sensitivity for capacitive pressure sensors. The enhanced sensitivity is attributed to a lower compressive modulus and larger change in an effective dielectric constant under pressure. By placing the pressure sensors on islands of hard elastomer embedded in a soft elastomer substrate, the sensors exhibited insensitivity to strain. The pressure sensors were also nonresponsive to temperature. Finally, a contact resistance-based pressure sensor is also demonstrated by chemically grafting PPDL with a conductive polymer, which also showed drastically enhanced sensitivity.",Confined Water-Assistant Thermal Response of a Graphene Oxide Heterostructure and Its Enabled Mechanical Sensors for Load Sensing and Mode Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056894,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 30,"Mechanically responsive features are essential in devising mechanical sensors capable of sensing and differentiating loadings. We present a heterostructure composed of bilayer graphene oxides and confined water as a mechanical sensor that enables the detection and differentiation of tension, compression, pressure, and bending. Guided by molecular simulations, we demonstrate that the thermal transport across solid-liquid interfaces is sensitive to loading modes owing to the reversible response of hydrogen-bonding networks between confined water molecules and graphene oxides and quantitatively elucidate the thermal transport mechanism by correlating the thermal conductance, number, and distribution of hydrogen bonds and interfacial energy with mechanical loadings. Such structure-enabled mechanical sensor with contrasting thermal response to different loading modes is devised to exemplify the robustness of sensing functions. These results lay a foundation for rational designs of mechanical sensors that leverage the thermal response of solid-liquid systems beyond the current strategy relying on the electrical properties of sole solids.",Oxygen-Valve Formed in Cobaltite-Based Heterostructures by Ionic Liquid and Ferroelectric Dual-Gating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056893,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 30,"Manipulation of oxygen vacancies via electric-field-controlled ionic liquid gating has been reported in many model systems within the emergent fields of oxide electronics and iontronics. It is then significant to investigate the oxygen vacancy formation/annihilation and migration across an additional ferroelectric layer with ionic liquid gating. Here, we report that via a combination of ionic liquid and ferroelectric gating, the remote control of oxygen vacancies and magnetic phase transition can be achieved in SrCoO2.5 films capped with an ultrathin ferroelectric BaTiO3 layer at room temperature. The ultrathin BaTiO3 layer acts as an atomic oxygen valve and is semitransparent to oxygen-ion transport due to the competing interaction between vertical electron tunneling and ferroelectric polarization plus surface electrochemical changes in itself, thus resulting in the striking emergence of new mixed-phase SrCoO x. The lateral coexistence of brownmillerite phase SrCoO2.5 and perovskite phase SrCoO3-δ was directly observed by transmission electron microscopy. Besides the fundamental significance of long-range interaction in ionic liquid gating, the ability to control the flow of oxygen ions across the heterointerface by the oxygen valve provides a new approach on the atomic scale for designing multistate memories, sensors, and solid-oxide fuel cells.",Efficacy of MPFF 1000 mg oral suspension on CVD C0s-C1-related symptoms and quality of life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056892,International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology,2019 05 06,"To show the efficacy of micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) 1000 mg in the mild cases of chronic venous disorders (CVD), i.e. in C0s-C1 patients according to the CEAP classification.",Factors associated with spontaneous abortion following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056891,JBRA assisted reproduction,2019 05 06,The aim of this study was to describe the miscarriage rates and the factors associated with cases of spontaneous abortion observed in women offered intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).,Autoimmune hypothyroidism and intermittent ovarian failure - Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056890,JBRA assisted reproduction,2019 05 06,"a 35 year-old physical educator sought gynecological care for secondary amenorrhea and infertility. She denied the occurrence of similar problems in her family and referred to hypothyroidism as her only comorbidity, for which she was on levothyroxine 88µg daily. She was tested for beta-HCG, prolactin and TSH levels. She was negative for beta-HCG, and had prolactin and TSH levels of 19ng/ml and 2.04 mIU/ml, respectively. Her progesterone test was negative. The combined test (estradiol + norethisterone acetate) was positive, excluding the possibility of an anatomical cause.

However, the excessive inflammatory reaction may aggravate the myocardial injury. For this reason, the immediate control of the post-injury inflammatory reaction is the principal therapeutic measure and the research hotspot at the present. Acupuncture intervention has been demonstrated to have positive roles in relieving MI and inflammatory reaction by suppressing myocardial inflammatory cytokines (suppressing IL-1β， TNF-α， IL-8, etc.), adjusting inflammatory reaction pathway (NF-κB signaling, TGF-β， etc.)and activating cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.

Cognitive science,2019 05 06,"Delusions are symptoms of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia. By and large, delusions are characterized by their behavioral manifestations and defined as irrational beliefs that compromise good functioning. In this overview paper, we ask whether delusions can be adaptive notwithstanding their negative features. Can they be a response to a crisis rather than the source of the crisis? Can they be the beginning of a solution rather than the problem? Some of the psychological, psychiatric, and philosophical literature has recently suggested that they can. We consider different types of delusions and different ways in which they can be considered as adaptive: psychologically (e.g., by increasing wellbeing, purpose in life, intrapsychic coherence, or good functioning) and biologically (e.g., by enhancing genetic fitness). Although further research is needed to map the costs and benefits of adopting and maintaining delusional beliefs, a more nuanced picture of the role of delusions in people's lives has started to emerge.

HLA plays a major role in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Typing of cord blood samples for HLA alleles has been performed based on the serological and molecular methods. However, with the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, HLA typing becomes more accurate and unambiguous (upto intron level). Contamination of cord blood cells with erythropoietic cells poses a challenge in DNA extraction and downstream application. In the present study, DNA extracted from buffy coat of cord blood samples was typed for HLA-A, -B, -C, DRB1, and DQB1 alleles by Illumina miniseq and the sequences were aligned, phased, and mapped by MIA FORA software algorithms.

The endocannabinoid system plays a critical role in habit learning and in ethanol self-administration, but the role of this neuromodulatory system in the expression of habitual alcohol seeking is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the endocannabinoid system in established alcohol habits using contingency degradation in male C57BL/6 mice. We found that administration of the novel diacyl glycerol lipase inhibitor DO34, which decreases the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), reduced habitual responding for ethanol and ethanol approach behaviors. Moreover, administration of the endocannabinoid transport inhibitor AM404 or the cannabinoid receptor type 1 antagonist AM251 produced similar reductions in habitual responding for ethanol and ethanol approach behaviors. Notably, AM404 was also able to reduce ethanol seeking and consumption in mice that were insensitive to lithium chloride-induced devaluation of ethanol. Conversely, administration of JZL184, a monoacyl glycerol lipase inhibitor that increases levels of 2-AG, increased motivation to respond for ethanol on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. These results demonstrate an important role for endocannabinoid signaling in the motivation to seek ethanol, in ethanol-motivated habits, and suggest that pharmacological manipulations of endocannabinoid signaling could be effective therapeutics for treating alcohol use disorder.",Wide-field optical property mapping and structured light imaging of the esophagus with spatial frequency domain imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056845,Journal of biophotonics,2019 06 14,"As the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma continues to rise, there is a need for improved imaging technologies with contrast to abnormal esophageal tissues.

Histopathology was used to categorize tissue types, including normal, inflammation, fibrotic, ulceration, Barrett's Esophagus and squamous cell carcinoma. Average absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of normal tissues were 0.211 ± 0.051 and 1.20 ± 0.18 mm-1 , respectively at 471 nm, and both values decreased monotonically with increasing wavelength. Fibrotic tissue exhibited at least 68% larger scattering signal across all wavelengths, while squamous cell carcinoma exhibited a 36% decrease in scattering at 471 nm.

One mechanism through which SES may confer risk for ADHD is by influencing brain structure. Alterations to cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume have been associated with low SES and with the presence of ADHD across multiple studies. The current study examined whether cortical thickness, surface area or subcortical volume mediate the associations between SES and ADHD in youth 3-21 years old (N = 874) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition and Genetics Study. Freesurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume from structural magnetic resonance imaging. Parents reported on demographics, family SES, ADHD diagnoses and the presence of child attention problems. Statistical mediation was assessed using a bootstrap resampling procedure. Controlling for parental ADHD, child age, gender, birth weight and scanner, children in low SES families were more likely to be in the ADHD group. Consistent with previous reports in this sample, low SES was associated with reduced surface area across the frontal lobe and reduced subcortical volume in the amygdala, cerebellum, hippocampus and basal ganglia. Of these regions, a significant indirect effect of SES on ADHD status through subcortical volume was observed for the left cerebellum (95% confidence interval: 0.004, 0.022), the right cerebellum (95% confidence interval: 0.006, 0.025), and the right caudate (95% confidence interval: 0.002, 0.022). Environmentally mediated changes in the cerebellum and the caudate may be neurodevelopmental mechanisms explaining elevated risk of ADHD in children in low SES families.","Drug screening in Drosophila; why, when, and when not?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056843,Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

The cellular mechanism(s) of these EtOH effects may range from synaptic signaling modulation to alterations of the epigenome. Previously, we reported that two binge-like exposures to EtOH (3 g/kg, ip, 9 h apart) in adolescent rats abolished long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in hippocampus slices, induced learning deficits, and increased N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling through its GluN2B subunit after 48 hours. Here, we tested the hypothesis of EtOH-induced epigenetic alterations leading to modulation of GluN2B and GluN2A NMDA receptor subunits. Forty-two days old rats were treated with EtOH or the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) sodium butyrate (NaB, 600 mg/kg, ip) injected alone or 30 minutes before EtOH. After 48 hours, learning was tested with novel object recognition while synaptic plasticity and the role of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits in NMDA-fEPSP were measured in CA1 field of hippocampus slices. LTD and memory were impaired 48 hours after EtOH and NMDA-fEPSP analysis unraveled changes in the GluN2A/GluN2B balance. These results were associated with an increase in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity and HDAC2 mRNA and protein while Ac-H4K12 labelling was decreased. EtOH increases expression of HDAC2 and mRNA level for GluN2B subunit (but not GluN2A), while HDAC2 modulates the promoter of the gene encoding GluN2B. Interestingly, NaB pretreatment prevented all the cellular and memory-impairing effects of EtOH. In conclusion, the memory-impairing effects of two binge-like EtOH exposure involve NMDA receptor-dependent LTD deficits due to a GluN2A/GluN2B imbalance resulting from changes in GluN2B expression induced by HDAC2.",Global patterns of intraspecific leaf trait responses to elevation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056841,Global change biology,2019 06 12,"Elevational gradients are often used to quantify how traits of plant species respond to abiotic and biotic environmental variations. Yet, such analyses are frequently restricted spatially and applied along single slopes or mountain ranges. Since we know little on the response of intraspecific leaf traits to elevation across the globe, we here perform a global meta-analysis of leaf traits in 109 plant species located in 4 continents and reported in 71 studies published between 1983 and 2018. We quantified the intraspecific change in seven morpho-ecophysiological leaf traits along global elevational gradients: specific leaf area (SLA), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf area (LA), nitrogen concentration per unit of area (Narea), nitrogen concentration per unit mass (Nmass), phosphorous concentration per unit mass (Pmass) and carbon isotope composition (δ13 C). We found LMA, Narea, Nmass and δ13 C to significantly increase and SLA to decrease with increasing elevation. Conversely, LA and Pmass showed no significant pattern with elevation worldwide. We found significantly larger increase in Narea, Nmass, Pmass and δ13 C with elevation in warmer regions. Larger responses to increasing elevation were apparent for SLA of herbaceous compared to woody species, but not for the other traits. Finally, we also detected evidences of covariation across morphological and physiological traits within the same elevational gradient. In sum, we demonstrate that there are common cross-species patterns of intraspecific leaf trait variation across elevational gradients worldwide. Irrespective of whether such variation is genetically determined via local adaptation or attributed to phenotypic plasticity, the leaf trait patterns quantified here suggest that plant species are adapted to live on a range of temperature conditions. Since the distribution of mountain biota is predominantly shifting upslope in response to changes in environmental conditions, our results are important to further our understanding of how plants species of mountain ecosystems adapt to global environmental change."

In the absence of other types of community resources, schools may be one of the few community resources that can help buffer children from the negative effects of community violence exposure. We sampled 8,300 students ranging in age from 6-18 years in 123 schools from the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo to examine whether and how two distinct dimensions of positive school climate can protect two key features of children's social-emotional development in the presence of community violence. Multi-level models tested the hypothesis that students' perceptions of a positive school climate moderated the relation between community violence and self-reported mental health problems and peer victimization. Findings support the hypothesis. Specifically, a positive school climate protected against mental health problems and peer victimization in the presence of high community violence. Students who experienced high community violence and a negative school climate generally demonstrated the worst development. We find complex interactions between the dimensions of school climate and exposure to violence on student social-emotional development that highlight the salience of children's contexts for developmental studies in low-income countries. We use dynamic developmental systems theory and differential impact to discuss the dual potential of schools as a buffer against the effects of violence or as a source of compounded risk.",Transforming growth factor beta-induced p.(L558P) variant is associated with autosomal dominant lattice corneal dystrophy type IV in a large cohort of Spanish patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056827,Clinical & experimental ophthalmology,2019 05 23,Rare transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) gene variants are involved in autosomal dominant corneal dystrophies (CDs) with heterogeneous clinical features.,13-step Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)-Jungermatrobrunin A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056826,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 06,"A concise and enantioselective total synthesis of (+)-jungermatrobrunin A (1), possessing a unique bicyclo[3.2.1]octene ring skeleton with an unprecedented peroxide bridge, was accomplished in 13 steps via a visible light mediated late-stage Schenck ene reaction of (-)-1α,6α-diacetoxyjungermannenone C (2).

In stony corals, the characteristics and functions of gonadal somatic cells remain largely unknown. No molecular markers are currently available that allow for the identification and enrichment of gonadal somatic cells in corals. Here, we showed that the testicular somatic cells of a stony coral, Euphyllia ancora, express an endogenous green fluorescent protein (GFP). Fluorescence microscopy showed that, in contrast to the endogenous expression of the red fluorescent protein of E. ancora ovaries that we have previously reported, the testes displayed a distinct green fluorescence. Molecular identification and spectrum characterization demonstrated that E. ancora testes expressed a GFP (named EaGFP) that is a homolog of the GFP from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria and that possesses an excitation maximum of 506 nm and an emission maximum of 514 nm. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the testicular somatic cells, but not the germ cells, expressed EaGFP. EaGFP was enclosed within one or a few granules in the cytoplasm of testicular somatic cells, and the granule number decreased as spermatogenesis proceeded. We also showed that testicular somatic cells could be enriched by using endogenous GFP as an indicator. The present study not only revealed one of the unique cellular characteristics of coral testicular cells but also established a technical basis for more in-depth investigations of the function of testicular somatic cells in spermatogenesis in future studies.",Palatal morphology in unilateral cleft lip and palate patients: Association with infant cleft dimensions and timing of hard palate repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056824,Orthodontics & craniofacial research,2019 05 21,To assess the impact of cleft severity and timing of hard palate repair on palatal dimensions in unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) children.,Quality and quantity of genetic relatedness data affect the analysis of social structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056823,Molecular ecology resources,2019 06 05,"Kinship plays a fundamental role in the evolution of social systems and is considered a key driver of group living. To understand the role of kinship in the formation and maintenance of social bonds, accurate measures of genetic relatedness are critical. Genotype-by-sequencing technologies are rapidly advancing the accuracy and precision of genetic relatedness estimates for wild populations. The ability to assign kinship from genetic data varies depending on a species' or population's mating system and pattern of dispersal, and empirical data from longitudinal studies are crucial to validate these methods. We use data from a long-term behavioural study of a polygynandrous, bisexually philopatric marine mammal to measure accuracy and precision of parentage and genetic relatedness estimation against a known partial pedigree. We show that with moderate but obtainable sample sizes of approximately 4,235 SNPs and 272 individuals, highly accurate parentage assignments and genetic relatedness coefficients can be obtained. Additionally, we subsample our data to quantify how data availability affects relatedness estimation and kinship assignment. Lastly, we conduct a social network analysis to investigate the extent to which accuracy and precision of relatedness estimation improve statistical power to detect an effect of relatedness on social structure.

We examined the diffusion characteristics of BPGs through cartilage with the use of a custom-made in vitro cartilage diffusion model in both normal bovine and human osteoarthritic cartilage explants. BPGs were introduced into the cartilage through essentially one-dimensional diffusion using osteochondral plugs. The molecular diffusion was shown to be size and concentration dependent. Diffusion profiles were found over different diffusion time intervals and the profiles were fit to a nonlinear Fickian diffusion model. Steady state 011012-7diffusion coefficients for BPGs were found to be 4.01 and 3.53 μm2 /s for 180 and 1600 kDa BPGs, respectfully, and these values are similar to other large molecule diffusion in cartilage. In both bovine and osteoarthritic human cartilage, BPGs were found localized around the chondrocytes. BPG localization was examined by labeling collagen type VI and soaking 5 μm thick sections of cartilage with BPG solutions demonstrating that the BPGs diffused into the cartilage and preferentially localized alongside collagen type VI in the pericellular matrix.","Converging function, structure, and behavioural features of emotion regulation in very preterm children.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056820,Human brain mapping,2019 05 06,"Children born very preterm (VPT; <32 weeks' gestational age) are at high risk for emotional regulation and social communication impairments. However, the underlying neurobiological correlates of these difficulties remain poorly understood. Using a multimodal approach, including both magnetoencephalographic and structural magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the functional, structural, and behavioural characteristics of socio-emotional processing in 19 school-age children born VPT and 21 age-matched term-born (TB) children (7-13 years). Structural MRI analyses were conducted on a subset of these groups (16 VPT and 21 age-matched TB). Results showed that the inhibition of aversive socio-emotional stimuli was associated with a sustained reduction of right frontoparietal functional brain activity in children born VPT children. Moreover, whole brain structural analyses showed that reductions of cortical thickness or volume in these regions were associated with poor socio-emotional performance in children born VPT. Hence, our results suggest that functional and structural alterations encompassing the frontoparietal areas might be a biological marker of less efficient emotion regulation processes/performance in school-age children born VPT. These findings open up novel avenues to investigate the potential impact of such atypicalities, and in particular, those related to the atypical maturation of the medial prefrontal regions, on the frequent development of psychiatric disorders in this vulnerable population."

The role of circRNAs in osteoporosis remains largely unknown. Here, we explore the expression of circRNAs in osteoporosis using microarray analysis, and identify potential circRNAs associated with osteoporosis by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation and statistical analysis in clinical samples. As a result, circ_0006873 and circ_0002060 were found to be significantly upregulated between nonosteoporotic controls and osteoporosis patients (n = 40, respectively). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the level of circ_0006873 and circ_0002060 were associated with the low-bone mineral density in patients with osteoporosis. Furthermore, ROC analysis indicated that circ_0002060 showed potential diagnostic value for osteoporosis.

The objective of this multicenter, retrospective, case series study was to describe neurological signs and MRI findings in a group of dogs that presented for spinal pain or other neurological deficits and had multiple myeloma. Electronic records of four veterinary referral hospitals were reviewed. Dogs were included if they had a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma, had presented for spinal pain or other neurological signs, and had undergone MRI of the vertebral column. The MRI studies were evaluated and the anatomical location of lesion(s), signal intensity, presence of extra-dural material, degree of spinal cord compression, extent of vertebral lesions, and contrast enhancement were recorded. Twelve dogs met inclusion criteria. Most dogs (n = 8) had a chronic progressive history, with varying degrees of proprioceptive ataxia and paresis (n = 11), and spinal pain was a feature in all dogs. The MRI findings were variable but more consistent features included the presence of multiple expansile vertebral lesions without extension beyond the outer cortical limits of affected vertebrae, and associated extradural material causing spinal cord compression. The majority of lesions were hyper- to isointense on T2 (n = 12) and T1-weighted (n = 8) sequences, with variable but homogeneous contrast-enhancement (n = 12).

An integrated bioinformatics analysis was used to construct an EC-specific ceRNA network and select key molecules. As a result, 96 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), 29 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and 77 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were identified. An EC-specific ceRNA network was built based on nine DElncRNAs significantly associated with overall survival. CCNB1 was found as a key gene in EC through the weighted gene coexpression network analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis. Our ceRNA network showed C2orf48 and LINC00483 might upregulate CCNB1 via competing with miR-183. In addition, we found a subnetwork which contained survival-associated DERNAs (AC110491.1, LINC00483-miR-192-GRHL1). The results of reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction supported the relative expressions of C2orf48, LINC00483 were upregulated and that of AC110491.1 was downregulated in EC.

Treatments are often ineffective, and relapse is common. Most research attempting to understand the underlying causes and maintenance factors of AN has focused on environmental contributions, yet there is much to be explored in terms of biological risk and maintenance factors. In this paper, we focus primarily on AN research related to genetics and the complex microbial community in the gut (intestinal microbiota), and how these impact our conceptualization of this disorder. Emerging research identifying significant negative genetic correlations between AN and obesity suggests that the conditions may represent ""metabolic bookends."" The identification of underlying biological mechanisms may provide both insight into extreme weight dysregulation on both ends of the spectrum and new possible points of entry for AN treatment. Additionally, the reported microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) in the gut microbiota in AN patients, potentially due to a nutrient- and energy-deprived gut environment, imply alterations in functional and metabolic capacity of the gut microbiome. The extent to which AN and obesity can also be considered to be ""microbiome bookends"" requires further investigation.

The maintenance of this species in tropical regions has been successful, but there are no studies that demonstrate the maintenance of reproductive seasonality under these climatic conditions, which was the objective of the present study. To do so, the present investigation involved 27 fallow deer (D. dama) specimens, of which 14 were adults and 13 prepubescent (<8 months) individuals, all assessed during and outside (December-February) the reproductive season (June-August). The serum concentrations of testosterone, testicular volume, and neck circumference were analyzed among all animals during both seasons. The reproductive season was marked by expressive hormonal concentrations, increasing neck circumference and testicular volume, differing significantly between adults and prepubescent individuals outside the season. Positive correlations were observed among all analyzed variables: mean testicular volume and neck circumference (r = 0.92, p < 0.0001), testicular volume and testosterone concentrations (r = 0.79, p < 0.0001) and between neck circumference and testosterone concentrations (r = 0.67, p < 0.0001). Given the results found, the conclusion is that even under tropical climate conditions the reproductive seasonality of the fallow deer is well defined and may be related to photoperiod."

It is further found that the condensation product of (R)-2 with tryptophan, (R)-3, shows dual responsive emissions toward amino acids with the short wavelength (λ1 = 350 nm) emission sensitive to the concentration of the substrate independent of the chiral configuration and the long wavelength (λ2 > 500 nm) emission highly enantioselective.

We herein show that the downregulation of the retinol-retinoic acid metabolism pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of congenital scoliosis. By analyzing DNA microarray data, we found that the expression levels of genes associated with the retinol metabolism pathway were decreased in the lumbar spine of Ishibashi rats (IS), a rat model of congenital kyphoscoliosis. The expression of Adh1 and Aldh1a2 (alcohol dehydrogenase), two enzymes that convert retinol to retinoic acid in this pathway, were decreased at both the gene and protein levels. Rarα, a receptor of retinoic acid and bone morphogenetic protein 2, which play a central role in bone formation and are located downstream of this pathway, were also downregulated. Interestingly, the serum retinol levels of IS rats were higher than those of wild-type control rats. These results indicate that the adequate conversion from retinol to retinoic acid is extremely important in the regulation of normal bone formation and it may also be a key factor for understanding the pathogenesis of congenital scoliosis.",Interferon-Gamma test for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection in Macaca mulatta and other non-human primates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056769,Journal of medical primatology,2019 05 06,We have formatted an assay to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infections of non-human primates.

This study investigated the mechanism by which mutant MATR3 causes multisystem proteinopathy (MSP) including ALS and VCPDM. We first analyzed the muscle pathology of C57BL/6 mice injected with adeno-associated viruses expressing human wild-type or mutant (S85C) MATR3. We next generated transgenic mice that overexpress mutant (S85C) MATR3, driven by the CMV early enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter, and evaluated their clinicopathological features. Intramuscular injection of viruses expressing wild-type and mutant MATR3 induced similar myogenic changes, including smaller myofibers with internal nuclei, and upregulated p62 and LC3-II. Mutant MATR3 transgenic mice showed decreased body weight and lower motor activity. Muscle histology demonstrated myopathic changes including fiber-size variation, internal nuclei and rimmed vacuoles. Spinal cord histology showed a reduced number of motor neurons, and activation of microglia and astrocytes. Comprehensive proteomic analyses of muscle demonstrated upregulation of proteins related to chaperones, stress response, protein degradation and nuclear function. Overexpression of wild-type and mutant MATR3 similarly caused myotoxicity, recapitulating the clinicopathological features of MSP. These models will be helpful for analyzing MSP pathogenesis and for understanding the function of MATR3.",Oxidative stability of virgin olive oil: evaluation and prediction with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056745,Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2019 06 13,"An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was employed to predict the oxidative stability of virgin olive oil (VOO) during storage as a function of time, storage temperature, total polyphenol, α-tocopherol, fatty acid profile, ultraviolet (UV) extinction coefficient (K268 ), and diacylglycerols (DAGs).",Epidermal AMBRA1 and Loricrin; a paradigm shift in the prognostication and stratification of AJCC stage I melanomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056744,The British journal of dermatology,2019 05 06,"Despite the recent update to the AJCC staging criteria for melanoma, this system is still unable to identify truly high-risk stage I tumour subsets."

Seventy-four patients with LARCs treated with nCRT were collected. Pathological evaluation after nCRT was performed according to the tumor regression grading (TRG) system. Next-generation sequencing kit including 279 exons of 59 genes was performed on Illumina Miseq Platform. Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm some mutations. Four of the tumors (4/74, 5.4%) had BRAF mutation, which presented in one TRG 2 tumor and three TRG 3 tumors but was not observed in TRG 0-1 tumors. Higher mutational frequency of BRAF gene in TRG 3 tumors (3/12, 25%) was found in comparison with the TRG 0-2 tumors (1/62, 1.6%; p = 0.012). Eight tumors (8/74, 10.8%) harbored SMAD4 mutations, which was mutated across all TRG groups. However, SMAD4 mutated more in TRG 3 tumors (4/12, 33.3%) compared with that in TRG 0-2 tumors (4/62, 6.5%; p = 0.020). The patients with BRAF-mutated LARCs had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.045) and shorter overall survival (OS) (p = 0.000) than the BRAF wild-type (WT) ones. The patients with SMAD4-mutated tumors had shorter PFS than the WT cases (p = 0.008). BRAF and SMAD4 genetic mutations might be important molecular markers to predict resistance to nCRT and poor prognosis in LARCs. More cases are needed to confirm these findings in the near future.",Malignant Melanoma: Autoimmunity and Supracellular Messaging as New Therapeutic Approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056729,Current treatment options in oncology,2019 05 10,"Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, with a high mortality rate in the absence of a safe and curable therapy. As a consequence, several procedures have been tested over time, with the most recent (immunological and targeted) therapies proving to be effective in some patients. Unfortunately, these new treatment options continue to generate debate related to the therapeutic strategy (intended to maximize the long-term results of patients with melanoma), not only about the monotherapy configuration but also regarding association/succession between distinct therapeutic procedures. As an example, targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors proved to be effective in advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma. However, such treatments with BRAF inhibitors lead to therapy resistance in half of patients after approximately 6 months. Even if most benign nevi incorporate oncogenic BRAF mutations, they rarely become melanoma; therefore, targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors should be viewed as an incomplete or perfectible therapy. Another example is related to the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors/ICIs (anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies), which are successfully used in metastatic melanoma. It is currently believed that CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade would favor a strong immune response against cancer cells. The main side effects of ICIs are represented by the development of immune-related adverse events, which in some cases can be lethal. These ICI side effects would thus be not only therapeutically counterproductive but also potentially dangerous. Surprisingly, a subset of immune-related adverse events (especially autoimmune toxicity) seems to be clearly correlated with better therapeutic results, perhaps due to an additional therapeutic effect (currently insufficiently studied/exploited). Contrary to the classical approach of cancer (considered until now an uncontrolled division of cells), a very recent and comprehensive theory describes malignancy as a supracellular disease. Cancerous disease would therefore be a disturbed supracellular process (embryogenesis, growth, development, regeneration, etc.), which imposes/coordinates an increased rhythm of cell division, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, etc. Melanoma is presented from such a supracellular perspective to be able to explain the beneficial role of autoimmunity in cancer (autoimmune abortion/rejection of the melanoma-embryo phenotype) and to create premises to better optimize the newly emerging therapeutic options. Finally, it is suggested that the supracellular evolution of malignancy implies complex supracellular messaging (between the cells and host organism), which would be interfaced especially by the extracellular matrix and noncoding RNA. Therefore, understanding and manipulating supracellular messaging in cancer could open new treatment perspectives in the form of digitized (supracellular) therapy.","A ""pickup"" stereoscopic camera with visual-motor aligned control for the da Vinci surgical system: a preliminary study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056727,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2019 06 15,"The current state-of-the-art surgical robotic systems use only a single endoscope to view the surgical field.

Eight lcSSc patients and five healthy subjects (control group, CNT) were enrolled. The skin involvement was evaluated by mRSS and US (18 and 22 MHz probes) in all 13 subjects in the 17 standard skin areas evaluated by mRss. Circulating fibrocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of all lcSSc patients and the CNT group to analyze their percentage at baseline time (T0) when the experiments started with PBMCs' isolation and collection and after 8 days of culture (T8). Non-parametric tests were used for the statistical analysis. A positive correlation between the percentage of circulating fibrocytes at T0, mRSS (p = 0.04 r = 0.96), and DT-US, evaluated by the 22 MHz and the 18 MHz probes (p = 0.03, r = 0.66 and p = 0.05, r = 0.52, respectively), was observed in lcSSc patients. Conversely, at T8, there was no correlation (p > 0.05) between these parameters in lcSSc group. In the CNT group, no correlations between mRSS or DT-US and the percentage of circulating fibrocytes were observed both at T0 and T8. The study shows the presence of a significant relationship between the percentage of circulating fibrocytes and DT, as evidenced by both mRSS and US, in limited cutaneus SSc.

Methods Sixteen semi-structured individual interviews and participant observations at seven workplaces took place, involving seven employers and nine co-workers with different professions. A phenomenological-hermeneutic analytic approach was applied involving coding, identification of themes, and interpretation. Results We identified three employer themes: call for knowledge, Making decisions, and Feeling helpless. Also, three co-worker themes were identified: understanding and sympathy, extra work and burden, and Insecurity about future work tasks. Early initiated RTW, e.g. less work hours and work accommodations, did neither constitute challenges for employers nor co-workers in the beginning of the RTW process. However, when the RTW process was prolonged employers encountered difficulties in finding suitable work tasks, whereas co-workers were burdened by extra work. Conclusions Overall, cancer survivors' RTW process was welcomed and encouraged at the workplace level. However, employer and co-worker experiences suggested that RTW initiation parallel with cancer treatment raised challenges at the workplace level, when the RTW process was extended beyond the initial RTW plan; increased workload and difficulties in balancing the needs of the cancer survivor and co-workers. Mechanisms that support cancer survivors' RTW without introducing strain on co-workers should be investigated in future research. Furthermore, support for employers in their RTW management responsibilities needs to be addressed in general and in particular in future RTW interventions.",Hypothyroidism-related zinc deficiency leads to suppression of T lymphocyte activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056723,Endocrine,2019 05 06,"Hypothyroidism has been shown to induce immunosuppression and both the thyroid status and immunity are affected by zinc deficiency.

The auscultation of the heart is still an important method in the medical process because it is very simple and cheap. To detect possible heart anomalies at an early stage, an automatic method enabling cardiac health low-cost screening for the general population would be highly valuable. By analyzing the phonocardiogram signals, it is possible to perform cardiac diagnosis and find possible anomalies at an early-term. Therefore, the development of intelligent and automated analysis tools of the phonocardiogram is very relevant. In this work, we use simultaneously collected electrocardiograms and phonocardiograms from the Physionet Challenge database with the main objective of determining whether a phonocardiogram corresponds to a ""normal"" or ""abnormal"" physiological state. Our main contribution is the methodological combination of time domain features and frequency domain features of phonocardiogram signals to improve cardiac disease automatic classification. This novel approach is developed using both features. First, the phonocardiogram signals are segmented with an algorithm based on a logistic regression hidden semi-Markov model, which uses electrocardiogram signals as a reference. Then, two groups of features from the time and frequency domain are extracted from the phonocardiogram segments. One group is based on motifs and the other on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. After that, we combine these features into a two-dimensional time-frequency heat map representation. Lastly, a binary classifier is applied to both groups of features to learn a model that discriminates between normal and abnormal phonocardiogram signals. In the experiments, three classification algorithms are used: Support Vector Machines, Convolutional Neural Network, and Random Forest. The best results are achieved when both time and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients features are considered using a Support Vector Machines with a radial kernel."

The 2016 Shanghai Declaration and the 1986 Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion call for comprehensive approaches which include policy and environmental changes. Yet many health promotion programmes in Australia continue to focus on informational and/or behavioural strategies, and there is a contemporary tendency for such programmes to be described as 'sending messages'. This paper uses frame analysis to discuss the role of language, and specifically language that frames health promotion as sending messages, in contributing to and reinforcing the predominance of informational and/or behavioural strategies. It argues such 'message' language helps to set a pattern in which informational and/or behavioural strategies are assumed to be the primary goal and extent of health promotion; rather than one component of a comprehensive, multi-strategic approach. It discusses how frames can be 'taken for granted' and ways in which such frames can be challenged and broadened. It argues that the message frame and associated behavioural framings set narrow boundaries for health promotion, contributing to the continuation of health inequities. These frames can also displace the language of the Ottawa Charter, which has capacity to reframe health issues socio-ecologically and include collective strategies. The paper concludes that a first step (of the many needed) towards applying the Charter's approach and multi-level, multi-strategic framework is to use the innovative vocabulary it offers. The words matter.","Potential exists to change, through breeding, the yield of individual primal carcass cuts in cattle without increasing overall carcass weight.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056704,Journal of animal science,2019 05 06,"The ability to alter the morphology of cattle towards greater yields of higher value primal cuts has the potential to increase the value of animals at slaughter. Using weight records of 14 primal cuts from 31,827 cattle, the objective of the present study was to quantify the extent of genetic variability in these primal cuts; also of interest was the degree of genetic variability in the primal cuts adjusted to a common carcass weight. Variance components were estimated for each primal cut using animal linear mixed models. The coefficient of genetic variation in the different primal cuts ranged from 0.05 (bavette) to 0.10 (eye of round) with a mean coefficient of genetic variation of 0.07. When phenotypically adjusted to a common carcass weight, the coefficient of genetic variation of the primal cuts was lesser ranging from 0.02 to 0.07 with a mean of 0.04. The heritability of the 14 primal cuts ranged from 0.14 (bavette) to 0.75 (topside) with a mean heritability across all cuts of 0.48; the heritability estimates reduced, and ranged from 0.12 (bavette) to 0.56 (topside), when differences in carcass weight were accounted for in the statistical model. Genetic correlations between each primal cut and carcass weight were all ≥0.77; genetic correlations between each primal cut and carcass conformation score were, on average, 0.59 but when adjusted to a common carcass weight, the correlations weakened to, on average, 0.27. The genetic correlations among all 14 primal cut weights was, on average, strong (mean correlation of 0.72 with all correlations being ≥0.37); when adjusted to a common carcass weight, the mean of the genetic correlations among all primal cuts was 0.10. The ability of estimated breeding values for a selection of primal cuts to stratify animals phenotypically on the respective cut weight was demonstrated; the weight of the rump, striploin and fillet of animals estimated to be in the top 25% genetically for the respective cut, were 10-24%, 12-24% and 7-17% heavier than the weight of cuts from animals predicted to be in the worst 25% genetically for that cut. Significant exploitable genetic variability in primal carcass cuts was clearly evident even when adjusted to a common carcass weight. The high heritability of many of the primal cuts infers that large datasets are not actually required to achieve high accuracy of selection once the structure of the data and the number of progeny per sire is adequate.",Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement with a catheter-based cerebral protection system: transferring percutaneous technologies into a surgical intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056703,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019 05 06,"Patients with severe aortic valve stenosis are currently treated with 2 different interventional techniques: surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Both have strengths and limitations. On the one hand, TAVI represents a valuable option in high- and intermediate-risk patients and is commonly preferred over surgical aortic valve replacement in subjects with porcelain or severely calcified aorta, on the other, the lack of data on valve durability raises concerns on its use in young, low-risk patients. We present herein the case of a low-risk 71-year-old patient with a severely calcified ascending aorta. We successfully combined our minimally invasive surgical approach with the use of a percutaneous cerebral protection system commonly employed during TAVI procedures. We believe that cardiac surgeons could adopt transcatheter technology to improve operative results.","ESMO recommendations on microsatellite instability testing for immunotherapy in cancer, and its relationship with PD-1/PD-L1 expression and tumour mutational burden: a systematic review-based approach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056702,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,2019 05 06,"Cancers with a defective DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) system contain thousands of mutations most frequently located in monomorphic microsatellites and are thereby defined as having microsatellite instability (MSI). Therefore, MSI is a marker of dMMR. MSI/dMMR can be identified using immunohistochemistry to detect loss of MMR proteins and/or molecular tests to show microsatellite alterations. Together with tumour mutational burden (TMB) and PD-1/PD-L1 expression, it plays a role as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy.","Increasing the dosing of a Buttiauxella phytase improves phytate degradation, mineral, energy, and amino acid digestibility in weaned pigs fed a complex diet based on wheat, corn, soybean meal, barley, and rapeseed meal1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056701,Journal of animal science,2019 06 14,"This study evaluated the effects of increasing the dose of a 6-phytase from Buttiauxella on phytate degradation, mineral, energy, and AA digestibility in weaned pigs fed complex diets based on wheat, corn, soybean meal, barley, and rapeseed meal. A negative control (NC) diet containing no added inorganic phosphorus (P) and a reduction of 0.1% calcium (Ca) and 36 kcal/kg ME was supplemented with Buttiauxella phytase at 0, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 FTU/kg diet and tested against a nutritionally adequate, positive control (PC) diet. One phytase units (FTU) is the amount of enzyme that liberates 1 micromole of inorganic phosphate per minute from a sodium phytate substrate at pH 5.5 and 37 °C. Barrows (Topigs × Pietrian; initial mean body weight 19.3 kg) were housed individually in metabolic crates and fed the test diets in mash form via 2 equal meals per day for 9 d (fed at 2.5 times the maintenance energy requirement), with 8 replicate pigs per treatment, in 2 experimental runs (total n = 48). After a 3-d adaptation period, urine and feces were collected over 5 d for measurements of apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) and retention of nutrients. On day 9, pigs were euthanized and ileal digesta collected for measurements of apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients. Phytase improved (P < 0.05) digestibility of all measured AA except Trp (P < 0.1), and AID P, nitrogen, phytate, ATTD P, Ca versus NC. Increasing phytase dose from 0 (NC) to 2,000 FTU/kg increased AID Lys, Cys, Thr, Val, Ile, Leu, mean AA, P, N, phytate, ATTD P, N, Na, energy, ME, P retention (g/d), and reduced P excretion (g/d) in a linear or exponential manner (P < 0.05). Phytase at 2,000 FTU/kg improved AA digestibility by between +3.1 percentage points (Trp) and +8.8 percentage points (Cys) versus NC (average +6.3 percentage points) (P < 0.05). Phytase inclusion at 2,000 FTU/kg reduced P excretion (g/d) by 57% versus PC (P < 0.05). In conclusion, increasing Buttiauxella phytase in the range of 0 to 2,000 FTU/kg increased phytate degradation, improved AA and P digestibility, and reduced P excretion in weaned pigs fed complex diets.",Fecal Proteases from Pouchitis Patients Activate Protease Activating Receptor-2 to Disrupt the Epithelial Barrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056700,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,2019 05 06,"The pathogenesis of pouch inflammation may involve epithelial barrier disruption.

Neuromelanin content is thought to reflect the loss of pigmented neurons, but available data characterizing its relationship with striatal dopaminergic integrity are not comprehensive or consistent, and predominantly involve heterogeneous samples. In this cross-sectional study, we used neuromelanin-sensitive MRI and the highly specific dopamine transporter PET radioligand, 11C-PE2I, to assess the association between neuromelanin-containing cell levels in the substantia nigra pars compacta and nigrostriatal terminal density in vivo, in 30 patients with bilateral Parkinson's disease. Fifteen healthy control subjects also underwent neuromelanin-sensitive imaging. We used a novel approach taking into account the anatomical and functional subdivision of substantia nigra into dorsal and ventral tiers and striatal nuclei into pre- and post-commissural subregions, in accordance with previous animal and post-mortem studies, and consider the clinically asymmetric disease presentation. In vivo, Parkinson's disease subjects displayed reduced neuromelanin levels in the ventral (-30 ± 28%) and dorsal tiers (-21 ± 24%) as compared to the control group [F(1,43) = 11.95, P = 0.001]. Within the Parkinson's disease group, nigral pigmentation was lower in the ventral tier as compared to the dorsal tier [F(1,29) = 36.19, P < 0.001] and lower in the clinically-defined most affected side [F(1,29) = 4.85, P = 0.036]. Similarly, lower dopamine transporter density was observed in the ventral tier [F(1,29) = 76.39, P < 0.001] and clinically-defined most affected side [F(1,29) = 4.21, P = 0.049]. Despite similar patterns, regression analysis showed no significant association between nigral pigmentation and nigral dopamine transporter density. However, for the clinically-defined most affected side, significant relationships were observed between pigmentation of the ventral nigral tier with striatal dopamine transporter binding in pre-commissural and post-commissural striatal subregions known to receive nigrostriatal projections from this tier, while the dorsal tier correlated with striatal projection sites in the pre-commissural striatum (P < 0.05, Benjamini-Hochberg corrected). In contrast, there were no statistically significant relationships between these two measures in the clinically-defined least affected side. These findings provide important insights into the topography of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, indicating that the characteristics of disease progression may fundamentally differ across hemispheres and support post-mortem data showing asynchrony in the loss of neuromelanin-containing versus tyrosine hydroxylase positive nigral cells.","Infant pneumococcal carriage during influenza, RSV and hMPV respiratory illness within a maternal influenza immunization trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056697,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 05 06,"In this post-hoc analysis of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in a community-based, randomized prenatal influenza vaccination trial in Nepal with weekly infant respiratory illness surveillance, 457 of 605 (75.5%) infants with influenza, RSV or hMPV illness had pneumococcus detected.

This study aimed at informing the development of an HIV-testing intervention for GPs in Flanders (Belgium) using formative research with a participatory approach. Through the active involvement of an advisory board and 16 group discussions with 122 Flemish GPs, GPs' current HIV-testing practices and perceived practical relevance of 2 distinct HIV-testing strategies (i.e. provider-initiated testing of key populations and indicator condition-based testing) were explored in terms of their relevance and feasibility in routine primary care. Self-reported HIV-testing practices revealed that most tests performed were patient-initiated, pretest counseling was rarely done, and post-test counseling was offered mainly for patients with an HIV-diagnosis. GPs reported multiple barriers to provider-initiated HIV-testing, i.e. personal discomfort, fear of offending their patient, limited knowledge of benefits of early HIV-diagnosis, misconceptions about HIV-risks, lack of guidelines and time. Difficulties to identify patient's sexual orientation or ethical concerns were mentioned as barriers for target group-based HIV testing. GPs assessed the current list of 64 indicator conditions as too difficult to integrate in routine care, deeming a reduced list of GP-relevant conditions as more feasible. Combined strategies (i.e. target group- and indicator-based testing) supported by official screening recommendations were perceived as successful strategies for provider-initiated HIV-testing in primary care.

The α5(V294F and S413F) and α1(P260S and L296S/W315L) subunit residue substitutions were all in transmembrane domains, while the α1(R112Q and N115R) subunit residue substitutions were in the N-terminal GABA binding domain. Using multidisciplinary approaches, we compared effects of mutant GABAA receptor α5 and α1 subunits on the properties of recombinant α5β3γ2 and α1β3γ2 GABAA receptors in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and characterized their effects on receptor clustering, biogenesis and channel function. GABAA receptors containing mutant α5 and α1 subunits all had reduced cell surface and total cell expression with altered endoplasmic reticulum processing, impaired synaptic clustering, reduced GABAA receptor function and decreased GABA binding potency. Our study identified GABRA5 as a causative gene for early onset epileptic encephalopathy and expands the mutant GABRA1 phenotypic spectrum, supporting growing evidence that defects in GABAergic neurotransmission contribute to early onset epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes.",The effectiveness of training in emergency obstetric care: a systematic literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056670,Health policy and planning,2019 05 06,"Providing quality emergency obstetric care (EmOC) reduces the risk of maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity. There is evidence that over 50% of maternal health programmes that result in improving access to EmOC and reduce maternal mortality have an EmOC training component. The objective was to review the evidence for the effectiveness of training in EmOC. Eleven databases and websites were searched for publications describing EmOC training evaluations between 1997 and 2017. Effectiveness was assessed at four levels: (1) participant reaction, (2) knowledge and skills, (3) change in behaviour and clinical practice and (4) availability of EmOC and health outcomes. Weighted means for change in knowledge and skills obtained, narrative synthesis of results for other levels. One hundred and one studies including before-after studies (n = 44) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 15). Level 1 and/or 2 was assessed in 68 studies; Level 3 in 51, Level 4 in 21 studies. Only three studies assessed effectiveness at all four levels. Weighted mean scores pre-training, and change after training were 67.0% and 10.6% for knowledge (7750 participants) and 53.1% and 29.8% for skills (6054 participants; 13 studies). There is strong evidence for improved clinical practice (adherence to protocols, resuscitation technique, communication and team work) and improved neonatal outcomes (reduced trauma after shoulder dystocia, reduced number of babies with hypothermia and hypoxia). Evidence for a reduction in the number of cases of post-partum haemorrhage, case fatality rates, stillbirths and institutional maternal mortality is less strong. Short competency-based training in EmOC results in significant improvements in healthcare provider knowledge/skills and change in clinical practice. There is emerging evidence that this results in improved health outcomes.",10-Min Targeted Geriatric Assessment Predicts Disability and Hospitalization in Fast-Paced Acute Care Settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056669,"The journals of gerontology.

Here, we present the breeding results of long-term studies on successful development of new crambe lines producing WEs through genetic engineering and cross breeding. The transgenic crambe lines producing WEs at over 25% of the total seed oil were first generated by introduction of the jojoba WE biosynthetic genes ScFAR and ScWS. Further improvement of the lines aiming at improving oxidative stability of WEs was achieved through introducing the CaFAD2-RNAi gene into these lines by crossing. The hybrid lines possessed similar agronomic traits to the wild type and a stable level of WEs over several generations, suggesting a high potential of crambe as an industrial crop for WE production.",Early B cell tolerance defects in neuromyelitis optica favour anti-AQP4 autoantibody production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056665,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 06 12,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) constitute rare autoimmune disorders of the CNS that are primarily characterized by severe inflammation of the spinal cord and optic nerve. Approximately 75% of NMOSD patients harbour circulating pathogenic autoantibodies targeting the aquaporin-4 water channel (AQP4). The source of these autoantibodies remains unclear, but parallels between NMOSD and other autoantibody-mediated diseases posit compromised B cell tolerance checkpoints as common underlying and contributing factors. Using a well established assay, we assessed tolerance fidelity by creating recombinant antibodies from B cell populations directly downstream of each checkpoint and testing them for polyreactivity and autoreactivity. We examined a total of 863 recombinant antibodies. Those derived from three anti-AQP4-IgG seropositive NMOSD patients (n = 130) were compared to 733 antibodies from 15 healthy donors. We found significantly higher frequencies of poly- and autoreactive new emigrant/transitional and mature naïve B cells in NMOSD patients compared to healthy donors (P-values < 0.003), thereby identifying defects in both central and peripheral B cell tolerance checkpoints in these patients. We next explored whether pathogenic NMOSD anti-AQP4 autoantibodies can originate from the pool of poly- and autoreactive clones that populate the naïve B cell compartment of NMOSD patients. Six human anti-AQP4 autoantibodies that acquired somatic mutations were reverted back to their unmutated germline precursors, which were tested for both binding to AQP4 and poly- or autoreactivity. While the affinity of mature autoantibodies against AQP4 ranged from modest to strong (Kd 15.2-559 nM), none of the germline revertants displayed any detectable binding to AQP4, revealing that somatic hypermutation is required for the generation of anti-AQP4 autoantibodies. However, two (33.3%) germline autoantibody revertants were polyreactive and four (66.7%) were autoreactive, suggesting that pathogenic anti-AQP4 autoantibodies can originate from the pool of autoreactive naïve B cells, which develops as a consequence of impaired early B cell tolerance checkpoints in NMOSD patients."

Based on our previous data showing that doxycycline and minocycline work as the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of PAC1-R, we used computer molecular docking and isothermal titration calorimetry assay to further determine the bindings of doxycycline/minocycline's derivatives including tetracycline/tigecycline with the N-terminal extracellular domain of PAC1-R (PAC1-EC1). Then the cAMP assay combined with the PAC1-R natural agonist PACAP27 was used to confirm the possible PAM roles of the small-molecule antibiotics. The results showed that tetracycline/tigecycline had significant lower affinity to PAC1-EC1 than doxycycline/minocycline, which was consistent with their non-positive allosteric modulation activity on PAC1-R. Furthermore, by comparing the key residues contributing to the PAM binding with the predicted allosteric site in PAC1-EC1, we characterized four motifs contributing to PAM binding in PAC1-EC1. The site-directed mutation results showed that ASN60 played the most important role in the PAM binding of the small-molecule antibiotics, while ASP116 played a sensitive marginal role in the PAM binding. These results not only help to explain the clinical and experimental neuroprotective effects of doxycycline/minocycline, but also help to characterize the PAM binding site in PAC1-EC1, which will promote the screening and characterization of novel small-molecule PAMs targeting PAC1-EC1 with drug development potency in nerve system disease.",Social support modulates the neural correlates underlying social exclusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056647,Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,2019 05 06,"Ostracism threatens the human need for social interactions, with negative consequences on cognition, affect, and behavior. Understanding the mechanisms that can alleviate these consequences has therefore become an important research agenda. In this study, we used behavioral and fMRI measures to advance our understanding how social support can buffer the negative effects of social exclusion. We focused on two different types of support from a friend: emotional support, conveyed by gentle touch, and appraisal support, implemented as informative text messages. 71 female participants underwent fMRI scanning while playing a virtual ball-tossing game in the course of which they were excluded. Two consecutive runs of the game were separated according to the participant's experimental condition (appraisal support, emotional support, and no support). Results showed that the experience of social exclusion is modulated by the type of support received. Specifically, emotional support decreased negative emotions and anterior insula activity, while appraisal support increased negative emotions, with concomitant increase of subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and decrease of Temporal-Parietal Junction activity. These divergent effects of social support point to the necessity to characterize whether and under which conditions it represents an effective and positive resource to alleviate the negative consequences of social exclusion.",CEP-CEPR1 signalling inhibits the sucrose-dependent enhancement of lateral root growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056646,Journal of experimental botany,2019 05 06,"Lateral root (LR) proliferation is a major determinant of soil nutrient uptake. How resource allocation controls the extent of LR growth remains unresolved. We used genetic, physiological, transcriptomic and grafting approaches to define a role for C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDE RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1) in controlling sucrose-dependent LR growth. CEPR1 inhibited LR growth in response to applied sucrose, other metabolisable sugars, and high light intensity. Pathways through CEPR1 restricted LR growth by reducing LR meristem size and the length of mature LR cells. RNA-sequencing of WT and cepr1-1 roots with or without sucrose treatment revealed an intersection of CEP-CEPR1 signalling with the sucrose transcriptional response. Sucrose upregulated several CEP genes, supporting a specific role for CEP-CEPR1 in the response to sucrose. Moreover, genes with basally perturbed expression in cepr1-1 overlap with WT sucrose-responsive genes significantly. We found that exogenous CEP peptide inhibited LR growth via CEPR1 by reducing LR meristem size and mature cell length. This result is consistent with CEP-CEPR1 acting to curtail the extent of sucrose-dependent LR growth. Reciprocal grafting indicates LR growth inhibition requires CEPR1 in both the roots and shoots.

As a source of inspiration, insects are quite apt at searching for mates and tracking prey, which always appear as small dim speckles in the visual field. The exquisite sensitivity of insects for small target motion, as revealed recently, is coming from a class of specific neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). Although a few STMD-based models have been proposed, these existing models only use motion information for small target detection and cannot discriminate small targets from small-target-like background features (named fake features). To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel visual system model (STMD+) for small target motion detection, which is composed of four subsystems--ommatidia, motion pathway, contrast pathway, and mushroom body. Compared with the existing STMD-based models, the additional contrast pathway extracts directional contrast from luminance signals to eliminate false positive background motion. The directional contrast and the extracted motion information by the motion pathway are integrated into the mushroom body for small target discrimination. Extensive experiments showed the significant and consistent improvements of the proposed visual system model over the existing STMD-based models against fake features.",Discriminative Fisher Embedding Dictionary Learning Algorithm for Object Recognition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056524,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019 05 06,"Both interclass variances and intraclass similarities are crucial for improving the classification performance of discriminative dictionary learning (DDL) algorithms. However, existing DDL methods often ignore the combination between the interclass and intraclass properties of dictionary atoms and coding coefficients. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a discriminative Fisher embedding dictionary learning (DFEDL) algorithm that simultaneously establishes Fisher embedding models on learned atoms and coefficients. Specifically, we first construct a discriminative Fisher atom embedding model by exploring the Fisher criterion of the atoms, which encourages the atoms of the same class to reconstruct the corresponding training samples as much as possible. At the same time, a discriminative Fisher coefficient embedding model is formulated by imposing the Fisher criterion on the profiles (row vectors of the coding coefficient matrix) and coding coefficients, which forces the coding coefficient matrix to become a block-diagonal matrix. Since the profiles can indicate which training samples are represented by the corresponding atoms, the proposed two discriminative Fisher embedding models can alternatively and interactively promote the discriminative capabilities of the learned dictionary and coding coefficients. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DFEDL algorithm achieves superior performance in comparison with some state-of-the-art dictionary learning algorithms on both hand-crafted and deep learning-based features.",Stabilization of Second-Order Memristive Neural Networks With Mixed Time Delays via Nonreduced Order.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056523,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019 05 06,"In this brief, we investigate a class of second-order memristive neural networks (SMNNs) with mixed time-varying delays.

In addition, compared with the reduced-order method used in the existing research studies, we consider the global stabilization directly from the SMNNs themselves without the reduced-order method. Finally, we give some numerical simulations to show the effectiveness of the results.",Distributed Dissipative State Estimation for Markov Jump Genetic Regulatory Networks Subject to Round-Robin Scheduling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056522,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,2019 05 06,"The distributed dissipative state estimation issue of Markov jump genetic regulatory networks subject to round-robin scheduling is investigated in this paper.

However, existing density forecast models have introduced various constraints on forecasted distributions, which has limited their ability to approximate real distributions and may result in suboptimality. In this paper, a distribution-free density forecast model based on deep learning is proposed, in which the real cumulative density functions (CDFs) of forecasting target are approximated by a large-capacity positive-weighted deep neural network (NN). Benefiting from the universal approximation ability of NNs, the range of forecasted distributions has been proven to contain all the distributions with continuous CDFs, which is superior to existing models' considering both width and accordance with reality. Three tests from different scenarios were implemented for evaluation, i.e., very-short-term wind power, wind speed, and day-ahead electricity price forecast, in which the proposed density forecast model has shown superior performance over the state of the art.",Low Cost Haptic Simulation Using Material Fracture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056520,IEEE transactions on haptics,2019 05 06,"Medical simulation training is widely used to effectively train for invasive medical procedures such peripheral nerve blocks. Traditionally, accurate haptic training relies on expensive cadavers, mannequins, or advanced haptic robots. Proposed herein is a novel concept for haptic training called the Low Cost Haptic Force Needle Insertion Simulator (LCNIS), which uses material fracture inside disposable cartridges to accurately replicate the force of inserting a needle into tissue. Cadaver and material fracture experiments are performed to develop and determine the accuracy of the LCNIS. The material testing showed that polycarbonate had the highest maximum needle puncture force of the materials tested, 9.85 N, and that fluorinated ethylene propylene had the lowest maximum puncture force, 0.84 N. The cadaver results showed that the error between the three peak forces in a cadaver and a cadaver mimicking cartridge was 1.00 N, 0.01 N, and 1.54 N. The standard deviation of these peaks was 0.60 N, 0.55 N, and 0.41 N.

The proposed solution has been tested on 10 subjects in a typical gesture recognition scenario achieving 85% average accuracy on 11 gestures recognition, which is aligned with the state-of-the-art, with the unique capability of performing online learning. Furthermore, by virtue of the hardware friendly algorithm and of the efficient PULP system-on-chip (Mr. Wolf) used for prototyping and evaluation, the energy budget required to run the learning part with 11 gestures is 10.04 mJ, and 83.2  μJ per classification.

These patients benefit from wearable FoG detection systems that provide timely biofeedback cues and hence help them regain control over their gait. Unfortunately, the systems proposed thus far are bulky and obtrusive when worn. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the first integration of an FoG detection system into a single sensor node. To achieve such an integration, features with low computational load are selected and dedicated hardware is designed that limits area and memory utilization. Classification is achieved with a neural network that is capable of learning in real time and thus allows the system to adapt to a patient during run-time. A small form factor FPGA implements the feature extraction and classification, whereas a custom PCB integrates the system into a single node. The system fits into a 4.5 × 3.5 × 1.5 cm 3 housing case, weighs 32 g, and achieves 95.6% sensitivity and 90.2% specificity when adapted to a patient. Biofeedback cues are provided either through auditory or somatosensory means and the system can remain operational for longer than 9 h while providing cues.

However, it has been shown, and is proved in this article, that waiting between perturbations so that the update dynamics of the system prepares the ground, allows for new reprogramming strategies. To identify such sequential perturbations, we consider a qualitative model of regulatory networks, and rely on Binary Decision Diagrams to model their dynamics and the putative perturbations. Our method establishes a set identification of sequential perturbations, whether permanent (mutations) or only temporary, to achieve the existential or inevitable reachability of an arbitrary state of the system. We apply an implementation for temporary perturbations on models from the literature, illustrating that we are able to derive sequential perturbations to achieve trans-differentiation."

However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this recovery are unknown. This paper analyzes muscle synergies in two motor complete SCI patients under SCS during standing and compares them with muscle synergies in healthy subjects, in order to help elucidate the mechanisms that enable motor control through SCS. One challenge is that standard muscle synergy extraction algorithms, such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), fail when applied to SCI patients under SCS. We develop a new algorithm-rShiftNMF-to extract muscle synergies in these cases. We find muscle synergies extracted by rShiftNMF are significantly better at interpreting electromyography (EMG) activity, and resulting synergy features are more physiologically meaningful. By analyzing muscle synergies from SCI patients and healthy subjects, we find that: 1) SCI patients rely significantly on muscle synergy activation to generate motor activity; 2) interleaving SCS can selectively activate an additional muscle synergy that is critical to SCI standing; and 3) muscle synergies extracted from SCI patients under SCS differ substantially from those extracted from healthy subjects. We provide evidence that after spinal cord injury, SCS influences motor function through muscle synergy activation.",Neural Comodulation of Independent Brain Processes Related to Multitasking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056503,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2019 06 10,"Distracted driving is regarded as an integrated task requiring different regions of the brain to receive sensory data, coordinate information, make decisions, and synchronize movements. In this paper, we applied an independent modulator analysis (IMA) method to temporally independent electroencephalography (EEG) components to understand how the human executive control system coordinates different brain regions to simultaneously perform multiple tasks with distractions presented in different modalities. The behavioral results showed that the reaction time (RT) in response to traffic events increased while multitasking. Moreover, the RT was longer when the distractor was presented in an auditory form versus a visual form. The IMA results showed that there were performance-related IMs coordinating different brain regions during distracted driving. The component spectral fluctuations affected by the modulators were distinct between the single- and dual-task conditions. Specifically, more modulatory weight was projected to the occipital region to address the additional distracting stimulus in both visual and auditory modality in the dual-task conditions. A comparison of modulatory weights between auditory and visual distractors showed that more modulatory weight was projected to the frontal region during the processing of the auditory distractor. This paper provides valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of attentional modulation during multitasking as well as an understanding of the underlying brain mechanisms that mediate the synchronization across brain regions and govern the allocation of attention in distracted driving.",Neurophysiological Correlates of Gait Retraining With Real-Time Visual and Auditory Feedback.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056502,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2019 06 10,"Most people acquire motor skills through feedback-based training. How the human brain processes sensory feedbacks during training, especially in a gait training, remain largely unclear. The purpose of this paper is to explore how humans adopt a new gait pattern to reduce impacts during walking-with the aid of visual and audio feedbacks. This paper demonstrates the features of underlying brain activity in incorporating the visual or auditory cues to acquire a new gait pattern. Electroencephalography (EEG) and peak positive acceleration (PPA) of the heel were collected from 23 participants during walking on a treadmill with no feedback, with visual feedback, or with audio feedback. The feedbacks were presented after each foot strike, where a sub-threshold PPA triggered a positive feedback (green/low-pitched), and a suprathreshold PPA triggered a negative feedback (red/high-pitched). The participants were instructed to voluntarily control their gait, so that low PPA could be achieved. This control was perturbed in some sessions by an additional cognitive task, and the influence of such distraction was also explored. The PPA was significantly lower in the sessions with visual or audio feedback than in sessions without feedback, showing an immediate improvement in gait pattern, when the feedback was provided. Different feedbacks modulated neural activities at different locations and/or levels during training. Alpha event-related synchronization (ERS) was particularly increased during the encoding of auditory feedback or the introduction of a distracting task. In the meantime, prominent frontal and posterior theta ERS were coupled with negative feedback, and strong beta event-related desynchronization (ERD) was observed only in sessions with feedbacks. Our results indicate that feedback effectively enhances motor planning when acquiring a new gait.",Gaussian Process Trajectory Learning and Synthesis of Individualized Gait Motions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056501,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2019 06 10,"This paper proposes a Gaussian process-based method for trajectory learning and generation of individualized gait motions at arbitrary user-designated walking speeds, intended to be used in generating reference motions for robotic gait rehabilitation systems. We utilize a nonlinear dimension reduction technique based on Gaussian process dynamical models (GPDMs), in which the internal dynamics is modeled as a second-order Markov process evolving in a lower-dimensional latent space. After the GPDM parameters are identified with training data obtained from gait motions of healthy subjects walking at different speeds, our method then employs Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict the initial two states of the latent space dynamics from any arbitrary desired walking speed and the anthropometric parameters of the test subject. Motions are then generated by directly mapping the latent space dynamics to joint trajectories. Experimental studies involving more than 100 subjects indicate that our method generates gait patterns with 30% less mean square prediction errors compared to recent state-of-the-art methods, while also allowing for arbitrary user-specified walking speeds.",Robot-Assisted Reaching Performance of Chronic Stroke and Healthy Individuals in a Virtual Versus a Physical Environment: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056500,IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,2019 06 10,"The aim of the current study was to examine the role of environment, whether virtual or physical, on robot-assisted reaching movements in chronic stroke and healthy individuals, within a single session. Twenty-three subjects participated in the current study divided into three groups: nine chronic stroke individuals able to perform a reaching task with no need for the robot assistance, nine chronic stroke individuals who needed robot assistance to complete the reaching task, and five healthy individuals. The task was to reach six target buttons in two identical physical and virtual environments. The outcomes consisted of specific kinematic measures (amount of movement completion without robot assistance, mean speed, peak speed, straightness, and shakiness) and a custom questionnaire to assess how the stroke subjects perceived and experienced the reaching task in both environments. The results showed no differences between the two environments in terms of the outcome measures in any of the groups. Our findings suggest that the choice of environment, whether physical or virtual, is not a key factor in designing a simple robot-assisted reaching task for stroke survivors. Further studies are required for more complex environments and tasks as well as robot-assisted training protocols.",Strong 3D Printing by TPMS Injection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056499,IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,2019 05 09,"3D printed objects are rapidly becoming prevalent in science, technology and daily life. An important question is how to obtain strong and durable 3D models using standard printing techniques. This question is often translated to computing smartly designed interior structures that provide strong support and yield resistant 3D models. In this paper we suggest a combination between 3D printing and material injection to achieve strong 3D printed objects. We utilize triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) to define novel interior support structures. TPMS are closed form and can be computed in a simple and straightforward manner. Since TPMS are smooth and fully connected, we utilize them to define channels that adequately distribute injected materials in the shape interior. To account for weak regions, TPMS channels are locally optimized according to the shape stress field. After the object is printed, we simply inject the TPMS channels with materials that solidify and yield a strong inner structure that supports the shape. Our method allows injecting a wide range of materials in an object interior in a fast and easy manner. Results demonstrate the efficiency of strong printing by combining 3D printing and injection together.",Discrete Multi-Graph Clustering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056498,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 05 06,"Spectral clustering plays a significant role in applications that rely on multi-view data due to its well-defined mathematical framework and excellent performance on arbitrarily-shaped clusters. Unfortunately, directly optimizing the spectral clustering inevitably results in an NP-hard problem due to the discrete constraints on the clustering labels. Hence, conventional approaches intuitively include a relax-and-discretize strategy to approximate the original solution. However, there are no principles in this strategy that prevent the possibility of information loss between each stage of the process. This uncertainty is aggravated when a procedure of heterogeneous features fusion has to be included in multi-view spectral clustering. In this paper, we avoid an NP-hard optimization problem and develop a general framework for multi-view discrete graph clustering by directly learning a consensus partition across multiple views, instead of using the relax-and-discretize strategy. An effective re-weighting optimization algorithm is exploited to solve the proposed challenging problem. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of the model's convergence properties and computational complexity for the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm on clustering and image segmentation tasks.",Transfer Neural Trees: Semi-Supervised Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation and Beyond.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056497,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 05 06,"Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) addresses the task of associating data not only across dissimilar domains but also described by different types of features. Inspired by the recent advances of neural networks and deep learning, we propose a deep leaning model of Transfer Neural Trees (TNT), which jointly solves cross-domain feature mapping, adaptation, and classification in a unified architecture. As the prediction layer in TNT, we introduce Transfer Neural Decision Forest (Transfer- NDF), which is able to learn the neurons in TNT for adaptation by stochastic pruning. In order to handle semi-supervised HDA, a unique embedding loss term is introduced to TNT for preserving prediction and structural consistency between labeled and unlabeled target-domain data. We further show that our TNT can be extended to zero shot learning for associating image and attribute data with promising performance. Finally, experiments on different classification tasks across features, datasets, and modalities would verify the effectiveness of our TNT.",SCAN: Self-and-Collaborative Attention Network for Video Person Re-identification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056496,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 05 06,"Video person re-identification attracts much attention in recent years. It aims to match image sequences of pedestrians from different camera views. Previous approaches usually improve this task from three aspects, including a) selecting more discriminative frames, b) generating more informative temporal representations, and c) developing more effective distance metrics. To address the above issues, we present a novel and practical deep architecture for video person re-identification termed Self-and-Collaborative Attention Network (SCAN), which adopts the video pairs as the input and outputs their matching scores. SCAN has several appealing properties. First, SCAN adopts non-parametric attention mechanism to refine the intra-sequence and inter-sequence feature representation of videos, and outputs self-and-collaborative feature representation for each video, making the discriminative frames aligned between the probe and gallery sequences. Second, beyond existing models, a generalized pairwise similarity measurement is proposed to generate the similarity feature representation of video pair by calculating the Hadamard product of their self-representation difference and collaborative-representation difference. Thus the matching result can be predicted by the binary classifier. Third, a dense clip segmentation strategy is also introduced to generate rich probe-gallery pairs to optimize the model. In the test phase, the final matching score of two videos is determined by averaging the scores of top-ranked clip-pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SCAN, which outperforms top-1 accuracies of the best-performing baselines on iLIDS-VID, PRID2011 and MARS dataset, respectively.",A Two-stage Outlier Filtering Framework for City-Scale Localization using 3D SfM Point Clouds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056495,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 05 06,"3D Structure-based localization aims to estimate the 6-DOF camera pose of a query image by means of feature matches against a 3D Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud. For city-scale SfM point clouds with tens of millions of points, it becomes more and more difficult to disambiguate matches. Therefore a 3D Structure-based localization method, which can efficiently handle matches with very large outlier ratios, is needed. We propose a two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization that leverages both visibility and geometry intrinsics of SfM point clouds. Firstly, we propose a visibility-based outlier filter, which is based on a bipartite visibility graph, to filter outliers on a coarse level. Secondly, we apply a geometry-based outlier filter to generate a set of fine-grained matches with a novel data-driven geometrical constraint for efficient inlier evaluation. The proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework only relies on intrinsic information of a SfM point cloud. It is thus widely applicable to be embedded into existing localization approaches. The experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage outlier filtering framework for city-scale localization."

However, many cancers often exhibit CGI hypermethylation, implying that the machinery is impaired in cancer cells. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of CGI methylation during somatic cell reprogramming. Although most CGIs remain hypomethylated, a small subset of CGIs, particularly at several ICRs, was often de novo methylated in reprogrammed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Such de novo ICR methylation was linked with the silencing of reprogramming factors, which occurs at a late stage of reprogramming. The ICR-preferred CGI hypermethylation was similarly observed in human PSCs. Mechanistically, ablation of Dnmt3a prevented PSCs from de novo ICR methylation. Notably, the ICR-preferred CGI hypermethylation was observed in pediatric cancers, while adult cancers exhibit genome-wide CGI hypermethylation. These results may have important implications in the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers and the application of PSCs.",Functional Properties of Engineered Heart Slices Incorporating Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056480,Stem cell reports,2019 06 10,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) hold great promise for cardiac studies, but their structural and functional immaturity precludes their use as faithful models of adult myocardium.

EHS exhibited multicellular, aligned bundles of elongated CMs with organized sarcomeres, positive inotropic responses to isoproterenol, anisotropic conduction of action potentials, and electrophysiological functionality for more than 200 days. We developed a new drug assay, GRIDS, that serves as a ""fingerprint"" of cardiac drug sensitivity for a range of pacing rates and drug concentrations. GRIDS maps characterized differences in drug sensitivity between EHS and monolayers more clearly than changes in action potential durations or conduction velocities.

Transplantation of immature hESC-CMs resulted in substantial myocardial implants within the infarct scar that matured over time, formed vascular networks with the host, and evoked minimal cellular rejection. While arrhythmias were rare in infarcted pigs receiving vehicle alone, hESC-CM recipients experienced frequent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia before reverting back to normal sinus rhythm by 4 weeks post transplantation. Electroanatomical mapping and pacing studies implicated focal mechanisms, rather than macro-reentry, for these graft-related tachyarrhythmias as evidenced by an abnormal centrifugal pattern with earliest electrical activation in histologically confirmed graft tissue. These findings demonstrate the suitability of the pig model for the preclinical development of a hESC-based cardiac therapy and provide new insights into the mechanistic basis of electrical instability following hESC-CM transplantation.",WNT/NOTCH Pathway Is Essential for the Maintenance and Expansion of Human MGE Progenitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056478,Stem cell reports,2019 06 10,"Medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like cells yielded from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold great potentials for cell therapies of related neurological disorders. However, cues that orchestrate the maintenance versus differentiation of human MGE progenitors, and ways for large-scale expansion of these cells have not been investigated. Here, we report that WNT/CTNNB1 signaling plays an essential role in maintaining MGE-like cells derived from hPSCs. Ablation of CTNNB1 in MGE cells led to precocious cell-cycle exit and advanced neuronal differentiation. Activation of WNT signaling through genetic or chemical approach was sufficient to maintain MGE cells in an expandable manner with authentic neuronal differentiation potencies through activation of endogenous NOTCH signaling. Our findings reveal that WNT/NOTCH signaling cascade is a key player in governing the maintenance versus terminal differentiation of MGE progenitors in humans. Large-scale expansion of functional MGE progenitors for cell therapies can therefore be achieved by modifying WNT/NOTCH pathway.",Enhancer Chromatin and 3D Genome Architecture Changes from Naive to Primed Human Embryonic Stem Cell States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056477,Stem cell reports,2019 06 10,"During mammalian embryogenesis, changes in morphology and gene expression are concurrent with epigenomic reprogramming. Using human embryonic stem cells representing the preimplantation blastocyst (naive) and postimplantation epiblast (primed), our data in 2iL/I/F naive cells demonstrate that a substantial portion of known human enhancers are premarked by H3K4me1, providing an enhanced open chromatin state in naive pluripotency. The 2iL/I/F enhancer repertoire occupies 9% of the genome, three times that of primed cells, and can exist in broad chromatin domains over 50 kb. Enhancer chromatin states are largely poised. Seventy-seven percent of 2iL/I/F enhancers are decommissioned in a stepwise manner as cells become primed. While primed topologically associating domains are largely unaltered upon differentiation, naive 2iL/I/F domains expand across primed boundaries, affecting three-dimensional genome architecture. Differential topologically associating domain edges coincide with 2iL/I/F H3K4me1 enrichment. Our results suggest that naive-derived 2iL/I/F cells have a unique chromatin landscape, which may reflect early embryogenesis.",Context-Dependent Impact of RAS Oncogene Expression on Cellular Reprogramming to Pluripotency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056476,Stem cell reports,2019 06 10,"Induction of pluripotency in somatic cells with defined genetic factors has been successfully used to investigate the mechanisms of disease initiation and progression. Cellular reprogramming and oncogenic transformation share common features; both involve undergoing a dramatic change in cell identity, and immortalization is a key step for cancer progression that enhances reprogramming. However, there are very few examples of complete successful reprogramming of tumor cells. Here we address the effect of expressing an active oncogene, RAS, on the process of reprogramming and found that, while combined expression with reprogramming factors enhanced dedifferentiation, expression within the context of neoplastic transformation impaired reprogramming. RAS induces expression changes that promote loss of cell identity and acquisition of stemness in a paracrine manner and these changes result in reprogramming when combined with reprogramming factors. When cells carry cooperating oncogenic defects, RAS drives cells into an incompatible cellular fate of malignancy.",FGF10-FGFR2B Signaling Generates Basal Cells and Drives Alveolar Epithelial Regeneration by Bronchial Epithelial Stem Cells after Lung Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056475,Stem cell reports,2019 06 10,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a common form of interstitial lung disease resulting in alveolar remodeling and progressive loss of pulmonary function because of chronic alveolar injury and failure to regenerate the respiratory epithelium.

Bronchial epithelial stem cells (BESCs) can give rise to AT2 and AT1 cells or honeycomb cysts following bleomycin-mediated lung injury. However, little is known about what controls this binary decision or whether this decision can be reversed. Here we report that inactivation of Fgfr2b in BESCs impairs their contribution to both alveolar epithelial regeneration and honeycomb cysts after bleomycin injury. By contrast overexpression of Fgf10 in BESCs enhances fibrosis resolution by favoring the more desirable outcome of alveolar epithelial regeneration over the development of pathologic honeycomb cysts.",Stemness underpinning all steps of human colorectal cancer defines the core of effective therapeutic strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056474,EBioMedicine,2019 05 06,"Despite their lethality and ensuing clinical and therapeutic relevance, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) remain elusive, poorly characterized biological entities."

LexA, a central repressor in the response, has been implicated in the regulation of lysogeny in various temperate bacteriophages. During infection of Bacillus thuringiensis with GIL01 bacteriophage, LexA represses the SOS response and the phage lytic cycle by binding DNA, an interaction further stabilized upon binding of a viral protein, gp7. Here we report the crystallographic structure of phage-borne gp7 at 1.7-Å resolution, and characterize the 4:2 stoichiometry and potential interaction with LexA using surface plasmon resonance, static light scattering, and small-angle X-ray scattering.

The structure of PpdDp, determined by NMR, was then docked into the density envelope of purified EHEC pili obtained by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). Cryo-EM reconstruction of EHEC pili at ∼8 Å resolution revealed extremely high pilus flexibility correlating with a large extended region of the pilin stem.

Tuber formation is controlled by a homolog of the floral inductor FLOWERING LOCUS T, referred to as SP6A. To gain deeper insights into its function, we created transgenic potato plants overexpressing a codon-optimized version of SP6A, SP6Acop, to avoid silencing effects. These plants exhibited extremely early tuberization at the juvenile stage, hindering green biomass development and indicating a tremendous shift in the source sink balance. The meristem identity was altered in dormant buds of transgenic tubers. This strong phenotype, not being reported so far for plants overexpressing an unmodified SP6A, could be due to post-transcriptional regulation. In fact, a putative SP6A-specific small regulatory RNA was identified in potato. It was effectively repressing SP6A mRNA accumulation in transient assays as well as in leaves of young potato plants prior to tuber formation. SP6A expression is downregulated under heat, preventing tuberization. The molecular mechanism has not been elucidated yet. We showed that this small RNA is strongly upregulated under heat. The importance of the small RNA was demonstrated by overexpression of a target mimicry construct, which led to an increased SP6A expression, enabling tuberization even under continuous heat conditions, which abolished tuber formation in the wild-type. Thus, our study describes an additional regulatory mechanism for SP6A besides the well-known pathway that integrates both developmental and environmental signals to control tuberization and is therefore a promising target for breeding of heat-tolerant potato.",Diverse Food-Sensing Neurons Trigger Idiothetic Local Search in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056390,Current biology : CB,2019 06 10,"Foraging animals may benefit from remembering the location of a newly discovered food patch while continuing to explore nearby [1, 2]. For example, after encountering a drop of yeast or sugar, hungry flies often perform a local search [3, 4]. That is, rather than remaining on the food or simply walking away, flies execute a series of exploratory excursions during which they repeatedly depart and return to the resource. Fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, can perform this food-centered search behavior in the absence of external landmarks, instead relying on internal (idiothetic) cues [5]. This path-integration behavior may represent a deeply conserved navigational capacity in insects [6, 7], but its underlying neural basis remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetic activation to screen candidate cell classes and found that local searches can be initiated by diverse sensory neurons. Optogenetically induced searches resemble those triggered by actual food, are modulated by starvation state, and exhibit key features of path integration. Flies perform tightly centered searches around the fictive food site, even within a constrained maze, and they can return to the fictive food site after long excursions. Together, these results suggest that flies enact local searches in response to a wide variety of food-associated cues and that these sensory pathways may converge upon a common neural system for navigation. Using a virtual reality system, we demonstrate that local searches can be optogenetically induced in tethered flies walking on a spherical treadmill, laying the groundwork for future studies to image the brain during path integration. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",Yeast Spontaneous Mutation Rate and Spectrum Vary with Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056389,Current biology : CB,2019 06 10,"Mutation is the ultimate genetic source of evolution and biodiversity, but to what extent the environment impacts mutation rate and spectrum is poorly understood. Past studies discovered mutagenesis induced by antibiotic treatment or starvation, but its relevance and importance to long-term evolution is unclear because these severe stressors typically halt cell growth and/or cause substantial cell deaths. Here, we quantify the mutation rate and spectrum in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by whole-genome sequencing following mutation accumulation in each of seven environments with relatively rapid cell growths and minimal cell deaths. We find the point mutation rate per generation to differ by 3.6-fold among the seven environments, generally increasing in environments with slower cell growths. This trend renders the mutation rate per year more constant than that per generation across environments, which has implications for neutral evolution and the molecular clock. Additionally, we find substantial among-environment variations in mutation spectrum, such as the transition to transversion ratio and AT mutational bias. Other main mutation types, including small insertion or deletion, segmental duplication or deletion, and chromosome gain or loss also tend to occur more frequently in environments where yeast grows more slowly. In contrast to these findings from the nuclear genome, the yeast mitochondrial mutation rate rises with the growth rate, consistent with the metabolic rate hypothesis. Together, these observations indicate that environmental changes, which are ubiquitous in nature, influence not only natural selection, but also the amount and type of mutations available to selection, and suggest that ignoring the latter impact, as is currently practiced, may mislead evolutionary inferences.",Local and Global Influences of Visual Spatial Selection and Locomotion in Mouse Primary Visual Cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056388,Current biology : CB,2019 06 10,"Sensory selection and movement locally and globally modulate neural responses in seemingly similar ways. For example, locomotion enhances visual responses in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), resembling the effects of spatial attention on primate visual cortical activity. However, interactions between these local and global mechanisms and the resulting effects on perceptual behavior remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a novel mouse visual spatial selection task in which animals either monitor one of two locations for a contrast change (""selective mice"") or monitor both (""non-selective mice"") and can run at will. Selective mice perform well only when their selected stimulus changes, giving rise to local electrophysiological changes in the corresponding hemisphere of V1 including decreased noise correlations and increased visual information. Non-selective mice perform well when either stimulus changes, giving rise to global changes across both hemispheres of V1. During locomotion, selective mice have worse behavioral performance, increased noise correlations in V1, and decreased visual information, while non-selective mice have decreased noise correlations in V1 but no change in performance or visual information. Our findings demonstrate that mice can locally or globally enhance visual information, but the interaction of the global effect of locomotion with local selection impairs behavioral performance. Moving forward, this mouse model will facilitate future studies of local and global sensory modulatory mechanisms and their effects on behavior.",Soil Salinity Limits Plant Shade Avoidance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056387,Current biology : CB,2019 06 10,"Global food production is set to keep increasing despite a predicted decrease in total arable land [1]. To achieve higher production, denser planting will be required on increasingly degraded soils. When grown in dense stands, crops elongate and raise their leaves in an effort to reach sunlight, a process termed shade avoidance [2]. Shade is perceived by a reduction in the ratio of red (R) to far-red (FR) light and results in the stabilization of a class of transcription factors known as PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) [3, 4]. PIFs activate the expression of auxin biosynthesis genes [4, 5] and enhance auxin sensitivity [6], which promotes cell-wall loosening and drives elongation growth. Despite our molecular understanding of shade-induced growth, little is known about how this developmental program is integrated with other environmental factors. Here, we demonstrate that low levels of NaCl in soil strongly impair the ability of plants to respond to shade. This block is dependent upon abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and the canonical ABA signaling pathway. Low R:FR light enhances brassinosteroid (BR) signaling through BRASSINOSTEROID SIGNALING KINASE 5 (BSK5) and leads to the activation of BRI1 EMS SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1). ABA inhibits BSK5 upregulation and interferes with GSK3-like kinase inactivation by the BR pathway, thus leading to a suppression of BES1:PIF function. By demonstrating a link between light, ABA-, and BR-signaling pathways, this study provides an important step forward in our understanding of how multiple environmental cues are integrated into plant development.",Neural Signatures of Prediction Errors in a Decision-Making Task Are Modulated by Action Execution Failures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056386,Current biology : CB,2019 06 10,"Decisions must be implemented through actions, and actions are prone to error. As such, when an expected outcome is not obtained, an individual should be sensitive to not only whether the choice itself was suboptimal but also whether the action required to indicate that choice was executed successfully. The intelligent assignment of credit to action execution versus action selection has clear ecological utility for the learner. To explore this, we used a modified version of a classic reinforcement learning task in which feedback indicated whether negative prediction errors were, or were not, associated with execution errors. Using fMRI, we asked if prediction error computations in the human striatum, a key substrate in reinforcement learning and decision making, are modulated when a failure in action execution results in the negative outcome. Participants were more tolerant of non-rewarded outcomes when these resulted from execution errors versus when execution was successful, but reward was withheld. Consistent with this behavior, a model-driven analysis of neural activity revealed an attenuation of the signal associated with negative reward prediction errors in the striatum following execution failures. These results converge with other lines of evidence suggesting that prediction errors in the mesostriatal dopamine system integrate high-level information during the evaluation of instantaneous reward outcomes.",Giant Pandas Are Macronutritional Carnivores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056385,Current biology : CB,2019 05 21,"Giant pandas are unusual in belonging to a primarily carnivorous clade and yet being extremely specialized herbivores that feed almost exclusively on highly fibrous bamboo [1]. Paradoxically, they appear inconsistently adapted to their plant diet, bearing a mix of herbivore and carnivore traits. Herbivore traits include a skull, jaw musculature, and dentition that are adapted for fibrous diets and a specialized ""pseudo-thumb"" used for handling bamboo [2, 3]. They have lost functional versions of the T1R1 gene codes for umami taste receptors, which are often associated with meat eating [3]. They also have an herbivore-like subcellular distribution of the metabolic enzyme alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase [4]. But meanwhile, giant pandas have a digestive tract [5], digestive enzymes [6], and a gut microbiota composition that resemble those of carnivores and not of herbivores [6, 7]. We draw on recent developments in multi-dimensional niche theory [8] to examine this apparent paradox. We show that the pandas' diet clustered in a macronutrient space among carnivores and was distinct from that of herbivores. The similarity with carnivore diets applied not only to the ingested diet but also to the absorbed diet, with the absorbed macronutrient ratios similar to those of the ingested foods. Comparison of the macronutrient composition of pandas' milk with those of other species shows that the carnivore-like dietary macronutrient composition extends across the life cycle. These results cast new light on the seemingly incongruous constellation of dietary adaptations in pandas, suggesting that the transition from carnivorous and omnivorous ancestry to specialized herbivory might be less abrupt than it might otherwise appear.",The controversial role of corticosteroids in septic shock.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056383,The American journal of emergency medicine,2019 05 06,"Several clinical trials and literature reviews have been conducted to evaluate the impact of corticosteroids on the physiological markers and clinical outcomes of patients in septic shock.

In addition, there is now ample evidence that the previously held belief that imaging of patients with IIH should be normal is incorrect but rather that there are several subtle findings that radiologists need to look for. These findings include a partially empty sella, flattening of the posterior globe, cupping of optic disks and distension of the optic nerve sheaths. In addition, the role of intracranial venography is playing an ever increasing role due to the finding that a very high percentage of patients have dural venous sinus stenoses. It is becoming clear that there is potentially true morbidity associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The earlier the disease can be diagnosed, the earlier treatment can be started to minimalize permanent visual changes including blindness. Treatment varies from institution to institution due to the fact that multiple specialists with different perspectives treat these patients. Knowledge of subtle imaging features associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension can help radiologists establish the diagnosis earlier and potentially prevent complications of this disorder. However imaging has not as of yet been shown to be beneficial in managing patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.",Temporal expression of cytokines and B-cell phenotypes during mechanical circulatory support.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056358,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 05 06,"Allosensitization during mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a well-described phenomenon, although its mechanism remains unknown.

However, by interpreting a simple mixture on the penile swab of the deceased and a complex mixture on the prayer flag wrapped around the ankles of the deceased, the information embedded in these two mixtures provided us with a breakthrough point for addressing the identity determination. Preliminary analysis using the separating method or based on imbalanced peaks at the Amelogenin locus revealed that each of the two DNA mixtures should have a female minor contributor, who were likely to be sex workers according to the investigation results. Consequently, blood samples from fifty-two women were collected for STR genotyping. The analysis results of the two mixtures using LRmix Studio showed that the probability of the simple mixture that if it came from the deceased and the female numbered P0053 is 4.7078 × 1012 times more likely than if it came from the deceased and an unknown female, while the probability of the complex mixture that if it came from P0062, the deceased and the male suspect is 8.1777 × 107 times more likely than if it came from the deceased and two unknowns. Subsequently, based on the clues provided by P0053 and P0062, the identity of the deceased and the suspect was successfully determined and the case was finally resolved. These results suggest the valuable evidence that can be obtained from mixtures and the high priority that should be placed on the analysis of mixtures, especially those that may be considered unlikely to derive complete single-source profiles by interpretation.

The molecular descriptors of quinolones were then used to screen heterologous coating antigens for the detection of ENR based on an ensemble learning method to improve the sensitivity of the ELISA. Results indicated that 6 of the 7 selected heterologous competitive antigens could enhance the sensitivity of ELISA. The ELISA sensitivity for the detection of ENR with sarafloxacin-BSA as heterologous coating antigen was improved 10-fold (in PBS) and 6-fold (in milk) compared with that with ENR-BSA as homologous antigen.

We detected 2 novel haplotypes on chromosomes 11 and 24 but did not confirm 6 previously reported haplotypes. The one on chromosome 11 showed a marked reduction in conception rates and moderate decrease in nonreturn rate in at-risk versus control mating, supporting late embryonic mortality. After fine mapping and analyzing whole-genome sequences, we prioritized a missense mutation in CAD (g.72399397T>C; p.Tyr452Cys)-a gene encoding a protein (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase) essential for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis-as a candidate causal variant. This transition mutation replaces a tyrosine residue, which is perfectly conserved among living organisms, with a cysteine residue in the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2 domain of the protein. A single animal was confirmed to be homozygous for the mutation based on Sanger sequencing. However, large-scale genotyping of the candidate variant with the Illumina EuroG10k BeadChip revealed an absence of live homozygotes in a panel of 33,323 Normande animals and an absence of carriers in 348,593 animals from 19 other cattle breeds. These results support recessive embryonic lethality with nearly complete penetrance, as was previously reported in CAD mutants in several eukaryote species. The only homozygous cow had extremely poor udder conformation, suggesting a potential role of CAD in udder development, but no effect was detected when comparing daughter yield deviations of 250 heterozygous bulls with that of 2,912 homozygotes for the ancestral allele. Together, our results showed the importance of large-scale screening for homozygous haplotype deficiency with hundreds of thousands of animals, validating results with an independent data set, and considering unexpected live homozygotes, to avoid both false-positive and false-negative discoveries. These discoveries will be used primarily in mating decisions to avoid at-risk mating. In addition, we recommend including CAD in the breeding objectives of Normande cattle.","Phenotypic relationships, genetic parameters, genome-wide associations, and identification of potential candidate genes for ketosis and fat-to-protein ratio in German Holstein cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056336,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 06,"Energy demand for milk production in early lactation exceeds energy intake, especially in high-yielding Holstein cows. Energy deficiency causes increasing susceptibility to metabolic disorders. In addition to several blood parameters, the fat-to-protein ratio (FPR) is suggested as an indicator for ketosis, because a FPR >1.5 refers to high lipolysis. The aim of this study was to analyze phenotypic, quantitative genetic, and genomic associations between FPR and ketosis. In this regard, 8,912 first-lactation Holstein cows were phenotyped for ketosis according to a veterinarian diagnosis key. Ketosis was diagnosed if the cow showed an abnormal carbohydrate metabolism with increased content of ketone bodies in the blood or urine. At least one entry for ketosis in the first 6 wk after calving implied a score = 1 (diseased); otherwise, a score = 0 (healthy) was assigned. The FPR from the first test-day was defined as a Gaussian distributed trait (FPRgauss), and also as a binary response trait (FPRbin), considering a threshold of FPR = 1.5. After imputation and quality controls, 45,613 SNP markers from the 8,912 genotyped cows were used for genomic studies. Phenotypically, an increasing ketosis incidence was associated with significantly higher FPR, and vice versa. Hence, from a practical trait recording perspective, first test-day FPR is suggested as an indicator for ketosis. The ketosis heritability was slightly larger when modeling the pedigree-based relationship matrix (pedigree-based: 0.17; SNP-based: 0.11). For FPRbin, heritabilities were larger when modeling the genomic relationship matrix (pedigree-based: 0.09; SNP-based: 0.15). For FPRgauss, heritabilities were almost identical for both pedigree and genomic relationship matrices (pedigree-based: 0.14; SNP-based: 0.15). Genetic correlations between ketosis with FPRbin and FPRgauss using either pedigree- or genomic-based relationship matrices were in a moderate range from 0.39 to 0.71. Applying genome-wide association studies, we identified the specific SNP rs109896020 (BTA 5, position: 115,456,438 bp) significantly contributing to ketosis. The identified potential candidate gene PARVB in close chromosomal distance is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in humans. The most important SNP contributing to FPRbin was located within the DGAT1 gene. Different SNP significantly contributed to ketosis and FPRbin, indicating different mechanisms for both traits genomically.","Short communication: Pro- and antioxidative indicators in serum of dairy cows during late pregnancy and early lactation: Testing the effects of parity, different dietary energy levels, and farm.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056335,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 06,"Dairy cows face metabolic challenges in the transition from late pregnancy to early lactation. The energy demands for the growing fetus and the onset of milk production are increasing but voluntary feed intake often decreases around parturition and cannot meet these demands. This energy balance, among others, can change the oxidative status. Oxidative stress occurs when antioxidant defense mechanisms are not sufficient to cope with the increasing generation of reactive oxygen species. Our objectives were to investigate (1) the effect of parity on the oxidative status of dairy cows (n = 247) in late pregnancy and early lactation; and (2) the effect of different inclusion rates of concentrate feeding (150 vs. 250 g/kg of energy-corrected milk) during early lactation on 2 farms including 87 cows in total. In addition, we aimed to compare the oxidative status across the 2 farms using equal portions of concentrate feeding. For these purposes, we measured concentrations of the derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (dROM) and the ferric reducing ability (FRAP) in serum on d -50, -14, +8, +28, and +100 relative to calving. Furthermore, we calculated the oxidative status index (OSi) as dROM/FRAP × 100. Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model. Cows in the first and second lactations had greater dROM, FRAP, and OSi than cows in their third and greater lactations. Hence, supporting the antioxidative side of the balance might be of particular importance in the first and second lactations. Feeding different amounts of concentrates did not affect dROM, FRAP, or OSi under our experimental conditions, suggesting that the relatively small differences in energy intake were not affecting the oxidative status. Comparing farms, cows from one farm were notable for having greater dROM and lower FRAP, resulting in a greater OSi compared with cows on the other farm. Milk yield showed a time by farm interaction with 7% less milk on d 100 on the farm with the greater OSi. Moreover, cows on that farm had 1.4-fold greater β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations. Our results emphasize the value of assessing oxidative status with regard to both the pro- and antioxidative sides, and support the association between oxidative and metabolic status. Further investigations are needed to determine the applicability of OSi as a prognostic tool during early lactation and to determine which factors have the greatest influence on oxidative status.","Choline supply during negative nutrient balance in Holstein cows alters hepatic cystathionine β-synthase, intermediates of the methionine cycle and transsulfuration pathway, and liver function in Holstein cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056334,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 06,"Although choline requirements for cows are unknown, enhanced postruminal supply may decrease liver triacylglycerol and increase flux through the Met cycle to improve immunometabolic status during a negative nutrient balance (NNB). Our objectives were to investigate the effects of postruminal choline supply during a feed restriction-induced NNB on (1) hepatic activity cystathionine β-synthase and transcription of enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway and Met cycle; (2) hepatic metabolites in the Met cycle and the transsulfuration pathway, bile acids, and energy metabolism; and 3) plasma biomarkers of liver function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Ten primiparous rumen-cannulated Holstein cows (158 ± 24 d postpartum) were used in a replicated 5 × 5 Latin square design with 4-d treatment periods and 10 d of recovery (14 d/period). Treatments were unrestricted intake with abomasal infusion of water, restricted intake (R; 60% of net energy for lactation requirements) with abomasal infusion of water, or R plus abomasal infusion of 6.25, 12.5, or 25 g/d choline ion. Liver tissue was collected on d 5 after infusions ended, and blood was collected on d 1, 3, and 5. Statistical contrasts were A0 versus R0 (CONT1), R versus the average of choline doses (CONT2), and tests of linear and quadratic effects of choline dose. Activity of cystathionine β-synthase was lower with R (CONT1) and decreased linearly with choline. Hepatic glutathione was not different with R or choline, but taurine tended to be greater with choline (CONT2). Betaine and carnitine were greater with R (CONT1) and further increased with choline (CONT2). Concentrations of NAD+ were greater with choline (CONT2). Cholic and glycol-chenodeoxycholic acids were decreased by R and choline, while taurocholic and tauro-chenodeoxycholic acids were not altered. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin were greater with R (CONT1) but decreased with choline (CONT2). Paraoxonase was lower with R and increased with choline (CONT2). Data suggest that enhanced supply of choline during NNB decreases entry of homocysteine to the transsulfuration pathway, potentially favoring remethylation to Met by acquiring a methyl group from betaine. As such, Met may provide methyl groups for synthesis of carnitine. Along with production data indicating that 12.5 g/d choline ion improved milk yield and liver fatty acid metabolism during NNB, the changes in blood biomarkers also suggest a beneficial effect of choline supply on liver function and oxidative stress.","Genetic parameter estimates for body conformation traits using composite index, principal component, and factor analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056333,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Information about genetic parameters is population specific and it is crucial for designing animal breeding programs and predicting response to selection. This study was carried out to estimate the genetic parameters for 23 body conformation traits of 45,517 Chinese Holstein reared in Eastern China from 1995 to 2017 with the Bayesian inference method using a linear animal mixed model. The methods to integrate these traits included (1) using the composite index from the Dairy Association of China and (2) applying principal component analysis and factor analysis to explore the relationship between the conformation traits. Estimates of heritability using the composite index were low (0.04; feet and legs) to moderate (0.23; body capacity). Strong genetic correlations were observed between the individual body conformation traits. Both principal components (1 to 7; eigenvalues ≥ 1) and latent factors (1 to 7; eigenvalues ≥ 1) explained 60.37% of total variability. Principal component 1 and factor 1 accounted for the traits that are usually associated with milk production. Moderate to low heritability were estimated through multi-trait analysis for principal components (from 0.07 to 0.21) and latent factors (from 0.07 to 0.23). Genetic correlations among the 2 multivariate techniques are typically lower compared with the one existing among the measured traits. Results from these analyses suggest the possibility of using both principal component analysis and factor analysis in morphological evaluation, simplifying the information given by the body conformation traits into new variables that could be useful for the genetic improvement of the Chinese Holstein population. This information could also be used to avoid analyzing large number of correlated traits, thereby improving precision and reducing computation burdens to analyze large and complex data."

Under this model, animals' permanent environment effects are assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process over the long (auto-correlations between parities) and short (auto-correlations between test-days within lactation) terms. Given the relevance of genomic prediction in dairy cattle, it is essential to include marker information in national genetic evaluations. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of applying the single-step genomic (G)BLUP to analyze milk yield using the AR model in Portuguese Holstein cattle. In total, 11,434,294 test-day records from the first 3 lactations collected between 1994 and 2017 and 1,071 genotyped bulls were used in this study. Rank correlations and differences in reliability among bulls were used to compare the performance of the traditional (A-AR) and single-step (H-AR) models. These 2 modeling approaches were also applied to reduced data sets with records truncated after 2012 (deleting daughters of tested bulls) to evaluate the predictive ability of the H-AR. Validation scenarios were proposed, taking into account young and proven bulls. Average EBV reliabilities, empirical reliabilities, and genetic trends predicted from the complete and reduced data sets were used to validate the genomic evaluation. Average EBV reliabilities for H-AR (A-AR) using the complete data set were 0.52 (0.16) and 0.72 (0.62) for genotyped bulls with no daughters and bulls with 1 to 9 daughters, respectively. These results showed an increase in EBV reliabilities of 0.10 to 0.36 when genomic information was included, corresponding to a reduction of up to 43% in prediction error variance. Considering the 3 validation scenarios, the inclusion of genomic information improved the average EBV reliability in the reduced data set, which ranged, on average, from 0.16 to 0.26, indicating an increase in the predictive ability. Similarly, empirical reliability increased by up to 0.08 between validation tests. The H-AR outperformed A-AR in terms of genetic trends when unproven genotyped bulls were included. The results suggest that the single-step GBLUP AR model is feasible and may be applied to national Portuguese genetic evaluations for milk yield.",Genomic analysis of perinatal sucking reflex in German Brown Swiss calves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056319,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 06,"A healthy sucking reflex is essential for newborn calves to ensure sufficient colostrum intake in the first few hours postpartum. In recent decades, European Brown Swiss breeders have repeatedly reported that some calves lack the ability to consume colostrum directly after birth due to an absent sucking reflex. In this study, we collected the phenotypes of more than 5,500 German Brown Swiss calves and performed variance component estimation with sire threshold models using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The 50K (777K) genotypes of nearly 2,000 (200) calves were collected, and an imputation was performed for all 50K genotypes up to 777K. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the trait sucking reflex were conducted for all 777K genotypes. Depending on the trait coding, a low heritability was estimated to range from 0.08 to 0.11. The GWAS results identified 34 trait-associated SNP on 6 different chromosomes. Post-GWAS analyses showed significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontologies for central nervous development and several regulative processes. Functional annotation clustering and pathway analysis revealed relations to lipid metabolism, immune and endocrine systems, and signal transduction. The results of this study suggest that breeding for an improved sucking reflex is possible but requires large data sets for the estimation of reliable breeding values (either large progeny testing groups or a large reference genome in a genomic selection program).",Biogenic amines: Concentrations in serum and skeletal muscle from late pregnancy until early lactation in dairy cows with high versus normal body condition score.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056318,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 06,"Biogenic amines (BA) are a class of nitrogenous compounds that are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes, but their role in transition cows is poorly understood. Our objectives were to describe the longitudinal changes of BA in serum and in skeletal muscle during the transition period and to characterize temporal responses of BA in relation to body condition score (BCS) of periparturient dairy cows. Fifteen weeks before calving, 36 multiparous Holstein cows were assigned to 2 groups (n = 18 per group) that were fed differently to reach either high [HBCS; net energy for lactation (NEL) = 7.2 MJ/kg of dry matter (DM)] or normal BCS (NBCS; NEL = 6.8 MJ/kg of DM) at dry-off. The targeted BCS and back fat thickness (BFT) at dry-off (HBCS, >3.75 and >1.4 cm; NBCS, <3.5 and <1.2 cm) were reached. Thereafter, both groups were fed identical diets. Blood samples and muscle (semitendinosus) biopsies were collected at d -49, +3, +21, and +84 relative to parturition. In serum and skeletal muscle, BA concentrations were measured using a targeted metabolomics assay. The data were analyzed as a repeated measure using the MIXED procedure of SAS. The serum concentrations of most BA (i.e., creatinine, taurine, carnosine putrescine, spermine, α-aminoadipic acid, acetylornithine, kynurenine, serotonin, hydroxyproline, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and symmetric dimethylarginine) fluctuated during the transition period, while others (i.e., spermidine, phenylethylamine) did not change with time. The muscle concentrations of BA remained unchanged over time. Creatinine had the highest concentrations in the serum, while carnosine had the highest concentration among the muscle BA. The serum concentrations of creatinine (d +21), putrescine (d +84), α-aminoadipic acid (d +3), and hydroxyproline (d +21) were or tended to be higher for HBCS compared with NBCS postpartum. The serum concentrations of symmetric dimethylarginine (d -49) and acetylornithine (d +84) were or tended to be lower for HBCS compared with NBCS, respectively. The serum kynurenine/tryptophan ratio was greater with HBCS than with NBCS (d +84). Compared with NBCS, HBCS was associated with lower muscle concentrations of carnosine, but those of hydroxyproline were higher (d -49). In both serum and muscle, the asymmetric dimethylarginine concentrations were greater with HBCS than with NBCS (d -49). No correlation was found between serum and skeletal muscle BA.

Here, we harnessed a methodology for retrospective sorting of fully functional, stroma-free cancer cells solely on the basis of their relative distance from blood vessels (BVs) to unveil the whole spectrum of genes, metabolites, and biological traits impacted by BV proximity. In both grafted mouse tumors and natural human glioblastoma (GBM), mTOR activity was confined to few cell layers from the nearest perfused vessel. Cancer cells within this perivascular tier are distinguished by intense anabolic metabolism and defy the Warburg principle through exercising extensive oxidative phosphorylation. Functional traits acquired by perivascular cancer cells, namely, enhanced tumorigenicity, superior migratory or invasive capabilities, and, unexpectedly, exceptional chemo- and radioresistance, are all mTOR dependent.

Mechanistic experiments using ACBP-acyl-CoA binding affinity variants and pharmacological FAO modulators suggest that ACBP supports tumor growth by controlling the availability of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs to mitochondria, promoting FAO in GBM. Thus, our findings uncover a critical link between lipid metabolism and GBM progression established by ACBP and offer a potential therapeutic strategy for an effective anti-proliferative metabolic management of GBM."

A,2019 05 06,"Cell membrane chromatography (CMC) is a bioaffinity chromatographic method used to screen active compounds from natural products. However, since the receptor capacity of CMC column is limited, high content/affinity compounds may cause column overloading and thus lead to ignorance of other positive candidates. For avoiding this effect and comprehensively discovering bioactive components, a strategy based on two-dimensional CMC and component-knockout approach was proposed. As an illustrative case study, red yeast rice (RYR), a rice product with good myocardial protective effect in clinical studies, was selected as the model experimental sample. For discovering its potential cardioprotective compounds, a CMC model with H9c2 rat cardiac myoblasts (H9c2/CMC) with good selectivity, stability and reproducibility was established. By using two-dimensional H9c2/CMC-HPLC coupled with QTOF MS system, three components were firstly screened out. After knocking out high content/affinity compound, another four bioactive compounds were then found. By this two-round screening, column overloading caused by high concentration or infinity compounds was avoided, and trace compounds were enriched. As a result, one pigment and six monacolins from RYR were fished out. The results indicate the proposed strategy might be used to discover active compounds from complex matrix.",Simultaneous quantification of acidic and basic flupirtine metabolites by supercritical fluid chromatography according to European Medicines Agency validation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056272,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 06,"Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) holds the potential to become an orthogonal method to HPLC/UHPLC in xenobiotic metabolism studies, due to its outstanding capacity to simultaneously separate highly similar (as HPLC) and physicochemically different analytes (problematic using HPLC). Paucity of guideline-conform validation, however, has been a major obstacle to clinical application of SFC, even in cases where biotransformation yields chemically dissimilar metabolites that require more than one HPLC method for comprehensive analysis. Here, a method based on supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to single quadrupole MS detection was developed to simultaneously quantify the divisive analgesic flupirtine and its acidic and basic metabolites, represented by 4-fluorohippuric acid (4-FHA) and the active metabolite D-13223 respectively, using custom-made synthetic internal standards. Experimental data on the fundamental retention mechanisms under supercritical conditions, indicating the importance of halogen and π-π-bonding for specific retention on polysaccharide-based stationary-phases, is discussed. Compared to previous HPLC methods, the novel method offers higher versatility in terms of the target metabolite range (addressing both acidic and basic metabolites within a singular method), faster analysis (7.5 min), and compliance with green chemistry principles. Validation was performed according to EMA criteria on bioanalytical method validation, demonstrating selectivity, carry-over, calibration curve parameters (LLOQ, range, and linearity), within- and between-run accuracy and precision, dilution integrity, matrix effect and stability. For proof-of-concept, the SFC method was applied to clinical samples of human urine obtained after single intravenous (100 mg), single oral (100 mg), and repeated oral administration (400 mg). Flupirtine, D-13223, and 4-FHA could be quantified, shedding light on the extent of oxidative flupirtine metabolism in humans in the context of the unresolved biotoxification that has led to the withdrawal of specific neuronal KV7 openers.",Halogen bonding for increasing efficiency in liquid-liquid microextraction: Application to the extraction of hexabromocyclododecane enantiomers in river water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056271,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 06 11,"Halogen bonding (XB) was here proposed, for the first time, as a solubilization mechanism for increasing efficiency in the liquid-liquid microextraction of halogenated compounds. The approach was illustrated by the extraction of hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) enantiomers in natural waters with a supramolecular solvent (SUPRAS) made up of inverted hexagonal aggregates of decanoic acid. The XB and dispersion interactions offered by the SUPRAS were able to extract the six HBCD enantiomers (i.e. (+)-α-, (-)-α- (+)-β-, (-)-β-, (+)-γ- and (-)-γ-) quantitatively (e.g. recoveries in the range 89-106%) and reach concentration factors as high as 720 without the need for solvent evaporation. HBCD enantiomers in the SUPRAS extract were directly analysed by chiral liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). Quantitation limits of the method (0.09-0.9 ng L-1) were below the quality standard stablished by the European Union for HBCDs in inland surface water samples (1.6 ng L-1), and the precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (n = 6), was below 9% for all the HBCD enantiomers at concentrations within the range 50-500 ng L-1. The method was successfully applied to the enantioselective determination of HBCDs in the dissolved and the particle-bound fractions of river waters containing different concentration of suspended particles (10-57.8 mg L-1) that were spiked at two concentration levels (10 and 100 ng L-1). The results here obtained prove that XB is a valuable mechanism for the solubilisation of halogenated compounds that can effectively increase their recovery from liquid and solid samples.",Chromatographic behavior of bivalent bispecific antibodies on cation exchange columns. I. Experimental observations and phenomenological model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056270,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 06,"The cation exchange chromatographic behavior of three homologous bivalent bispecific antibodies (BiSAb) is characterized for two different resins, Source 15S and ProPac WCX-10, having different base matrix, particle size, pore structure, and ligand chemistry. For both resins, elution with a salt gradient results in multiple peaks for each of the three BiSAb molecules at short residence times. The peaks gradually merge into two peaks and then into one peak eluting at intermediate salt concentrations when the residence time is gradually increased. Re-injecting fractions of each the individual peaks obtained at short residence time results in nearly the same multiple peak elution pattern. This behavior, which is contrary to the behavior normally encountered in ion exchange chromatography, appears to be related to the reversible, surface -catalyzed interconversion between different conformational states of each BiSAb that interact with different strength with the chromatographic surface. This behavior is qualitatively independent of pH in the range 5-8.5, protein load in the range 0.06-5.0 mg/ml, and gradient slope, and is not associated with the formation of aggregates. Gradually increasing temperature, however, reduces the multiple peak behavior eventually resulting into a single peak at 55 °C A phenomenological model is developed that predicts the experimental behavior over a broad range of conditions using fitted rate and equilibrium constants.",Liquid chromatographic chiral recognition of phytoalexins on immobilized polysaccharides chiral stationary phases.

A,2019 05 06,"Three immobilized polysaccharide chiral stationary phases, Chiralpak IA, Chiralpak IB and Chiralpak IC, were used for the study of enantioseparation of 36 derivatives of natural indole phytoalexins, in most cases bioactive, including racemic spirobrassinin, 1-methoxyspirobrassinin and 1-methoxyspirobrassinol methyl ether. Almost all analytes were baseline resolved at least on two different polysaccharide columns in normal phase mode. The effects of mobile phase composition, the analyte structure and the column temperature on the retention and enantioseparation were investigated. Evaluation of the corresponding thermodynamic parameters using van´t Hoff plots (ln k versus 1/T) in the temperature range -15 to 50 °C indicated that separations were enthalpy controlled in most cases, but some entropy controlled separations were also observed. Moreover, unusual phenomenon, an increase retention with increasing temperature accompanied with increased resolution was observed on the Chiralpak IC column.

Although it is widely believed that ANPEP acts as an important angiogenesis regulatory factor, there are few studies about its function in the female reproductive system. In our previous research, we applied Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) to analyze the influence of different controlled superovulation treatments for Assisted Reproductive Technology, In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET)) patients from a global proteomic perspective to search for potential biomarkers associated with endometrium receptivity and embryo implantation. ANPEP is one of the proteins that demonstrated differential expression between different treatment groups and may be closely associated with endometrial receptivity. In this study, we assessed the expression of ANPEP in the endometrium of mice at different ages and found it to be highest in the mature period. We also detected ANPEP expression in the endometrium of IVF-ET patients in the proliferative, preimplantation and implantation stages, and the highest expression level of ANPEP was found in the last group. Human primary endometrial stromal cells were infected with an adenovirus expression vector containing the ANPEP gene and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein; the mRNA levels of HOXA-10, LIF, and integrin β3 were found to be increased.

In this study, we present a new mechanism of Irinotecan which inhibits the activities of MDM2, an E3 ligase of tumour suppressor p53, and Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, through direct binding. In our structure modelling study, Irinotecan could fit to the binding sites of MDM2 and Bcl-xL for their known drugs, Nutlin-3 and ABT-737, with a better binding affinity than to Topo I. The direct binding of Irinotecan to both proteins was confirmed through a NMR study. We further showed that Irinotecan increased the amount of p53 only in the presence of MDM2 and inhibited the physical interaction of Bcl-xL with Bim, a core pro-apoptotic protein. In addition, we demonstrated that Irinotecan induced the down regulation of proliferation and strong G2/M arrest in HCT116 colon cancer cells shortly after treatment. Collectively, we suggest a new mechanism of action for Irinotecan as a dual target inhibitor of MDM2 and Bcl-xL facilitating the anticancer activities mediated by p53 and Bcl-xL interaction partners.",A novel Kir7.1 splice variant expressed in various mouse tissues shares organisational and functional properties with human Leber amaurosis-causing mutations of this K+ channel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056263,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 01,"Kir7.1 is an inwardly rectifying K+ channel present in epithelia where it shares membrane localization with the Na+/K+-pump. In the present communication we report the presence of a novel splice variant of Kir7.1 in mouse tissues including kidney, lung, choroid plexus and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The variant named mKir7.1-SV2 lacks most of the C-terminus domain but is predicted to have the two transmembrane domains and permeation pathway unaffected. Similarly truncated predicted proteins, Kir7.1-R166X and Kir7.1-Q219X, would arise from mutations associated with Leber Congenital Amaurosis, a rare recessive hereditary retinal disease that results in vision loss at early age. We found that mKir7.1-SV2 and the pathological variants do not produce any channel activity when expressed alone in HEK-293 cells due to their scarce presence in the plasma membrane. Simultaneous expression with the full length Kir7.1 however leads to a reduction in activity of the wild-type channel that might be due to partial proteasome degradation of WT-mutant channel heteromers."

Numerous clinical tools to diagnose frailty exist, but none has emerged as the standard tool to be used in clinical practice. Radiological modalities, such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, are widely performed before surgery, and are therefore available to be used opportunistically to objectively evaluate surrogate markers of frailty. This review presents the importance of frailty assessment by anaesthesiologists; lists common clinical tools that have been applied; and proposes that utilising radiological imaging as an objective surrogate measure of frailty is a novel, expanding approach for which anaesthesiologists can significantly contribute to broad implementation."

The extended Kalman filter (EKF) method is used to estimate SOC widely. But it does not consider the SOC constraints. Moreover, the convergence is influenced by the uncertain initial SOC, which may lead to false alarm, unwanted operation of protection, error dispatching and poor robustness of the system. This paper presents an improved extended Kalman filter (IEKF) method to estimate SOC for vanadium redox battery (VRB) by introducing a gain factor. It can be adjusted automatically according to the output error and SOC boundary. To implement IEKF estimator, a VRB state space model is established and its parameters are identified by recursive least square (RLS) method. Then a VRB of 5kW/30kWh experimental platform is built. Finally, the IEKF method is validated and compared with EKF against unknown initial value through the experiments. The results have shown that IEKF method is superior to EKF in terms of accuracy, convergence speed and robustness. And the estimated SOC remains bounded by using IEKF method. It is more suitable for SOC estimation than EKF algorithm in the industrial applications.",Adaptive super-twisting sliding mode observer based robust backstepping sensorless speed control for IPMSM.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056215,ISA transactions,2019 05 06,"This paper proposes a higher-order sliding mode observer based robust backstepping control to realize high-performance sensorless speed regulation for the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM).

Olives intended for Spanish-style green olives are currently debittered with NaOH that generates lyes and washing waters that cannot be used for agronomic purposes. In this study, the substitution of NaOH with KOH during the debittering of Manzanilla and Hojiblanca cultivars was assessed as well as the vacuum evaporation of the olive wastewaters to comply with fertilizer requirements. Typical lactic acid fermentation occurred in brines of olives treated with KOH and a final product with similar color and flavor characteristics to those treated with NaOH was achieved. However, lower texture was found in olives debittered with KOH than those with NaOH, using them at the same molar concentration. Furthermore, the lyes and washing waters from the KOH treatment were concentrated up to 10% of their initial volume and they complied with Spanish requirements to be considered as organo-mineral fertilizers (Corganic > 4%, K2O > 2%, Ntotal + K20 > 6%) although an external source of nitrogen would be needed.

We first applied Benchmarker to 20 well-powered GWASs and compared gene prioritization based on strategies employing three different data sources, including annotated gene sets and gene expression; genes prioritized based on gene sets had higher per-SNP heritability than those prioritized based on gene expression. Additionally, in a direct comparison of three methods, DEPICT and MAGMA outperformed NetWAS. We also evaluated combinations of methods; our results indicated that combining data sources and algorithms can help prioritize higher-quality genes for follow-up. Benchmarker provides an unbiased approach to evaluate any similarity-based method that provides genome-wide prioritization of genes, variants, or gene sets and can determine the best such method for any particular GWAS. Our method addresses an important unmet need for rigorous tool assessment and can assist in mapping genetic associations to causal function.",Safety of intradiscal delivery of triamcinolone acetonide by a poly(esteramide) microsphere platform in a large animal model of intervertebral disc degeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056104,The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,2019 05 06,"Local corticosteroids have been used to relieve symptoms of chronic low back pain, although treatment effects have been shown to wear off relatively fast.

Clinicians are well positioned to critique these processes and their input into such policies may be beneficial. A two-cycle, multi-centre audit was completed to assess the consistency of consent forms in two orthodontic departments. The results from the first cycle initiated the implementation of changes to hospital policy, in order to produce a new procedure-specific consent form for orthodontic treatment.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 05 06,"Plant qualitative resistances to viruses are natural exhaustible resources that can be impaired by the emergence of resistance-breaking (RB) virus variants. Mathematical modelling can help determine optimal strategies for resistance durability by a rational deployment of resistance in agroecosystems. Here, we propose an innovative approach, built up from our previous empirical studies, based on plant cultivars combining qualitative resistance with quantitative resistance narrowing population bottlenecks exerted on viruses during host-to-host transmission and/or within-host infection. Narrow bottlenecks are expected to slow down virus adaptation to plant qualitative resistance. To study the effect of bottleneck size on yield, we developed a stochastic epidemic model with mixtures of susceptible and resistant plants, relying on continuous-time Markov chain processes. Overall, narrow bottlenecks are beneficial when the fitness cost of RB virus variants in susceptible plants is intermediate. In such cases, they could provide up to 95 additional percentage points of yield compared with deploying a qualitative resistance alone. As we have shown in previous works that virus population bottlenecks are at least partly heritable plant traits, our results suggest that breeding and deploying plant varieties exposing virus populations to narrowed bottlenecks will increase yield and delay the emergence of RB variants.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 05 06,"Epidemics are often triggered by specific weather patterns favouring the pathogen on susceptible hosts. For plant diseases, models predicting epidemics have therefore often emphasized the identification of early season weather patterns that are correlated with a disease outcome at some later point. Toward that end, window-pane analysis is an exhaustive search algorithm traditionally used in plant pathology for mining correlations in a weather series with respect to a disease endpoint. Here we show, with reference to Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, that a functional approach is a more principled analytical method for understanding the relationship between disease epidemics and environmental conditions over an extended time series. We used scalar-on-function regression to model a binary outcome (FHB epidemic or non-epidemic) relative to weather time series spanning 140 days relative to flowering (when FHB infection primarily occurs). The functional models overall fit the data better than previously described standard logistic regression (lr) models. Periods much earlier than heretofore realized were associated with FHB epidemics. The findings were used to create novel weather summary variables which, when incorporated into lr models, yielded a new set of models that performed as well as existing lr models for real-time predictions of disease risk.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 05 06,"Predicting the impact of natural disasters such as hurricanes on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases poses significant challenges. In this paper, we put forward a simple modelling framework to investigate the impact of heavy rainfall events (HREs) on mosquito-borne disease transmission in temperate areas of the world such as the southern coastal areas of the USA. In particular, we explore the impact of the timing of HREs relative to the transmission season via analyses that test the sensitivity of HRE-induced epidemics to variation in the effects of rainfall on the dynamics of mosquito breeding capacity, and the intensity and temporal profile of human population displacement patterns. The recent Hurricane Harvey in Texas motivates the simulations reported. Overall, we find that the impact of vector-borne disease transmission is likely to be greater the earlier the HREs occur in the transmission season. Simulations based on data for Hurricane Harvey suggest that the limited impact it had on vector-borne disease transmission was in part because of when it occurred (late August) relative to the local transmission season, and in part because of the mitigating effect of the displacement of people. We also highlight key data gaps related to models of vector-borne disease transmission in the context of natural disasters.

Series B, Biological sciences",2019 05 06,"Dynamic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) compartmental models provide a tool for predicting the size and duration of both unfettered and managed outbreaks-the latter in the context of interventions such as case detection, patient isolation, vaccination and treatment. The reliability of this tool depends on the validity of key assumptions that include homogeneity of individuals and spatio-temporal homogeneity. Although the SEIR compartmental framework can easily be extended to include demographic (e.g. age) and additional disease (e.g. healthcare workers) classes, dependence of transmission rates on time, and metapopulation structure, fitting such extended models is hampered by both a proliferation of free parameters and insufficient or inappropriate data. This raises the question of how effective a tool the basic SEIR framework may actually be. We go some way here to answering this question in the context of the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa by comparing fits of an SEIR time-dependent transmission model to both country- and district-level weekly incidence data. Our novel approach in estimating the effective-size-of-the-populations-at-risk ( Neff) and initial number of exposed individuals ( E0) at both district and country levels, as well as the transmission function parameters, including a time-to-halving-the-force-of-infection ( tf/2) parameter, provides new insights into this Ebola outbreak. It reveals that the estimate R0 ≈ 1.7 from country-level data appears to seriously underestimate R0 ≈ 3.3 - 4.3 obtained from more spatially homogeneous district-level data. Country-level data also overestimate tf/2 ≈ 22 weeks, compared with 8-10 weeks from district-level data. Additionally, estimates for the duration of individual infectiousness is around two weeks from spatially inhomogeneous country-level data compared with 2.4-4.5 weeks from spatially more homogeneous district-level data, which estimates are rather high compared with most values reported in the literature.

Methods: Physical activity (PA), sleep, and screen time of children with ADHD (aged 6-18 y) were compared with recommendations and with behaviors of children with autism, asthma, and a normative group using 2011 National Survey of Child Health data. Results: Approximately one-third of children with ADHD participated in daily PA and half in sports in the past year. Older children with ADHD were less likely to get daily PA, get enough sleep, and limit screen time to <2 hours per day. Obese children had lower odds of daily PA. Children who had lower socioeconomic status, or severe ADHD, had lower odds of sports participation. Children with ADHD had 50% lower odds of sports participation than children with asthma.

In four methodically diverse studies, we found converging support for this hypothesis. Semantically or symbolically activating Christian religious concepts, as well as being a self-reported believer, attenuated participants' need to reduce post-decisional dissonance via a spreading of alternatives in a free-choice paradigm (Studies 1, 2, & 4) as well as after counterattitudinal advocacy in an induced compliance paradigm (Study 3).

Participants classified spam emails according to pairings of three stimulus features - presence or absence of awkward prose, abnormal message structure, and implausible premise. We examined dimensional interactions within general recognition theory (GRT; a multidimensional extension of signal detection theory). Classification accuracy was highest for categories containing either two non-normal dimension levels (e.g. awkward prose and implausible premise) or two normal dimension levels (e.g. normal prose and plausible premise). Modelling indicated both perceptual and decisional contributions to classification responding. In most cases, perceptual discriminability was higher along one dimension when stimuli contained a non-normal level of the paired dimension (e.g. prose discriminability was higher with abnormal structure). Similarly, decision criteria along one dimension were biased in favour of the non-normal response when stimuli contained a non-normal level of the paired dimension. Potential applications for training are discussed. Practitioner summary: We applied general recognition theory (i.e. multivariate signal detection theory) to spam email classification at low or high levels of three stimulus dimensions: premise plausibility, prose quality, and email structure. Relevant to training, this approach helped identify perceptual and decisional biases that could be leveraged to individualise training.","Social Support, Retirement Resources, and the Gendered Experiences of Aging for Tunisian Older Adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056017,Journal of gerontological social work,2019 05 06,"Cultural context plays an important role in the experience of aging.

The amino acid sequence of the protein did not show any significant homology in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases. Recombinant PsPCP was expressed as the soluble form in E. coli. The reaction mixture of purified recombinant PsPCP and 3H-indol-3-one showed a pink color as the native pigment. A real-time PCR analysis revealed the strong expression of PsPCP in the primordium formation stage of the life cycle of the fungus; however, its expression decreased with the maturation of the fruit body. A comparison of PsPCP gene expression profiles between two strains revealed high levels in the dark-colored strain.",The Implementation of Marijuana Legalization in New York.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31056005,"Psychiatric services (Washington, D.C.)",2019 05 06,"In 2018, Governor Cuomo tasked the Department of Health (DOH) with studying the anticipated impact of legalizing recreational marijuana use in New York State.

Four diets were designed in which 25%, 50%, and 100% of calcium carbonate (CaCO3, Control) were substituted with MBCa and were designated as MBCa-25, MBCa-50, and MBCa-100, respectively. The cecal concentration of short-chain fatty acids was significantly higher in groups MBCa-50 and MBCa-100; however, pH of cecal contents did not significantly differ among the groups. Retention rates of calcium and magnesium were significantly higher in all MBCa groups as compared to the Control. In Experiment 2, the efficiency of calcium absorption was compared using everted sacs of jejunum and ileum with CaCO3 and MBCa as calcium sources. More calcium from MBCa was absorbed as the concentration of calcium increased in comparison to CaCO3. It was concluded that MBCa is a better calcium source than CaCO3 in terms of both calcium retention and absorption.

Conventional soybean transformation methods using chemical selectable markers, such as antibiotic or herbicide resistance genes, rely on the identification of positive transgenic lines at advanced developmental stages, making selection procedure labor intensive and time consuming. Utilization of a visual maker to track the transgene would avoid the uncertainty and blindness in the transformation process. In this research, we used green fluorescent protein (GFP) as the selectable marker to detect transgenics at early stages of soybean development. Positive transformants were detected recurrently during each stage of the process based on visualization of the green fluorescence signal, which help us to discard the non-transgenic ones in each stage to reduce the unnecessary experimental cost and lab space. In addition, the positive transgenic seeds can be identified before planting for early detection of transgene and obtain homozygous lines in advance.

The sexual beliefs and attitudes of a person begin in childhood and are developed through multiple chains in early adolescence, affecting his or her future sexual behavior and future incidence of HIV. A deeper understanding of the perspectives of adolescents regarding infidelity is critical to effective HIV prevention efforts during adulthood. Using a descriptive qualitative approach, this study explored the perceptions of male adolescents regarding male infidelity. Through the thematic analysis method, themes and subcategories were developed from the responses of 48 male high school students from three provinces. Majority of the participants ( n = 33) were found to have liberal attitudes not only toward male infidelity but also toward the high possibility of their own future infidelity ( n = 14). Almost 45% ( n = 21) of the participants explained that men would fulfill their sexual desires outside, such as in karaoke, when their wives are unable to have sex with them. Participants believed it annoying for men to disclose their extramarital activities to their wives. The study concluded that the participants hold accepting perceptions about infidelity; they are part of the HIV problem and must be part of the solution.

The impact of the duration from hospital admission to TTM initiation (door-to- TTM ; DTT ) on clinical outcomes has not been well elucidated. We hypothesized that shorter DTT initiation intervals would be associated with improved survival with favorable neurological outcome. Methods and Results We performed a post hoc analysis of nontraumatic paramedic-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. The primary outcome was favorable neurological status at hospital discharge, with a secondary outcome of survival to discharge. We fit a logistic regression analysis to determine the association of early compared with delayed DTT , dichotomized by the median DTT duration, and outcomes. Of 3805 patients enrolled in the CCC (Continuous Chest Compressions) Trial in British Columbia, 570 were included in this analysis. There was substantial variation in DTT among patients receiving TTM . The median DTT duration was 122 minutes (interquartile range 35-218). Favorable neurological outcomes in the early and delayed DTT groups were 48% and 38%, respectively. Compared with delayed DTT (interquartile range 167-319 minutes), early DTT (interquartile range 20-81 minutes) was associated with survival (adjusted odds ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.02-2.38) but not with favorable neurological outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI , 0.94-2.22) at hospital discharge. Conclusions There was wide variability in the initiation of TTM among comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors. Initiation of TTM within 122 minutes of hospital admission was associated with improved survival. These results support in-hospital efforts to achieve early DTT among out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients admitted to the hospital.",Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Among Men in the Middle East: A Retrospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055980,American journal of men's health,2019 05 19,"The rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious global health concern. The world is experiencing type 2 diabetes epidemics and prevalence differs by gender, regions, and level of socioeconomic development. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in men increased at a faster rate and numbers are continuing to rise in some regions of the world. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of T2DM among men in the Middle East countries. Seventy-four research articles were identified through search engines including Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Ovid databases by using keywords ""epidemiology,"" ""prevalence,"" ""diabetes mellitus,"" and individual names of the Middle East states. Finally, 17 studies were included for the assessment of prevalence of T2DM among men in the Middle East. In the Middle East, high prevalence of T2DM among men was identified in Bahrain (33.60%), Saudi Arabia (29.10%), United Arab Emirates (UAE; 25.83%), and Kuwait (25.40%), whereas low prevalence was reported in Iran (9.90%) and Yemen (9.80%). The random pooled prevalence in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states was (24.0%) compared to non-GCC states (16.0%), and in both GCC and non-GCC countries combined, it was 19%. The prevalence was significantly associated with the gross domestic product of these states ( p = .0005). Despite different socioeconomic and cultural settings in the Middle East, the rising T2DM prevalence among men was identified in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait. These states must incorporate future diabetes defensive strategies targeting the Middle East population to minimize the burden of DM from the region.",Effect of IL-21 on the Balance of Th17 Cells/Treg Cells in the Pathogenesis of Graves' Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055979,Endocrine research,2019 05 06,"Graves' disease (GD) is a common organ-specific autoimmune disease, and its pathogenesis is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of interleukin (IL)-21 in the regulation of Th17/Treg cells in GD. We recruited 28 newly diagnosed GD patients, 27 GD patients in remission (eGD), and 24 normal controls (NC). Thyroid function and autoantibodies were evaluated by electrochemical luminescence. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured with or without recombinant human interleukin-21 (rhIL-21), and mRNA and protein levels were quantified by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Compared with those in the eGD and control groups, the thyroid function indexes and autoantibodies levels were significantly different in the GD group (P < 0.05). Without rhIL-21 stimulation, the expression levels of retinoid-related orphan gamma t (RORγt), IL-17, IL-22, forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3) and IL-10 mRNA and the IL-10 and IL-22 proteins were significantly higher in the GD group than those in the eGD and control groups (P < 0.05). rhIL-21 stimulation increased the RORγt, IL-17, and IL-22 mRNA levels and IL-22 protein levels and decreased the Foxp3 and IL-10 mRNA levels and IL-10 protein levels (P < 0.05) in the GD group. In conclusion, our analyses demonstrated that IL-21 might induce the differentiation of CD4+ T cells to Th17 cells and reduce Treg cell differentiation, which could contribute to activation of the downstream immune response and the pathogenesis of GD.",Minimally invasive surgical approaches for lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055977,Expert review of respiratory medicine,2019 05 29,"Introduction: Surgery is the standard of care for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but there remains on an ongoing discussion as to what is the best surgical approach. Despite only modest adoption of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), it is now the favored approach over traditional open surgery. MIS techniques like video-assisted (VATS) and robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS) have been demonstrated to reduce postoperative complications and shorten the length of hospitalization. Furthermore, despite unresolved questions of the oncological equivalency of MIS approaches, recent literature suggests no differences in upstaging or survival between VATS and open surgery. Area covered: We examine the current state and future direction of MIS for lung cancer in this review. Expert opinion: The perioperative benefits of VATS may make it superior to thoracotomy. There is overall insufficient clinical and patient equipoise to support a large randomized trial comparing MIS with open surgery at this time, but this may change in the presence of compelling preliminary data. The growing use of RATS has thus far only shown equivalence to VATS at a higher cost. Further investigation is needed.",Cost-effectiveness analysis of second-line pharmacological treatment of acromegaly in Spain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055976,Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,2019 05 28,"Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of second-line pharmacological treatments in patients with acromegaly resistant to first-generation somatostatin analogues (FG SSA) from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective. Methods: A Markov model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of pegvisomant and pasireotide in FG SSA-resistant acromegaly, simulating a cohort of patients from the treatment beginning to death. Treatment with pegvisomant or pasireotide was compared to FG SSA retreatment. Efficacy data were obtained from clinical trials and utilities from the literature. Direct health costs were obtained from Spanish sources (€2018). Results: The Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of pegvisomant vs. FG SSA was €85,869/Quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The ICER of pasireotide vs. FG SSA was €551,405/QALY. The ICER was mainly driven by the incremental efficacy (4.41 QALY for pegvisomant vs. FG SSA and 0.71 QALY for pasireotide vs. FG SSA), with a slightly lower increase in costs with pegvisomant (€378,597 vs. FG SSA) than with pasireotide (€393,151 vs. FG SSA). Conclusion: The ICER of pasireotide compared to FG SSA was six times higher than the ICER of pegvisomant vs. FG SSA. Pegvisomant is a more cost-effective alternative for the treatment of acromegaly in FG SSA-resistant patients in the Spanish NHS.",The choice of amniotic fluid in metabolomics for the monitoring of fetus health - update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055975,Expert review of proteomics,2019 06 03,"Introduction: In recent years, several studies have highlighted the promising role of metabolomics in the analysis of amniotic fluid (AF), to describe and characterize the interactions occurring between the mother and the fetus during prenatal development. Among the available biological fluids, AF represents an ideal substrate to provide dynamic information regarding fetal organogenesis and metabolism through pregnancy, since it originates from both maternal and fetal tissues and contains substances derived from placenta, fetal skin, lungs, gastric fluid, and fetal urine. Areas covered: In this paper, we provide an update reporting the most recent results on AF metabolomics in the assessment of feto-maternal health, regarding physiological pregnancies but even fields such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, fetal malformations, chromosomopathies, maternal diseases, placental inflammation or infections, maternal diet or exposure to exogenous substances, according to the literature found on MEDLINE since 2015. Expert opinion: Metabolomics shows a promising role in describing both physiology and disease; the goal would be the identification of biomarkers able to precociously and efficaciously detect pathological conditions, allowing the identification of complicated pregnancy and improving their management.

Novel agents for treatment of lymphoma in the setting of pregnancy are discussed. Therapeutic dilemmas and areas of uncertainty are illuminated. Expert opinion: HL and NHL are potentially curable diseases in the pregnant patient with generally good outcomes for the mother and the offspring, when tailoring the treatment according to the individual patient. The complexity of the situation merits shared decision-making with the patient and her family, explicitly outlining the risks and benefits. The pregnant patient is best managed by a multidisciplinary team, familiar with the intricacies of the gestational period, and providing the necessary support and sensitivity.

Innate immune activation driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors is the primary mechanism underlying disease pathogenesis in AOSD patients. Few biomarkers have been identified for AOSD diagnosis or for the assessment of disease activity or prediction of clinical outcomes. Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) can activate innate immunity, resulting in tissue damage. Changes in several DAMPs are associated with disease pathogenesis in AOSD patients. Areas covered: This review describes the role of DAMPs in AOSD pathogenesis and discusses their potential for use as disease biomarkers. Together with overall pathogenesis of AOSD, high-mobility group box-1, advanced glycation end products, S100 proteins, and neutrophil extracellular traps are introduced and discussed in detail. Expert opinion: The activation of macrophages and neutrophils is associated with several DAMPs, causing high concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in AOSD patients. Involvement of certain DAMPs in AOSD patients is well documented due to the presence of sterile inflammation; however, direct evidence for some DAMPs is lacking. Further research into the role of DAMP molecules in AOSD patients may reveal new biomarkers and provide targets for disease intervention."

More than 600 bacterial species can be isolated. Most of them are harmless, moreover, some species prove themselves to be specifically useful. However, in the case of a weakened immune status or inappropriate oral hygiene, they may cause many types of soft and hard tissue disorders. Caries and periodontal diseases are the most common bacterial diseases of the oral cavity. In both cases, the dental biofilm gives rise to the disorder, which is caused by the insufficient oral hygiene. Dental caries are mainly caused by cariogenic streptococci and lactobacilli. In the case of serious periodontal diseases, anaerob parodonto-pathogen microorganisms play the major role. Untreated caries may result in the necrosis of the pulp, which can cause an inflammation expanding towards the parodontium. This can be characterized as a focal infection, like the untreated periodontal pockets. Dental foci may have lots of systemic consequences such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, pneumonia, arthritis, preterm birth and alopecia areata. When these diseases occur, dental foci should always be considered.

Primary vascular (venous) tumors are uncommon. The authors review the case of a 67-year-old woman, who was admitted to the hospital in a poor general condition with jaundice. Laboratory findings indicated hepatic and renal insufficiency. Abdominal ultrasound detected a large retroperitoneal mass which was suspected to be of uterine origin. Abdominal CT showed a retroperitoneal mass that invaded the inferior vena cava, but there was no sign of primary intraabdominal or pelvic tumor. Due to the poor general condition of the patient, surgery was not performed. The patient died in some days after admission. Autopsy revealed a primary leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava. Based on the literature data, primary leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is extremely rare. Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava can cause various symptoms, depending on the involved segment of the vein. Surgical intervention can be performed in early stages of the disease.

Similar to any other drugs, PPIs have possible adverse reactions, being associated with bone fractures, infections, kidney disease, mineral deficiency, dementia, and pneumonia. Multiple analyses have stated that PPIs therapy may affect bone regeneration and osseointegration process, causing an increased risk of bone fracture, deterioration of bone metabolism and impaired bone healing. In this review, we emphasized the current literature regarding the influence of proton pump inhibitors in the bone regeneration process. Results from the studies suggest a link between PPIs intake and bone regeneration, but several concerns are raised regarding inadequate recipient bone, surgical trauma, limitations on the titanium surface, comorbidities or interference with other pharmacological agents.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was decreased dose-dependently by both acute and chronic hypoxia (p < .05). Acute exposure to 3, and 10% O2 stimulated the expression of lipid storage gene, while chronic exposure to 3% O2 inhibited the expression of genes involved in lipid storage and mobilisation (p < .05). Acute hypoxia dose-dependently stimulated basal lipolysis. Conversely, chronic hypoxia did not affect basal lipolysis but significantly decreased isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis (p < .05). In conclusion, the effects of hypoxia on human adipocyte lipid storage and mobilisation functions are complex but could favour ectopic fat deposition.",Strong Relationship Between Vascular Function in the Coronary and Brachial Arteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055952,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",2019 06 12,"Early detection of coronary artery dysfunction is of paramount cardiovascular clinical importance, but a noninvasive assessment is lacking. Indeed, the brachial artery flow-mediated dilation test only weakly correlated with acetylcholine-induced coronary artery function ( r=0.36). However, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation methodologies have, over time, substantially improved. This study sought to determine if updates to this technique have improved the relationship with coronary artery function and the noninvasive indication of coronary artery dysfunction. Coronary artery and brachial artery function were assessed in 28 patients referred for cardiac catheterization (61±11 years). Coronary artery function was determined by the change in artery diameter with a 1.82 μg/min intracoronary acetylcholine infusion. Based on the change in vessel diameter, patients were characterized as having dysfunctional coronary arteries (>5% vasoconstriction) or relatively functional coronary arteries (<5% vasoconstriction). Brachial artery function was determined by flow-mediated dilation, adhering to current guidelines. The acetylcholine-induced change in vessel diameter was smaller in patients with dysfunctional compared with relatively functional coronary arteries (-11.8±4.6% versus 5.8±9.8%, P<0.001). Consistent with this, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was attenuated in patients with dysfunctional compared with relatively functional coronaries (2.9±1.9% versus 6.2±4.2%, P=0.007). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation was strongly correlated with the acetylcholine-induced change in coronary artery diameter ( r=0.77, P<0.0001) and was a strong indicator of coronary artery dysfunction (receiver operator characteristic=78%). The current data support that updates to the brachial artery flow-mediated dilation technique have strengthened the relationship with coronary artery function, which may now provide a clinically meaningful indication of coronary artery dysfunction.",The Placental Growth Factor Pathway and Its Potential Role in Macular Degenerative Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055948,Current eye research,2019 05 24,"There is growing evidence that placental growth factor (PlGF) is an important player in multiple pathologies, including tumorigenesis, inflammatory disorders and degenerative retinopathies. PlGF is a member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and in the retina, binding of this growth factor to specific receptors is associated with pathological angiogenesis, vascular leakage, neurodegeneration and inflammation. Although they share some receptor signalling pathways, many of the actions of PlGF are distinct from VEGF and this has revealed the enticing prospect that it could be a useful therapeutic target for treating early and late stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Recent research suggests that modulation of PlGF could also be important in the geographic atrophy (GA) form of late AMD by protecting the outer retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This review discusses PlGF and its signalling pathways and highlights the potential of blocking the bioactivity of this growth factor to treat irreversible visual loss due to the two main forms of AMD.",Patient Perception and Satisfaction With Insulin Pump System: Pilot User Experience Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055947,Journal of diabetes science and technology,2019 05 06,"Adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus using the Medtronic™ 670G pump were surveyed about their experience with the device. Responses were quantified to identify themes. Twenty-one participants completed the survey. Seventeen participants used the pump as part of a hybrid closed loop system, while the remainder used the pump in combination with a nonintegrated continuous glucose monitoring system. Overall, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the pump (14/21) mostly because of improvements in BG control (15/21). Least liked features were physical design and structure (6/21), frequency of user input (5/21), alert frequency (4/21), and difficulty of use (3/21). Those using the hybrid closed loop were satisfied with the auto mode feature (11/17), mostly because of improvements in BG control (9/17). The least liked features of the auto mode technology were that blood glucose levels remained elevated (5/17) and the frequency of alerts (4/17). Several aspects of the insulin pump that are of potential clinical or commercial relevance were reported. Further research is needed to discover more about participant usage patterns and satisfaction with the pump.",Methanol-Extract/Fractions of Dacryodes edulis Leaves Ameliorate Hyperglycemia and Associated Oxidative Stress in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Wistar Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055945,Journal of evidence-based integrative medicine,2019 05 19,"The present study evaluated the antidiabetic and antioxidant potential of the methanolic extract/solvent fractions of the leaves of Dacryodes edulis using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic Albino Wistar rat model. The fasting blood glucose/insulin levels and inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase were determined. Antioxidant activity was assessed in vitro by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl, superoxide scavenging, reducing power, and total antioxidant capacity assays and in vivo by monitoring catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities and reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The aqueous-methanol fraction exhibited the highest and significant ( P < .05) reduction in fasting blood glucose (FBG; 54.03%) with a concomitant inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities. The ethyl acetate fraction also exhibited a significant ( P < .05) reduction in FBG and an increase in insulin levels in the treated diabetic Wistar rats. A significantly ( P < .05) higher reducing power and radical scavenging activity was observed in the aqueous-methanol and ethyl acetate fractions. The aqueous-methanol and ethyl acetate fractions also significantly ( P < .05) reversed the alterations in oxidative stress markers (GSH, MDA, CAT, and SOD) observed in the diabetic control group. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the methanol extract of Dacryodes edulis ameliorates hyperglycemia and the associated oxidative stress in STZ-induced diabetic Wistar rats. These observed activities are largely due to the compounds that partitions into the aqueous-methanol (55:45) solvent fraction. This provides scientific evidence for the use of this plant extract in folk medicine and also a baseline data for its further characterization. Further work should be carried out to characterize the aqueous-methanol solvent fractions for the active compounds.","The ""problem"" of health: An analysis of health care provision in Canada's federal prisons.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055943,"Health (London, England : 1997)",2019 05 06,"The United Nations states that prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community. Despite this, persons in prison experience barriers to care and face unique health challenges. Given the ways in which prisons shape health outcomes for incarcerated persons, it is important to interrogate how the provision of health care is governed in custodial settings. In this article, we examine one important aspect of governance: legislation governing the provision of health care in prisons. We view this issue through a critical lens, building on a body of poststructural scholarship which has illuminated how laws and policies are not merely tools of governance but also key sites for the production of meanings around social ""problems,"" including the ""problem of health."" Taking Canada's Corrections and Conditional Release Act as a case example and applying Carol Bacchi's ""What's the Problem Represented to Be"" analytical framework, we examine how the specific representation of ""health"" in this legislation works to produce effects for persons in federal prison. Three key themes are formed through this analysis. First, what constitutes ""essential services"" in the context of federal prisons is more limited compared with the broader community. Second, the dichotomy between the rights of persons in prison versus the protection of society that is produced in development of these laws has significant bearing on the treatment of those in prison. Third, this representation has negative effects on the health of persons in prison. In order to meet United Nations standards, greater attention must be paid to the ways in which laws and other governing practices reproduce inequities in health care provision in prisons."

We refine a plasmonic enhancement system by focusing on a carrier blocking layer (between a plasmonic metal and a photoactive layer), which is commonly used to prevent a major quenching channel in a plasmonic enhancement system. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity is enhanced by 33 times from the introduction of a carrier-selective blocking layer (CSBL) in Ag-CdS nanoparticles. The Ag2S layer, a typical example of a CSBL, synergistically improves the plasmonic enhancement effect of Ag on the photocatalytic HER activity of CdS by both the selective blocking of photoexcited electrons and the effective transfer of holes, which extends the lifetime of the active species (electrons in the conduction band) in the semiconductor photocatalyst (CdS) to accelerate the photocatalytic HER. We propose a new strategy for a further improvement of plasmonic enhancement systems.",A Highly Sensitive SPE Derivatization-UHPLC-MS Approach for Quantitative Profiling of Carotenoid-Derived Dialdehydes from Vegetables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055928,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 23,"Oxidative cleavage of carotenoids leads to dialdehydes (diapocarotenoids, DIALs) in addition to the widely known apocarotenoids. DIALs are biologically active compounds that presumably impact human health and play different roles in plant development and carotenoid metabolism. However, detection of DIALs in plants is challenging due to their instability, low abundance, and poor ionization efficiency in mass spectrometry. Here, we developed a solid-phase extraction and derivatization protocol coupled with ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for quantitative profiling of DIALs. Our method significantly enhances the sensitivity of DIAL detection with a detection limit of 0.05 pg/mg of dried food materials, allowing unambiguous profiling of 30 endogenous DIALs with C5 to C24 from vegetables. Our work provides a new and efficient approach for determining the content of DIALs from various complex matrices, paving the way for uncovering the functions of DIALs in human health and plant growth and development.",Proteomic Profiles of the Early Mitochondrial Changes in APP/PS1 and ApoE4 Transgenic Mice Models of Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055927,Journal of proteome research,2019 06 10,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases. Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) carriers account for 40% of all AD cases, emphasizing the importance of ApoE4 in the pathogenesis of AD. In the present study, we explored the changes of hippocampal proteins expression profile at the early stage (3 month-old) of APP/PS1 and ApoE4 knockin mice with the aim to find potential key pathways involved in AD progression. Proteomic analysis showed a lot of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 247 (137 increased and 110 decreased) and 1125 (642 increased and 484 decreased) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 and ApoE4 mice, respectively, compared with the wild-type (WT) mice, using a cutoff of 1.2-fold change. Functional classification of DEPs revealed that these proteins mainly comprise proteins involved in acetylation, methylation, endocytosis/exocytosis, chaperone, oxidoreductase, mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and synaptic proteins in APP/PS1 mice compared with the WT mice. Likewise in ApoE4 mice compared with the WT mice, the DEPs are mostly involved in the functions of synapses, ribosomes, mitochondria, spliceosomes, endocytosis/exocytosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and proteasomes. STRING analysis suggested that some DEPs were involved in insulin signaling and mitochondrial electron transport chain in the two mouse models. The abnormal changes of insulin signaling and mitochondrial electron transport chain were further verified by Western blot. Taken together, our study exposed the changes of hippocampal protein expression profiles at the early stage of APP/PS1 and ApoE4 knockin mice, and the change of insulin signaling and mitochondrial electron transport chain may be the key molecular processes involved in AD progression.",Alloying and Embedding of Cu-Core/Ag-Shell Nanowires for Ultrastable Stretchable and Transparent Electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055926,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 29,"In this paper, transparent electrodes with dense Cu@Ag alloy nanowires embedded in the stretchable substrates are successfully fabricated by a high-intensity pulsed light (HIPL) technique within one step. The intense light energy not only induces rapid mutual dissolution between the Cu core and the Ag shell to form dense Cu@Ag alloy nanowires but also embeds the newly formed alloy nanowires into the stretchable substrates. The combination of alloy nanowires and embedded structures greatly improve the thermal stability of the transparent electrodes that maintain a high conductivity unchanged in both high temperature (140 °C) and high humidity (85 °C, 85% RH) for at least 500 h, which is much better than previous reports. The transparent electrodes also exhibit high electromechanical stability due to the strong adhesion between alloy nanowires and substrates, which remain stable after 1000 stretching-relaxation cycles at 30% strain. Stretchable and transparent heaters based on the alloyed and embedded electrodes have a wide outputting temperature range (up to 130 °C) and show excellent thermal stability and stretchability (up to 60% strain) due to the alloy nanowires and embedded structures. To sum up, this study proposes the combination of alloying and embedding structures to greatly improve the stability of Cu nanowire-based stretchable transparent electrodes, showing a huge application prospect in the field of stretchable and wearable electronics.",Electric-Alignment Immobilization of Liquid Crystalline Colloidal Nanosheets with the Aid of a Natural Organic Polymer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055925,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 28,"Inorganic nanosheets obtained by exfoliation of a layered crystal in water form colloidal liquid crystals, and their alignment can be controlled by an electric field. In order to realize the immobilization of the electrically aligned niobate nanosheets without external forces, an aqueous gelator, agar, is introduced to the niobate nanosheet system to utilize the thermosensitive sol-gel transition property of agar. Alignment of nanosheets in a niobate-agar system is performed by applying an electric field above the sol-gel transition temperature, and then, the sample is cooled down, followed by cooling below the transition temperature with the electric field turned off. The aligned structure is kept for more than 24 h after the removal of the electric field. The concentration of agar is a key parameter for both the orientation of nanosheets and the retention of the orientation.",Al-Doped Ga-Based Liquid Metal: Modification Strategy and Controllable High-Temperature Lubricity through Frictional Interface Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055924,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 28,"Ga-based liquid metal (GLM) may be a potential heat-transfer material in many industries such as electronic devices and nuclear reactors, and thus, improving its lubricity is conducive to solving the friction and corrosion problems of the motion pairs served in the GLM medium. This paper proposes a modification strategy based on the conventional and large-scale mechanical milling to prepare Al-doped GLM successfully and regulates the GLM lubricity through controlling the frictional interface properties. It is found that at room temperature (∼20 °C), the Al element in the Al-doped GLM medium has a stronger adsorption capacity on the T91 surface, so the Al-rich film is formed on the frictional interfaces and reduces the wear of the T91 disk effectively compared to that in the GLM medium. However, the doping of Al is detrimental to the wear resistance of the T91 steel significantly at 400 °C by inhibiting the formation of the protective FeGa3 film on the frictional interfaces, which readily appears at T91 frictional interfaces in the GLM medium. At 600 °C, Al atoms participate in the formation of a multilayer intermetallic film, thus improving the wear resistance again. This paper provides a new idea for preparing the metal-doped GLM and improving the lubricity of GLM, and it drives forward our understanding of the lubrication mechanisms of liquid lubricants.",Deciphering the Roles of N-Glycans on Collagen-Platelet Interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055923,Journal of proteome research,2019 06 15,"Collagen is a potent agonist for platelet activation, presenting itself as a key contributor to coagulation via interactions with platelet glycoproteins. The fine details dictating platelet-collagen interactions are poorly understood. In particular, glycosylation could be a key determinant in the platelet-collagen interaction. Here, we report an affinity purification coupled to a mass spectrometry-based approach to elucidate the function of N-glycans in dictating platelet-collagen interactions. By integrative proteomic and glycoproteomic analysis of collagen-platelet interactive proteins with N-glycan manipulation, we demonstrate that the interaction of platelet adhesive receptors with collagen is highly N-glycan regulated, with glycans on many receptors playing positive roles in collagen binding, with glycans on other platelet glycoproteins exhibiting inhibitory roles on the binding to collagen. Our results significantly enhance our understanding of the details of glycans influencing the platelet-collagen interaction.",Fast Capture of Fluoride by Anion-Exchange Zirconium-Graphene Hybrid Adsorbent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055922,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 05 28,"Fluoride contamination is a severe problem affecting the safety of drinking water around the world. High-rate adsorbent materials are particularly desirable for potable water defluoridation. Current research on fluoride adsorbent materials is primarily focused on metal-based adsorbents with high capacities. However, they generally suffer from slow adsorption kinetics due to the adsorption mechanism of a sluggish exchange between coordinated hydroxyl groups and fluoride ions. Designing metal-based adsorbents to mimic the rapid ion-exchange behavior of anion-exchange resins is a promising approach to integrate fast adsorption and high capacity for fluoride removal. Herein, a ZrO(OH)1.33Cl0.66-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid adsorbent containing exchangeable chloride ions was synthesized with the assistance of cation-π interactions. Unlike most adsorbents requiring a high surface area, this composite has a negligible surface area (1.45 m2 g-1), but can deliver a fast fluoride capture performance (reaching equilibrium in 5 min) with high adsorption rate constants of 1.05 min-1 and 0.171 mg g-1 min-1, around 10 times faster than the best result reported in the literature. Besides, ZrO(OH)1.33Cl0.66-rGO can also demonstrate a high fluoride uptake (44.14 mg g-1) and high removal efficiency (94.4%) in 35 mg L-1 fluoride solution, both among the highest performances for fluoride adsorption.",Fucoidan A2 from the Brown Seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum Lowers Lipid by Improving Reverse Cholesterol Transport in C57BL/6J Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055921,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 23,"Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is a physiological process, in which excess peripheral cholesterol is transported to the liver and further excreted into the bile and then feces. Recently, fucoidans are reported to have a lipid-lowering effect. This study was designed to investigate whether fucoidan from the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum lowers lipid by modulating RCT in C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet. Our results indicated that fucoidan intervention significantly reduced plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, and fat pad index and markedly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. In the liver, fucoidan significantly increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α, PPARγ, liver X receptor (LXR)β, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette (ABC)A1, ABCG8, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), scavenger receptor B type 1 (SR-B1), and cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase A1 (CYP7A1) and decreased the triglyceride level and expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and PPARβ but had no effect on LXRα, ABCG1, and ABCG5. In the small intestine, the fucoidan treatment significantly reduced the expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) and improved ABCG5 and ABCG8. These results demonstrated that fucoidan can improve lipid transfer from plasma to the liver by activating SR-B1 and LDLR and inactivating PCSK9 and upregulate lipid metabolism by activating PPARα, LXRβ, ABC transporters, and CYP7A1. In the small intestine, this fucoidan can decrease cholesterol absorption and increase cholesterol excretion by activating NPC1L1 and ABCG5 and ABCG8, respectively. In conclusion, fucoidan from A. nodosum may lower lipids by modulating RCT-related protein expression and can be explored as a potential compound for prevention or treatment of hyperlipidemia-related diseases.",Composite Lipid Bilayers from Cell Membrane Extracts and Artificial Mixes as a Cell Culture Platform.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055920,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 12,"An artificial lipid bilayer is the closest possible model for the cell membrane.

In the current work, a method to produce an integrated solid-supported lipid bilayer combining natural extracts from cell membranes and artificially made lipid vesicles is proposed. This simple method allows delivery of transmembrane proteins and components of the extracellular matrix into the substrate. Biocompatibility of the composite natural/artificial lipid bilayers is evaluated by their interactions with the cardiomyocyte-like HL-1 cell line. Compared with fully artificial mixes, composite lipid bilayers allow cells to adhere and develop a morphologically more normal cytoskeleton."

In this work, an elaborate composite, cobalt sulfide nanoclusters embedded in honeycomb-like sulfur-doped carbon foam (Co9S8@S-CF), is prepared via a facile sulfur-assisting calcination strategy, which tactfully induces the co-occurrence of in situ pore-forming, sulfidation, sulfur doping, and carbonization. Notably, sulfur-doped carbon foam (S-CF) possesses abundant voids, which are subject to construction of three-dimensional ionic/electronic pathways, leading to high sodium-ion accessibility and ultrafast sodium-ion/electron transportation toward Co9S8 nanoclusters.

Outer retinal structural changes occurring secondary to VMT due to incomplete posterior vitreous detachment were described retrospectively with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 3 eyes of 3 patients. The patients ranged in age from 58 to 65 years and best corrected visual acuity in the 3 eyes was 4/10, 8/10, and 9/10. All of the patients were symptomatic and exhibited outer retinal microholes at the fovea extending from the retinal pigment epithelium to outer limiting membrane, with an overlying operculum on the detached posterior hyaloid membrane over the macula following spontaneous resolution of VMT. In the mean follow-up period of 32 months, the outer retinal microholes decreased in size but did not completely resolve.

Furthermore, the ability of A. gossypii to grow using low-cost substrates together with the inexpensive downstream processing makes this fungus an attractive biotechnological chassis. Indeed, the production in A. gossypii of other high-added value compounds such as folic acid, nucleosides and biolipids has been described. Hence, the development of new methods to expand the molecular toolkit for A. gossypii genomic manipulation constitutes an important issue for the biotechnology of this fungus. In this work, we present a one-vector CRISPR/Cas9 system for genomic engineering of A. gossypii. We demonstrate the efficiency of the system as a marker-less approach for nucleotide deletions and substitutions both with visible and invisible phenotypes. Particularly, the system has been validated for three types of genomic editions: gene inactivation, the genomic erasure of loxP scars and the introduction of point mutations. We anticipate that the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for A. gossypii will largely contribute to facilitate the genomic manipulations of this industrial fungus in a marker-less manner.",Divergent long-term trends and interannual variation in ecosystem resource use efficiencies of a southern boreal old black spruce forest 1999-2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055880,Global change biology,2019 05 28,"Long-term trends in ecosystem resource use efficiencies (RUEs) and their controlling factors are key pieces of information for understanding how an ecosystem responds to climate change. We used continuous eddy covariance and microclimate data over the period 1999-2017 from a 120-year-old black spruce stand in central Saskatchewan, Canada, to assess interannual variability, long-term trends, and key controlling factors of gross ecosystem production (GEP) and the RUEs of carbon (CUE = net primary production [NPP]/GEP), light (LUE = GEP/absorbed photosynthetic radiation [APAR]), and water (WUE = GEP/evapotranspiration [E]). At this site, annual GEP has shown an increasing trend over the 19 years (p < 0.01), which may be attributed to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. Interannual variability in GEP, aside from its increasing trend, was most strongly related to spring temperatures. Associated with the significant increase in annual GEP were relatively small changes in NPP, APAR, and E, so that annual CUE showed a decreasing trend and annual LUE and WUE showed increasing trends over the 19 years. The long-term trends in the RUEs were related to the increasing CO2 concentration. Further analysis of detrended RUEs showed that their interannual variation was impacted most strongly by air temperature. Two-factor linear models combining CO2 concentration and air temperature performed well (R2 ~0.60) in simulating annual RUEs. LUE and WUE were positively correlated both annually and seasonally, while LUE and CUE were mostly negatively correlated. Our results showed divergent long-term trends among CUE, LUE, and WUE and highlighted the need to account for the combined effects of climatic controls and the 'CO2 fertilization effect' on long-term variations in RUEs. Since most RUE-based models rely primarily on one resource limitation, the observed patterns of relative change among the three RUEs may have important implications for RUE-based modeling of C fluxes.",Docetaxel-based chemotherapy combined with dexamethasone 1 mg daily oral administration for castration-resistant prostate cancer: Long-term outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055879,International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,2019 05 05,To report long-term outcome survival analysis of docetaxel-based chemotherapy combined with dexamethasone in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients (Japan-Multinational Trial Organization Pca10-01 trial).,Characterization and validation of an intra-fraction motion management system for masked-based radiosurgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055877,Journal of applied clinical medical physics,2019 06 10,"Characterize the intra-fraction motion management (IFMM) system found on the Gamma Knife Icon (GKI), including spatial accuracy, latency, temporal performance, and overall effect on delivered dose.",Association between interleukin-10 gene polymorphisms and severe chronic periodontitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055876,Oral diseases,2019 05 28,Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease that is a result of the interaction between pathogenic bacteria and host immune response.

Terminal sialic acid residues, expressed on both the N- and O-linked glycans of VWF, regulate VWF functional activity, susceptibility to proteolysis and plasma clearance in vivo. Quantitative and qualitative variations in VWF sialylation have been reported in patients with von Willebrand Disease, as well as in a number of other physiological and pathological states. Further studies are warranted to define the molecular mechanisms through which N- and O-linked sialylation impacts upon the multiple biological activities of VWF. von Willebrand factor (VWF) undergoes complex post-translational modification prior to its secretion into the plasma. Consequently, VWF monomers contain complex N-glycan and O-glycan structures that, together, account for approximately 20% of the final monomeric mass. An increasing body of evidence has confirmed that these carbohydrate determinants play critical roles in regulating multiple aspects of VWF biology. In particular, studies have demonstrated that terminal ABO blood group has an important effect on plasma VWF levels. This effect is interesting, given that only 15% of the N-glycans and 1% of the O-glycans of VWF actually express terminal ABO(H) determinants. In contrast, the vast majority of the N-glycans and O-glycans on human VWF are capped by terminal negatively charged sialic acid residues. Recent data suggest that sialylation significantly regulates VWF functional activity, susceptibility to proteolysis, and clearance, through a number of independent pathways. These findings are of direct clinical relevence, in that quantitative and qualitative variations in VWF sialylation have been described in patients with VWD, as well as in patients with a number of other physiologic and pathologic conditions. Moreover, platelet-derived VWF is significantly hyposialylated as compared with plasma-derived VWF, whereas the recently licensed recombinant VWF therapeutic is hypersialylated. In this review, we examine the evidence supporting the hypothesis that VWF sialylation plays multiple biological roles. In addition, we consider data suggesting that quantitative and qualitative variations in VWF sialylation may play specific roles in the pathogenesis of VWD, and that sialic acid expression on VWF may also differ across a number of other physiologic and pathologic conditions.","Nickel dermatitis from earrings 15 years after EU directive implementation: a clinical-epidemiological study and a market survey in Rome, Italy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055872,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2019 05 05,Nickel (Ni) dermatitis remains a highly prevalent allergic condition in Italy.

Thrombolysis with alteplase is effective when administered to patients with potentially disabling stroke, who are not at high risk of bleeding, within 4.5 hours of the time the patient was last known to be well. Emerging evidence suggests that other thrombolytics such as tenecteplase may be even more effective. Treatment may be possible beyond 4.5 hours in patients selected using brain imaging. Endovascular thrombectomy (via angiography) effectively reduces risk of death or dependency in patients with large vessel occlusion (internal carotid, proximal middle cerebral and basilar arteries) if applied within 6 hours of the time they were last known to be well. Endovascular thrombectomy is also beneficial 6-24 hours from the last known well time in selected patients with favourable brain imaging. Thus, some patients with wake-up stroke are now treatable, and protocols for stroke need to include computed tomography (CT) perfusion scan and CT angiography as routine, in addition to the non-contrast CT brain scan. Optimised pre-hospital and emergency department systems (eg, code stroke response teams, pre-notification by ambulance, direct transport from triage to CT scanner) are essential to maximise the benefit of these strongly time-dependent therapies. Telemedicine is increasingly providing specialist guidance for these more complex treatment decisions in rural areas.

However, the effects of vitexin on interleukins-1β (IL-1β)-stimulated OA patient-derived chondrocytes have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of vitexin on IL-1β-stimulated human osteoarthritis chondrocytes and to reveal the involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) pathway. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting assays were employed. ELISA results demonstrated that the proinflammatory cytokine levels of interleukins-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the serum and synovial fluid and HIF-1α level in the synovial fluid were significantly elevated in OA patients compared to normal healthy subjects. Moreover, the Western blotting results indicated that the protein expression of HIF-1α was significantly higher in the cartilage tissues of OA patients. OA patient-derived chondrocytes were stimulated by IL-1β and treated with different concentration of vitexin for 24 hours. Vitexin showed no cytotoxicity and increased the survival of chondrocytes under IL-1β stimulation. Vitexin suppressed IL-1β-induced production of NO and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) in chondrocytes culture. The treatment of vitexin significantly inhibited IL-1β-induced expressions of proinflammatory cytokine levels of IL-6, TNF-α, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3 and MMP-13. Furthermore, Western blotting results demonstrated that HIF-1α is involved in vitexin's protective effects on IL-1β-stimulated injuries in OA patient-derived chondrocytes. Our study demonstrates that vitexin alleviates IL-1β-induced inflammatory responses in chondrocytes from osteoarthritis patients, which may be attributed partly to the inhibition of HIF-1α pathway.",Characterization of EBT3 radiochromic films for dosimetry of proton beams in the presence of magnetic fields.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055847,Medical physics,2019 06 01,"Radiochromic film dosimetry is extensively used for quality assurance in photon and proton beam therapy.

The chrysophyte genus Mallomonas (Stramenopiles) forms species-specific silica scales with extraordinary diversity of their ornamentation. In this paper, we molecularly characterized three additional species to provide an updated phylogeny of 43 species, and combined this with evaluations of 24 morphological traits. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we evaluated phylogenetic signal in traits, reconstructed the trait evolution, and compared the overall phylogenetic and morphological diversity. The majority of traits showed strong phylogenetic signal and mostly dynamic evolution. Phylogenetic relatedness was often reflected by the phenotypic similarity. Both V-rib and dome are very conservative structures that are presumably involved in precise scale overlap and bristle attachment, respectively. Based on modern species, it seems the dome firstly appeared on apical and/or caudal scales, and only later emerged on body scales. Bristle was presumably present in the common ancestor and gradually elongated ever since. However, most other morphological traits readily changed during the evolution of Mallomonas.

Contrary to common assumptions, CLL significantly affects the life expectancy of older individuals, frequently presenting at a more advanced stage and with more unfavorable features than in the younger population. Therefore, identifying the optimal treatment for these patients is a priority. Older patients with CLL are usually classified as fit, non-fit, or frail based on performance status and comorbidities, and several assessment tools can be used to make these evaluations. While supportive care is appropriate for frail patients, the remaining patients should be treated when indication criteria are met. Treatment options include chemoimmunotherapy, monoclonal antibody-based approaches (such as the use of rituximab, ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) and, more recently, small molecules (such as ibrutinib, idelalisib, and venetoclax).

However, the prevalence of atopic keratoconjunctivitis is scarcely investigated, and the data are often uncertain because other allergic nasal or respiratory disorders occur concomitantly. Mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of atopic keratoconjunctivitis. Despite its denomination as atopic, negative responses to skin tests or in-vitro immunoglobulin E tests are common. In fact, atopic keratoconjunctivitis can be attributed to a combination of T-helper-1 and T-helper-2 responses, but a higher prominence for T-helper-1 cells was found. The most common symptoms of atopic keratoconjunctivitis are bilateral ocular itching, burning, and tearing with a perennial presentation, although some patients may have seasonal exacerbations in winter or summer. Other symptoms such as photophobia, blurred vision, and mucous chewy discharge, owing to the accumulation of cells and mucin, may occur. The diagnosis of atopic keratoconjunctivitis is mainly clinical, as accepted diagnostic criteria or laboratory tests are not available. The treatment of atopic keratoconjunctivitis is aimed at controlling symptoms, decreasing relapse and exacerbations, and reducing vision loss. Therapeutic options comprise topical ophthalmic drops, including cromones, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors. Topical ointments are also available for corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Severe forms may require systemic medications including antihistamines, corticosteroids, and calcineurin inhibitors. Atopic keratoconjunctivitis therapy in the elderly does not differ from the adult population, but the occurrence of multi-morbidities and concomitant drug treatment, which are common in this age group, requires a careful evaluation to determine appropriate and personalized treatment.",Long non-coding RNAs and cell death following ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055786,Metabolic brain disease,2019 05 05,"Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and extensive efforts have focused on the improvement of therapeutic strategies to reduce cell death following ischemic stroke. Uncovering the cellular and molecular pathophysiological processes in ischemic stroke have been a top priority. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are endogenous molecules that play key roles in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia, and involved in the neuronal cell death during ischemic stroke. In recent years, a bulk of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs have been screened out in ischemic stroke insulted animals. LncRNAs along with their targets could affect the genetic machinery at molecular levels, and exploring their functions and mechanisms may be a promising option for ischemic stroke treatment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge for lncRNAs in ischemic stroke, focusing on the role of specific lncRNAs that may underlie cell death to find possible therapeutic targets.",Neuroprotective effect of diclofenac on chlorpromazine induced catalepsy in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055785,Metabolic brain disease,2019 05 05,"Neuroinflammation plays a key role in progressive degeneration of dopaminergic cells. Upregulation of prostaglandins and free radicals formation are involved in the mechanisms of cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of diclofenac against chlorpromazine (CPZ) induced catalepsy and motor impairment in mice. Adult Wistar rats treated with CPZ (3 mg/kg/day, IP) were orally dosed with diclofenac and L-dopa/carbidopa for 21 days. Catalepsy was measured after 21 days of dosing by using standard bar test at 30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min then motor performances were assessed via open field test and wire hanging test. Histopathological investigation and determination of dopamine (DA) and 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels of rat's brain was also carried out. We found that CPZ treated group exhibited reduced motor impairment after 21 days of treatment in open field and wire hanging test (P < 0.01) as compared to control group. The cataleptic scores of CPZ treated rats were also significantly increased (P < 0.01) after 21 days of chronic dosing, however diclofenac treated groups showed significant reduction in cataleptic scores with improved motor performances. Histopathology of CPZ treated rats showed marked degeneration with architecture distortion in the mid brain region. Dopaminergic degeneration is confirmed by neurochemical results that showed reduced amount of dopamine and DOPAC levels in mid brain. Moreover, histopathological slides of diclofenac treated rats showed improved architecture with reduced gliosis of mid brain region as well as improved dopamine and DOPAC levels were achieved after 21 days dosing of diclofenac. Taken together, the present work provide an evidence that diclofenac ameliorated behavioral performances by mediating neuroprotection against CPZ induced PD via preventing dopaminergic neuronal cell death.",Expression of benzoyl-CoA metabolism genes in the lignocellulolytic host Caldicellulosiruptor bescii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055784,AMB Express,2019 05 22,"Genes responsible for the anaerobic catabolism of benzoate in the thermophilic archaeon Ferroglobus placidus were expressed in the thermophilic lignocellulose-degrading bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii, as a first step to engineering this bacterium to degrade this lignin metabolite. The benzoyl-CoA ligase gene was expressed individually, and in combination with benzoyl-CoA reductase and a putative benzoate transporter. This effort also assessed heterologous expression from a synthetically designed operon whereby each coding sequence was proceeded by a unique C. bescii ribosome binding site sequence. The F. placidicus benzoyl-CoA ligase gene was expressed in C. bescii to produce a full-length protein with catalytic activity. A synthetic 6-gene operon encoding three enzymes involved in benzoate degradation was also successfully expressed in C. bescii as determined by RNA analysis, though the protein products of only four of the genes were detected. The discord between the mRNA and protein measurements, especially considering the two genes lacking apparent protein abundance, suggests variable effectiveness of the ribosome binding site sequences utilized in this synthetic operon. The engineered strains did not degrade benzoate. Although the heterologously expressed gene encoding benzoyl-CoA ligase yielded a protein that was catalytically active in vitro, expression in C. bescii of six benzoate catabolism-related genes combined in a synthetic operon yielded mixed results. More effective expression and in vivo activity might be brought about by validating and using different ribosome binding sites and different promoters.

While the majority of existing studies focus on characterizing intelligence in neurotypical (NT) brains, investigating how neural correlates of intelligence scores are altered by atypical neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), is almost absent. To help fill this gap, we use a connectome-based predictive model (CPM) to predict intelligence scores from functional connectome data, derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). The utilized model learns how to select the most significant positive and negative brain connections, independently, to predict the target intelligence scores in NT and ASD populations, respectively. In the first step, using leave-one-out cross-validation we train a linear regressor robust to outliers to identify functional brain connections that best predict the target intelligence score (p - value < 0.01). Next, for each training subject, positive (respectively negative) connections are summed to produce single-subject positive (respectively negative) summary values. These are then paired with the target training scores to train two linear regressors: (a) a positive model which maps each positive summary value to the subject score, and (b) a negative model which maps each negative summary value to the target score. In the testing stage, by selecting the same connections for the left-out testing subject, we compute their positive and negative summary values, which are then fed to the trained negative and positive models for predicting the target score. This framework was applied to NT and ASD populations independently to identify significant functional connections coding for full-scale and verbal intelligence quotients in the brain.",Single-molecule in vitro reconstitution assay for kinesin-1-driven membrane dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055762,Biophysical reviews,2019 06 11,"Intracellular membrane dynamics, especially the nano-tube formation, plays important roles in vesicle transportation and organelle biogenesis. Regarding the regulation mechanisms, it is well known that during the nano-tube formation, motor proteins act as the driven force moving along the cytoskeleton, lipid composition and its associated proteins serve as the linkers and key mediators, and the vesicle sizes play as one of the important regulators. In this review, we summarized the in vitro reconstitution assay method, which has been applied to reconstitute the nano-tube dynamics during autophagic lysosomal regeneration (ALR) and the morphology dynamics during mitochondria network formation (MNF) in a mimic and pure in vitro system. Combined with the single-molecule microscopy, the advantage of the in vitro reconstitution system is to study the key questions at a single-molecule or single-vesicle level with precisely tuned parameters and conditions, such as the motor mutation, ion concentration, lipid component, ATP/GTP concentration, and even in vitro protein knockout, which cannot easily be achieved by in vivo or intracellular studies.","""Force-From-Lipids"" mechanosensation in Corynebacterium glutamicum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055761,Biophysical reviews,2019 06 11,"Since the mechanosensitive channel MscCG has been identified as the major glutamate efflux system in Corynebacterium glutamicum, studies of mechanotransduction processes in this bacterium have helped to unpuzzle a long-unresolved mystery of glutamate efflux that has been utilised for industrial monosodium glutamate production. The patch clamp recording from C. glutamicum giant spheroplasts revealed the existence of three types of mechanosensitive (MS) channels in the cell membrane of this bacterium. The experiments demonstrated that the MS channels could be activated by membrane tension, indicating that the channel gating by mechanical force followed the ""Force-From-Lipids (FFL)"" principle characteristic of ion channels inherently sensitive to transbilayer pressure profile changes in the mechanically stressed membrane bilayer. Mechanical properties of the C. glutamicum membrane are characteristics of very soft membranes, which in the C. glutamicum membrane are due to negatively charged lipids as its exclusive constituents. Given that membrane lipids are significantly altered during the fermentation process in the monosodium glutamate production, MS channels seem to respond to changes in force transmission through the membrane bilayer due to membrane lipid dynamics. In this review, we describe the recent results describing corynebacterial FFL-dependent mechanosensation originating from the particular lipid composition of the C. glutamicum membrane and unique structure of MscCG-type channels.",A look back at the molten globule state of proteins: thermodynamic aspects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055760,Biophysical reviews,2019 06 11,"Interest in protein folding intermediates lies in their significance to protein folding pathways. The molten globule (MG) state is one such intermediate lying on the kinetic (and sometimes thermodynamic) pathway between native and unfolded states. Development of our qualitative and quantitative understanding of the MG state can provide deeper insight into the folding pathways and hence potentially facilitate solution of the protein folding problem. An extensive look at literature suggests that most studies into protein MG states have been largely qualitative. Attempts to obtain quantitative insights into MG states have involved application of high-sensitivity calorimetry (differential scanning calorimetry and isothermal titration calorimetry). This review addresses the progress made in this direction by discussing the knowledge gained to date, along with the future promise of calorimetry, in providing quantitative information on the structural features of MG states. Particular attention is paid to the question of whether such states share common structural features or not. The difference in the nature of the transition from the MG state to the unfolded state, in terms of cooperativity, has also been addressed and discussed.","""A Résumé for the Baby"": Biosocial Precarity and Care of Substance-Using, Pregnant Women in San Francisco.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055757,"Culture, medicine and psychiatry",2019 05 05,"In the United States, the historical condemnation and punitive legal consequences of substance use during pregnancy-ranging from incarceration to termination of parental custody of a newborn-render pregnant women in state of biosocial precarity.

Based on longitudinal interviews with pregnant women who were actively using illicit substances and attempting to parent after delivery, we posit that the relationship between biosocial precarity and biomedical care is a procedural interaction that is rooted in the potential to parent, described as the ability to have a ""take-home baby."" In order to achieve this goal, the need for engagement in biomedical care and the creation of a biomedical narrative, described as a ""résumé for the baby"" is required.

While designating more land as PAs is important, concerns about the degree to which existing PAs are effective in meeting conservation goals are growing. Unfortunately, conservation effectiveness of PAs and its underlying determinants are often unclear across large spatial scales. Using PAs in China as an example, we evaluated the effectiveness of 472 PAs established before 2000 in reducing deforestation between 2000 and 2015. Our results show that the majority (71%) of the PAs were effective in reducing deforestation. Without their establishment, deforestation within the PAs would have increased by about 50% (581 km2), with about 1271 megaton of carbon per year not being sequestered. We also found some attributes of PAs, including surrounding deforestation level, roughness of terrain, and travel time to the nearest city, are significantly related to their effectiveness in reducing deforestation. Our findings highlight the need of systematically evaluating the effectiveness of PAs and incorporating this effectiveness into conservation planning and management to more fully realize the goals of PAs not only in China but also around the world.",An ultra-spatially resolved method to quali-quantitative monitor particulate matter in urban environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055755,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"Monitoring the amount and composition of airborne particulate matter (PM) in the urban environment is a crucial aspect to guarantee citizen health. To focus the action of stakeholders in limiting air pollution, fast and highly spatially resolved methods for monitoring PM are required. Recently, the trees' capability in capturing PM inspired the development of several methods intended to use trees as biomonitors; this results in the potential of having an ultra-spatially resolved network of low-cost PM monitoring stations throughout cities, without the needing of on-site stations. Within this context, we propose a fast and reliable method to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the PM present in urban air based on the analysis of tree leaves by scanning electron microscopy combined with X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). We have tested our method in the Real Bosco di Capodimonte urban park (Naples, Italy), by collecting leaves from Quercus ilex trees along transects parallel to the main wind directions. The coarse (PM10-2.5) and fine (PM2.5) amounts obtained per unit leaf area have been validated by weighting the PM washed from leaves belonging to the same sample sets. PM size distribution and elemental composition match appropriately with the known pollution sources in the sample sites (i.e., traffic and marine aerosol). The proposed methodology will then allow the use of the urban forest as an ultra-spatially resolved PM monitoring network, also supporting the work of urban green planners and stakeholders.",Assessment of chemical and microbiological parameters on the Leite River Lithuania.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055754,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 15,"The most common source of pollution is wastewater that comes from the industrial, agricultural, and household sectors. The aim of this work is to evaluate the impact of a new innovative wastewater treatment technology on the water quality of the Leite River, Lithuania. The Leite River basin receives wastewater from the Leitgiriai agglomeration; it is then released into a channel, which is 73 m away from the river. During the implementation of the BSR Interreg project ""Water emissions and their reduction in village communities in the Baltic Sea Region as pilots (VillageWater),"" the ineffective Leitgiriai wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was reconstructed in September and October of 2017. Water samples from Leite River were collected in 2010-2018 in three locations: near the Kulynai, Leitgiriai, and Sausgalviai villages in Lithuania. The results show that the wastewater treatment efficiency is statistically higher than that before the reconstruction of the WWTP. The treated wastewater (before and after reconstruction) is released from the Leitgiriai WWTP into the surface water (channel), which flows into the Leite River. The highest concentrations (according to all examined indicators) have been observed in the channel and in the Leite River 500 m after the release point before the reconstruction. All differences are statistically significant (p < 0.05). According to the 2018 values, the water quality of the Leite River did comply with the good ecological status/potential class indicators near the Leitgiriai village. After the Leitgiriai WWTP reconstruction, the wastewater treatment efficiency increased two times on average. Therefore, the Leite River water quality near Leitgiriai improved.","Prophylactic administration of carnosine and melatonin abates the incidence of apoptosis, inflammation, and DNA damage induced by titanium dioxide nanoparticles in rat livers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055753,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 05,"Although titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TDO-ns) are extensively used in the food, medicine, and cosmetic industries, discussions about the possible hazards of nanomaterials are just beginning to emerge.

Scientific evidences have shown that asbestos (including chrysotile) exposure is associated with increased rates of lung cancer, asbestosis, and mesothelioma. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity effects of chrysotile are not clear. This study evaluated the oxidative stress in chronic lung toxicity caused by the intratracheal instillation (IT) of four kinds China representative chrysotile once a month for 12 months in Wistar rats. These results indicated that chrysotile exposure led to an obvious increase in lung mass and slowed the growth of body mass. Inflammation and fibrosis were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Exposure to chrysotile significantly increased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the level of lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant capacity in lung tissues. Furthermore, 1-6-month chrysotile exposure activated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression, whereas 12-month exposure caused significant decreases of two-factor expression levels in XK and MN groups when compared to negative control group. Therefore, our results suggested that chronic chrysotile pulmonary injury in Wistar rats is triggered by oxidative damage. Meanwhile, the oxidative damage of MN and XK was stronger than that of SSX and AKS, and the difference of oxidative damage in four chrysotile could have been brought by its properties, morphology, chemical composition, and particle size. With all the above mentioned in view, we hope that the revealed data in the experiment could contribute to the progress of further researches on the toxicity and mechanism of chrysotile.",Secured Lumen-Apposing Fully Covered Metallic Stents for Stenoses in Post-Bariatric Surgery Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055739,Obesity surgery,2019 05 05,"New approaches for refractory stenosis in post-bariatric surgical patients include fully covered lumen-apposing metallic stents (LAMS); however, stent migration continues to be a problem. Endoscopic suture placement to LAMS can reduce the migration. Aiming to assess the feasibility and safety of the procedure, we evaluated nine consecutive patients with inability to tolerate a solid diet due to a benign gastrointestinal stricture recalcitrant to previous attempts at endoscopic therapy. All patients were symptom-free starting from 1-week follow-up. Median stent dwell time was nearly 3 months. During the removal procedures, three incidental foreign bodies were found and removed. No stent migration was observed in any patients. Suturing LAMS is a feasible technique allowing for prolonged stent dwell times; however, it requires a high level of expertise plus additional procedure time.",Diffusion Tensor Imaging: Tool for Tracking Injured Spinal Cord Fibres in Rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055738,Neurochemical research,2019 05 05,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe disorder of the CNS leading to tissue damage and disability. Because it is critical to understand the pathological processes, it is important to find efficient ways to diagnose the severity of injured spinal cord tracts in situ from beginning up to a certain level of recovery following therapeutic interventions. In the current study, we set-up the criteria for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in order to capture changes of nerve fibre tracts in rat spinal cord compression injury. We tested four DTI parameters, such as fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity at the lesion site, in time course of 7 weeks. Afterwards, we compared DTI data with histological results and locomotor outcomes to examine their consistency and capability of reflecting the lesion development in time. Our data confirm that DTI is a valuable in vivo imaging tool capable to distinguish damaged white matter tracts after mild SCI in rat. Fractional anisotropy showed decreased values for injury site, while the mean diffusivity had higher values, with increased both axial and radial diffusivity in comparison to control subjects. Thus, the combination of DTI parameters can reflect the severity of lesion in time and may correlate with histological evaluation of spared tissue, but not with locomotor recovery following mild injury associated with spontaneous recovery.","Increased genetic diversity of BVDV strains circulating in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey: first detection of BVDV-3 in Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055737,Tropical animal health and production,2019 05 05,"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a pathogen associated with loss of meat, milk, and reproductive performance in cattle across the world. There have been two types of BVDV identified worldwide: BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. However, a new type of BVDV, named HoBi-like pestivirus (BVDV-3), has been identified recently. BVDV presence in Turkey has been reported since the 1990s, but a mandatory vaccination program has not been implemented in Turkey so far. In serological studies conducted in Turkey for BVDV, reported seropositivity has been 50% on average. The aim of this study is to determine the genetic diversity of BVDV in blood and abortion materials from bovine in eastern Turkey. The presence of the virus was determined by antigen ELISA test. As a result of the phylogenetic analysis of 5'UTR, Npro and E2 genomic regions of the BVDV (n = 28), BVDV-1 (n = 25) was identified as the dominant type. In addition, BVDV-2 (n = 2) and BVDV-3 (n = 1) were determined which is the first report of HoBi-like pestivirus in Turkey. Although BVDV-1l (n = 19) was detected as the predominant sub-type of BVDV-1, 1a (n = 2), 1b (n = 1), 1c (n = 1), and 1d (n = 2) were also identified. In 2 samples, the BVDV-2 type detected was the 2a sub-type. In this study, it is emphasized that BVDV can be present in the abort materials as an agent and that it should be examined in the herd screening. In addition, it is understood that molecular epidemiological studies should continue for determining the genetic diversity of the viruses and that such studies should be carried out on the country basis. Necessary diagnostic programs should be developed for animals, which are imported or buying from other barns, and protection and control measures should be taken. The increase of reports on BVDV heterogeneity in Turkey and worldwide gets up related to the occurrence and spread of new BVDV types or variants, with potential implications for animal health and disease control.",Female Age Affects the Mesenchymal Stem Cell Characteristics of Aspirated Follicular Cells in the In Vitro Fertilization Programme.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055736,Stem cell reviews,2019 05 05,"Aspirated follicular cells (AFCs) from the in vitro fertilization program can express various stem cell markers and are even able to differentiate into different types of cells in vitro. The female reproductive potential decreases with increasing age due to lowered ovarian reserve and oocyte quality, but data on the effect of female age on stem cell characteristics of AFCs are scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate whether female age affects the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) characteristics of AFCs. Follicular aspirates were collected from 12 patients included in the in vitro fertilization programme with a normal ovarian reserve. Patients were divided into four age groups: Group A ≤ 30 years, Group B 31-35 years, Group C 36-39 years and Group D ≥ 40 years. After removal of the oocytes, AFCs were collected from follicular aspirates using hypo-osmotic technique and cultured in vitro, and their stemness was compared according to female age. The cultured AFCs were analysed for gene expression using the Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell RT2 Profiler™ PCR Array, for their potential for differentiation into adipogenic and osteogenic lineage, and for their expression of MSC-related markers using immunocytochemistry. We found that female age can significantly influence their stemness: expression of pluripotency and MSC-related genes, and their differentiation potential. Despite the relatively high expression of MSC-related genes, the AFCs of the oldest patients had the lowest potential to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro, which may be related to their age and the changed ovarian function.",Chronic Kidney Disease Increases Cerebral Microbleeds in Mouse and Man.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055735,Translational stroke research,2019 05 26,"Brain microbleeds are increased in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their presence increases risk of cognitive decline and stroke. We examined the interaction between CKD and brain microhemorrhages (the neuropathological substrate of microbleeds) in mouse and cell culture models and studied progression of microbleed burden on serial brain imaging from humans. Mouse studies: Two CKD models were investigated: adenine-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis and surgical 5/6 nephrectomy. Cell culture studies: bEnd.3 mouse brain endothelial cells were grown to confluence, and monolayer integrity was measured after exposure to 5-15% human uremic serum or increasing concentrations of urea. Human studies: Progression of brain microbleeds was evaluated on serial MRI from control, pre-dialysis CKD, and dialysis patients. Microhemorrhages were increased 2-2.5-fold in mice with CKD independent of higher blood pressure in the 5/6 nephrectomy model. IgG staining was increased in CKD animals, consistent with increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Incubation of bEnd.3 cells with uremic serum or elevated urea produced a dose-dependent drop in trans-endothelial electrical resistance. Elevated urea induced actin cytoskeleton derangements and decreased claudin-5 expression. In human subjects, prevalence of microbleeds was 50% in both CKD cohorts compared with 10% in age-matched controls. More patients in the dialysis cohort had increased microbleeds on follow-up MRI after 1.5 years. CKD disrupts the blood-brain barrier and increases brain microhemorrhages in mice and microbleeds in humans. Elevated urea alters the actin cytoskeleton and tight junction proteins in cultured endothelial cells, suggesting that these mechanisms explain (at least in part) the microhemorrhages and microbleeds observed in the animal and human studies.",Vitamin D3 from Ultraviolet-B Exposure or Oral Intake in Relation to Cancer Incidence and Mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055734,Current nutrition reports,2019 05 05,This review summarizes the understanding of vitamin D3's role in reducing risk of cancer incidence and mortality.,Genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with and without hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055733,GeroScience,2019 06 01,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors. Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy. In this study, we investigated the differences in the genetic architecture of AD between hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects in four independent cohorts. Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms (P < 5E-06) that were located outside the chromosome 19q13 region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups. The closest genes to 14 polymorphisms were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Also, four of them were located within two chromosomal regions (i.e., 3q13.11 and 17q21.2) that were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 before. In addition, 30 genes demonstrated evidence of group-specific associations with AD at the false discovery rates (FDR) < 0.05 in our gene-based and transcriptome-wide association analyses. The chromosomal regions corresponding to four genes (i.e., 2p13.1, 9p13.3, 17q12, and 18q21.1) were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous GWAS. These genes may serve as a list of prioritized candidates for future functional studies. Our pathway-enrichment analyses revealed the associations of 11 non-group-specific and four group-specific pathways with AD at FDR < 0.05. These findings provided novel insights into the potential genetic heterogeneity of AD among subjects with and without hypertension.",Pathogenic Role of Type I Interferons in HIV-Induced Immune Impairments in Humanized Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055732,Current HIV/AIDS reports,2019 06 16,Recent findings on the critical pathogenic role of type 1 interferons (IFN-I) in HIV-1 persistence in humanized mice suggest that inhibiting IFN-I signaling transiently will reverse HIV-induced inflammatory diseases and rescue anti-HIV immunity to control HIV-1 reservoirs.,"Hypertension, seizures, and epilepsy: a review on pathophysiology and management.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055731,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 05 05,"Epilepsy and hypertension are common chronic conditions, both showing high prevalence in older age groups.

Cells of strain CC-YTH430T were found to be Gram-stain negative, facultative anaerobic rods that formed yellow-colored colonies on nutrient agar. Cell growth occurred at 15-40 °C, pH 5.0-9.0 and in the presence of 0-2% NaCl. Strain CC-YTH430T resembled Mesorhizobium species while sharing high pair-wise 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with Mesorhizobium silamurunense, Mesorhizobium thiogangeticum, Mesorhizobium plurifarium, Mesorhizobium tamadayense, Mesorhizobium amorphae (96.9% each), Mesorhizobium sediminum (96.8%), and Mesorhizobium soli (96.5%) and < 96.5% similarity to other species. Strain CC-YTH430T showed 78.8-79.7% average nucleotide identity compared to the type strains of M. amorphae, M. plurifarium, M. soli, M. tamadayense and M. wenxiniae. The N2-fixing activity of strain CC-YTH430T was 0.2 nmol ethylene h-1 at 30 °C. The respiratory system was ubiquinone 10 (Q-10) and the DNA G+C content was 62.0 ± 0.2 mol%.

However, there are few studies focused on the virulence potential of C. striatum. A growing body of research supports the use of Caenorhabditis elegans as a model host for investigating the virulence potential of pathogenic bacteria, including corynebacteria. In the present study, chemotaxis behaviour, mortality, and morphological changes were investigated in nematodes infected by four C. striatum strains isolated from different clinical sites, and with different MDR profiles and PFGE types. The results showed chemotaxis of nematodes towards C. striatum. Nematode death (> 60%) was detected from the first day post-infection with all strains tested, but at different levels, independent of biofilm formation on catheter surfaces and differences in growth temperature between nematodes (20 °C) and mammals (37 °C). C. striatum 2369/II multidrug-resistant (MDR; from tracheal aspirate of a patient undergoing endotracheal intubation) and 1961/III multidrug-sensitive (MDS; urine) strains led to 100% mortality in worms. Survival of nematodes was observed until 4 days post-infection with the C. striatum 1954/IV MDS strain isolated from a surgical wound (13%) and 1987/I MDR strain isolated from a patient with a lower respiratory tract infection (39%). The Dar phenotype was observed post-infection with all MDS and MDR strains except 1954/IV. All strains showed the capacity for bagging formation. Star formation was observed only with strains that led to 100% nematode mortality. In conclusion, C. striatum was found to exert virulence for C. elegans. Variations in nematode morphological changes and levels of mortality indicate differences in the virulence potential of C. striatum independent of clinical isolation site, capacity for biofilm formation, and MDR and PFGE profiles.","Intracranial Aneurysms: Pathology, Genetics, and Molecular Mechanisms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055715,Neuromolecular medicine,2019 05 05,"Intracranial aneurysms (IA) are local dilatations in cerebral arteries that predominantly affect the circle of Willis. Occurring in approximately 2-5% of adults, these weakened areas are susceptible to rupture, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a type of hemorrhagic stroke. Due to its early age of onset and poor prognosis, SAH accounts for > 25% of years lost for all stroke victims under the age of 65. In this review, we describe the cerebrovascular pathology associated with intracranial aneurysms. To understand IA genetics, we summarize syndromes with elevated incidence, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), whole exome studies on IA-affected families, and recent research that established definitive roles for Thsd1 (Thrombospondin Type 1 Domain Containing Protein 1) and Sox17 (SRY-box 17) in IA using genetically engineered mouse models. Lastly, we discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms of IA, including defects in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells caused by dysfunction in mechanotransduction, Thsd1/FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) signaling, and the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β) pathway. As illustrated by THSD1 research, cell adhesion may play a significant role in IA.",Power spectra prognostic aspects of impulsive eye movement traces in superior vestibular neuritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055714,Medical & biological engineering & computing,2019 05 05,"Since usefulness of power spectra (PS) analysis was demonstrated in many fields of electrophysiology, the aims of the present study were to evaluate differences in frequency domain values of eye velocity traces between a group of 60 healthy subjects (HC) and 35 matched superior vestibular neuritis (VN) patients and to determine prognostic aspects of such values in terms of superior VN recovery. PS calculated on video head impulse test traces was compared between HC and during the acute stage of vertigo (T1) and after 3 months (T2) in superior VN patients. A multiple regression and desirability model between Δ (T2gain - T1gain) vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain and five prognostic factors were employed.

To hydrolyze the okara and enable nutrient release, a strategy to valorize okara using solid-state fermentation with food grade Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) WX-17 was carried out. The study showed that fermentation of okara with B. subtilis WX-17 improved its overall nutritional content. The total amino acids content increased from 3.04 ± 0.14 mg/g in unfermented okara to 5.41 ± 1.21 mg/g in okara fermented with B. subtilis WX-17. Total fatty acids content increased from 153.04 ± 5.10 to 166.78 ± 2.41 mg/g okara, after fermentation. Antioxidant content (DPPH) also increased by 6.4 times after fermentation. To gain insight into the mechanism, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was carried out. In total, 49 metabolites were detected, which could be classified mainly into carbohydrates, TCA cycle metabolites, amino acids and fatty acids. The decrease in carbohydrate metabolites, showed that glycolysis was upregulated. This would have provided the energy and metabolic flux towards the amino acid and fatty acid pathway. This is also in line with the increased amino acids and fatty acid production seen in okara fermented with B. subtilis WX-17. The findings of this work demonstrated the potential of using B. subtilis WX-17 fermentation, to enhance the nutritional profile of okara.

One of the fundamental points for developing management strategies for this aphid is the understanding of its population growth since this allows predictions about future population peaks and which are the most appropriate hosts for its survival and reproduction. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the biological and population growth parameters of C. fragaefolii in four strawberry cultivars (Albion, Aromas, Camarosa, and San Andreas). The highest survival of the nymph stage was observed in 'San Andreas' (87%) and the lowest in 'Camarosa' (43%). 'Albion' had the highest net reproductive rate (R0 = 6.39) and the mean time for the population to double in number (TD = 5.61), thus presenting the best reproductive parameters for C. fragaefolii. 'Camarosa' and 'Aromas' had the lowest R0 values (2.65 and 2.70, respectively) and the highest TD values (10.89 and 10.34, respectively). We conclude that antibiosis mechanisms are involved in the resistance process of 'Camarosa' to C. fragaefolii. The characterization and the use of resistant cultivars can be an essential strategy to assist aphid management.",Risk factors for local recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055710,Japanese journal of radiology,2019 05 05,To identify the risk factors for local recurrence in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE).,Coffee consumption and all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a meta-analysis by potential modifiers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055709,European journal of epidemiology,2019 05 05,"Coffee consumption has been associated with decreased mortality in previous studies. As aging, obesity, and lifestyle factors affect the risk of mortality, the association between coffee and mortality needs to be examined in various subpopulations by characteristics of subjects. To quantitatively assess this association, we conducted an updated meta-analysis including stratified analyses by potential modifiers. We searched in the PubMed and Web of Science databases through March 8, 2019, and conducted meta-analysis including linear and non-linear dose-response analyses. We identified 40 studies including 3,852,651 subjects and 450,256 all-cause and cause-specific deaths. Non-linear inverse associations between coffee consumption and mortality from all-causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancers were found. The lowest relative risk (RR) was at intakes of 3.5 cups/day for all-cause mortality (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.89), 2.5 cups/day for CVD mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.87), and 2 cups/day for cancer mortality (RR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99), while additional intakes were not associated with further lower mortality. An inverse association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality was maintained irrespective of age, overweight status, alcohol drinking, smoking status, and caffeine content of coffee. By region, Europe and Asia showed stronger inverse associations than US. A non-linear inverse association was found for mortality from respiratory disease and diabetes, while linear inverse association was found for mortality from non-CVD, non-cancer causes.

To study interactions of GAGs with proteins, immobilization of GAGs is often required. Current methodologies for immobilization involve modification of GAGs and/or surfaces, which can be time-consuming and may involve specialized equipment. Here, we use an efficient and low-cost method to immobilize GAGs without any (chemical) modification using highly concentrated salt solutions. A number of salts from the Hofmeister series were probed for their capacity to immobilize heparin and chondroitin-6-sulfate on microtiter plates applying single chain antibodies against GAGs for detection (ELISA). From all salts tested, the cosmotropic salt ammonium sulfate was most efficient, especially at high concentrations (80-100% (v/v) saturation). Immobilized GAGs were bioavailable as judged by their binding of FGF2 and VEGF, and by their susceptibility towards GAG lyases (heparinase I, II and III, chondroitinase ABC). Using 80% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate, block and continuous gradients of heparin were established and a gradient of FGF2 was created using a heparin block gradient as a template. In conclusion, high concentrations of ammonium sulfate are effective for immobilization of GAGs and for the establishment of gradients of both GAGs and GAG-binding molecules, which enables the study to the biological roles of GAGs.",Clinical background and outcomes of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055694,International journal of clinical oncology,2019 05 05,This study aimed to identify the clinical background and treatment outcomes of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in Japan for women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC).,The levels of SYT13 and CEA mRNAs in peritoneal lavages predict the peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055693,Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,2019 05 05,"Although peritoneal lavage cytology often serves as a sensitive method to detect free cancer cells in the abdominal cavity, some patients experience peritoneal recurrence despite negative cytology.

MRE was performed using a clinical 3T MRI scanner at three frequencies (30, 40 and 60 Hz) on 36 healthy paediatric subjects aged between 7 and 18 years (19 F) and 11 adults aged 23-44 years (6 F). Anatomical and diffusion tensor imaging was also collected. The stiffness quantified as the magnitude of the complex shear modulus (G*), fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and volume of white and grey matter were calculated. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison tests were used to compare data in age groups separated into children (7-12 years), adolescents (13-18 years) and adults (18+ years), and Spearman's correlations were performed for paediatric data. White and grey matter stiffness for each frequency and their frequency dependence was found to be very similar in paediatric and adult subjects (p > 0.05 all variables). No significant correlations were found when comparing G* with age, FA, MD or volume. Adult G*, FA, MD and volume values were within range of others reported in the literature. Paediatric white and grey matter stiffness values are similar to those of adults. We conclude that clinically, adult values can be used as a baseline measure in paediatric brain MRE.",Microfluidic and computational study of structural properties and resistance to flow of blood clots under arterial shear.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055691,Biomechanics and modeling in mechanobiology,2019 05 09,"The ability of a blood clot to modulate blood flow is determined by the clot's resistance, which depends on its structural features. For a flow with arterial shear, we investigated the characteristic patterns relating to clot shape, size, and composition on the one hand, and its viscous resistance, intraclot axial flow velocity, and shear distributions on the other. We used microfluidic technology to measure the kinetics of platelet, thrombin, and fibrin accumulation at a thrombogenic surface coated with collagen and tissue factor (TF), the key clot-formation trigger. We subsequently utilized the obtained data to perform additional calibration and validation of a detailed computational fluid dynamics model of spatial clot growth under flow. We then ran model simulations to gain insights into the resistance of clots formed under our experimental conditions. We found that increased thrombogenic surface length and TF surface density enhanced the bulk thrombin and fibrin generation in a nonadditive, synergistic way. The height of the platelet deposition domain-and, therefore, clot occlusivity-was rather robust to thrombogenic surface length and TF density variations, but consistently increased with time. Clot viscous resistance was non-uniform and tended to be higher in the fibrin-rich, inner ""core"" region of the clot. Interestingly, despite intraclot structure and viscous resistance variations, intraclot flow velocity variations were minor compared to the abrupt decrease in flow velocity around the platelet deposition region. Our results shed new light on the connection between the structure of clots under arterial shear and spatiotemporal variations in their resistance to flow.",Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory and Problem Gambling in a General Population Sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055690,Journal of gambling studies,2019 05 05,"This study examined the impact of revised reinforcement sensitivity theory (r-RST) on two measures of problem gambling. Using 112 general population adult participants, two measures of r-RST, the reinforcement sensitivity theory of personality questionnaire (RST-PQ) and Jackson 5, were used to predict problem gambling operationalised using the South Oaks Gambling Screen and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Hypotheses were that the behavioural approach system (BAS) would positively predict problem gambling and the behavioural inhibition system (BIS) would negatively predict problem gambling. Results found that the BIS negatively predicted problem gambling. The RST-PQ BAS reward reactivity subscale positively predicted problem gambling using the IGT. These findings add to the operational understanding of the r-RST personality model, its relationships to avoidance and approach behaviour in response to reward and punishment, and to understanding the aetiology of problem gambling.",Long-term outcomes of radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in rheumatic heart disease patients with mild mitral stenosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055689,Journal of interventional cardiac electrophysiology : an international journal of arrhythmias and pacing,2019 05 05,To assess efficacy of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) in rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients with mild mitral stenosis (MS).,Unwelcoming: The Church Experiences of HIV-Infected Adolescents and Emerging Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055688,Journal of religion and health,2019 05 05,"Acceptance among family, friends, and within the community is a critical developmental milestone during adolescence.

Avicenna (980-1037) as the most important physician and philosopher in the Islamic world has undoubtedly affected various fields of thought and science in Islamic civilization. The basis and infrastructure of his understanding of medicine derive from his philosophical and religious views. According to Avicenna, the soul and body are two intertwined substances from which all human beings are composed. This reciprocal interaction between soul and body is essential in analyzing his medical concepts related to ""health"" and ""sickness."" Other than soul, he believes in spirit which is originally a religious concept that he interprets. Avicenna distinguishes between soul and spirit (≈ rūḥ) and poses that, as an ethereal volatile substance, the spirit is a mediator between soul and body. He also proposes a hierarchical system of spirit through which he illustrates a special type which is called ""Rūḥ Bukhārī"" (= RB). Faculties of the soul firstly penetrate into this type of spirit and then enter the body's organs. Consequently, health and sickness are interpreted through the terms and conditions of RB.",Making Honey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055686,Journal of religion and health,2019 05 05,"A third-year medical student reflects on the role of creative meditation in the life of the clinician.

The present study reports the cloning and expression of the B. malayi Tn1 (Tn1bm), its immunoprophylactic efficacy against B. malayi infection, and the immunological responses of the host. The Tn1bm gene was cloned (Acc no. JF912447) and expressed, and the purified recombinant Tn1bm (rTn1bm) presented a single ~ 27 kDa band. Parasite load in rTn1bm-immunized BALB/c mice challenged with B. malayi infective larvae (L3) was assessed. In rTn1bm-immunized animals, IgE, IgG, and IgG subclasses in the serum, cell proliferative response, Th1 and Th2 cytokine secretion (from splenocytes), and NO release (from peritoneal macrophages) were determined. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to L3 was assayed using rTn1bm-immune serum. The innate immune response markers MHC class-I, MHC class-II, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 expression in peritoneal macrophages and CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ in the splenocyte population were determined in Tn1bm-exposed cells from naïve mice. rTn1bm-immunized L3-challenged animals showed a 60% reduction in parasite burden. Immunization upregulated cellular proliferation, cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) secretion, NO release, and antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2b antibody levels. rTn1bm-immune serum killed > 65% of L3 in the ADCC assay. Increased MHC class-II, TLR2, and TLR6 expression and the relative CD4+ and CD19+ cell populations of naïve animal cells indicated the ability of rTn1bm to mobilize innate immune responses.

Several T. theileri strains isolated from domestic and wild ruminants via co-culturing with mammalian feeder cells or blood cells have been characterized morphologically and genetically. Here, we cultured a new trypanosome isolate from a Holstein cow in Hokkaido, Japan, and performed morphological and molecular characterization studies. The new isolate (Obihiro strain) was co-cultivated with Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells in GIT medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Trypomastigotes and epimastigotes, but not intracellular parasites, were identified in the culture. Analysis of the V7-V8 region of 18S rRNA sequences showed that the Obihiro strain is positioned within the subgenus Megatrypanum. A dendrogram based on whole internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequence showed that the Obihiro strain clustered in the lineage TthII together with the Japanese isolates of T. theileri, Esashi 9, and Esashi 12, and isolates from Zambia and the USA. T. theileri of the KM strain and a T. theileri-like trypanosome isolated from deer (TSD1 strain) clustered in the lineage TthI, separate from the Obihiro strain. Based on a partial cathepsin L-like protein gene analysis, the Obihiro strain clustered with isolates of the TthIIF genotype, which includes T. theileri from Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Brazil. Our analyses of the T. theileri Obihiro strain provide relevant insights into its genetic diversity in Japanese cattle and corroborate the host specificity of cattle and deer trypanosomes of the subgenus Megatrypanum.",Optimization of treating phenol from wastewater through the TiO2-catalyzed advanced oxidation process and response surface methodology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055670,Environmental monitoring and assessment,2019 05 10,"The use of dispersed catalysts in aqueous medium inside reactors in advanced oxidative processes is common among researchers. However, due to the difficult separation of these species after treatment, in many cases, the treatment process is unfeasible. In this context, the main target of the work was the evaluation of degradation of the phenolic solution by ozonation titanium dioxide (TiO2/P25), supported on zeolite spheres. The process was investigated through the response surface methodology (RSM) and optimized by the generalized reduced gradient (GRG) algorithm. The effects of various operating parameters including pH, power ozone (O3) generation, flow rate, and treatment time were investigated, using as a response to removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD). It was made in optimum conditions the ratio of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)/chemical oxygen demand to check the increasing biodegradability, aiming ozonation as preliminary treatment, with the possibility of subsequent biological treatments. There was an increase in this ratio from 0.17 to 0.50 in 48 min, which would facilitate the use of the subsequent biological process.

Based on the hypothesis that the amount of carbon stored can vary according to the vegetation typology and vegetation compartments, the aerial stock of dry biomass and carbon were estimated in different compartments (arboreal, herbaceous-shrub and litter). The study was developed in open Brazilian savannah and soils on the sandstone and discussed the effect of fire on this phytophysiognomy. For the arboreal compartment were adjusted mathematical models to fit the biomass equations to estimate the individual stock of the trees in this compartment.

In this paper, two typical types of urban green land (lawn and shrub) in Shanghai were selected to study the runoff characteristics under eight rainfall events. The sensitivity of the runoff parameters was analyzed, and then, the optimal parameters were determined using the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM). The results showed that the interception and infiltration capacities of shrub were greater than those of lawn. The rainfall intensity and rainfall pattern were the major factors that influenced the interception and infiltration of rainwater. The threshold value that generates runoff varied across the eight rainfall events ranged from 1.6 to 28.5 mm for lawn and 4.5 to 32.0 mm for shrub. The maximum reduction ratios of runoff and peak flow for shrub were 52 and 57% higher than them for lawn, respectively. The parameters for shrub were more sensitive to runoff and peak flow compared with those for lawn. Under light rainfalls with a short duration, the maximum infiltration rate and depression storage were more sensitive than those under heavy rainfalls with a long duration. Antecedent dry weather period was not found to be a sensitive parameter except for the shrub under light rainfalls. The relative errors of runoff and dynamic mean runoff (60 min) for lawn and shrub were within ± 9.5%. The errors of peak flow ranged between - 21 and 16.6%.

In this work, Ti-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Ni-, Cu-, and Ag-doped graphene were proposed and their adsorption capabilities for AsH3 and CO were investigated by DFT method. The optimized structures, adsorption energies, electron transfers, electron density difference, and density of states were thoroughly discussed. It was found that pristine graphene had a slight interaction with AsH3 or CO, while doping Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ag could greatly facilitate the AsH3 or CO adsorption with the adsorption energies of - 0.95 to - 1.45 eV (AsH3) and - 1.00 to 2.02 eV (CO). The partial density of states (PDOS) results showed that hybridizations between AsH3 orbitals, CO orbitals, and transition metals orbitals indicate that there were chemical interactions between them. The charge transfer and density of states (DOS) plots showed that AsH3 and CO have the same adsorption modes on transition metals-doped graphene. Among seven transition metals-doped graphene, Ni-doped graphene had the best selectivity for AsH3 but not for CO due to its larger adsorption energy discrepancy between AsH3 and CO than that of other transition metals-doped graphene, suggesting that Ni-doped graphene is a good candidate adsorbent for AsH3 removal in CO gas stream. Graphical abstract Seven transition metal (Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ag)-doped graphenes were investigated for AsH3 and CO adsorption by DFT method.

Therefore, we developed a paradigm for the assessment of approach-avoidance tendencies towards palatable food, which is based on arm and hand movements on a touchscreen, thereby mimicking real-life grasping or warding movements. In Study 1 (n = 85), an approach bias towards chocolate-containing foods was found when participants reached towards the stimuli, but not when these stimuli had to be moved on the touchscreen. This approach bias towards food observed in grab movements was replicated in Study 2 (n = 60) and Study 3 (n = 94). Adding task features to disambiguate distance change through either corresponding image zooming (Study 2) or emphasized self-reference (Study 3) did not moderate this effect. Associations between approach bias scores and trait and state chocolate craving were inconsistent across studies. Future studies need to examine whether touchscreen-based approach-avoidance tasks reveal biases towards other stimuli in the appetitive or aversive valence domain and relate to relevant interindividual difference variables.",Peripheral levels of the anti-aging hormone Klotho in patients with depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055648,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2019 06 10,"Klotho is a humoral factor with pleiotropic effects.

We measured the sKlotho serum levels in those patients before and after treatment and compared the baseline levels with those of age-matched healthy controls (n = 39). No group differences were found between the baseline sKlotho levels of patients and controls (573.5 pg/ml vs. 563.8 pg/ml; p = 0.80) and between pre- and post-treatment in the patients with depression (563.8 pg/ml vs. 561.8 pg/ml; p = 0.15), when treated either with electroconvulsive therapy or antidepressant. The major limitation of our study might be that peripheral material such as serum might not reliably reflect processes in the central nervous system. In sum, this first study on peripheral sKlotho levels in a clinical sample cannot confirm a global Klotho dysregulation in depression as it has been already suggested by others. Nonetheless, further preclinical and clinical studies on the involvement of Klotho in affective disorders should be carried out.",Symptoms Suggestive of Dysphagia and the Quality of Life in Cocaine and/or Crack Users.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055647,Dysphagia,2019 05 05,"Users of cocaine and/or crack may present symptoms of dysphagia due to changes in anatomical structures caused by the use of these substances. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of symptoms suggestive of dysphagia in users of cocaine and/or crack seeking treatment, as well as to investigate the quality of life of these individuals related to their swallowing condition. A cross-sectional study from September 2015 to December 2016, with 121 users of cocaine and/or crack, was conducted. 59 of them called a telemarketing service and 61 sought treatment at the Centro de Atenção Psicossocial Álcool e Drogas in Porto Alegre (Psychosocial Alcohol and Drug Center). Users were screened and asked to fill the Eating Assessment Tool questionnaire. Users who presented themselves at the center were submitted to the Tool Volume-Viscosity Swallow Test. Users with symptoms of dysphagia responded to the Quality of Life in Swallowing questionnaire. Of all the interviewees, 22.3% (n = 27) reported symptoms suggestive of dysphagia and 2% of the individuals, submitted to swallowing test, presented cough in the liquid consistency. The scores showed a negative impact on quality of life, mainly related to fatigue, sleep, feeding duration, and fear of eating. Significant numbers of users of cocaine and/or crack referred to symptoms suggestive of dysphagia and significant impairments in quality of life, which require specific care in feeding this population in order to assist in their rehabilitation.",Maternal sensitivity predicts anterior hippocampal functional networks in early childhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055646,Brain structure & function,2019 06 13,"Maternal care influences child hippocampal development. The hippocampus is functionally organized along an anterior-posterior axis. Little is known with regards to the extent maternal care shapes offspring anterior and posterior hippocampal (aHPC, pHPC) functional networks. This study examined maternal behavior, especially maternal sensitivity, at 6 months postpartum in relation to aHPC and pHPC functional networks of children at age 4 and 6 years. Maternal sensitivity was assessed at 6 months via the ""Maternal Behavior Q Sort (MBQS) mini for video"". Subsequently, 61 and 76 children underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), respectively, at 4 and 6 years of age. We found that maternal sensitivity assessed at 6 months postpartum was associated with the right aHPC functional networks in children at both 4 and 6 years of age. At age 4 years, maternal sensitivity was associated positively with the right aHPC's functional connectivity with the sensorimotor network and negatively with the aHPC's functional connectivity with the top-down cognitive control network. At 6 years of age, maternal sensitivity was linked positively with the right aHPC's functional connectivity with the visual-processing network. Our findings suggested that maternal sensitivity in infancy has a long-term impact on the anterior hippocampal functional network in preschool children, implicating a potential role of maternal care in shaping child brain development in early life.",Novel insights into PARPs in gene expression: regulation of RNA metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055645,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 05 05,"Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is an important post-translational modification in which an ADP-ribose group is transferred to the target protein by poly(ADP-riboses) polymerases (PARPs). Since the discovery of poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) 50 years ago, its roles in cellular processes have been extensively explored. Although research initially focused on the functions of PAR and PARPs in DNA damage detection and repair, our understanding of the roles of PARPs in various nuclear and cytoplasmic processes, particularly in gene expression, has increased significantly. In this review, we discuss the current advances in understanding the roles of PARylation with a particular emphasis in gene expression through RNA biogenesis and processing. In addition to updating PARP's significance in transcriptional regulation, we specifically focus on how PARPs and PARylation affect gene expression, especially inflammation-related genes, at the post-transcriptional levels by modulating RNA processing and degrading. Increasing evidence suggests that PARP inhibition is a promising treatment for inflammation-related diseases besides conventional chemotherapy for cancer.",Biological functions of mesenchymal stem cells and clinical implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055643,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019 05 05,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are isolated from multiple biological tissues-adult bone marrow and adipose tissues and neonatal tissues such as umbilical cord and placenta. In vitro, MSCs show biological features of extensive proliferation ability and multipotency. Moreover, MSCs have trophic, homing/migration and immunosuppression functions that have been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. A number of clinical trials are using MSCs for therapeutic interventions in severe degenerative and/or inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease and graft-versus-host disease, alone or in combination with other drugs. MSCs are promising for therapeutic applications given the ease in obtaining them, their genetic stability, their poor immunogenicity and their curative properties for tissue repair and immunomodulation. The success of MSC therapy in degenerative and/or inflammatory diseases might depend on the robustness of the biological functions of MSCs, which should be linked to their therapeutic potency. Here, we outline the fundamental and advanced concepts of MSC biological features and underline the biological functions of MSCs in their basic and translational aspects in therapy for degenerative and/or inflammatory diseases.",Polymyositis with mitochondrial pathology or atypical form of sporadic inclusion body myositis: case series and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055642,Rheumatology international,2019 05 05,"Polymyositis with mitochondrial pathology (PM-Mito) is a rare form of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with no definite diagnostic criteria and similarities to both PM and sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). The aim of this study is to address the dilemma of whether PM-Mito is a subtype of inflammatory myopathy or represents a disease falling into the spectrum of s-IBM. Herein, we report four female patients diagnosed with PM-Mito, highlighting their rather atypical clinical and histopathological characteristics that seem to indicate a diagnosis away from s-IBM. Muscle weakness was rather proximal and symmetrical and lacked the selective pattern observed in s-IBM. Patients had large-scale deletions in mtDNA, reflecting the mitochondrial component in the pathology of the disease. Conclusively, our study adds to the limited data in the literature on whether PM-Mito is a distinct form of myositis or represents a prodromal stage of s-IBM. Although the latter seems to be supported by a substantial body of evidence, there are, however, important differences, such as the different patterns of muscle weakness, and the good response to treatment observed in some patients. Larger-scale studies are certainly needed to clarify pathogenesis and clinical characteristics of PM-Mito patients, especially in therapeutic and prognostic terms."

We hypothesise several mechanisms in which gut microbiota may modulate changes in cognitive function with age. In this review, we discuss issues related to the measurement of cognition in the elderly and in particular outline a standardised model of cognition that could be utilised to better understand cognitive outcomes in future studies examining the relationship between gut microbiota and cognition in the elderly. We then review biological processes such as oxidative stress and inflammation which are related to cognitive changes with age and which are also influenced by our gut microbiota.

Ligustroflavone is an ingredient of common privet with activities of anti-inflammation and complement inhibition. This study aims to explore the effect of ligustroflavone on ischemic brain injury in stroke rat and the underlying mechanisms. A rat model of ischemic stroke was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), which showed ischemic injury (increase in neurological deficit score and infarct volume) and upregulation of necroptosis-associated proteins (RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL/p-MLKL). Administration of ligustroflavone (30 mg/kg, i.g.) 15 min before ischemia evidently improved neurological function, reduced infarct volume, and decreased the levels of necroptosis-associated proteins except the RIPK1. Consistently, hypoxia-cultured PC12 cells (O2/N2/CO2, 1:94:5, 8 h) caused cellular injury (LDH release and necroposis) concomitant with up-regulation of necroptosis-associated proteins, and these phenomena were blocked in the presence of ligustroflavone (25 μM) except the elevated RIPK1 levels. Using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) program, we identified RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL as potential targets of ligustroflavone. Further studies showed that the interaction between RIPK3 and RIPK1 or MLKL was significantly enhanced, which was blocked in the presence of ligustroflavone. Based on these observations, we conclude that ligustroflavone protects rat brain from ischemic injury, and its beneficial effect is related to the prevention of necroptosis through a mechanism involving targeting RIPK1, RIPK3, and/or MLKL.",Defunctioning loop ileostomy for rectal anastomoses: predictors of stoma outlet obstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055627,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 06 10,"Creation of defunctioning loop ileostomy is a standard procedure in laparoscopic lower rectal surgery.

Acclimation includes root growth stimulation, stomatal closure, osmotic adjustment, photoprotection, and regulation of nonstructural carbohydrates and amino acid metabolisms. Ilex paraguariensis (yerba mate) is cultivated in the subtropical region of South America, where the occurrence of drought episodes limit yield. To explore the mechanisms that allow I. paraguariensis to overcome dehydration, we investigated (1) how gene expression varied between water-stressed and non-stressed plants and (2) in what way the modulation of gene expression was linked to physiological status and metabolite composition. A total of 4920 differentially expressed transcripts were obtained through RNA-Seq after water deprivation. Drought induced the expression of several transcripts involved in the ABA-signalling pathway. Stomatal closure and leaf osmotic adjustments were promoted to minimize water loss, and these responses were accompanied by a high transcriptional remodeling of stress perception, signalling and transcriptional regulation, the photoprotective and antioxidant systems, and other stress-responsive genes. Simultaneously, significant changes in metabolite contents were detected. Glutamine, phenylalanine, isomaltose, fucose, and malate levels were shown to be positively correlated with dehydration. Principal component analysis showed differences in the metabolic profiles of control and stressed leaves. These results provide a comprehensive overview of how I. paraguariensis responds to dehydration at transcriptional and metabolomic levels and provide further characterization of the molecular mechanisms associated with drought response in perennial subtropical species.",Abscisic acid deficiency caused by phytoene desaturase silencing is associated with dwarfing syndrome in citrus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055623,Plant cell reports,2019 05 05,"In citrus, abscisic acid-deficiency was associated with a dwarfing phenotype, slow growth, small leaves, decreased fresh weight, and faster water loss. ABA supplementation reversed the dwarfing phenotype and enhanced growth. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a ubiquitously distributed phytohormone, which is almost produced by all living kingdoms. In plants, ABA plays pleiotropic physiological roles in growth, development, and stress responses. We explored the hidden relationship between ABA deficiency, and citrus dwarfing. We used targeted-HPLC, targeted-GC-MS, molecular genetics, immunoassays, and gene expression techniques to investigate the effects of the silencing of phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene on the ABA-biosynthetic pathway, endogenous ABA content, and other phytohormones. Silencing of PDS directly suppressed the carotenoids compounds involved in ABA biosynthesis, altered phytohormonal profile, and caused phytoene accumulation and ABA deficiency. The reduction of ABA presumably due to the limited availability of its precursor, zeaxanthin. The ABA-deficient citrus cuttings displayed photobleaching, a dwarf phenotype with impaired growth characteristics that included slow growth, small leaves, decreased fresh weight, and faster water loss. ABA supplementation enhanced the growth and reversed the dwarfing phenotype of the ABA-deficient cuttings. Our data demonstrate that ABA-deficiency may lead to dwarfing phenotype and impaired growth in citrus cuttings. The negative influence of ABA-deficiency on growth rate is the result of altered water relations. Addition of ABA to the CTV-tPDS roots restored shoot growth and reversed the dwarfing phenotype.",Improvement of phytochemical production by plant cells and organ culture and by genetic engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055622,Plant cell reports,2019 05 05,"Plants display an amazing ability to synthesize a vast array of secondary metabolites that are an inexhaustible source of phytochemicals, bioactive molecules some of which impact the human health. Phytochemicals present in medicinal herbs and spices have long been used as natural remedies against illness. Plant tissue culture represents an alternative to whole plants as a source of phytochemicals. This approach spares agricultural land that can be used for producing food and other raw materials, thus favoring standardized phytochemical production regardless of climatic adversities and political events. Over the past 20 years, different strategies have been developed to increase the synthesis and the extraction of phytochemicals from tissue culture often obtaining remarkable results. Moreover, the availability of genomics and metabolomics tools, along with improved recombinant methods related to the ability to overexpress, silence or disrupt one or more genes of the pathway of interest promise to open new exciting possibilities of metabolic engineering. This review provides a general framework of the cellular and molecular tools developed so far to enhance the yield of phytochemicals. Additionally, some emerging topics such as the culture of cambial meristemoid cells, the selection of plant cell following the expression of genes encoding human target proteins, and the bioextraction of phytochemicals from plant material have been addressed.

We also investigate the contribution of visuo-spatial working memory in reaching and in vista space in performing the retracing of the path. For this purpose, we asked 68 healthy college students to learn and come back along an unknown path in a real environment and to perform two different forward and backward working memory tasks, one in the reaching space (Corsi Block-Tapping Test) and the other in a vista space (Walking Corsi Test). The results show that participants performed better when travelling the route forward (which corresponds to the originally learned direction) than when travelling the route backward (return path) and that working memory in vista space is crucial for both wayfinding and homing behaviour, while the working memory for reaching space contributes only to homing behaviour. Although homing behaviour is an early mechanism in navigation shared among many species, it represents a very complex behaviour that requires both topographic and visuo-spatial memory as well as the first two levels of environmental knowledge.",Regulation of osteoblast behaviors via cross-talk between Hippo/YAP and MAPK signaling pathway under fluoride exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055605,"Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)",2019 05 05,"Titanium is widely used in implant materials, while excessive fluoride may have negative effects on the osseointegration between the titanium and osteoblasts. Although the underlying mechanisms are still not clear, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathways are thought to be involved. This study evaluated the role of Hippo/YAP and MAPK signaling pathway in osteoblast behaviors under excessive fluoride exposure in vitro and in vivo. Commercially pure Ti (cp-Ti) samples were exposed to fluoride (0, 0.1, and 1.0 mM NaF) for 7 days. Cell adhesion was observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The expressions of osteoblast markers and key molecules in MAPK and YAP pathway were detected by Western blot. In vivo studies were evaluated by histology methods in C57/BL6 mice model. Our results showed that 1.0 mM NaF destroyed the passivation film on cp-Ti surface, which further inhibited the osteoblast adhesion and spreading. Meanwhile, compared to other groups, 1.0 mM NaF led to a remarkable reduction in cell viability (P < 0.05), as well as increased apoptosis (P < 0.05) and downregulation of osteogenesis protein expression (P < 0.05). MAPK and YAP signaling pathways were also activated under 1.0 mM NaF exposure, and JNK seemed to regulate YAP phosphorylation in response to NaF impacts on osteoblasts. In vivo fluorosis mouse model further indicated that 100 ppm NaF group (high fluoride group) increased bone resorption and inhibited the nuclear translocation of YAP. The osteoblast behaviors were negatively altered under excessive fluoride, and MAPK/JNK axis contributed to YAP signaling activation in regulating NaF-induced osteoblast behaviors. KEY MESSAGES: • Excessive fluoride inhibited osteoblast behaviors and bone formation. • YAP and MAPK signaling pathways were activated in osteoblasts under fluoride exposure. • Fluoride regulated osteoblast behaviors via the cross-talk between YAP and MAPK.",Complementary energy acquisition via aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis and carbon monoxide oxidation by Planktomarina temperata of the Roseobacter group.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055603,FEMS microbiology ecology,2019 05 05,"In marine pelagic ecosystems energy is often the limiting factor for growth of heterotrophic bacteria. Aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis (AAP) and oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) are modes to acquire complementary energy, but their significance in abundant and characteristic pelagic marine bacteria has not been well studied. In long-term batch culture experiments we found that Planktomarina temperata RCA23, representing the largest and most prominent subcluster of the Roseobacter group, maintains 2-3-fold higher cell numbers in the stationary and declining phase when grown in a light-dark cycle relative to dark conditions. Light enables P. temperata to continue to replicate its DNA during the stationary phase relative to a dark control such that when reinoculated into fresh medium growth resumed two days earlier than in control cultures. In cultures grown in the dark and supplemented with CO, cell numbers in the stationary phase remained significantly higher than in an unsupplemented control. Furthermore, repeated spiking with CO until day 372 resulted in significant CO consumption relative to an unsupplemented control. P. temperata represents a prominent marine pelagic bacterium for which AAP and CO consumption, to acquire complementary energy, have been documented.",Extant microbial communities in the partially desiccated Rincon de Parangueo maar crater lake in Mexico.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055602,FEMS microbiology ecology,2019 05 05,"Rincon de Parangueo is a maar where a perennial lake was present until the 1980s. A conspicuous feature of the lake's sediments is the presence of bioherms and organo-sedimentary deposits produced by microbial communities. The gradual lake desiccation during the last 40 years has produced dramatic environmental changes inside the maar basin, which resulted in the formation of a highly saline-alkaline system with extant microorganisms. In this paper we succinctly describe the geologic setting where the microbial communities have developed inside of the maar crater and the results obtained from high-throughput sequencing methods to characterize the microbial component (Bacteria, Eukarya and Archaea) in endolithic mats of calcareous sediments, and microbial mats and free-living microorganisms in the soda ponds. The studied sites displayed different microbial communities with a diverse number of phylotypes belonging to Bacteria and Eukarya, contrasting with a much less diverse component in Archaea. The sequences here detected were related to environmental sequences from sites with extreme life conditions such as high alkalinity (alkaliphiles), high salinity (halophiles) and high temperature (thermophiles). Moreover, our results indicate an important unexplored endemic microbial biodiversity in the vestiges of the former lake that need to be studied.",Rhodanese domain-containing sulfurtransferases: multifaceted proteins involved in sulfur trafficking in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055601,Journal of experimental botany,2019 05 05,"Sulfur is an essential element for the growth and development of plants that synthesize cysteine and methionine residues from the reductive assimilation of sulfate. Besides its incorporation into proteins, cysteine is the building block for the biosynthesis of numerous sulfur-containing molecules and cofactors. The required sulfur atoms are extracted either directly from cysteine by cysteine desulfurases or indirectly after its catabolic transformation in 3-mercaptopyruvate, a substrate for sulfurtransferases (STRs). Both enzymes are transiently persulfidated in their reaction cycle, i.e. the abstracted sulfur atom is bound to a reactive cysteine residue in the form of a persulfide group. Trans-persulfidation reactions occur when sulfur atoms are transferred to nucleophilic acceptors such as glutathione, proteins or small metabolites. STRs form a ubiquitous, multigenic protein family. They are characterized by the presence of at least one rhodanese homology domain (Rhd), that usually contains the catalytic, persulfidated cysteine. In this review, we focused on Arabidopsis thaliana STRs presenting the sequence characteristics of all family members as well as their biochemical and structural features.

Despite this staggering incidence, most individuals exposed to AKI stressors, such as intravenous radiocontrast or cardiopulmonary bypass, do not develop AKI. In fact, whereas animal models of ischemia, sepsis, or nephrotoxicity suggest near-uniform responses to stressors, the natural history of stressed patients is highly heterogeneous. Recent studies of mitochondrial perturbations underlying experimental and human AKI suggest a conserved metabolic contribution to this variance. The renal tubule is only second to the heart in terms of mitochondrial abundance, reflecting the exquisite need for fuel combustion to generate the energy for active solute transport. The homeostasis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a requisite coenzyme in oxidative metabolism, may be an important determinant of the renal response to AKI stressors. This mini-review highlights recent studies implicating NAD+ dysregulation in experimental and human AKI and summarizes findings from a pilot randomized trial to augment NAD+ among at-risk individuals.",The Effects of Lysimachia christinae Hance Extract Fractions on Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilatation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055581,Pharmacology,2019 06 16,Endothelium-dependent dilatation is a predictor for vascular function.

Although UTI is readily treated with antibiotics in healthy adults, complicated cases in immune-compromised individuals and the emerging antibiotic resistance of several uropathogens have accelerated the need for new treatment strategies. Here, we surveyed the composition of urinary exosomes in a mouse model of uropathgenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) UTI to identify specific urinary tract defense constituents for therapeutic development. We found an enrichment of the iron-binding glycoprotein lactoferrin in the urinary exosomes of infected mice. In subsequent in vitro studies, we identified human bladder epithelial cells as a source of lactoferrin during UPEC infection. We further established that exogenous treatment with human lactoferrin (hLf) reduces UPEC epithelial adherence and enhances neutrophil antimicrobial functions including bacterial killing and extracellular trap production. Notably, a single intravesicular dose of hLf drastically reduced bladder bacterial burden and neutrophil infiltration in our murine UTI model. We propose that lactoferrin is an important modulator of innate immune responses in the urinary tract and has potential application in novel therapeutic design for UTI.","Effect of Creative Dance on Fitness, Functional Balance, and Mobility Control in the Elderly.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055579,Gerontology,2019 05 05,"In the literature on creativity in older adults, creative activities have been found to be an effective way of adapting to age-related psychological and physical changes, providing older adults with opportunities to think differently and be open to new ideas.

Many changes occur with aging and among the most important are changes in immune reactivity associated with cell differentiation stages and the phenomenon of inflammaging, understood as subclinical inflammatory readiness, manifested by elevated levels of proinflammatory factors. It was stated for a long time that this tandem occurs in parallel or eventually sequentially. However, recent evidence points to the fact that, as both originate from chronic antigen stimulation, they mutually drive each other. In this context, inflammaging is considered the basis of most age-related diseases (ARD). In this review concerning human inflammaging, we argue that inflammatory diseases develop during whole life as a diverted (excessive) normal immune reaction to specific stressors. Thus, inflammaging may not be the cause of these diseases; however, it can be the trigger of clinical manifestation of ARD. In this context, the best intervention should aim to regulate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory signals and the more appropriate reaction to chronic stimulations to avoid/delay the appearance of associated diseases.","Polymorphisms of MAMLD1, SRD5A2, and AR Candidate Genes in Seven Dogs (78,XY; SRY-Positive) Affected by Hypospadias or Cryptorchidism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055572,"Sexual development : genetics, molecular biology, evolution, endocrinology, embryology, and pathology of sex determination and differentiation",2019 06 09,"Knowledge of the molecular background of disorders of sex development (DSD) in dogs with normal sets of XY chromosomes (XY DSD) is very scarce. However, extensive studies have been carried out in humans, showing that polymorphisms and mutations of numerous genes, including SRY, MAMLD1, SRD5A2, and AR, are associated with or responsible for XY DSD. In this study, we analyzed the entire coding sequence of these genes in 7 dogs (78,XY) with ambiguous external genitalia (hypospadias, cryptorchidism, bifid scrotum, or rudimentary penis). The most common disorder was hypospadias (6 cases), followed by cryptorchidism (4 cases). The co-occurrence of both abnormalities was observed in 3 dogs. Polymorphisms were found in MAMLD1 (3 SNPs), SRD5A2 (5 SNPs), and AR (2 STRs and 1 SNP), while SRY was monomorphic. However, the distribution of the polymorphic variants in the DSD dogs and 11 control XY dogs did not differ significantly. Our study suggests that an association between the polymorphisms of the studied candidate genes and hypospadias or cryptorchidism is unlikely in dogs. We thus support the recent suggestion that hypospadias is not rare in this species, and moreover, we show that co-occurrence of hypospadias and cryptorchidism can be quite frequent.","Age- and Sex-Specific Risk Profiles and In-Hospital Mortality in 13,932 Spanish Stroke Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055571,"Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 05,"In-hospital stroke death rate is an important sanitary issue.

OBJECTIVE : Analyse changes after a cigarette tax increase in PIC, prices and smoking behaviour patterns for five Colombian cities (63% of the market). Smoking behaviour includes consumption intensity, presentation (stick/pack) and place of purchase. METHODS : Repeated street cross-sectional survey with smokers' self-report on smoking behaviour, last purchase information and direct observation of smokers' packs. Sampling frame: smokers, men and women, aged 12 years or older, all income levels, resident in the five cities with the highest number of smokers representing 63% of cigarette market share (Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Cartagena and Cúcuta) with 1 733 316 smokers in 2013.

In relatively small clinical trials, both non-invasive brain stimulation and behavioural manipulations targeting activation or suppression of specific cortices can improve aphasia treatment outcomes. Recent language interventions that employ principles consistent with inducing neuroplasticity also are showing improved performance for both trained and novel items and contexts.

Using fossil calibrated molecular clock we estimated the origin of Nassellaria among radiolarians primitive forms in the Devonian (ca. 420 Ma), that gave rise to living nassellarian groups in the Triassic (ca. 250 Ma), during the biggest diversification event over their evolutionary history. This morpho-molecular framework provides both a new morphological classification easier to identify under light microscopy and the basis for future molecular ecology surveys. Altogether, it brings a new standpoint to improve our scarce understanding of the ecology and worldwide distribution of extant nassellarians.",T helper 1 and 2 stimuli induce distinct phenotypes in gingival fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055250,Archives of oral biology,2019 05 27,"Gingival fibroblasts (GFs) can participate in the immune response and play an immune-regulatory role.

We review how the information content and analysis challenge of such data indicates that electron microscopy (EM)-based connectomics is an especially hard problem. Here, as in many other current machine learning applications, the need for excessive amounts of labelled data while utilizing only a small fraction of available raw image data for algorithm training illustrates the still fundamental gap between artificial and biological intelligence. Substantial improvements of label and energy efficiency in machine learning may be required to address the formidable challenge of acquiring the nanoscale connectome of a human brain.","Antinociceptive effects of new pyrazoles compounds mediated by the ASIC-1α channel, TRPV-1 and μMOR receptors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055237,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Pyrazoles are potent medicinal scaffolds and exhibit a wide spectrum of biological activities, such as analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic. In this paper we report on research we have performed with the aim of continuing the biological evaluation of the regio-isomeric pyrazole compounds, LQFM-020 (fluorine, para position), LQFM-021 (fluorine, meta position), and LQFM-039 (fluorine, ortho position) in models of pain induced by acidified saline, capsaicin, and formalin. We also investigated the mechanisms of action of these compounds via electrophysiological analyses using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique and heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This enabled us to study different potassium channel subtypes: the ASIC-1α channel, TRPV-1, and μMOR receptors. Our results indicate that LQFM-020, LQFM-021, and LQFM-039 (15, 30 or 60 mg.kg-1) compounds inhibited the nociceptive response induced by acidified saline in a dose-dependent manner. The dose of 30 mg.kg-1 inhibited the nociceptive response induced by capsaicin by 53.3%, 51.4%, and 52.1%, respectively. In addition, we found that naloxone reverses the antinociceptive effect produced by the compounds in both phases of the formalin test. In electrophysiological analyses, we observed that the LQFM-020, LQFM-021, and LQFM-039 compounds did not modulate voltage-gated K + channel subtypes. In contrast, all the compounds tested inhibited the ASIC-1α channel at pH 4.5, with IC50-values of 96.1, 91.6, and 235.2 μM, respectively. All compounds also inhibited the TRPV-1 channel with IC50-values of 139.1, 212.5, and 159.1 μM, respectively. In contrast to the ASIC-1α and TRPV-1 targets, all compounds showed agonist activity on the μMOR receptor with an EC50-value of 117.4, 98.9, and 86.3 μM, respectively. We thus conclude that the ASIC-1α, TRPV-1, and μMOR channels are targets that are directly involved in the antinociceptive effect of LQFM-020, LQFM-021, and LQFM-039. Furthermore, the modifications of the fluorine positions in the phenyl analogs do not change the analgesic effect. However, LQFM-039 showed lower interaction with ASIC-1α channel.",Progress of immunotherapy of anti-α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055236,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons and abnormal protein accumulation, including amyloid (A)β and tau in Alzheimer's disease and Lewy bodies and α-synuclein (α-syn) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent evidence suggests that adaptive immunity plays an important role in PD, and that anti-α-syn antibodies can be used as therapy in neurodegenerative diseases; monoclonal antibodies were shown to inhibit α-syn propagation and aggregation in PD models and patients. In this review, we summarize the different pathological states of α-syn, including gene mutations, truncation, phosphorylation, and the high molecular weight form, and describe the specific antibodies that recognize the α-syn monomer or oligomer, some of which have been tested in clinic trials. We also discuss future research directions and potential targets in PD therapy.",Gossypol overcomes EGFR-TKIs resistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells by targeting YAP/TAZ and EGFRL858R/T790M.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055235,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) improve the progression-free survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, most patients inevitably developed drug resistance. EGFR T790 M mutation is the major mechanism for resistance to EGFR-TKIs and becomes an obstacle for the treatment of NSCLC patients with EGFR activating mutations. Besides, YAP/TAZ also confers resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Our previous study identified gossypol as a YAP/TAZ inhibitor. In the current study, we found that gossypol inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in H1975 cells harboring EGFRL858R/T790M. Also, gossypol treatment sensitized H1975 cells to EGFR-TKIs. Our mechanism studies showed that gossypol decreased the protein level of YAP/TAZ, which was abrogated by the proteasome inhibition. Moreover, over-expression of YAP/TAZ reversed the effects of gossypol on H1975 cells, and YAP/TAZ knockdown sensitized H1975 cells to gossypol treatment. Furthermore, gossypol reduced the protein level of EGFRL858R/T790M and inhibited the downstream ERK1/2 pathway in H1975 cells. Our findings suggested that gossypol might serve a promise drug candidate for overcoming EGFR-TKIs resistance by targeting both YAP/TAZ and EGFRL858R/T790M.",Icariin induces irisin/FNDC5 expression in C2C12 cells via the AMPK pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055234,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 06 12,"Backgroud Icariin, a major bioactive pharmaceutical component of the Chinese herbal medicine Epimedii Herba, has demonstrated lipid-lowering and anti-obesity effects. Irisin/ fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) protects against obesity by inducing browning in white adipose tissue. Objectives This study investigated the effects of icariin on irisin/FNDC5 expression in C2C12 myotubes. Method Cultured murine C2C12 myocytes were used to study the effects of icariin on irisin/FNDC5 expressions by Western-blot, qPCR, Elisa and Immunofluorescence. We also investigated FNDC5 expression in icariin-treated intact mice. Results Icariin increased irisin/FNDC5 protein levels. mRNA levels of irisin/FNDC5 were also increased in C2C12 myocytes after treatment with icariin. Icariin increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1α) protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, icariin exposure resulted in phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in a dose-dependent manner. The regulatory effect of icariin on FNDC5 protein expression was blocked by the AMPK antagonist compound C or silencing of AMPK, suggesting that icariin increased FNDC5 protein expression via the AMPK pathway. In vivo, icariin decreased body weight gain in C57BL/6 mice and increased FNDC5, PGC-1α, and p-AMPK expression levels in skeletal muscle. Conclusions Taken together, our results indicated that icariin induces irisin/FNDC5 expression via the AMPK pathway, indicating that icariin may be promising as an anti-obesity drug.",Fish oil alleviates circadian bile composition dysregulation in male mice with NAFLD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055233,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Our previous studies have found that fish oil rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA) protects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. This study was aimed to explore the effects of fish oil on high fat diet (HFD)-induced circadian bile composition chaos. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups, a control group (CON), a HFD group and a fish oil (FO) group, which were fed a normal chow diet, a HFD, and a HFD supplemented with FO, respectively for 12 weeks. At the end of the experiment, liver tissue, blood and bile samples were processed at 12-h intervals with the first one at zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) and the second at zeitgeber time 12 (ZT12). Metabolites in bile were determined using UPLC-QTOF-MS, screened using multivariate statistical analysis, and analyzed using KEGG database and Metaboanalyst. The expression levels of key proteins in bile acid metabolism were examined using western blot. Results of biochemical analysis and H&E staining illustrated that feeding of HFD induced NAFLD, which was ameliorated in FO group. The bile content of each group at ZT0 (CON, HFD, or FO group) was respectively higher than that at ZT12 (P<.05). The metabolic pathway analysis of differential metabolites showed that these differences were correlated with amino acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis and primary bile acid synthesis at ZT0. FO supplement could modify bile composition, which was related to the influence of its ω-3 PUFA on liver metabolism. ω-3 PUFA may also regulate the circadian rhythm of bile metabolism.",Estradiol replacement therapy regulates innate immune response in ovariectomized arthritic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055232,International immunopharmacology,2019 05 28,"Neuroendocrine changes are essential factors contributing to the progression and development of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the role of estrogen in the innate immunity during arthritis development is still controversial. Here, we evaluated the effect of estrous cycle, ovariectomy, estradiol replacement therapy and treatment with estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ specific agonists on joint edema formation, neutrophil recruitment, and articular levels of cytokines/chemokines in murine zymosan-induced arthritis. Our results showed that articular inflammation of proestus/estrus was similar to metaestus/diestrus animals indicating that the inflammatory response in acute arthritis is not affected by the estrous cycle. However, ovariectomy increased joint swelling, neutrophil migration, and TNF-α level. Treatment for six consecutive days with estradiol cypionate re-established the acute inflammation in ovariectomized arthritic mice to responses similar to those in SHAM-proestrus/estrus or naive mice. Moreover, treatment with propylpyrazoletriol and diarylpropionitrile, two ERα and ERβ selective agonists, respectively, inhibited both edema and neutrophil recruitment. Finally, the non-genomic properties of estradiol were analyzed with an acute treatment with β-estradiol-water soluble, which reduced the edema only. In the present study, estradiol replacement therapy improves the innate immune responses in ovariectomized arthritic mice by activating nuclear estrogen receptors. These results suggest that estradiol can induce a protective anti-inflammatory effect in arthritis during ovaries failure, as observed in the menopause.",Cytotoxicity of 40 Egyptian plant extracts targeting mechanisms of drug-resistant cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055230,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2019 05 21,The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype encounters a major challenge to the success of established chemotherapy in cancer patients.

The highest growth of this pathogen was observed at 15 °C and, at 0.98 and 0.96 aw values. At 0.94 and 0.92 aw values, moderate NaCl levels stimulated the L. monocytogenes growth and repressed the expression of the four tested genes. At 7 °C, the expression of the plcA gene was favored while at 15 °C the hly and iap genes were activated. Preventive actions based on temperature, aw and salt content should be taken to minimise risks associated with growth and gene expression of L. monocytogenes in dry-cured ham.",Apoplasmic and simplasmic phloem unloading mechanisms: Do they co-exist in Angeleno plums under demanding environmental conditions?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055228,Journal of plant physiology,2019 06 01,"Biophysical fruit growth depends on a balance among the vascular and transpiration flows entering/exiting the fruit via phloem, xylem and through the epidermis. There is no information on vascular flows of Japanese plums, a species characterized by high-sugar content of its fruit at harvest. Vascular flows of Angeleno plums were monitored by fruit gauges during late fruit development, under the dry environment of the Goulburn Valley, Victoria, Australia. Phloem, xylem flows and skin transpiratory losses were determined, as well as diurnal leaf, stem and fruit pressure potentials. Fruit seasonal development, skin conductance and dry matter accumulation were also monitored. Fruit grew following a double-sigmoid pattern, but fruit size increased only 3.1 g over the last 3 weeks of development. Fruit grew very little in the morning, primarily due to phloem inflows (0.05 g fruit-1hr-1), while water left the fruit via the xylem. Negligible skin transpiration was recorded for vapour pressure deficit (VPD) values below 3 kPa. This growth pattern, in the absence of skin transpiration, suggests apoplastic phloem unloading. However, at VPD values over 3 kPa (e.g. from early afternoon to a peak around 18:00 h), transpiratory losses through the skin (up to 0.25 g fruit-1hr-1) caused fruit to shrink, leading to enhanced phloem and xylem inflows (ca. 0.15 g fruit-1hr-1), a scenario that would correspond to symplastic phloem unloading. Over 24 h the fruit showed a slightly negative total growth, consistent with fruit growth measured in situ during the season at weekly intervals. A few fruit species are known to alter their phloem unloading mechanism, switching from symplastic to apoplastic during the season. Our data support the coexistence in Japanese plum of different phloem unloading strategies within the same day."
