SorLA has recently attracted much attention as a novel strong risk gene for Alzheimer's disease, and much effort is currently being put into understanding the underlying molecular mechanism. Trafficking of SorLA and Sortilin are mediated by interacting with AP-1, AP-2, GGA 1-3 and the retromer complex. Although these cytosolic adaptor proteins all bind to both SorLA and Sortilin, a large fraction of intracellular Sortilin and SorLA are located in different subcellular vesicles. This indicates that unknown specialised adaptor proteins targeting SorLA for trafficking are yet to be discovered. We have identified HSPA12A as a new adaptor protein that, among Vps10p-D receptors, selectively binds to SorLA in an ADP/ATP dependent manner. This is the first described substrate of HSPA12A, and we demonstrate that the binding, which affects both endocytic speed and subcellular localisation of SorLA, is mediated by specific acidic residues in the cytosolic domain of SorLA. The identification of the relatively unknown HSPA12A as a SorLA specific interaction partner could lead to novel insight into the molecular mechanism of SorLA, and re-emphasises the role of heat shock proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.",Identification of Sex-Specific Transcriptome Responses to Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679748,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"PCBs are classified as xenoestrogens and carcinogens and their health risks may be sex-specific. To identify potential sex-specific responses to PCB-exposure we established gene expression profiles in a population study subdivided into females and males. Gene expression profiles were determined in a study population consisting of 512 subjects from the EnviroGenomarkers project, 217 subjects who developed lymphoma and 295 controls were selected in later life. We ran linear mixed models in order to find associations between gene expression and exposure to PCBs, while correcting for confounders, in particular distribution of white blood cells (WBC), as well as random effects. The analysis was subdivided according to sex and development of lymphoma in later life. The changes in gene expression as a result of exposure to the six studied PCB congeners were sex- and WBC type specific. The relatively large number of genes that are significantly associated with PCB-exposure in the female subpopulation already indicates different biological response mechanisms to PCBs between the two sexes. The interaction analysis between different PCBs and WBCs provides only a small overlap between sexes. In males, cancer-related pathways and in females immune system-related pathways are identified in association with PCBs and WBCs. Future lymphoma cases and controls for both sexes show different responses to the interaction of PCBs with WBCs, suggesting a role of the immune system in PCB-related cancer development.",Analogues of ERβ ligand chloroindazole exert immunomodulatory and remyelinating effects in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679747,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Pharmaceutical agents currently approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis reduce relapse rates, but do not reverse or prevent neurodegeneration nor initiate myelin repair. The highly selective estrogen receptor (ER) β ligand chloroindazole (IndCl) shows particular promise promoting both remyelination while reducing inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. To optimize these benefits, we developed and screened seven novel IndCl analogues for their efficacy in promoting primary oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitor cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation in vitro by immunohistochemistry. Two analogues, IndCl-o-chloro and IndCl-o-methyl, induced proliferation and differentiation equivalent to IndCl and were selected for subsequent in vivo evaluation for their impact on clinical disease course, white matter pathology, and inflammation. Both compounds ameliorated disease severity, increased mature OLs, and improved overall myelination in the corpus callosum and white matter tracts of the spinal cord. These effects were accompanied by reduced production of the OL toxic molecules interferon-γ and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand, CXCL10 by splenocytes with no discernable effect on central nervous system-infiltrating leukocyte numbers, while IndCl-o-methyl also reduced peripheral interleukin (IL)-17. In addition, expression of the chemokine CXCL1, which is associated with developmental oligodendrogenesis, was upregulated by IndCl and both analogues. Furthermore, callosal compound action potential recordings from analogue-treated mice demonstrated a larger N1 component amplitude compared to vehicle, suggesting more functionally myelinated fibers. Thus, the o-Methyl and o-Chloro IndCl analogues represent a class of ERβ ligands that offer significant remyelination and neuroprotection as well as modulation of the immune system; hence, they appear appropriate to consider further for therapeutic development in multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases.","Age-dependent changes in cardiac performance, motor function, QoL, and mental status in metoprolol-treated chronic heart failure patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679746,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"No previous study reports the effect of age on cardiac performance, motor function and quality of life (QoL) in Chinese chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. This single-center, prospective study enrolled CHF patients with resting heart rate (RHR) > 80 bpm, who were treated with metoprolol and were followed up at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Changes in cardiac, motor, and QoL parameters between patients aged ≥60 years and those aged <60 years were compared at all time points. P < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 154 patients were enrolled (median age: 66.39 years; 116 aged ≥60 years, 38 aged <60 years; 95% New York Heart Association class III-IV). RHR decreased significantly in both patient groups (P < 0.0001 for both groups). Patients aged ≥60 years had a significant improvement in both ejection fraction (EF) at 6 and 12 months and in cardiac index (CI) at 3, 6, and 12 months. However, no major difference was observed in motor function in both groups. Significantly higher SF-8 scores showed greater improvement in QoL in the <60 age group at 12 months (P = 0.0008). Metoprolol demonstrated improvement in cardiac performance, motor function, QoL, and anxiety with increase in depression and burnout in both genders; however, the findings were independent of age.",Sonic hedgehog signaling is negatively regulated in reactive astrocytes after forebrain stab injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679745,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Following injury to the central nervous system, astrocytes perform critical and complex functions that both promote and antagonize neural repair. Understanding the molecular signaling pathways that coordinate their diverse functional properties is key to developing effective therapeutic strategies. In the healthy, adult CNS, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is active in mature, differentiated astrocytes. Shh has been shown to undergo injury-induced upregulation and promote neural repair. Here, we investigated whether Shh signaling mediates astrocyte response to injury. Surprisingly, we found that following an acute, focal injury, reactive astrocytes exhibit a pronounced reduction in Shh activity in a spatiotemporally-defined manner. Shh signaling is lost in reactive astrocytes at the lesion site, but persists in mild to moderately reactive astrocytes in distal tissues. Nevertheless, local pharmacological activation of the Shh pathway in astrocytes mitigates inflammation, consistent with a neuroprotective role for Shh signaling after injury. Interestingly, we find that Shh signaling is restored to baseline levels two weeks after injury, a time during which acute inflammation has largely subsided and lesions have matured. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenous Shh signaling in astrocytes is dynamically regulated in a context dependent manner. In addition, exogenous activation of the Shh pathway promotes neuroprotection mediated by reactive astrocytes.",Toxicity of diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehyde mixtures on sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679744,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs), decadienal, heptadienal and octadienal, derive from the oxidation of fatty acids and have cytotoxic and anticancer effects. PUAs, tested separately, induce malformations in sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus embryos. Decadienal induces the worst malformations and lowest survival rates. Interestingly, decadienal, heptadienal and octadienal place in motion several genes to counteract their negative effects. To date, no studies are available reporting on the effects of PUA mixtures on marine invertebrates. Here we test binary and ternary mixtures on embryonic development of P. lividus. Our findings demonstrate that mixtures of PUAs act (i) at morphological level in synergistic way, being much more severe compared to individual PUAs; (ii) at molecular level also reveal an additive effect, affecting almost all fifty genes, previously tested using individual PUAs. This study is relevant from an ecological point of view since diatoms are a major food source for both pelagic and benthic organisms. This work opens new perspectives for understanding the molecular mechanisms that marine organisms use in reacting to environmental natural toxin mixtures such as diatom PUAs.",Biomarkers of optical coherence tomography in evaluating the treatment outcomes of neovascular age-related macular degeneration: a real-world study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679743,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"This study evaluated the characteristic changes in optical coherence tomography (OCT) biomarkers in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs and their relationship with visual outcomes at 1-year follow-up in a real-world setting. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 126 eyes with nAMD treated with either intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept, including ophthalmologic examinations and spectral-domain OCT at baseline and months 3, 6, and 12 after first injection. Treatment response of intraretinal cysts (IRCs), subretinal fluid (SRF), and pigment epithelial detachment (PED), and the correlation between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) changes and these OCT biomarkers were analyzed. After an average of 5.1 ± 1.5 injections, 33.3% of eyes with PED showed resolution at month 12, a significantly lower proportion than for IRCs (53.8%) or SRF (51.6%). BCVA improvement at 1 year was negatively associated with PED at baseline and with IRCs or PED at month 12. Persistence of IRCs at month 12 was associated with degeneration morphology of IRCs at baseline and non-resolved cysts at month 3 after loading. In conclusions, IRCs and PED are associated with poor visual improvement in nAMD in a real-world setting. Both IRCs and SRF responded better than PED to anti-VEGF therapy.",Structure-Mechanical Property Relations of Skin-Core Regions of Poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) Single Fiber.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679742,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"This study aims to elucidate the relationship between the mechanical properties and microstructures of poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) single fibers at the micro/nano scale. The skin-core structure of Kevlar® 29 fiber was revealed through a focused electron beam experiment inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) chamber. Cross sectional SEM images of the broken fiber showed that the thickness of the skin ranged from 300 to 800 nm and that the core region consisted of highly packed layers of fibrils. The skin and the core regions showed different mechanical behaviour and structural changes during nanoindentation and micro-tensile tests, indicating that the core region possessed higher stiffness, whereas the skin region could undergo more plastic deformation. Furthermore, micro-tensile testing results showed that the ultimate tensile strength, the elongation at failure, and the tensile toughness of single fibers could be significantly enhanced by cyclic loading. Such findings are important to understand the contribution of different microstructures of Kevlar® fibers to their mechanical performance, which in turn can be utilized to design high-performance fibers that are not limited by the trade-off between toughness and stiffness.",Ni-Co bimetal decorated carbon nanotube aerogel as an efficient anode catalyst in urea fuel cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679741,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Ni-based catalysts have been considered as an efficient anode material for urea fuel cells due to the low cost and high activity in alkaline media. Herein, we demonstrate that Ni-Co bimetallic nanoparticles decorated carbon nanotube aerogels as catalysts for urea oxidation reaction (UOR) can be synthesized by a polyol reduction and sol-gel method. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogels were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-Ray diffraction. The electro-catalytic activity of the Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogels towards UOR was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the Co-doping at 25% (Co/Ni) significantly increased the oxidation peak current and reduced the overpotential of the UOR. Furthermore, the MWCNT aerogel support also remarkably enhanced electro-catalytic activity by providing a high surface area and fast mass transport for the UOR owing to the porous 3D network structures with uniform distribution of Ni-Co nanoparticles. Urea/O2 fuel cell with Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogel as anode material exhibited an excellent performance with maximum power density of 17.5 mWcm-2 with an open circuit voltage of 0.9 V. Thus, this work showed that the highly porous three-dimensional Ni-Co/MWCNT aerogel catalysts can be used for urea oxidation and as an efficient anode material for urea fuel cells.",Schizophrenia-associated genomic copy number variants and subcortical brain volumes in the UK Biobank.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679740,Molecular psychiatry,2019 03 29,"Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder for which anatomical brain alterations have been repeatedly reported in clinical samples. Unaffected at-risk groups have also been studied in an attempt to identify brain changes that do not reflect reverse causation or treatment effects. However, no robust associations have been observed between neuroanatomical phenotypes and known genetic risk factors for schizophrenia. We tested subcortical brain volume differences between 49 unaffected participants carrying at least one of the 12 copy number variants associated with schizophrenia in UK Biobank and 9063 individuals who did not carry any of the 93 copy number variants reported to be pathogenic. Our results show that CNV carriers have reduced volume in some of the subcortical structures previously shown to be reduced in schizophrenia. Moreover, these associations partially accounted for the association between pathogenic copy number variants and cognitive impairment, which is one of the features of schizophrenia."

Remarkably, work in econophysics has provided evidence that the statistical properties of the growth of business firms follow the same sorts of power laws that characterize physical systems near their critical points. Given how economies change over time, whether these statistical properties are persistent, robust, and universal like those of physical systems remains an open question. Here, we show that the scaling properties of firm growth previously demonstrated for publicly-traded U.S. manufacturing firms from 1974 to 1993 apply to the same sorts of firms from 1993 to 2015, to firms in other broad sectors (such as materials), and to firms in new sectors (such as Internet services). We measure virtually the same scaling exponent for manufacturing for the 1993 to 2015 period as for the 1974 to 1993 period and virtually the same scaling exponent for other sectors as for manufacturing. Furthermore, we show that fluctuations of the growth rate for new industries self-organize into a power law over relatively short time scales.",Mercury methylating microbial communities of boreal forest soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679728,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The formation of the potent neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) is a microbially mediated process that has raised much concern because MeHg poses threats to wildlife and human health. Since boreal forest soils can be a source of MeHg in aquatic networks, it is crucial to understand the biogeochemical processes involved in the formation of this pollutant. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and the mercury methyltransferase, hgcA, combined with geochemical characterisation of soils, were used to determine the microbial populations contributing to MeHg formation in forest soils across Sweden. The hgcA sequences obtained were distributed among diverse clades, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Methanomicrobia, with Deltaproteobacteria, particularly Geobacteraceae, dominating the libraries across all soils examined. Our results also suggest that MeHg formation is also linked to the composition of non-mercury methylating bacterial communities, likely providing growth substrate (e.g. acetate) for the hgcA-carrying microorganisms responsible for the actual methylation process. While previous research focused on mercury methylating microbial communities of wetlands, this study provides some first insights into the diversity of mercury methylating microorganisms in boreal forest soils.",Identification of the novel role of butyrate as AhR ligand in human intestinal epithelial cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679727,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The ligand activated transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) emerged as a critical regulator of immune and metabolic processes in the gastrointestinal tract. In the gut, a main source of AhR ligands derives from commensal bacteria. However, many of the reported microbiota-derived ligands have been restricted to indolyl metabolites. Here, by screening commensal bacteria supernatants on an AhR reporter system expressed in human intestinal epithelial cell line (IEC), we found that the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate induced AhR activity and the transcription of AhR-dependent genes in IECs. We showed that AhR ligand antagonists reduced the effects of butyrate on IEC suggesting that butyrate could act as a ligand of AhR, which was supported by the nuclear translocation of AhR induced by butyrate and in silico structural modelling. In conclusion, our findings suggest that (i) butyrate activates AhR pathway and AhR-dependent genes in human intestinal epithelial cell-lines (ii) butyrate is a potential ligand for AhR which is an original mechanism of gene regulation by SCFA.",STAT3 is activated in multicellular spheroids of colon carcinoma cells and mediates expression of IRF9 and interferon stimulated genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679726,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Three-dimensional cell cultures, such as multicellular spheroids (MCS), reflect the in vivo architecture of solid tumours and multicellular drug resistance. We previously identified interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to be responsible for the up-regulation of a subset of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) in MCS of colon carcinoma cells. This set of ISGs closely resembled a previously identified IFN-related DNA-damage resistance signature (IRDS) that was correlated to resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. In this study we found that transcription factor STAT3 is activated upstream of IRF9 and binds to the IRF9 promoter in MCS of HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Transferring conditioned media (CM) from high cell density conditions to non-confluent cells resulted in STAT3 activation and increased expression of IRF9 and a panel of IRDS genes, also observed in MCS, suggesting the involvement of a soluble factor. Furthermore, we identified gp130/JAK signalling to be responsible for STAT3 activation, IRF9, and IRDS gene expression in MCS and by CM. Our data suggests a novel mechanism where STAT3 is activated in high cell density conditions resulting in increased expression of IRF9 and, in turn, IRDS genes, underlining a mechanism by which drug resistance is regulated.",Comparison of regeneration capacity and Agrobacterium-mediated cell transformation efficiency of different cultivars and rootstocks of Vitis spp. via organogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679725,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The success of in vitro plant regeneration and the competence of genetic transformation greatly depends on the genotype of the species of interest. In previous work, we developed a method for the efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation via organogenesis of V. vinifera cultivar Thompson Seedless, by using meristematic bulk (MB) as starting tissue. In this study, we applied this method for the regeneration and transformation of MBs obtained from the Italian cultivar Ciliegiolo and two of the commonly used Vitis rootstocks, 110 Richter and Kober 5BB, in comparison with Thompson Seedless. The A. tumefaciens strain EHA105, harbouring pK7WG2 binary vector, was used for the transformation trials, which allowed selection through the enhanced-green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene. Putative transformed tissues and/or shoots were identified by either a screening based on the eGFP expression alone or its use in combination with kanamycin in the medium. MBs obtained from Thompson Seedless showed the highest regeneration and transformation cell competence, which subsequently allowed the recovery of stably transformed plants. Ciliegiolo, 110 Richter, and Kober 5BB, produced actively growing transgenic calli showing eGFP fluorescence, more consistently on selective media, but had no regenerative competence.",Structural similarity networks predict clinical outcome in early-phase psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679724,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 05 22,"Despite recent advances, there is still a major need for prediction of treatment success in schizophrenia, a condition long considered a disorder of dysconnectivity in the brain. Graph theory provides a means to characterize the connectivity in both healthy and abnormal brains. We calculated structural similarity networks in each participant and hypothesized that the ""hubness"", i.e., the number of edges connecting a node to the rest of the network, would be associated with clinical outcome. This prospective controlled study took place at an academic research center and included 82 early-phase psychosis patients (23 females; mean age [SD] = 21.6 [5.5] years) and 58 healthy controls. Medications were administered in a double-blind randomized manner, and patients were scanned at baseline prior to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics. Symptoms were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale at baseline and over the course of 12 weeks. Nodal degree of structural similarity networks was computed for each subject and entered as a predictor of individual treatment response into a partial least squares (PLS) regression. The model fit was significant in a permutation test with 1000 permutations (P = 0.006), and the first two PLS regression components explained 29% (95% CI: 27; 30) of the variance in treatment response after cross-validation. Nodes loading strongly on the first PLS component were primarily located in the orbito- and prefrontal cortex, whereas nodes loading strongly on the second PLS component were primarily located in the superior temporal, precentral, and middle cingulate cortex. These data suggest a link between brain network morphology and clinical outcome in early-phase psychosis.",Spectral photoacoustic imaging to estimate in vivo placental oxygenation during preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679723,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder accounting for 14% of global maternal deaths annually. Preeclampsia - maternal hypertension and proteinuria - is promoted by placental ischemia resulting from reduced uteroplacental perfusion. Here, we assess longitudinal changes in placental oxygenation during preeclampsia using spectral photoacoustic imaging. Spectral photoacoustic images were acquired of the placenta of normal pregnant (NP) and preeclamptic reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) Sprague Dawley rats on gestational days (GD) 14, 16, and 18, corresponding to mid- to late gestation (n = 10 per cohort). Two days after implementation of the RUPP surgical model, placental oxygen saturation decreased 12% in comparison with NP. Proteinuria was determined from a 24-hour urine collection prior to imaging on GD18. Blood pressure measurements were obtained on GD18 after imaging. Placental hypoxia in the RUPP was confirmed with histological staining for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, a cellular transcription regulator which responds to local oxygen levels. Using in vivo, longitudinal imaging methods we determined that the placenta in the reduced uterine perfusion pressure rat model of preeclampsia is hypoxic, and that this hypoxia is maintained through late gestation. Future work will utilize these methods to assess the impact of novel therapeutics on placental ischemia and the progression of preeclampsia.","Determination of Ultrastructural Properties of Human Carotid Atherosclerotic Plaques by Scanning Acoustic Microscopy, Micro-Computer Tomography, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679722,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Microcalcification is the precursor of vulnerability of plaques in humans. Visualization of such small structures in vivo with high spatial resolution is an unsolved issue. The goal of this study is to evaluate the potential of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) in the determination of atherosclerotic plaques with calcifications by validating this technique with micro-computer tomography (micro-CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The fibrocalcific plaques were obtained from 12 different patients and initially examined with micro-CT. The images exhibited calcifications within these plaques. For imaging with SAM, approximately 5 μm thick slices were prepared. Sound speed values within calcified regions were measured to be greater than the ones in collagen-rich regions. These fibrocalcific plaques were also examined with SEM and EDS revealing collagen and calcium deposition within these samples. The consistency of the results obtained by all of the modalities involved in our study is an indication of the potential of SAM as a clinical tool for the diagnosis of vulnerable plaques.",Comparisons of different indices of low muscle mass in relationship with cardiometabolic disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679721,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"This study aimed to evaluate the most valid index among various indices of low muscle mass in assessing cardiometabolic risks in a Korean population. Appendicular lean mass index (ALMI, kg/m2), fat mass index (FMI, kg/m2), FMI-adjusted ALMI (ALMfmi), ratio of ALM to weight index (ALMwt), ratio of ALM to body mass index (ALMbmi) and ratio of ALM to truncal fat index (ALMtrunkfat) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in 17,870 participants from 2008 to 2011. We adopted all the aforementioned indices of low muscle mass expressed as sex- and age-specific standard deviation scores (Z-scores). Low muscle mass for age was defined as Z-score <-1. The prevalence of low muscle mass was approximately 16% across all indices. Low muscle mass defined by ALMI had low muscle mass and low fat mass, and ALMfmi had low muscle mass at the same FMI. However, low muscle mass defined by ALMwt, ALMbmi and ALMtrunkfat had similar muscle mass with high FMI. The receiver operating characteristic curve in metabolic syndrome showed that the ALMtrunkfat was 0.74 in male and 0.69 in female, indicating that ALMtrunkfat was the best discrimination index for metabolic syndrome. This study showed that ALMtrunkfat could be a useful indicator for screening cardiometabolic risk factors, particularly in normal or overweight Asian population.",Physical plasma-treated saline promotes an immunogenic phenotype in CT26 colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679720,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Metastatic colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death. Current options in palliation such as hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) present severe side effects. Recent research efforts suggested the therapeutic use of oxidant-enriched liquid using cold physical plasma. To investigate a clinically accepted treatment regimen, we assessed the antitumor capacity of plasma-treated saline solution. In response to such liquid, CT26 murine colon cancer cells were readily oxidized and showed cell growth with subsequent apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and upregulation of immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers in vitro. This was accompanied by marked morphological changes with re-arrangement of actin fibers and reduced motility. Induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype was not observed. Key results were confirmed in MC38 colon and PDA6606 pancreatic cancer cells. Compared to plasma-treated saline, hydrogen peroxide was inferiorly toxic in 3D tumor spheroids but of similar efficacy in 2D models. In vivo, plasma-treated saline decreased tumor burden in Balb/C mice. This was concomitant with elevated numbers of intratumoral macrophages and increased T cell activation following incubation with CT26 cells ex vivo. Being a potential adjuvant for HIPEC therapy, our results suggest oxidizing saline solutions to inactivate colon cancer cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses."

To date several X-ray structures of NP of Influenza A (A/NP) and B (B/NP) viruses and of infectious salmon anemia (ISA/NP) virus have been solved. Here we purified, characterized and solved the X-ray structure of the tetrameric D/NP at 2.4 Å resolution. The crystal structure of its core is similar to NP of other Influenza viruses. However, unlike A/NP and B/NP which possess a flexible amino-terminal tail containing nuclear localization signals (NLS) for their nuclear import, D/NP possesses a carboxy-terminal tail (D/NPTAIL). We show that D/NPTAIL harbors a bipartite NLS and designed C-terminal truncated mutants to demonstrate the role of D/NPTAIL for nuclear transport.",Local anaesthetics upregulate nitric oxide generation in cord blood and adult human neutrophils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679708,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Nitric oxide (NO) generation by systemic neonatal neutrophils is not clarified. It is also not known whether local anaesthetics (LAs) transferred to the fetal systemic circulation following maternal epidural blockade may affect this process. In the present study, NO generation was evaluated in neutrophils from cord blood (CB, n = 11) and adult blood (n = 10) following exposure to bupivacaine (0.0005, 0.005, 1 mM), lidocaine (0.002, 0.02, 4 mM) and ropivacaine (0.0007, 0.007, 1.4 mM) using flow cytometry, as well as indirectly by determining nitrite concentrations in cell incubation media. To determine the role of NO synthase (NOS) isoforms in NO generation following exposure to LAs, experiments were repeated in the presence of the NOS inhibitors, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and aminoguanidine; in addition, the expression of NOS isoforms was analysed. CB neutrophils produced less NO than adult neutrophils. LAs, especially ropivacaine and lidocaine, stimulated neutrophil NO generation, but in CB neutrophils this effect was negligible at clinically relevant drug concentrations. A mechanism involving NOS activity was responsible for the observed phenomena. In conclusion, LAs are able to upregulate neutrophil NO production, but in neonates this effect is likely to be clinically insignificant.",Maximizing Electrokinetic Energy Conversion via the Intersecting Asymptotes Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679707,Scientific reports,2019 04 12,"It has been shown in earlier studies that the maximum electrokinetic conversion efficiency between flow and electric work (e.g., electrokinetic power generation) occurs when electric double-layer (λ) overlaps and there is no electroneutral zone in a nanometer-scale channel. This result has been shown through cumbersome and lengthy numerical and theoretical studies. The case is made here that complications associated with solving the coupled set of governing equations i.e. Poisson, Nernst-Planck, and Navier-Stokes (PNPNS) could be drastically reduced to a two-step solution by method of intersecting asymptotes.",Superficial sedimentary stocks and sources of carbon and nitrogen in coastal vegetated assemblages along a flow gradient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679706,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Coastal vegetated ecosystems are major organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) sinks, but the mechanisms that regulate their spatial variability need to be better understood. Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17-32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45-35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.",Identification of Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase variants with increased mismatch discrimination and reverse transcriptase activity from a smart enzyme mutant library.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679705,Scientific reports,2019 02 12,"DNA polymerases the key enzymes for several biotechnological applications. Obviously, nature has not evolved these enzymes to be compatible with applications in biotechnology. Thus, engineering of a natural scaffold of DNA polymerases may lead to enzymes improved for several applications. Here, we investigated a two-step approach for the design and construction of a combinatorial library of mutants of KlenTaq DNA polymerase. First, we selected amino acid sites for saturation mutagenesis that interact with the primer/template strands or are evolutionarily conserved. From this library, we identified mutations that little interfere with DNA polymerase activity. Next, these functionally active mutants were combined randomly to construct a second library with enriched sequence diversity. We reasoned that the combination of mutants that have minuscule effect on enzyme activity and thermostability, will result in entities that have an increased mutation load but still retain activity. Besides activity and thermostability, we screened the library for entities with two distinct properties. Indeed, we identified two different KlenTaq DNA polymerase variants that either exhibit increased mismatch extension discrimination or increased reverse transcription PCR activity, respectively.",The association between intraoperative urine output and postoperative acute kidney injury differs between partial and radical nephrectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679704,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"We sought to investigate the association between intraoperative urine output and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing radical and partial nephrectomy. We retrospectively reviewed data of 742 patients. Postoperative AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The relationship between intraoperative urine output and the risk of AKI was evaluated by multivariable logistic regression analysis in radical and partial nephrectomy, separately. Minimum P-value approach was used to find the optimal threshold of intraoperative oliguria associated with the risk of AKI. The incidence of AKI was 14.4% (67/466) after partial nephrectomy and 57.6% (159/276) after radical nephrectomy. For partial nephrectomy, multivariable analysis showed that renal ischemic time, operation time, open surgery and intraoperative transfusion were significantly associated with AKI. For radical nephrectomy, history of hypertension, baseline glomerular filtration rate and intraoperative mean urine output were significantly associated with AKI. Intraoperative mean urine output during radical nephrectomy was associated with AKI after radical nephrectomy, while not after partial nephrectomy. Mean urine output <1.0 mL/kg/h was determined to be an optimal cutoff of AKI after radical nephrectomy. Intraoperative oliguria may have different clinical implication for AKI between partial and radical nephrectomy.","Gfi1-Mediated Repression of c-Fos, Egr-1 and Egr-2, and Inhibition of ERK1/2 Signaling Contribute to the Role of Gfi1 in Granulopoiesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679703,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Gfi1 supports neutrophil development at the expense of monopoiesis, but the underlying molecular mechanism is incompletely understood. We recently showed that the G-CSFR Y729F mutant, in which tyrosine 729 was mutated to phenylalanine, promoted monocyte rather than neutrophil development in myeloid precursors, which was associated with prolonged activation of Erk1/2 and enhanced activation of c-Fos and Egr-1. We show here that Gfi1 inhibited the expression of c-Fos, Egr-1 and Egr-2, and rescued neutrophil development in cells expressing G-CSFR Y729F. Gfi1 directly bound to and repressed c-Fos and Egr-1, as has been shown for Egr-2, all of which are the immediate early genes (IEGs) of the Erk1/2 pathway. Interestingly, G-CSF- and M-CSF-stimulated activation of Erk1/2 was augmented in lineage-negative (Lin-) bone marrow (BM) cells from Gfi1-/- mice. Suppression of Erk1/2 signaling resulted in diminished expression of c-Fos, Egr-1 and Egr-2, and partially rescued the neutrophil development of Gfi1-/- BM cells, which are intrinsically defective for neutrophil development. Together, our data indicate that Gfi1 inhibits the expression of c-Fos, Egr-1 and Egr-2 through direct transcriptional repression and indirect inhibition of Erk1/2 signaling, and that Gfi1-mediated downregulation of c-Fos, Egr-1 and Egr-2 may contribute to the role of Gfi1 in granulopoiesis.",Fractional topological phase measurement with a hyperentangled photon source.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679702,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Pairs of photons simultaneously entangled in their path and polarization degrees of freedom are used to measure the topological phase acquired by bipartite entangled states. Conditional phase local unitary operations having the polarization degree of freedom as the control variable are applied. Qudits of arbitrary dimensions are encoded on the photons transverse positions while polarization entanglement is used as an auxiliary resource for quantum interference measurements. With this scheme the fractional phases predicted for dimensions d = 2, 3 and 4 could be measured with visibilities for the interference curves beyond the limit allowed for classical sources, which is expected for a source of quantum correlated photons. The strategy of perform a quantum interferometry experiment with photons entangled in an auxiliary degree of freedom and apply unitary local operations conditioned to this auxiliary variable shows an increase to the signal to noise ratio, simplifies alignment and can be used in different applications. This offers an interesting perspective for the efficient implementation of phase gates in quantum computing with hyperentangled photon sources in polarization and path degrees of freedom. Furthermore, one can conjecture whether the measured phase can serve as a dimensionality identifier of the Hilbert space dimension for an unknown state preparation.",Characterizing Branching Vascular Network Morphology in Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy by Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679701,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"This study analyze the morphological characteristics of branching vascular networks (BVN) in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and correlate imaging characteristics with clinical presentations. We presented a retrospective observational case series for fifty cases of PCV confirmed by indocyanine green angiography. Macular OCTA were done by the AngioVue. The PCV cases were classified by distinct morphologic patterns of BVN by two retina specialists and clinical features were analyzed. The sensitivity of polyp detection by OCTA was 86% after manual segmentation and that of BVN was 90%. Three distinct morphologic patterns of BVN were identified. (1) The ""Trunk"" pattern (47%) exhibited major vessel trunk with features including presence of drusens, thin choroid, and larger BVN area. (2) The ""Glomeruli"" pattern (33%) showed anastomotic vascular network without major trunk. (3) The ""Stick"" pattern (20%) had localized BVN and the thickest choroid. Subtypes 2 and 3 held higher recurrence rate. In conclusions, the precise visualization of BVN on OCTA supported that OCTA might be a noninvasive tool to study the morphology of BVN in PCV, which exhibits three different morphological types. Identifying the morphology of BVN has the potential to prognosticate outcomes in PCV patients.",Tumor resection ameliorates tumor-induced suppression of neuroinflammatory and behavioral responses to an immune challenge in a cancer survivor model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679700,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Breast cancer survivors display altered inflammatory responses to immune challenges relative to cancer-naive controls likely due to previous cancer treatments, stress associated with cancer, and/or tumor physiology. Proper inflammatory responses are necessary for adaptive sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, anorexia, and fever) and neuroinflammatory pathways are also implicated in mental health disturbances (e.g., cognitive impairment, depression) suffered by cancer patients and survivors. Rodent cancer models indicate that tumors are sufficient to exacerbate neuroinflammatory responses after an immune challenge, however primary tumors are not usually present in cancer survivors, and the behavioral consequences of these brain changes remain understudied. Therefore, we tested the extent to which mammary tumor resection attenuates tumor-induced neuroinflammation and sickness behavior following an immune challenge (i.p. lipopolysaccharide [LPS] injection) in mice. Tnf-α, Il-1β, and Il-6 mRNA decreased in multiple brain regions of LPS-treated tumor-bearing mice relative to LPS-treated controls; tumor resection attenuated these effects in some cases (but not Tnf-α). Tumors also attenuated sickness behaviors (hypothermia and lethargy) compared to LPS-treated controls. Tumor resection reversed these behavioral consequences, although basal body temperature remained elevated, comparable to tumor-bearing mice. Thus, tumors significantly modulate neuroinflammatory pathways with functional consequences and tumor resection mitigates most, but not all, of these changes."

However, adverse events, including the emergence of secondary tumors and drug resistance, have been reported. Studies have revealed that undesirable RAF dimerization induced by inhibitors promotes these adverse effects. Here, we developed highly sensitive biosensors of RAF dimerization in cells utilizing the split enhanced click beetle luciferase (Emerald Luc, ELuc) complementation technique. We demonstrated that our biosensor system works effectively for high-throughput screens in the microplate format. A comprehensive analysis of commercially available RAF inhibitors performed using this assay system revealed that the inhibitors exhibit various potencies in inducing the dimerization of RAF isoforms, and their dimerization potencies do not always correlate with the RAF enzyme inhibition. This sensitive assay system will become a powerful tool to discover next-generation BRAF inhibitors with safer profiles.",Impaired activation of lesional CD8+ T-cells is associated with enhanced expression of Programmed Death-1 in Indian Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679687,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Post Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), caused by Leishmania donovani is the dermal sequel of Visceral Leishmaniasis and importantly, is the proposed disease reservoir. The survival of Leishmania parasites within monocytes/macrophages hinges on its ability to effectively nullify immune activation mechanisms. Thus, delineating the disease-promoting immune mechanisms can facilitate development of immunotherapeutic strategies. Accordingly, in the absence of an animal model, this study aimed to delineate the status of CD8+ T-cells in patients with PKDL. At disease presentation, the absence of CD4+ T-cells at lesional sites was concomitant with an overwhelming infiltration of CD8+ T-cells that demonstrated an absence of Perforin, Granzyme and Zap-70, along with an enhanced expression of Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and the skin-homing CCL17. Additionally, the lesional CCR4+CD8+ population was associated with an enhanced expression of IL-10 and IL-5. In circulation, the enhanced CD8+CCR4+ T-cell population and raised levels of CCL17/22 was associated with an increased frequency of PD-1, while CD127 was decreased. Taken together, in PKDL, the enhanced plasma and lesional CCL17 accounted for the dermal homing of CD8+CCR4+ T-cells, that along with a concomitant upregulation of PD-1 and IL-10 mediated immune inactivation, emphasizing the need for designing immunotherapies capable of reinvigorating T-cell potency.",The nature of collective excitations and their crossover at extreme supercritical conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679686,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Physical properties of an interacting system are governed by collective excitations, but their nature at extreme supercritical conditions is unknown. Here, we present direct evidence for propagating solid-like longitudinal phonon-like excitations with wavelengths extending to interatomic separations deep in the supercritical state at temperatures up to 3,300 times the critical temperature. We observe that the crossover of dispersion curves develops at k points reducing with temperature. We interpret this effect as the crossover from the collective phonon to the collisional mean-free path regime of particle dynamics and find that the crossover points are close to both the inverse of the shortest available wavelength in the system and to the particle mean free path inferred from experiments and theory. Notably, both the shortest wavelength and mean free path scale with temperature with the same power law, lending further support to our findings.",Separate multisensory integration processes for ownership and localization of body parts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679685,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The experiences that body parts are owned and localized in space are two key aspects of body awareness. Although initial work assumed that the perceived location of one's body part can be used as a behavioral measure to assess the feeling of owning a body part, recent studies call into question the relationship between localization and ownership of body parts. Yet, little is known about the processes underlying these two aspects of body-part awareness. Here, I applied a statistically optimal cue combination paradigm to a perceptual illusion in which ownership over an artificial hand is experienced, and found that variances predicted by a model of optimal cue combination are similar to those observed in localization of the participant's hand, but systematically diverge from those observed in ownership of the artificial hand. These findings provide strong evidence for separate processes between ownership and localization of body parts, and indicate a need to revise current models of body part ownership. Results from this study suggest that the neural substrates for perceptual identification of one's body parts-such as body ownership-are distinct from those underlying spatial localization of the body parts, thus implying a functional distinction between ""who"" and ""where"" in the processing of body part information.",RGB Magnetophotonic Crystals for High-contrast Magnetooptical Spatial Light Modulators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679684,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Magnetooptical spatial light modulators (MOSLMs) are photonic devices that encode information in photonic waveforms by changing their amplitude and phase using magnetooptical Faraday or Kerr rotation. Despite the progress on both MO materials and switching methods, significant improvements on materials engineering and SLM design are needed for demonstrating low-power, multicolor, analog and high-contrast MOSLM devices. In this study, we present design rules and example designs for a high-contrast and large figure-of-merit MOSLM using three-color magnetophotonic crystals (MPC). We demonstrate for the first time, a three-defect MPC capable of simultaneously enhancing Faraday rotation, and high-contrast modulation at three fundamental wavelengths of red, green and blue (RGB) within the same pixel. We show using 2D finite-difference time-domain simulations that bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet films are promising for low-loss and high Faraday rotation MOSLM device in the visible band. Faraday rotation and loss spectra as well as figure-of-merit values are calculated for different magnetophotonic crystals of the form (H/L)p/(D/L)q/(H/L)p. After an optimization of layer thicknesses and MPC configuration, Faraday rotation values were found to be between 20-55° for losses below 20 dB in an overall thickness less than 1.5 µm including three submicron garnet defect layers.

We explore low-loss multilayer dielectric SiO2/HfO2 mirrors which are commonly employed in petawatt-class laser systems. The spatial features of damage sites are precisely characterized, enabling the direct correlation of the observed damage morphology to the location of energy deposition and the corresponding standing-wave electric-field intensities within the layer structure. The results suggest that there are three discrete damage-initiation morphologies arising from distinctly different mechanisms: the first prevailing at laser pulse lengths shorter than about 2.3 ps, while the other two are observed for longer pulses. Modeling of the thermomechanical response of the material to localized laser-energy deposition was performed for each type of damage morphology to better understand the underlying mechanisms of energy deposition and subsequent material response.","Emergence of Topological insulator and Nodal line semi-metal states in XX'Bi (X = Na, K, Rb, Cs; X' = Ca, Sr).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679682,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"In this article, we predict the emergence of non-trivial band topology in the family of XX'Bi compounds having [Formula: see text] (# 189) space group.

Here, we propose three different ways to engineer the band topology to get a non-trivial order: (i) hydrostatic pressure, (ii) biaxial strain (due to epitaxial mismatch), and (iii) doping. Non-triviality is confirmed by investigating bulk band inversion, topological Z2 invariant, surface dispersion and spin texture. Interestingly, some of these compounds also show a three dimensional topological nodal line semi-metal (NLS) state in the absence of spin orbit coupling (SOC). In these NLS phases, the closed loop of band degeneracy in the Brillouin zone lie close to the Fermi level. Moreover, a drumhead like flat surface state is observed on projecting the bulk state on the [001] surface. The inclusion of SOC opens up a small band gap making them behave like a topological insulator.",Alternative Face-on Thin Film Structure of Pentacene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679681,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Pentacene attracts a great deal of attention as a basic material used in organic thin-film transistors for many years. Pentacene is known to form a highly ordered structure in a thin film, in which the molecular long axis aligns perpendicularly to the substrate surface, i.e., end-on orientation. On the other hand, the face-on oriented thin film, where the molecular plane is parallel to the substrate, has never been found on an inert substrate represented by SiO2. As a result, the face-on orientation has long been believed to be generated only on specific substrates such as a metal single crystal. In the present study, the face-on orientation grown on a SiO2 surface has first been identified by means of visible and infrared p-polarized multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry (pMAIRS) together with two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD). The combination of the multiple techniques readily reveals that the face-on phase is definitely realized as the dominant component. The face-on film is obtained when the film growth is kinetically restricted to be prevented from transforming into the thermodynamically stable structure, i.e., the end-on orientation. This concept is useful for controlling the molecular orientation in general organic semiconductor thin films.",Phenotypic analysis of Myo10 knockout (Myo10tm2/tm2) mice lacking full-length (motorized) but not brain-specific headless myosin X.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679680,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"We investigated the physiological functions of Myo10 (myosin X) using Myo10 reporter knockout (Myo10tm2) mice. Full-length (motorized) Myo10 protein was deleted, but the brain-specific headless (Hdl) isoform (Hdl-Myo10) was still expressed in homozygous mutants. In vitro, we confirmed that Hdl-Myo10 does not induce filopodia, but it strongly localized to the plasma membrane independent of the MyTH4-FERM domain. Filopodia-inducing Myo10 is implicated in axon guidance and mice lacking the Myo10 cargo protein DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) have severe commissural defects, whereas MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of isolated brains revealed intact commissures in Myo10tm2/tm2 mice. However, reminiscent of Waardenburg syndrome, a neural crest disorder, Myo10tm2/tm2 mice exhibited pigmentation defects (white belly spots) and simple syndactyly with high penetrance (>95%), and 24% of mutant embryos developed exencephalus, a neural tube closure defect. Furthermore, Myo10tm2/tm2 mice consistently displayed bilateral persistence of the hyaloid vasculature, revealed by MRI and retinal whole-mount preparations. In principle, impaired tissue clearance could contribute to persistence of hyaloid vasculature and syndactyly. However, Myo10-deficient macrophages exhibited no defects in the phagocytosis of apoptotic or IgG-opsonized cells. RNA sequence analysis showed that Myo10 was the most strongly expressed unconventional myosin in retinal vascular endothelial cells and expression levels increased 4-fold between P6 and P15, when vertical sprouting angiogenesis gives rise to deeper layers. Nevertheless, imaging of isolated adult mutant retinas did not reveal vascularization defects. In summary, Myo10 is important for both prenatal (neural tube closure and digit formation) and postnatal development (hyaloid regression, but not retinal vascularization).",Characterization of a novel species of adenovirus from Japanese microbat and role of CXADR as its entry factor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679679,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Recently, bat adenoviruses (BtAdVs) of genus Mastadenovirus have been isolated from various bat species, some of them displaying a wide host range in cell culture. In this study, we isolated two BtAdVs from Japanese wild microbats. While one isolate was classified as Bat mastadenovirus A, the other was phylogenetically independent of other BtAdVs. It was rather related to, but serologically different from, canine adenoviruses. We propose that the latter, isolated from Asian parti-colored bat, should be assigned to a novel species of Bat mastadenovirus. Both isolates replicated in various mammalian cell lines, implying their wide cell tropism. To gain insight into cell tropism of these BtAdVs, we investigated the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR) for virus entry to the cells. We prepared CXADR-knockout canine kidney cells and found that replication of BtAdVs was significantly hampered in these cells. For confirmation, their replication in canine CXADR-addback cells was rescued to the levels with the original cells. We also found that viral replication was corrected in human or bat CXADR-transduced cells to similar levels as in canine CXADR-addback cells. These results suggest that BtAdVs were able to use several mammalian-derived CXADRs as entry factors."

We estimated overall risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death by Cox proportional hazards regression according to quartiles of suPAR, including age, sex, use of lipid-lowering drugs, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, lipids, as well as glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), NT-proBNP, interleukin-6 and high-sensitive CRP as covariates. A total of 2940 participants (age 62.7 ± 10.5years) having a median eGFR of 83.8 mL/min/1.73 m2 were included. The median suPAR concentration was 3010 pg/mL (interquartile range, 2250-3988 pg/mL).

Lowering the temperature can significantly reduce the rate of the switching process and enhance the resident time on the high magnetic state. It stabilizes in the high magnetic state at as low as 30 K. Analyzing the atomic trajectories and the instant electronic structures confirms that these two magnetic states in MD simulations correspond to the magnetic and nonmagnetic states reported in the literatures. Such fluctuations of local magnetic moments are associated with the vertical displacement of the carbon atoms with the unsaturated dangling bond. This study reveals the dynamical correlation between atomic movement and the magnetic switching, and a comprehensive picture of vacancy magnetism in graphene. It has implications in graphene based spintronic devices.",Subcutaneous Inoculation of Echinococcus multilocularis Induces Delayed Regeneration after Partial Hepatectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679666,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the larval stage of echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis), and hepatectomy is the main modality in hepatic AE patients. Liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx) in such patients is challenging, and further investigation is needed. Thus far, knowledge regarding the possible impact of E. multilocularis on liver regeneration after PHx is limited. Herein, a subcutaneous infection model of E. multilocularis was developed in C57 BL/6 mice, and after 3 months, PHx was performed. Plasma and liver samples were harvested under inhalational isofluorane (2%) anaesthesia at designated post-PHx time points (0, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h). The parameters included the future remnant liver/body weight ratio (FLR/BW), liver function tests (AST and ALT) and related cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, Factor V, HMGB1, TGF-β, TSP-1, and TLR4) and proteins (MyD88 and STAT3). To assess the proliferation intensity of hepatocytes, BrdU, Ki67 and PAS staining were carried out in regenerated liver tissue. The FLR/BW in the infected group from 48 h after surgery was lower than that in the control group. The BrdU positive hepatocyte proportions reached their peak at 48 h in the control group and 96 h in the infected group and then gradually decreased. During the first 48 h after surgery, both the AST and ALT levels in the infected group were lower; however, these levels were altered from 96 h after surgery. In the infected group, the concentrations and mRNA expression levels of the pre-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 demonstrated a delayed peak. Moreover, post-operatively, the TGF-β and TSP-1 levels showed high levels in the infected group at each different time-point compared to those in the control group; however, high levels of TGF-β were observed at 96 h in the control group. The MyD88 and STAT3 protein expression levels in the infected group were markedly higher than those in the control group 96 h after surgery. Delayed liver regeneration after PHx was observed in the C57 BL/6 mice with the subcutaneous infection of E. multilocularis in the current study. This phenomenon could be partially explained by the alteration in the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the immunotolerant milieu induced by chronic E. multilocularis infection.","Surface Emitting, Tunable, Mid-Infrared Laser with High Output Power and Stable Output Beam.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679665,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"A reflective outcoupler is demonstrated which can allow for stable surface emission from a quantum cascade laser and has potential for cost-effective wafer-scale manufacturing.

Single mode peak power up to 6.7 W is demonstrated with >6 W available over a 90 cm-1 (215 nm) spectral range. A high quality output beam is realized with a simple, single-layer, anti-reflective coating.

Keeping this fact in mind, a mathematical model is designed to deliberate the 3D magnetohydrodynamic couple stress nanofluid flow with joule heating and viscous dissipation effects past an exponential stretched surface. The analysis is performed keeping in mind the physical effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis combined with convective heat condition. This paper also distinctly introduces a more realistic boundary constraint for nanoliquid flow model. For instance, zero mass flux condition has been instituted for the first time for 3D couple stress nanofluid model as far as the exponential stretched surface is concerned. Self-similar transformations are engaged to obtain a system of ordinary differential equations possessing high nonlinearity from the system of boundary layer partial differential equations. Analytic solution is constructed in the form of series using Homotopy Analysis Method (HAM). Numerically calculated values of Skin friction and local Nusselt number are also given with suitable analysis. Moreover, the influences of sundry parameters on velocity distribution, and heat and mass transfer rates are deliberated and depicted through relevant graphs. The results obtained clearly show that the Biot number and Hartmann number possess increasing effect on temperature distribution. To authenticate our obtained results, a comparison in limiting case is also given.",A Combined Targeted and Whole Exome Sequencing Approach Identified Novel Candidate Genes Involved in Heritable Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679663,Scientific reports,2019 02 08,"The pathogenesis of idiopathic and heritable forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension is still not completely understood, even though several causative genes have been proposed, so that a third of patients remains genetically unresolved. Here we applied a multistep approach to extend identification of the genetic bases of such a disease by searching for novel candidate genes/pathways. Twenty-eight patients belonging to 18 families were screened for BMPR2 mutations and BMPR2-negative samples were tested for 12 additional candidate genes by means of a specific massive parallel sequencing-based assay. Finally, whole exome sequencing was performed on four patients showing no mutations at known disease genes, as well as on their unaffected parents. In addition to EIF2AK4, which has been already suggested to be associated with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, we identified the novel candidate genes ATP13A3, CD248, EFCAB4B, involved in lung vascular remodeling that represent reliable drivers contributing to the disease according to their biological functions/inheritance patterns. Therefore, our results suggest that combining gene panel and whole exome sequencing provides new insights useful for the genetic diagnosis of familial and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as for the identification of biological pathways that will be potentially targeted by new therapeutic strategies.",Adipose fin development and its relation to the evolutionary origins of median fins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679662,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"The dorsal, anal and caudal fins of vertebrates are proposed to have originated by the partitioning and transformation of the continuous median fin fold that is plesiomorphic to chordates. Evaluating this hypothesis has been challenging, because it is unclear how the median fin fold relates to the adult median fins of vertebrates. To understand how new median fins originate, here we study the development and diversity of adipose fins. Phylogenetic mapping shows that in all lineages except Characoidei (Characiformes) adipose fins develop from a domain of the larval median fin fold. To inform how the larva's median fin fold contributes to the adipose fin, we study Corydoras aeneus (Siluriformes). As the fin fold reduces around the prospective site of the adipose fin, a fin spine develops in the fold, growing both proximally and distally, and sensory innervation, which appears to originate from the recurrent ramus of the facial nerve and from dorsal rami of the spinal cord, develops in the adipose fin membrane. Collectively, these data show how a plesiomorphic median fin fold can serve as scaffolding for the evolution and development of novel, individuated median fins, consistent with the median fin fold hypothesis.",Fibrogenic Gene Expression in Hepatic Stellate Cells Induced by HCV and HIV Replication in a Three Cell Co-Culture Model System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679661,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Retrospective studies indicate that co-infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accelerates hepatic fibrosis progression. We have developed a co-culture system (MLH) comprising primary macrophages, hepatic stellate cells (HSC, LX-2), and hepatocytes (Huh-7), permissive for active replication of HCV and HIV, and assessed the effect of these viral infections on the phenotypic changes and fibrogenic gene expression in LX-2 cells. We detected distinct morphological changes in LX-2 cells within 24 hr post-infection with HCV, HIV or HCV/HIV in MLH co-cultures, with migration enhancement phenotypes. Human fibrosis microarrays conducted using LX-2 cell RNA derived from MLH co-culture conditions, with or without HCV and HIV infection, revealed novel insights regarding the roles of these viral infections on fibrogenic gene expression in LX-2 cells. We found that HIV mono-infection in MLH co-culture had no impact on fibrogenic gene expression in LX-2 cells. HCV infection of MLH co-culture resulted in upregulation (>1.9x) of five fibrogenic genes including CCL2, IL1A, IL1B, IL13RA2 and MMP1. These genes were upregulated by HCV/HIV co-infection but in a greater magnitude. Conclusion: Our results indicate that HIV-infected macrophages accelerate hepatic fibrosis during HCV/HIV co-infection by amplifying the expression of HCV-dependent fibrogenic genes in HSC.",The protective value of a defensive display varies with the experience of wild predators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679660,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Predation has driven the evolution of diverse adaptations for defence among prey, and one striking example is the deimatic display. While such displays can resemble, or indeed co-occur with, aposematic 'warning' signals, theory suggests deimatic displays may function independently of predator learning. The survival value of deimatic displays against wild predators has not been tested before. Here we used the mountain katydid Acripeza reticulata to test the efficacy of a putative deimatic display in the wild. Mountain katydids have a complex defence strategy; they are camouflaged at rest, but reveal a striking red-, blue-, and black-banded abdomen when attacked. We presented live katydids to sympatric (experienced) and allopatric (naive) natural predators, the Australian magpie Cracticus tibicen, and observed bird reactions and katydid behaviors and survival during repeated interactions. The efficacy of the katydids' defence differed with predator experience. Their survival was greatest when faced with naïve predators, which provided clear evidence of the protective value of the display. In contrast, katydid survival was consistently less likely when facing experienced predators. Our results suggest that sympatric predators have learned to attack and consume mountain katydids despite their complex defense, and that their post-attack display can be an effective deterrent, particularly against naïve predators. These results suggest that deimatism does not require predator learning to afford protection, but that a predator can learn to expect the display and subsequently avoid it or ignore it. That sympatric predators learn to ignore the defense is a possible explanation for the mountain katydid's counter-intuitive behavior of revealing warning colors only after tactile stimuli from predator attack.",Tunable Backward Terahertz-wave Parametric Oscillation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679659,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Backward optical parametric oscillation has attracted attention for cavityless spectral narrowband generation based on perfect photon conversion. Few demonstrations have shown its potential from the aspect of nonlinear photonics; therefore, the mechanisms of momentum conservation among interacting light waves have been concealed by the restricted configuration under the phase-matching condition of periodically poled structures. Here, we unveil a tunable mechanism in the terahertz region by active control of the phase-matching condition. The tunability of backward terahertz-wave parametric oscillation is investigated using a quasi-collinear phase-matching model and its frequency range from the sub-terahertz to terahertz region is identified. Transform-limited terahertz-wave pulse is achieved simply by installing a device on the pump propagating line with no cavity. Moreover, the cascading terahertz-wave generation enhances the photon conversion efficiency, thus making nonlinear optics and its applications more promising. The results highlight new capabilities for using modern ferroelectric materials and encourage further research on nonlinear optics."

Compared to canonical microRNAs, mirtrons are less conserved and hard to be identified. Except stringent annotations based on experiments, many in silico computational methods have be developed to classify miRNAs. Although several machine learning classifiers delivered high classification performance, all the predictors depended heavily on the selection of calculated features. Here, we introduced nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pre-miRNAs classification. By using ""one-hot"" encoding and padding, pre-miRNAs were converted into matrixes with the same shape. The convolution and max-pooling operations can automatically extract features from pre-miRNAs sequences. Evaluation on test dataset showed that our models had a satisfactory performance. Our investigation showed that it was feasible to apply CNNs to extract features from biological sequences. Since there are many hyperparameters can be tuned in CNNs, we believe that the performance of nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks can be greatly improved in the future.",High Serum Uric Acid is Highly Associated with a Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction Rather than Increased Plasma B-type Natriuretic Peptide in Patients with Cardiovascular Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679647,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"High serum uric acid (UA) has been reported to be associated with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction; however, the relationship between UA and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a sensitive biomarker of heart failure, is still unclear. This study investigated their relationship to provide an accurate assessment of high UA. The study patients consisted of 3,077 subjects who underwent cardiac catheterization because of various cardiovascular disorders. Since the explanatory factors of multiple regression analysis were mostly confounding with each other, subgroup analysis was performed by quartering the study population using the respective risk factors and by covariance structure analysis. This analysis revealed that UA was almost always well associated with a reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF), but generally not with BNP. UA was significantly associated with BNP in lean aged females, but not in obese adolescent males, although LVEF was significantly reduced in response to a high UA in both groups. A high UA is a direct risk factor for cardiac dysfunction from the perspective of BNP; however, augmentation of BNP in response to a high UA would likely be restricted among obese adolescent males. On the other hand, the observed LV systolic dysfunction, such as LVEF, reflects a high UA on an almost constant basis.",Immunoinformatic and systems biology approaches to predict and validate peptide vaccines against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679646,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4 (HHV-4), is a member of the Herpesviridae family and causes infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt's lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Even in the United States of America, the situation is alarming, as EBV affects 95% of the young population between 35 and 40 years of age. In this study, both linear and conformational B-cell epitopes as well as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes were predicted by using the ElliPro and NetCTL.1.2 webservers for EBV proteins (GH, GL, GB, GN, GM, GP42 and GP350). Molecular modelling tools were used to predict the 3D coordinates of peptides, and these peptides were then docked against the MHC molecules to obtain peptide-MHC complexes. Studies of their post-docking interactions helped to select potential candidates for the development of peptide vaccines. Our results predicted a total of 58 T-cell epitopes of EBV;  where the most potential were selected based on their TAP, MHC binding and C-terminal Cleavage score. The top most peptides were subjected to MD simulation and stability analysis. Validation of our predicted epitopes using a 0.45 µM concentration was carried out by using a systems biology approach. Our results suggest a panel of epitopes that could be used to immunize populations to protect against multiple diseases caused by EBV.",Attenuation of murine sclerodermatous models by the selective S1P1 receptor modulator cenerimod.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679645,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid mediator, regulates lymphocyte migration between lymphoid tissue and blood. Furthermore, S1P participates in several physiological phenomena including angiogenesis, inflammation, immune regulation, and neurotransmitter release. Moreover, S1P/S1P receptor signaling involves in systemic sclerosis (SSc) pathogenesis. This study aimed to investigate whether the selective S1P1 receptor modulator cenerimod attenuates murine sclerodermatous models. Cenerimod was orally administered to murine sclerodermatous chronic graft versus host disease (Scl-cGVHD) mice, either from day 0 to 42 or day 22 to 42 after bone marrow transplantation. Bleomycin-induced SSc model mice were administered cenerimod from day 0 to 28. Early cenerimod administration inhibited, and delayed cenerimod administration attenuated skin and lung fibrosis in Scl-cGVHD mice. Cenerimod suppressed the infiltration of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD11b+ cells into the inflamed skin of Scl-cGVHD mice as opposed to control mice. In contrast, cenerimod increased the frequency of regulatory T cells in the spleen and skin of Scl-cGVHD mice. Additionally, cenerimod attenuated the mRNA expression of extracellular matrix and fibrogenic cytokines in the skin. Furthermore, cenerimod attenuated bleomycin-induced fibrosis in the skin and lung. Hence, the selective S1P1 receptor modulator cenerimod is a promising candidate for treating patients with SSc and Scl-cGVHD.",Development of a peptide-siRNA nanocomplex targeting NF- κB for efficient cartilage delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679644,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Delivery of therapeutic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in an effective dose to articular cartilage is very challenging as the cartilage dense extracellular matrix renders the chondrocytes inaccessible, even to intra-articular injections. Herein, we used a self-assembling peptidic nanoparticle (NP) platform featuring a cell penetrating peptide complexed to NF-κB p65 siRNA. We show that it efficiently and deeply penetrated human cartilage to deliver its siRNA cargo up to a depth of at least 700 μm. To simulate osteoarthritis in vitro, human articular cartilage explants were placed in culture and treated with IL-1β, a cytokine with known cartilage catabolic and pro-inflammatory effects. Exposure of peptide-siRNA NP to cartilage explants markedly suppressed p65 activation, an effect that persisted up to 3 weeks after an initial 48 h exposure to NP and in the presence of continuous IL-1β stimulation. Suppression of IL-1β-induced p65 activity attenuated chondrocyte apoptosis and maintained cartilage homeostasis. These findings confirm our previous in vivo studies in a murine model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and suggest that the ability of peptide-siRNA NP to specifically modulate NF-κB pathway, a central regulator of the inflammatory responses in chondrocytes, may potentially mitigate the progression of cartilage degeneration.",Metabolic Syndrome and Incidence of Laryngeal Cancer: A Nationwide Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679643,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"It is unknown whether the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects the incidence of laryngeal cancer. The aim of this national population-based retrospective study was to analyze the relationship between MetS and the incidence of laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer (ICD-10: C32) between 2009 and 2010 were retrospectively identified and tracked until 2015 using the Korean Health Insurance claims database. During the seven-year follow-up period, 5,322 subjects were newly diagnosed with larynx cancer. The mean age of people with laryngeal cancer was much higher than those without (63.29 vs. 47.7 years, p < 0.0001), and the incidence of larynx cancer in men was much higher than that in women (93.16% vs. 6.84%, p < 0.0001). Age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise-adjusted hazard ratios indicated that participants with MetS had a 1.13-fold higher hazard of having larynx cancer than those without MetS. The number of MetS components was a strong risk factor for laryngeal cancer with a higher risk estimate of this cancer in both ex- and current smokers as well as people who have never smoked. MetS was found to be an independent risk factor for the incidence of laryngeal cancer. In Korea, MetS and its components are significantly associated with the development of laryngeal cancer.",Ag fiber/IZO Composite Electrodes: Improved Chemical and Thermal Stability and Uniform Light Emission in Flexible Organic Light-Emitting Diodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679642,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Electrospun metal fiber is a promising flexible transparent electrode owing to its extremely long length and facile fabrication process. However, metal-fiber electrodes have problems with chemical and thermal stability and nonuniform emission in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) at low luminance. In this study, we proposed a Ag fiber/IZO composite electrode with high stability. Ag fiber/IZO composite electrodes exhibited chemical and thermal stability. In addition, it was demonstrated that the OLED with the Ag fiber/IZO composite electrode operated stably, and the uniform emission of the OLED with metal-fiber electrodes improved by using highly conductive IZO film.",Mammalian plasma fetuin-B is a selective inhibitor of ovastacin and meprin metalloproteinases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679641,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Vertebrate fetuins are multi-domain plasma-proteins of the cystatin-superfamily. Human fetuin-A is also known as AHSG, α2-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein. Gene-knockout in mice identified fetuin-A as essential for calcified-matrix-metabolism and bone-mineralization. Fetuin-B deficient mice, on the other hand, are female infertile due to zona pellucida 'hardening' caused by the metalloproteinase ovastacin in unfertilized oocytes. In wildtype mice fetuin-B inhibits the activity of ovastacin thus maintaining oocytes fertilizable. Here we asked, if fetuins affect further proteases as might be expected from their evolutionary relation to single-domain-cystatins, known as proteinase-inhibitors. We show that fetuin-A is not an inhibitor of any tested protease. In stark contrast, the closely related fetuin-B selectively inhibits astacin-metalloproteinases such as meprins and ovastacin, but not astacins of the tolloid-subfamily, nor any other proteinase. The analysis of fetuin-B expressed in various mammalian cell types, insect cells, and truncated fish-fetuin expressed in bacteria, showed that the cystatin-like domains alone are necessary and sufficient for inhibition. This report highlights fetuin-B as a specific antagonist of ovastacin and meprin-metalloproteinases. Control of ovastacin was shown to be indispensable for female fertility. Meprin inhibition, on the other hand, renders fetuin-B a potential key-player in proteolytic networks controlling angiogenesis, immune-defense, extracellular-matrix-assembly and general cell-signaling, with implications for inflammation, fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.",Off-target based drug repurposing opportunities for tivantinib in acute myeloid leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679640,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"GSK3α has been identified as a new target in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, most GSK3 inhibitors lack specificity for GSK3α over GSK3β and other kinases. We have previously shown in lung cancer cells that GSK3α and to a lesser extent GSK3β are inhibited by the advanced clinical candidate tivantinib (ARQ197), which was designed as a MET inhibitor. Thus, we hypothesized that tivantinib would be an effective therapy for the treatment of AML. Here, we show that tivantinib has potent anticancer activity across several AML cell lines and primary patient cells. Tivantinib strongly induced apoptosis, differentiation and G2/M cell cycle arrest and caused less undesirable stabilization of β-catenin compared to the pan-GSK3 inhibitor LiCl. Subsequent drug combination studies identified the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 to synergize with tivantinib while cytarabine combination with tivantinib was antagonistic. Interestingly, the addition of ABT-199 to tivantinib completely abrogated tivantinib induced β-catenin stabilization. Tivantinib alone, or in combination with ABT-199, downregulated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-XL levels, which likely contribute to the observed synergy. Importantly, tivantinib as single agent or in combination with ABT-199 significantly inhibited the colony forming capacity of primary patient AML bone marrow mononuclear cells. In summary, tivantinib is a novel GSK3α/β inhibitor that potently kills AML cells and tivantinib single agent or combination therapy with ABT-199 may represent attractive new therapeutic opportunities for AML.",Finding and analysing the minimum set of driver nodes required to control multilayer networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679639,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"It is difficult to control multilayer networks in situations with real-world complexity. Here, we first define the multilayer control problem in terms of the minimum dominating set (MDS) controllability framework and mathematically demonstrate that simple formulas can be used to estimate the size of the minimum dominating set in multilayer (MDSM) complex networks. Second, we develop a new algorithm that efficiently identifies the MDSM in up to 6 layers, with several thousand nodes in each layer network. Interestingly, the findings reveal that the MDSM size for similar networks does not significantly differ from that required to control a single network. This result opens future directions for controlling, for example, multiple species by identifying a common set of enzymes or proteins for drug targeting. We apply our methods to 70 genome-wide metabolic networks across major plant lineages, unveiling some relationships between controllability in multilayer networks and metabolic functions at the genome scale."

Phosphorus limitation exists in many soils since a high proportion of soil phosphorus is stored in unavailable forms for plants, such as bound to iron minerals or stabilized organic matter. This is in spite of soils having a high amount of total soil phosphorus. The feasibility of silicon to mobilize phosphorus from strong binding sites of iron minerals has been shown for marine sediments but is less well studied in soils. Here we tested the effect of silicon on phosphorus mobilization for 143 Artic soils (representing contrasting soil characteristics), which have not been affected by agriculture or other anthropogenic management practices. In agreement with marine studies, silicon availabilities were significantly positive correlated to phosphorus mobilization in these soils. Laboratory experiments confirmed that silicon addition significantly increases phosphorus mobilization, by mobilizing Fe(II)-P phases from mineral surfaces. Silicon addition increased also soil respiration in phosphorus deficient soils. We conclude that silicon is a key component regulating mobilization of phosphorous in Arctic soils, suggesting that this may also be important for sustainable management of phosphorus availability in soils in general.",Screening Pyridine Derivatives against Human Hydrogen Sulfide-synthesizing Enzymes by Orthogonal Methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679627,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Biosynthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a key signalling molecule in human (patho)physiology, is mostly accomplished by the human enzymes cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST). Several lines of evidence have shown a close correlation between increased H2S production and human diseases, such as several cancer types and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Identifying compounds selectively and potently inhibiting the human H2S-synthesizing enzymes may therefore prove beneficial for pharmacological applications. Here, the human enzymes CBS, CSE and MST were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and thirty-one pyridine derivatives were synthesized and screened for their ability to bind and inhibit these enzymes. Using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), circular dichroism spectropolarimetry (CD), and activity assays based on fluorimetric and colorimetric H2S detection, two compounds (C30 and C31) sharing structural similarities were found to weakly inhibit both CBS and CSE: 1 mM C30 inhibited these enzymes by approx. 50% and 40%, respectively, while 0.5 mM C31 accounted for CBS and CSE inhibition by approx. 40% and 60%, respectively. This work, while presenting a robust methodological platform for screening putative inhibitors of the human H2S-synthesizing enzymes, highlights the importance of employing complementary methodologies in compound screenings.",Elucidation of an intrinsic parameter for evaluating the electrical quality of graphene flakes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679626,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"A test method for evaluating the quality of graphene flakes, such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene nanopowder (GNP), was developed in this study. The pelletizer was selected for a sampling tool, which enables us to formulate the flake sample as a measurable sample. Various parameters were measured from the pelletized sample in order to elucidate the best parameter for representing the quality of the graphene flakes in terms of their electrical properties. Based on the analysis of 4-probe measurement data on the pelletized sample, the best intrinsic parameter is volume resistivity (or volume conductivity) rather than resistivity (or conductivity). Additionally, the possible modification of a sample before and after the pressurization was investigated by electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. No significant modification was observed. The volume conductivity in the two types of the graphene was different from their individual conductivities by one order of magnitude. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy measurements, the volume conductivity of the graphene flake samples was governed by the oxygen content in the sample. Our achievements will promote the effective use of powder-type graphene products for further applications.",Whole Transcriptome Analysis of Renal Intercalated Cells Predicts Lipopolysaccharide Mediated Inhibition of Retinoid X Receptor alpha Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679625,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"The renal collecting duct consists of intercalated cells (ICs) and principal cells (PCs). We have previously demonstrated that collecting ducts have a role in the innate immune defense of the kidney. Transcriptomics is an important tool used to enhance systems-level understanding of cell biology. However, transcriptomics performed on whole kidneys provides limited insight of collecting duct cell gene expression, because these cells comprise a small fraction of total kidney cells. Recently we generated reporter mouse models to enrich collecting duct specific PC and ICs and reported targeted gene expression of anti-microbial peptide genes. Here we report transcriptomics on enriched ICs and PCs and performed a pilot study sequencing four single ICs. We identified 3,645 genes with increased relative expression in ICs compared to non-ICs. In comparison to non-PCs, 2,088 genes had higher relative expression in PCs. IC associated genes included the innate interleukin 1 receptor, type 1 and the antimicrobial peptide(AMP) adrenomedullin. The top predicted canonical pathway for enriched ICs was lipopolysaccharide/Interleukin 1 mediated inhibition of Retinoid X Receptor alpha function and decreased Retinoid X Receptor expression was confirmed to occur 1-hour post experimental murine UTI in ICs but not in non-ICs.",Liposome-based transfection enhances RNAi and CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis in non-model nematode systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679624,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Nematodes belong to one of the most diverse animal phyla. However, functional genomic studies in nematodes, other than in a few species, have often been limited in their reliability and success. Here we report that by combining liposome-based technology with microinjection, we were able to establish a wide range of genomic techniques in the newly described nematode genus Auanema. The method also allowed heritable changes in dauer larvae of Auanema, despite the immaturity of the gonad at the time of the microinjection. As proof of concept for potential functional studies in other nematode species, we also induced RNAi in the free-living nematode Pristionchus pacificus and targeted the human parasite Strongyloides stercoralis.",Propagule pressure and hunting pressure jointly determine genetic evolution in insular populations of a global frog invader.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679623,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Islands are often considered to be more susceptible to biological invasions and to suffer greater impacts from invaders than mainland areas, and this difference is generally attributed to differences in species introductions, ecological factors or human activities between islands and mainland areas. Genetic variation, as a good estimate of evolutionary potential, can influence the invasion process and impacts of alien species. However, few studies have compared the genetic diversity of alien species between islands and a corresponding mainland. Here, we examined the genetic variation and differentiation in feral populations (30 sampled individuals/population) of a globally invasive species (the American bullfrog, Lithobates catesbeianus) that was extensively farmed on 14 islands in the Zhoushan Archipelago of China and in three nearby regions on the mainland. We quantified the relative importance of propagule pressure and hunting pressures on the genetic variation of bullfrog populations and found that insular populations have greater genetic variation than their mainland counterparts. Although genetic differentiation between the populations was observed, no evidence of recent bottlenecks or population expansion in any of the tested population was found. Our results suggest that the propagule pressures of bullfrogs escaping from farms, multiple releases and hunting pressure influence the genetic variation among bullfrog populations. These results might have important implications for understanding the establishment and evolution of alien species on islands and for the management of invasive species.",Efficient coralline algal psbA mini barcoding and High Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis using a simple custom DNA preparation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679622,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Coralline algae form extensive maerl and rhodolith habitats that support a rich biodiversity. Calcium carbonate harvesting as well as trawling activities threatens this ecosystem. Eleven species were recorded so far as maerl-forming in NE Atlantic, but identification based on morphological characters is unreliable. As for most red algae, we now use molecular characters to resolve identification of these taxa. However, obtaining DNA sequences requires time and resource demanding methods. The purpose of our study was to improve methods for achieving simple DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing and sequence analysis to allow robust identification of maerl species and other coralline algae. Our novel and easy DNA preparation method for coralline algae was of sufficient quality for qPCR amplification and sequencing of all 47 tested samples. The new psbA qPCR assay successfully amplified a 350 bp fragment identifying six species and uncovering two new Operational Taxonomic Units. Molecular results were corroborated with anatomical examination using i.e. scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the qPCR assay was coupled with High Resolution Melt analysis that successfully differentiated the closely related species Lithothamnion erinaceum and L. cf. glaciale. This DNA preparation and qPCR technique should vitalize coralline research by reducing time and cost associated with molecular systematics.",Susceptibility of Escherichia coli O157:H7 grown at low temperatures to the krypton-chlorine excilamp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679621,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"This study was conducted to investigate the resistance of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to 222-nm krypton-chlorine(KrCl) excilamp and 254-nm low-pressure Hg lamp (LP lamp) treatment according to growth temperature. As growth temperature decreased, lag time of E. coli O157:H7 significantly increased while the growth rate significantly decreased. Regardless of growth temperature, the KrCl excilamp showed higher disinfection capacity compared to the LP lamp at stationary growth phase. KrCl excilamp treatment showed significantly higher reduction as growth temperature decreased. Conversely, reduction levels according to growth temperature were not significantly different when the pathogen was subjected to LP lamp treatment. Inactivation mechanisms were evaluated by the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay and SYBR green assay, and we confirmed that lipid oxdiation capacity following KrCl excilamp treatment increased as growth temperature decreased, which was significantly higher than that of LP lamp treated samples regardless of growth temperature. DNA damage level was significantly higher for LP Hg lamp treated samples compared to those subjected to the KrCl excilamp, but no significant difference pursuant to growth temperature was observed. At the transcriptional level, gene expression related to several metabolic pathways was significantly higher for the pathogen grown at 15 °C compared that of 37 °C, enabling it to adapt and survive at low temperature, and membrane lipid composition became altered to ensure membrane fluidity. Consequently, resistance of E. coli O157:H7 to the KrCl excilamp decreased as growth temperature decreased because the ratio of unsaturated fatty acid composition increased at low growth temperature resulting in higher lipid oxidation levels. These results indicate that KrCl excilamp treatment should be determined carefully considering the growth temperature of E. coli O157:H7.",A Ras destabilizer KYA1797K overcomes the resistance of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor in KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679620,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as erlotinib and gefitinib are widely used for treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but they have shown limited efficacy in an unselected population of patients. The KRAS mutations, which are identified in approximately 20% of NSCLC patients, have shown to be associated with the resistance to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Currently, there is no clinically available targeted therapy which can effectively inhibit NSCLC tumors harboring KRAS mutations. This study aims to show the effectiveness of KYA1797K, a small molecule which revealed anti-cancer effect in colorectal cancer by destabilizing Ras via inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, for the treatment of KRAS-mutated NSCLC. While erlotinib fail to have anti-transforming effect in NSCLC cell lines harboring KRAS mutations, KYA1797K effectively inhibited the Ras-ERK pathway in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cell lines. As a result, KYA1797K treatment suppressed the growth and transformation of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells and also induced apoptosis. Furthermore, KYA1797K effectively inhibited Kras-driven tumorigenesis in the KrasLA2 mouse model by suppressing the Ras-ERK pathway. The destabilization of Ras via inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a potential therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutated NSCLC that is resistant to EGFR TKI.",Application of the Transcriptional Disease Signature (TDSs) to Screen Melanoma-Effective Compounds in a Small Fish Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679619,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Cell culture and protein target-based compound screening strategies, though broadly utilized in selecting candidate compounds, often fail to eliminate candidate compounds with non-target effects and/or safety concerns until late in the drug developmental process. Phenotype screening using intact research animals is attractive because it can help identify small molecule candidate compounds that have a high probability of proceeding to clinical use. Most FDA approved, first-in-class small molecules were identified from phenotypic screening. However, phenotypic screening using rodent models is labor intensive, low-throughput, and very expensive. As a novel alternative for small molecule screening, we have been developing gene expression disease profiles, termed the Transcriptional Disease Signature (TDS), as readout of small molecule screens for therapeutic molecules. In this concept, compounds that can reverse, or otherwise affect known disease-associated gene expression patterns in whole animals may be rapidly identified for more detailed downstream direct testing of their efficacy and mode of action. To establish proof of concept for this screening strategy, we employed a transgenic strain of a small aquarium fish, medaka (Oryzias latipes), that overexpresses the malignant melanoma driver gene xmrk, a mutant egfr gene, that is driven by a pigment cell-specific mitf promoter. In this model, melanoma develops with 100% penetrance. Using the transgenic medaka malignant melanoma model, we established a screening system that employs the NanoString nCounter platform to quantify gene expression within custom sets of TDS gene targets that we had previously shown to exhibit differential transcription among xmrk-transgenic and wild-type medaka. Compound-modulated gene expression was identified using an internet-accessible custom-built data processing pipeline. The effect of a given drug on the entire TDS profile was estimated by comparing compound-modulated genes in the TDS using an activation Z-score and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics. TDS gene probes were designed that target common signaling pathways that include proliferation, development, toxicity, immune function, metabolism and detoxification. These pathways may be utilized to evaluate candidate compounds for potential favorable, or unfavorable, effects on melanoma-associated gene expression. Here we present the logistics of using medaka to screen compounds, as well as, the development of a user-friendly NanoString data analysis pipeline to support feasibility of this novel TDS drug-screening strategy."

Volumes of weighed fossil Globigerina bulloides shells were accurately determined using X-ray Computer Tomography and were combined with water density reconstructions from Mg/Ca and δ18O measurements to estimate the buoyancy force exerted on each shell. After assessment of dissolution effects, the resulting relationship between shell mass and buoyancy suggests that heavier shells would need to be precipitated in glacial climates in order for these organisms to remain at their optimum living depth, and counterbalance the increased buoyant force of a denser, glacial ocean. Furthermore, the reanalysis of bibliographic data allowed the determination of a relationship between G. bulloides shell mass and ocean density, which introduces implications of a negative feedback mechanism for the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the oceans.",Ag(I) and Au(III) Mercaptobenzothiazole complexes induced apoptotic cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679607,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) complexes of Ag(I) and Au(III) were synthesized by wet chemical method.

The TUNEL assay studies of Ag(I)MBT and Au(III)MBT complexes on A549 cell line indicated induced apoptosis in the cells. TUNEL assay showed 60% cell viability for Ag(I)MBT whereas 80% for Au(III)MBT. Thus Ag(I)MBT can induce cell apoptosis in cells at a higher rate than Au(III)MBT. Therefore these complexes studied here can be a viable option as anti - proliferating agent.",Optimal composition of the poly(triarylamine)-based polymer composite to maximize photorefractive performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679606,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"A holographic display system requires the external diffraction efficiency to be greater than 10% and four orders of magnitude of sensitivity for practical usage. To achieve such requirements, the photorefractive (PR) performance of PR composite based on poly[bis(2,4,6-trimethylpheneyl)amine] (PTAA) has been investigated. In the present report, the change of the content of PTAA as a photoconductive polymer, (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)diphenylamine (TAA) as a photoconductive plasticizer, and second trap agent bathophenanthroline (BPhen) reasonably optimized the PR response time and external diffraction efficiency. High sensitivity of 1851 cm2 J-1 with response time of 494 μs and external diffraction efficiency of 23.9% were achieved at 532 nm and 60 V μm-1 by reducing the content of PTAA and increasing the contents of TAA and BPhen. Decreasing the amount of PTAA and increasing the contents of TAA and BPhen lowered the absorption coefficient, resulting in the high external diffraction efficiency. The narrower distribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) for PTAA/TAA (43.5/20 and 33.5/30) also contributed to the shorter PR response time of hundreds of microseconds.",Interactions of HLA-DR and Topoisomerase I Epitope Modulated Genetic Risk for Systemic Sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679605,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The association of systemic sclerosis with anti-Topoisomerase 1 antibody (ATASSc) with specific alleles of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR has been observed among various ethnics. The anti-Topoisomerase 1 antibody is a common autoantibody in SSc with diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, which is one of the clinical subtypes of SSc. On the other hand, an immunodominant peptide of topoisomerase 1 (Top1) self-protein (residues 349-368) was reported to have strong association with ATASSc. In this study, molecular dynamics simulation was performed on the complexes of Top1 peptide with various HLA-DR subtypes divided into ATASSc-associated alleles (HLA-DRB1*08:02, HLA-DRB1*11:01 and HLA-DRB1*11:04), suspected allele (HLA-DRB5*01:02), and non-associated allele (HLA-DRB1*01:01). The unique interaction for each system was compared to the others in terms of dynamical behaviors, binding free energies and solvation effects. Our results showed that three HLA-DR/Top1 complexes of ATASSc association mostly exhibited high protein stability and increased binding efficiency without solvent interruption, in contrast to non-association. The suspected case (HLA-DRB5*01:02) binds Top1 as strongly as the ATASSc association case, which implied a highly possible risk for ATASSc development. This finding might support ATASSc development mechanism leading to a guideline for the treatment and avoidance of pathogens like Top1 self-peptide risk for ATASSc.",Effects of the long-term storage of human fecal microbiota samples collected in RNAlater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679604,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The adequate storage of fecal samples from clinical trials is crucial if analyses are to be performed later and in long-term studies. However, it is unknown whether the composition of the microbiota is preserved during long-term stool storage (>1 year). We therefore evaluated the influence of long-term storage on the microbiota composition of human stool samples collected in RNAlater and stored for approximately five years at -80 °C. We compared storage effects on stool samples from 24 subjects with the effects of technical variation due to different sequencing runs and biological variation (intra- and inter-subject), in another 101 subjects, based on alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and taxonomic composition. We also evaluated the impact of initial alpha-diversity and fecal microbiota composition on beta-diversity instability upon storage. Overall, long-term stool storage at -80 °C had only limited effects on the microbiota composition of human feces. The magnitude of changes in alpha- and beta- diversity and taxonomic composition after long-term storage was similar to inter-sequencing variation and smaller than biological variation (both intra- and inter-subject). The likelihood of fecal samples being affected by long-term storage correlated with the initial relative abundance of some genera and tend to be affected by initial taxonomic richness.",Organic-Inorganic Solid-State Hybridization with High-Strength and Anti-Hydrolysis Interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679603,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Organic-inorganic material hybridization at the solid-state level is indispensable for the integration of IoT applications, but still remains a challenging issue. Existing bonding strategies in the field of electronic packaging tend to employ vacuum or ultrahigh temperature; however, these can cause process complications and material deterioration. Here we report an easy-to-tune method to achieve hybrid bonding at the solid-state level and under the ambient atmosphere. Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV)-induced reorganization with ethanol was used to develop hydroxyl-carrying alkyl chains through coordinatively-bonded carboxylate onto aluminum, whereas numerous hydroxyl-carrying alkyls were created on polyimide. The triggering of dehydration through these hydroxyls by merely heating at 150 °C for a few minutes produced robust organic-inorganic reticulated complexes within the aluminum/polyimide interface. The as-bonded aluminum/polyimide interface possessed an superior fracture energy of (2.40 ± 0.36) × 103 (J/m2) compared with aluminum and polyimide matrices themselves, which was mainly attributed to crack deflection due to the nano-grains of inorganic-organic reticulated complexes. The interfacial adhesion was successfully kept after humidity test, which was contributed by those anti-hydrolytic carboxylates. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time organic-inorganic bonding at the solid-state level was achieved using the ethanol-assisted VUV (E-VUV) process, a strategy which should be applicable to a diversity of plastics and metals with native oxides.",Can anterior repositioning splint effectively treat temporomandibular joint disc displacement?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679602,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The aim of this study was to determine whether anterior repositioning splint (ARS) can effectively treat temporomandibular joint (TMJ) anterior disc displacement with reduction (DDwR) in juvenile Class II patients. This study investigated disc repositioning clinically and through use of MRI with 12-month follow up. Patients with skeletal Class II malocclusions and DDwR diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were treated with ARS. The efficacy of ARS was assessed clinically and by means of MRI before treatment (T0), immediately after bite registration (T1), at the end of treatment (T2), and at 12 months after functional appliance treatment (T3). Improvement in TMJ pain, TMJ noises, and range of mandibular movement were assessed. MRI evaluation was based on disc-condylar relationship in parasagittal images. Seventy-two juvenile patients with 91 joints were included in this study. The average age was 15.7 years old (range, 10-20 years) at first visit. There were statistically significant reductions in TMJ pain, disability in daily life and TMJ clicking (P < 0.01). MRI at T2 indicated that the success rate was 92.31% (84/91), but decreased to 72.53% (66/91) at T3. The unsuccessful splint disc capture was mainly observed in late adolescence, especially over 18 years old. Using MRI results as the gold standard, we found that clinical assessment had an accuracy rate of 75.82% at 12-month follow-up. In conclusion, although success rate for ARS treatment decreased over time, both clinical findings and MRI examination indicate that the ARS is relatively effective in repositioning the DDwR, especially for patients in early puberty. However, further and larger studies are needed to evaluate the outcome with ARS.",DNA damage and transcriptional regulation in iPSC-derived neurons from Ataxia Telangiectasia patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679601,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T) is neurodegenerative syndrome caused by inherited mutations inactivating the ATM kinase, a master regulator of the DNA damage response (DDR). What makes neurons vulnerable to ATM loss remains unclear. In this study we assessed on human iPSC-derived neurons whether the abnormal accumulation of DNA-Topoisomerase 1 adducts (Top1ccs) found in A-T impairs transcription elongation, thus favoring neurodegeneration. Furthermore, whether neuronal activity-induced immediate early genes (IEGs), a process involving the formation of DNA breaks, is affected by ATM deficiency. We found that Top1cc trapping by CPT induces an ATM-dependent DDR as well as an ATM-independent induction of IEGs and repression especially of long genes. As revealed by nascent RNA sequencing, transcriptional elongation and recovery were found to proceed with the same rate, irrespective of gene length and ATM status. Neuronal activity induced by glutamate receptors stimulation, or membrane depolarization with KCl, triggered a DDR and expression of IEGs, the latter independent of ATM. In unperturbed A-T neurons a set of genes (FN1, DCN, RASGRF1, FZD1, EOMES, SHH, NR2E1) implicated in the development, maintenance and physiology of central nervous system was specifically downregulated, underscoring their potential involvement in the neurodegenerative process in A-T patients.",Can enzyme proximity accelerate cascade reactions?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679600,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The last decade has seen an exponential expansion of interest in conjugating multiple enzymes of cascades in close proximity to each other, with the overarching goal being to accelerate the overall reaction rate. However, some evidence has emerged that there is no effect of proximity channeling on the reaction velocity of the popular GOx-HRP cascade, particularly in the presence of a competing enzyme (catalase). Herein, we rationalize these experimental results quantitatively. We show that, in general, proximity channeling can enhance reaction velocity in the presence of competing enzymes, but in steady state a significant enhancement can only be achieved for diffusion-limited reactions or at high concentrations of competing enzymes. We provide simple equations to estimate the effect of channeling quantitatively and demonstrate that proximity can have a more pronounced effect under crowding conditions in vivo, particularly that crowding can enhance the overall rates of channeled cascade reactions.",Assessing robustness of radiomic features by image perturbation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679599,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Image features need to be robust against differences in positioning, acquisition and segmentation to ensure reproducibility. Radiomic models that only include robust features can be used to analyse new images, whereas models with non-robust features may fail to predict the outcome of interest accurately. Test-retest imaging is recommended to assess robustness, but may not be available for the phenotype of interest. We therefore investigated 18 combinations of image perturbations to determine feature robustness, based on noise addition (N), translation (T), rotation (R), volume growth/shrinkage (V) and supervoxel-based contour randomisation (C). Test-retest and perturbation robustness were compared for combined total of 4032 morphological, statistical and texture features that were computed from the gross tumour volume in two cohorts with computed tomography imaging: I) 31 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; II): 19 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Robustness was determined using the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the intraclass correlation coefficient (1, 1). Features with CI ≥ 0:90 were considered robust. The NTCV, TCV, RNCV and RCV perturbation chain produced similar results and identified the fewest false positive robust features (NSCLC: 0.2-0.9%; HNSCC: 1.7-1.9%). Thus, these perturbation chains may be used as an alternative to test-retest imaging to assess feature robustness."

These differences are often attributed to GA or familial socio-economic status (SES). However, additional factors are increasingly recognized as likely contributors. Parental stress after a child's premature birth can present as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and can in turn reinforce difficulties in parent-child interaction pattern. Following a longitudinal design, we studied the interplay between a premature child's perinatal history and maternal PTSD symptoms on intelligence abilities assessed at 11 years of age. Thirty-three very preterm and 21 full-term mother-children dyads partook in the study. Children's perinatal risk was evaluated at hospital discharge, maternal PTSD symptoms were assessed when the children were 18 months old, and children's IQ was measured at 11 years old. IQ was significantly lower for preterm than full-term children, without reliable influences from perinatal risk scores. However, lower maternal PTSD symptoms predicted higher IQ in preterm children. This preliminary study highlights the importance detecting maternal PTSD symptoms after a preterm birth and suggests interventions should target reducing maternal PTSD symptoms during early childhood to enhance very preterm children's intelligence development.",The bacterial MrpORP is a novel Mrp/NBP35 protein involved in iron-sulfur biogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679587,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Despite recent advances in understanding the biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) proteins, most studies focused on aerobic bacteria as model organisms. Accordingly, multiple players have been proposed to participate in the Fe-S delivery step to apo-target proteins, but critical gaps exist in the knowledge of Fe-S proteins biogenesis in anaerobic organisms. Mrp/NBP35 ATP-binding proteins are a subclass of the soluble P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase superfamily (P-loop NTPase) known to bind and transfer Fe-S clusters in vitro. Here, we report investigations of a novel atypical two-domain Mrp/NBP35 ATP-binding protein named MrpORP associating a P-loop NTPase domain with a dinitrogenase iron-molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis domain (Di-Nase). Characterization of full length MrpORP, as well as of its two domains, showed that both domains bind Fe-S clusters. We provide in vitro evidence that the P-loop NTPase domain of the MrpORP can efficiently transfer its Fe-S cluster to apo-target proteins of the ORange Protein (ORP) complex, suggesting that this novel protein is involved in the maturation of these Fe-S proteins. Last, we showed for the first time, by fluorescence microscopy imaging a polar localization of a Mrp/NBP35 protein.","Prominent action of butyrate over β-hydroxybutyrate as histone deacetylase inhibitor, transcriptional modulator and anti-inflammatory molecule.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679586,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Butyrate and R-β-hydroxybutyrate are two related short chain fatty acids naturally found in mammals. Butyrate, produced by enteric butyric bacteria, is present at millimolar concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract and at lower levels in blood; R-β-hydroxybutyrate, the main ketone body, produced by the liver during fasting can reach millimolar concentrations in the circulation. Both molecules have been shown to be histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and their administration has been associated to an improved metabolic profile and better cellular oxidative status, with butyrate inducing PGC1α and fatty acid oxidation and R-β-hydroxybutyrate upregulating oxidative stress resistance factors FOXO3A and MT2 in mouse kidney. Because of the chemical and functional similarity between the two molecules, we compared here their impact on multiple cell types, evaluating i) histone acetylation and hydroxybutyrylation levels by immunoblotting, ii) transcriptional regulation of metabolic and inflammatory genes by quantitative PCR and iii) cytokine secretion profiles using proteome profiling array analysis. We confirm that butyrate is a strong HDAC inhibitor, a characteristic we could not identify in R-β-hydroxybutyrate in vivo nor in vitro. Butyrate had an extensive impact on gene transcription in rat myotubes, upregulating PGC1α, CPT1b, mitochondrial sirtuins (SIRT3-5), and the mitochondrial anti-oxidative genes SOD2 and catalase. In endothelial cells, butyrate suppressed gene expression and LPS-induced secretion of several pro-inflammatory genes, while R-β-hydroxybutyrate acted as a slightly pro-inflammatory molecule. Our observations indicate that butyrate induces transcriptional changes to a higher extent than R-β-hydroxybutyrate in rat myotubes and endothelial cells, in keep with its HDAC inhibitory activity. Also, in contrast with previous reports, R-β-hydroxybutyrate, while inducing histone β-hydroxybutyrylation, did not display a readily detectable HDAC inhibitor activity and exerted a slight pro-inflammatory action on endothelial cells.",Membrane damage mechanism contributes to inhibition of trans-cinnamaldehyde on Penicillium italicum using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679585,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"The antifungal mechanism of essential oils against fungi remains in the shallow study.

Trans-cinnamaldehyde exhibited strong mycelial growth inhibition against Penicillium italicum, with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.313 μg/mL. Conventional analytical tests showed that trans-cinnamaldehyde changed the cell membrane permeability, which led to the leakage of some materials. Meanwhile, the membrane integrity and cell wall integrity also changed. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, an ultrasensitive and fingerprint method, was served as a bran-new method to study the antifungal mechanism. Characteristic peaks of supernatant obviously changed at 734, 1244, 1330, 1338 and 1466 cm-1. The Raman intensity represented a strong correlation with results from conventional methods, which made SERS an alternative to study antifungal process. All evidences implied that trans-cinnamaldehyde exerts its antifungal capacity against Penicillium italicum via membrane damage mechanism.",Association between preterm delivery and bacterial vaginosis with or without treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679584,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The relationship between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and preterm delivery has become well known in recent years, although there are few studies on: (i) the differences in test results during the early gestational (EGP) and middle gestational (MGP) periods; (ii) the significance of the intermediate (I) group that does not develop overt BV; or (iii) the therapeutic effects of metronidazole. We performed a retrospective study to analyze the relationship between the vaginal bacterial status and the preterm delivery rate. Without treatment, the preterm delivery rate was higher in the BV subgroup than in the I and normal (N) subgroups (p = 0.021) in the EGP, whereas the rates in the BV and I subgroups were higher than in the N subgroup in the MGP (p = 0.0003). Although treatment of BV by metronidazole vaginal tablets significantly increased the N subgroup in the MGP (p = 0.020), there was no significant improvement in the preterm delivery rate. Decreasing the rate of preterm delivery requires development of treatment methods that will further increase the percentage of patients who test N during the MGP after BV during the EGP.",Social isolation impairs the persistence of social recognition memory by disturbing the glutamatergic tonus and the olfactory bulb-dorsal hippocampus coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679583,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"The absence of companion may jeopardize mental health in social animals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that social isolation impairs social recognition memory by altering the excitability and the dialog between the olfactory bulb (OB) and the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP). Adult male Swiss mice were kept grouped (GH) or isolated (SI) for 7 days. Social memory (LTM) was evaluated using social recognition test. SI increased glutamate release in the OB, while decreased in the dHIP. Blocking AMPA and NMDA receptors into the OB or activating AMPA into the dHIP rescued LTM in SI mice, suggesting a cause-effect relationship between glutamate levels and LTM impairment. Additionally, during memory retrieval, phase-amplitude coupling between OB and dHIP decreased in SI mice. Our results indicate that SI impaired the glutamatergic signaling and the normal communication between OB and HIP, compromising the persistence of social memory.",A panel of eGFP reporters for single base editing by APOBEC-Cas9 editosome complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679582,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"The prospect of introducing a single C-to-T change at a specific genomic location has become feasible with APOBEC-Cas9 editing technologies. We present a panel of eGFP reporters for quantification and optimization of single base editing by APOBEC-Cas9 editosomes. Reporter utility is demonstrated by comparing activities of seven human APOBEC3 enzymes and rat APOBEC1 (BE3). APOBEC3A and RNA binding-defective variants of APOBEC3B and APOBEC3H display the highest single base editing efficiencies. APOBEC3B catalytic domain complexes also elicit the lowest frequencies of adjacent off-target events. However, unbiased deep-sequencing of edited reporters shows that all editosomes have some degree of local off-target editing. Thus, further optimization is required to generate true single base editors and the eGFP reporters described here have the potential to facilitate this process.",Cellular and animal models of skin alterations in the autism-related ADNP syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679581,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Mutations in ADNP have been recently associated with intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. However, the clinical features of patients with this syndrome are not fully identified, and no treatment currently exists for these patients. Here, we extended the ADNP syndrome phenotype describing skin abnormalities in both a patient with ADNP syndrome and an Adnp haploinsufficient mice. The patient displayed thin dermis, hyperkeratotic lesions in periarticular areas and delayed wound healing. Patient-derived skin keratinocytes showed reduced proliferation and increased differentiation. Additionally, detection of cell cycle markers indicated that mutant cells exhibited impaired cell cycle progression. Treatment of ADNP-deficient keratinocytes with the ADNP-derived NAP peptide significantly reduced the expression of differentiation markers. Sonography and immunofluorescence staining of epidermal layers revealed that the dermis was thinner in the patient than in a healthy control. Adnp haploinsufficient mice (Adnp+/-) mimicked the human condition showing reduced dermal thickness. Intranasal administration of NAP significantly increased dermal thickness and normalized the levels of cell cycle and differentiation markers. Our observations provide a novel activity of the autism-linked ADNP in the skin that may serve to define the clinical phenotype of patients with ADNP syndrome and provide an attractive therapeutic option for skin alterations in these patients.",The Impact of Cardiac Lipotoxicity on Cardiac Function and Mirnas Signature in Obese and Non-Obese Rats with Myocardial Infarction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679580,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Cardiac lipotoxicity is involved in the cardiac functional consequences associated with obesity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore whether changes in the mitochondrial lipid cardiac profile could reflect differences in cardiac function and structure in obese and non-obese rats with myocardial infarction (MI). Whether these changes can also be reflected in a specific plasma miRNA signature as markers of cardiac damage was also evaluated. Rats were fed with either standard (3.5% fat) or high fat diet (35% fat) for 6 weeks before the induction of MI and sacrificed 4 weeks later. MI showed cardiac lipotoxicity independently of the presence of obesity, although obese and non-obese rats did not present the same cardiac lipid profile at mitochondrial level. Several cardiac lipid species in mitochondria, including cardiolipins and triglycerides, were associated with myocardial fibrosis, with mitochondrial triglyceride levels being independently associated with it; this supports that lipotoxicity can affect cardiac function. MI down-regulated plasma levels of miRNA 15b-5p and 194-5p in obese and non-obese animals, which were associated with cardiac function, mitochondrial lipids and myocardial fibrosis, with miRNA 15b-5p levels being independently associated with cardiac fibrosis. This could support that lipotoxicity could affect heart function by modulating plasma miRNAs.",Serum levels of fibroblast growth factor-2 distinguish Takayasu arteritis from giant cell arteritis independent of age at diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679579,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are two major variants of large vessel vasculitis, and age is a major factor in their differential diagnosis. We sought to determine whether the two diseases exist on the same spectrum. We compared the serum levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines in 25 patients with TAK, 20 patients with GCA, and sex- and age-matched healthy donors for either condition (HD-TAK and HD-GCA). To evaluate the effects of age on the levels of cytokines and chemokines, we performed multiple logistic regression analysis using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The levels of IL-1RA, IL-10, GM-CSF, G-CSF, FGF-2, eotaxin, and IP-10 were significantly different between TAK and GCA, but no differences were found in the levels of IL-6, IL-12(p40), IL-17, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Significant differences in the levels of IL-1RA, IL-10, GM-CSF, eotaxin, and IP-10 were observed between the HD-TAK and HD-GCA groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that only FGF-2 and IP-10 could significantly distinguish the diseases when added to age. Multiple logistic analysis using factors selected by the LASSO method revealed that FGF-2 was the only significant factor to distinguish the diseases when added to age. Among numerous cytokines and chemokines analyzed, only FGF-2 could be used together with age at diagnosis to differentiate TAK and GCA. Our results suggested the importance of considering the effects of age on serum cytokines."

Two of the most pervasive global change drivers are drought and nutrient enrichment. However, the responses of soil organisms to interacting global change drivers remain widely unknown. We tested the interactive effects of extreme drought and fertilization on soil biota ranging from microbes to invertebrates across seasons. We expected drought to reduce the activity of soil organisms and fertilization to induce positive bottom-up effects via increased plant productivity. Furthermore, we hypothesized fertilization to reinforce drought effects through enhanced plant growth, resulting in even drier soil conditions. Our results revealed that drought had detrimental effects on soil invertebrate feeding activity and simplified nematode community structure, whereas soil microbial activity and biomass were unaffected. Microbial biomass increased in response to fertilization, whereas invertebrate feeding activity substantially declined. Notably, these effects were consistent across seasons. The dissimilar responses suggest that soil biota differ vastly in their vulnerability to global change drivers. Thus, important ecosystem processes like decomposition and nutrient cycling, which are driven by the interdependent activity of soil microorganisms and invertebrates, may be disrupted under future conditions.",Gut microbiota-mediated Gene-Environment interaction in the TashT mouse model of Hirschsprung disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679567,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Based on the bilateral relationship between the gut microbiota and formation/function of the enteric nervous system (ENS), we sought to determine whether antibiotics-induced dysbiosis might impact the expressivity of genetically-induced ENS abnormalities. To address this, we took advantage of the TashT mouse model of Hirschsprung disease, in which colonic aganglionosis and hypoganglionosis are both much more severe in males. These defects result into two male-biased colon motility phenotypes: either megacolon that is lethal around weaning age or chronic constipation in adults, the latter being also associated with an increased proportion of nitrergic neurons in the distal ENS. Induction of dysbiosis using a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics specifically impacted the colonic ENS of TashTTg/Tg mice in a stage-dependent manner. It further decreased the neuronal density at post-weaning age and differentially modulated the otherwise increased proportion of nitrergic neurons, which appeared normalized around weaning age and further increased at post-weaning age. These changes delayed the development of megacolon around weaning age but led to premature onset of severe constipation later on. Finally, local inhibition of nitric oxide signaling improved motility and prevented death by megacolon. We thus conclude that exposure to antibiotics can negatively influence the expressivity of a genetically-induced enteric neuropathy.","Soil parameters, land use, and geographical distance drive soil bacterial communities along a European transect.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679566,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"To better understand the relationship between soil bacterial communities, soil physicochemical properties, land use and geographical distance, we considered for the first time ever a European transect running from Sweden down to Portugal and from France to Slovenia. We investigated 71 sites based on their range of variation in soil properties (pH, texture and organic matter), climatic conditions (Atlantic, alpine, boreal, continental, Mediterranean) and land uses (arable, forest and grassland). 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing revealed that bacterial communities highly varied in diversity, richness, and structure according to environmental factors. At the European scale, taxa area relationship (TAR) was significant, supporting spatial structuration of bacterial communities. Spatial variations in community diversity and structure were mainly driven by soil physicochemical parameters. Within soil clusters (k-means approach) corresponding to similar edaphic and climatic properties, but to multiple land uses, land use was a major driver of the bacterial communities. Our analyses identified specific indicators of land use (arable, forest, grasslands) or soil conditions (pH, organic C, texture). These findings provide unprecedented information on soil bacterial communities at the European scale and on the drivers involved; possible applications for sustainable soil management are discussed.",Calcite fibre formation in modern brachiopod shells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679565,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The fibrous calcite layer of modern brachiopod shells is a hybrid composite material and forms a substantial part of the hard tissue. We investigated how cells of the outer mantle epithelium (OME) secrete calcite material and generate the characteristic fibre morphology and composite microstructure of the shell. We employed AFM, FE-SEM, and TEM imaging of embedded/etched, chemically fixed/decalcified and high-pressure frozen/freeze substituted samples. Calcite fibres are secreted by outer mantle epithelium (OME) cells. Biometric analysis of TEM micrographs indicates that about 50% of these cells are attached via hemidesmosomes to an extracellular organic membrane present at the proximal, convex surface of the fibres. At these sites, mineral secretion is not active. Instead, ion transport from OME cells to developing fibres occurs at regions of closest contact between cells and fibres, however only at sites where the extracellular membrane at the proximal fibre surface is not developed yet. Fibre formation requires the cooperation of several adjacent OME cells. It is a spatially and temporally changing process comprising of detachment of OME cells from the extracellular organic membrane, mineral secretion at detachment sites, termination of secretion with formation of the extracellular organic membrane, and attachment of cells via hemidesmosomes to this membrane.","Speed-Selectivity in Retinal Ganglion Cells is Sharpened by Broad Spatial Frequency, Naturalistic Stimuli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679564,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Motion detection represents one of the critical tasks of the visual system and has motivated a large body of research. However, it remains unclear precisely why the response of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) to simple artificial stimuli does not predict their response to complex, naturalistic stimuli. To explore this topic, we use Motion Clouds (MC), which are synthetic textures that preserve properties of natural images and are merely parameterized, in particular by modulating the spatiotemporal spectrum complexity of the stimulus by adjusting the frequency bandwidths. By stimulating the retina of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus with MC we show that the RGCs respond to increasingly complex stimuli by narrowing their adjustment curves in response to movement. At the level of the population, complex stimuli produce a sparser code while preserving movement information; therefore, the stimuli are encoded more efficiently. Interestingly, these properties were observed throughout different populations of RGCs. Thus, our results reveal that the response at the level of RGCs is modulated by the naturalness of the stimulus - in particular for motion - which suggests that the tuning to the statistics of natural images already emerges at the level of the retina.","Relationship between ultraviolet index (UVI) and first-, second- and third-degree sunburn using the Probit methodology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679563,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"In this paper, a relation between the ultraviolet index (UVI) as a Sun exposure time and its effects in the form of burns according to the skin type has been elaborated. Moreover, we present a new expression that relates the intensity of solar radiation and the UVI, as well as expressions to obtain the percentage of population affected both by first and second degree lllsunburn for every skin-type. The results have been adjusted and validated through experimental results taken from the bibliography. Finally, this paper presents a table where the population can easily interpret the UVI values and calculate the maximum time one can be exposed to solar radiation without getting sunburn. In addition, this article aims to raise awareness of the potential harm caused by solar radiation by indicating the percentage of population affected by different types of sunburn depending on skin-type. Moreover, ultraviolet exposure to sunlight could not just result in sunburn, but also have long-term effects on eyes, or even cause immune system disorders or melanoma. Therefore, managing risk perception with this useful table could familiarize the population with actual harm prevention.",High Quality ATAC-Seq Data Recovered from Cryopreserved Breast Cell Lines and Tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679562,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"DNA accessibility to transcription regulators varies between cells and modulates gene expression patterns. Several ""open"" chromatin profiling methods that provide valuable insight into the activity of these regulatory regions have been developed. However, their application to clinical samples has been limited despite the discovery that the Analysis of Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) method can be performed using fewer cells than other techniques. Obtaining fresh rather than stored samples and a lack of adequate optimization and quality controls are major barriers to ATAC's clinical implementation. Here, we describe an optimized ATAC protocol in which we varied nuclear preparation conditions and transposase concentrations and applied rigorous quality control measures before testing fresh, flash frozen, and cryopreserved breast cells and tissue. We obtained high quality data from small cell number. Furthermore, the genomic distribution of sequencing reads, their enrichment at transcription start sites, and transcription factor footprint analyses were similar between cryopreserved and fresh samples. This updated method is applicable to clinical samples, including cells from fine needle aspiration and tissues obtained via core needle biopsy or surgery. Chromatin accessibility analysis using patient samples will greatly expand the range of translational research and personalized medicine by identification of clinically-relevant epigenetic features.","Quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics study for the comprehensive characterization of the salt-processing mechanism of Psoraleae Fructus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679561,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Research based on quantitative analysis, pharmacokinetics and metabolomics was conducted to explore the effects of salt-processing on Psoraleae Fructus (PF). Quantitative analysis showed that the contents of bioactive components were higher in salt-processed Psoraleae Fructus (SPF) extract than in PF extract. Pharmacokinetics indicated that the overall AUC and tmax levels was higher, while Cmax was lower in the SPF group. In the metabolomics study, the differential influences of PF and SPF on 22 common biomarkers and associated metabolic pathways showed that salt-processing could enhance the effect of PF and reduce toxicity in the cardiovascular and renal systems. The internal correlations among these results, together with the influence of salt-processing, suggested that the effects of heating and newly generated surfactants during the salt-processing procedure were the primary causes of the changes in chemical composition and absorption characteristics, as well as the subsequent enhanced efficacy and minor toxicity.",Defect Chemistry and Li-ion Diffusion in Li2RuO3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679560,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Layered Li2RuO3 is an important candidate cathode material in rechargeable lithium ion batteries because of its novel anionic redox process and high reversible capacity. Atomistic scale simulations are used to calculate the intrinsic defect process, favourable dopants and migration energies of lithium ion diffusions together with migration paths in Li2RuO3. The Li Frenkel is calculated to be the most favourable intrinsic defect type. The cation anti-site defect, in which Li and Ru ions exchange their positions is 1.89 eV/defect suggesting that this defect would be observed at high temperatures. Long range vacancy assisted lithium diffusion paths were calculated and it is confirmed that the lowest overall activation energy (0.73 eV) migration path is along the ab plane. Trivalent dopants (Al3+, Co3+, Sc3+, In3+, Y3+, Gd3+ and La3+) were considered to create additional Li in Li2RuO3. Here we show that Al3+ or Co3+ are the ideal dopants and this is in agreement with the experimental studies reported on Co3+ doping in Li2RuO3.",Interaction strength promotes robustness against cascading effects in mutualistic networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679559,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Perturbations, such as fluctuations in abundance, can ripple across species assemblages through ecological interactions. Furthermore, the way in which ecological interactions are organized into a network and the interaction strengths connecting species may be important for cascading effects. Previous work revealed that network structure determines how cascading effects spread across species assemblages. A next step is to understand how interaction strengths influence cascading effects. Here, we assume that perturbations have negative effects, and we evaluate whether interaction strength affects network robustness to cascading effects in mutualistic interactions, and examine the role of network structure in mediating perturbation cascades when interaction strength is incorporated. We combine empirical data on 18 mutualistic networks, two simulations scenarios, and network theory, to investigate how network structure affects perturbation spreading time, a proxy of network robustness to cascading effects. Simulations in which we included interaction strength presented higher mean spreading time, indicating that interaction strength increases network robustness. Richness, modularity, and nestedness had a strong, positive effect, on mean perturbation spreading time regardless of the interaction strengths. We found that network structure and the distribution of interaction strengths affected communities' robustness to perturbation spreading. Our results contribute to the discussion on the danger that ecosystems face when species, and interactions alike, become extinct."

We initiated the Taizhou Imaging Study (TIS) to examine the prevalence and correlates of incidental findings using brain MRI among an elderly population residing in a rural area of China. A total of 562 individuals, at the age of 55 to 65 years, participated in the TIS study with a response rate of 90%. The prevalence of lacunes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB), perivascular space, and intracranial arterial stenosis was 26.69%, 10.68%, 18.51%, 27.76%, and 12.81%, respectively. Age and hypertension were the major correlates of these incidental findings. Per each year increase in age, the risks of WMH and CMB increased by 15% and 14%. Compared to individuals with normal blood pressure, individuals with hypertension had an increased risk of all incidental findings, with the adjusted odds ratios of 2.28 to 5.45. Correlations of age, gender and body mass index with brain gray matter fraction were also observed. The high prevalence of these findings indicates a need of preventative strategy to help prevent future stroke and dementia in this population.",ES-mediated chimera analysis revealed requirement of DDX6 for NANOS2 localization and function in mouse germ cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679547,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"In embryonic male germ cells, the RNA-binding protein NANOS2 recruits its target RNAs to processing bodies (P-bodies), where they are repressed. This process is necessary to promote male-type germ cell differentiation. However, it remains unclear whether all NANOS2 functions depend on P-bodies. To address this question, we established ES cell lines containing a germ cell-specific inducible Cre and reporter together with the floxed Ddx6 allele. We deleted the Ddx6 gene by administering tamoxifen to chimeric embryos containing germ cells derived from recombinant ES cells. DDX6-null germ cells exhibited both similar and distinct defects from those observed in NANOS2-null germ cells. These results demonstrate that NANOS2 function is carried out via both P-body-dependent and -independent mechanisms. RNA-seq analyses further supported the phenotypic differences between DDX6-null and NANOS2-null germ cells, and indicated distinct molecular cascades involved in NANOS2-mediated gene regulation.",Regulation of volatile and non-volatile pheromone attractants depends upon male social status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679546,Scientific reports,2019 04 12,"We investigated the regulation of chemical signals of house mice living in seminatural social conditions. We found that male mice more than doubled the excretion of major urinary proteins (MUPs) after they acquired a territory and become socially dominant. MUPs bind and stabilize the release of volatile pheromone ligands, and some MUPs exhibit pheromonal properties themselves. We conducted olfactory assays and found that female mice were more attracted to the scent of dominant than subordinate males when they were in estrus. Yet, when male status was controlled, females were not attracted to urine with high MUP concentration, despite being comparable to levels of dominant males. To determine which compounds influence female attraction, we conducted additional analyses and found that dominant males differentially upregulated the excretion of particular MUPs, including the pheromone MUP20 (darcin), and a volatile pheromone that influences female reproductive physiology and behavior. Our findings show that once male house mice become territorial and socially dominant, they upregulate the amount and types of excreted MUPs, which increases the intensities of volatiles and the attractiveness of their urinary scent to sexually receptive females.",Novel pseudo-aspartic peptidase from the midgut of the tick Rhipicephalus microplus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679545,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The characterization of Rhipicephalus microplus tick physiology can support efforts to develop and improve the efficiency of control methods.

In this work we confirm the lack of proteolytic activity of RmPAP and investigate it's non-proteolytic interaction with bovine hemoglobin by Surface Plasmon Resonance and phage display. Moreover we carried out RNAi interference and artificial feeding of ticks with anti-RmPAP antibodies to assess it's possible biological role, although no changes were observed in the biological parameters evaluated.

However, their direct effect on endothelial cells and paracrine mediators have not yet been investigated. Using a carrier-based cell culture system to test the scalability for exosome production, we showed that different types of endothelial cells present specific kinetics for exosomes internalization. Exosome-treatment of endothelial cells increased cytotoxicity and reduced VEGF secretion and angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Using the hamster buccal pouch carcinoma as a preclinical model for human oral squamous cell carcinoma, we demonstrated a significant antitumor effect of intra-tumoral injection of exosomes associated with a loss of tumor vasculature. These results address up-scaling of exosome production, a relevant issue for their clinical application, and also assess menstrual stem cell exosomes as potential anti-angiogenic agents for the treatment of neoplastic conditions.",Role of Water on the Rotational Dynamics of the Organic Methylammonium Cation: A First Principles Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679543,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Understanding the degradation mechanisms of lead-halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbI3) under exposure to liquid/aerosol water is an essential problem within the photovoltaic community.

Various solvation structures of MA were characterized by their stabilization energies, dipoles, and Maximally-Localized Wannier Function (MLWF) centers. Calculation - and analysis - of vibrational shifts in the IR spectral region were performed for hydrated complexes; the locations of [Formula: see text] stretching vibrations allude to significant hydrogen bonding between MA and the water molecules. Through Fourier analysis of the rotational dynamics on several MA · (H2O)n complexes, we conclude that the water molecules dampen the rotational motion of the MA as the intermolecular bonds formed between the water molecules and the MA act to hinder the rotation of the cation; these findings give explanatory support to earlier computational observations of humidity effects on perovskites (i.e., CH3NH3PbI3) materials. This work is a step toward understanding the water-MA cation interaction in bulk perovskites, thus providing greater understanding of in situ instability/degradation of perovskite bulk materials.",Self-association and subcellular localization of Puumala hantavirus envelope proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679542,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Hantavirus assembly and budding are governed by the surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc.

We analyzed their intracellular distribution, co-localization and oligomerization, applying comprehensive live, single-cell fluorescence techniques, including confocal microscopy, imaging flow cytometry, anisotropy imaging and Number&Brightness analysis. We demonstrate that Gc is significantly enriched in the Golgi apparatus in absence of other viral components, while Gn is mainly restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Importantly, upon co-expression both glycoproteins were found in the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, we show that an intact CT of Gc is necessary for efficient Golgi localization, while the CT of Gn influences protein stability. Finally, we found that Gn assembles into higher-order homo-oligomers, mainly dimers and tetramers, in the ER while Gc was present as mixture of monomers and dimers within the Golgi apparatus. Our findings suggest that PUUV Gc is the driving factor of the targeting of Gc and Gn to the Golgi region, while Gn possesses a significantly stronger self-association potential.",Polarization induced control of optical trap potentials in binary liquids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679541,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"We illustrate control of a polarized laser optical trapping potential landscape through the nonideal mixing of binary liquids.

Experimentally, we show that this ITPA effect can be modified and/or removed by the use of binary liquid mixtures. From our femtosecond optical tweezers experiments, we determine the topograph of the trapping potential base on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, the Brownian motion of the trapped bead is sensitive to the frictional force (FF) of the surroundings that is exerted by clusters of water and alcohol binary mixture through extended hydrogen bonding. Thus, using these two effects, ITPA and FF of the medium, we have shown that one can indeed modify the effective trapping potential landscape. Water-alcohol binary mixtures display a nonlinear dependence on the microrheological properties of the solvent composition as a result of rigid cluster formation. Volumetrically, at about 30% methanol in water binary mixture, the trapping asymmetry is minimal. In this particular binary mixture composition, the hydrophobic part of the methanol molecule is surrounded by 'cages' of water molecules. Enhanced H-bonding network of water molecules results in higher viscosity, which contributes to the higher frictional force. Increased viscosity decreases the degree of anisotropy due to hindered dipolar rotation. However, at higher methanol concentrations, the methanol molecules are no longer contained within the water cages and are free to move, which decrease their overall bulk viscosity. Thus, for pure solvents, experimentally measured anisotropy matches quite well with the theoretical prediction, but this fails in case of the binary mixtures due to the increased frictional force exerted by binary mixtures that result from the formation of cage-like structures.",Improving orthotopic mouse models of patient-derived breast cancer brain metastases by a modified intracarotid injection method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679540,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) remains a major clinical problem. Approximately 10-16% of patients with breast cancer develop brain metastases (BCBM). However, no systemic therapy has gained regulatory approval for the specific treatment of BCBM and this remains an area of persistent, unmet medical need. Rapid, predictive and clinically-relevant animal models are critical to study the biology of brain metastases and to identify effective therapeutic approaches for patients with BCBM. Here, we describe a method for efficient establishment of orthotopic mouse models of patient-derived brain metastases via an improved intracarotid injection protocol that permits tumor cell growth in the unique brain microenvironment without compromising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate that our newly improved models of patient-derived brain metastases recapitulate the histologic, molecular, and genetic characteristics of their matched patient tumor specimens and thus represent a potentially powerful tool for pre-clinical and translational research.",Near-field optical trapping in a non-conservative force field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679539,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"The force-field generated by a near-field optical trap is analyzed. A C-shaped engraving on a gold film is considered as the trap. By separating out the conservative component and the solenoidal component of the force-field using Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, it was found that the force is non-conservative. Conventional method of calculating the optical potential from the force-field is shown to be inaccurate when the trapping force is not purely conservative. An alternative method is presented to accurately estimate the potential. The positional statistics of a trapped nanoparticle in this non-conservative field is calculated. A model is proposed that relates the position distribution to the conservative component of the force. The model is found to be consistent with numerical and experimental results. In order to show the generality of the approach, the same analysis is repeated for a plasmonic trap consisting of a gold nanopillar. Similar consistency is observed for this structure as well."

Dysfunction in these specialized cells, can often lead to emphysema, edema, and pulmonary inflammation. Long-time exposure can also lead to dangerous epigenetic modifications and cancer. Among the manufactured nanomaterials, metal oxide nanoparticles are widely encountered owing to their wide range of applications. Scores of published literatures affirm ZnO NPs are more toxic to human alveolar cells than TiO2. However, signalling cascades deducing differences in human alveolar responses to their exposure is not well documented. With A549 cells, we have demonstrated that epithelial to mesenchymal transition and an increased duration of phosphorylation of eIF2α are crucial mechanisms routing better tolerance to TiO2 NP treatment over exposure to ZnO. The increased migratory capacity may help cells escape away from the zone of stress. Further, expression of chaperone such as Hsp70 is also enhanced during the same dose-time investigations.

Tandem-lens optical mapping systems facilitated simultaneous recording of multiple parameters characterizing cardiac function. However, high cost and technological complexity restricted its proliferation to the wider biological community. We present here, an open-source solution for multiple-camera tandem-lens optical systems for multiparametric mapping of transmembrane potential, intracellular calcium dynamics and other parameters in intact mouse hearts and in rat heart slices.

The measured strength and resistivity are compared to isotropic tungsten-copper composites fabricated by standard powder metallurgical methods. Our results have the potential to fuel the development of more efficient materials, used in electrical power grids and solar-thermal energy conversion systems.

The measured quantities, which differed considerably for different peptides, lipid-membranes, AFM tips (prepared under identical conditions), and retraction speeds of the AFM cantilever, could not be described in terms of the standard theory, according to which detachment occurs along a single pathway, corresponding to a diffusive escape process across a free energy barrier. In particular, the prominent retraction speed dependence of k(F) was a clear indication that peptide-lipid membrane dissociation occurs stochastically along several detachment pathways. Thereby, we have formulated a general theoretical approach for describing P(F) and k(F), by assuming that peptide detachment from lipid membranes occurs, with certain probability, along a few dominant diffusive pathways. This new method was validated through a consistent interpretation of the experimental data. Furthermore, we have found that for moderate retraction speeds at intermediate force values, k(F) exhibits catch-bond behavior (i.e. decreasing detachment rate with increasing force). According to the proposed model this behavior is due to the stochastic mixing of individual detachment pathways which do not convert or cross during rupture. To our knowledge, such catch-bond mechanism has not been proposed and demonstrated before for a peptide-lipid interaction.",Carbonic Anhydrase 6 Gene Variation influences Oral Microbiota Composition and Caries Risk in Swedish adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679524,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Carbonic anhydrase VI (CA6) catalyses the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in saliva with possible pH regulation, taste perception, and tooth formation effects. This study assessed effects of variation in the CA6 gene on oral microbiota and specifically the acidophilic and caries-associated Streptococcus mutans in 17-year old Swedish adolescents (n = 154). Associations with caries status and secreted CA6 protein were also evaluated. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (27 SNPs in 5 haploblocks) and saliva and tooth biofilm microbiota from Illumina MiSeq 16S rDNA (V3-V4) sequencing and culturing were analysed. Haploblock 4 (rs10864376, rs3737665, rs12138897) CCC associated with low prevalence of S. mutans (OR (95% CI): 0.5 (0.3, 0.8)), and caries (OR 0.6 (0.3, 0.9)), whereas haploblock 4 TTG associated with high prevalence of S. mutans (OR: 2.7 (1.2, 5.9)) and caries (OR: 2.3 (1.2, 4.4)).

Because available anti-GABARAP antibodies perform inadequate, especially within various microscopy-based applications, we aimed to develop an antibody that targets GABARAP but not its close orthologs. Following the latest recommendations for antibody validation including fluorescence protein tagging, genetic and orthogonal strategies, we characterized the resulting anti-GABARAP (8H5) antibody during confocal immunofluorescence imaging in-depth. We compared the antibody staining pattern with that obtained for fluorescence protein tagged GABARAP, GABARAPL1 or GABARAPL2 each ectopically expressed in GABARAP knockout cells. Furthermore, we imaged cells expressing all mATG8 family members at endogenous levels and checked GABARAP knockout cells for unspecific staining under fed or macroautophagy-inducing conditions. Finally, we simultaneously stained cells for endogenous GABARAP and the common autophagosomal marker LC3B. Summarized, the presented antibody shows high specificity for GABARAP without cross-reactivity to other mATG8 family members in immunofluorescence imaging making it a valuable tool for the identification of unique GABARAP functions.",Effects of circadian misalignment on cognition in chronic shift workers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679522,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Shift work is associated with increased human operational errors, presumably due to the circadian timing system that inhibits optimal cognitive function during the night. Circadian misalignment, which is the misalignment between the circadian pacemaker and behavioral/environmental cycles, impairs cognitive performance in non-shift workers. However, it remains uncertain whether the adverse cognitive consequences of circadian misalignment are also observed in chronic shift workers. Thus, we investigated the effects of circadian misalignment on cognitive performance in chronic shift workers. Using a randomized, cross-over design that simulated day shift work (circadian alignment) and night shift work (circadian misalignment), we show that circadian misalignment increases cognitive vulnerability on sustained attention, information processing and visual-motor performance, particularly after more than 10 hours of scheduled wakefulness. Furthermore, their increased levels of subjective sleepiness and their decreased sleep efficiency were significantly associated with impaired sustained attention and visual-motor performance. Our data suggest that circadian misalignment dramatically deteriorates cognitive performance in chronic shift workers under circadian misalignment. This increased cognitive vulnerability may have important safety consequences, given the increasing number of nighttime jobs that crucially rely on the availability of cognitive resources.",STAT3-induced upregulation of lncRNA MEG3 regulates the growth of cardiac hypertrophy through miR-361-5p/HDAC9 axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679521,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Cardiac hypertrophy is closely correlated with diverse cardiovascular diseases, augmenting the risk of heart failure and sudden death. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been studied in cardiac hypertrophy for their regulatory function. LncRNA MEG3 has been reported in human cancers. Whereas, it is unknown whether MEG3 regulates the growth of cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the specific role of MEG3 in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we found that MEG3 contributed to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. MEG3 expression was remarkably strengthened in the mice heart which undergone the transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MEG3 was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes which were treated with Ang-II. Silenced MEG3 inhibited the increasing size of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes and reversed other hypertrophic responses. Mechanically, MEG3 could affect cardiac hypertrophy by regulating gene expression. Mechanically, we found that MEG3 could be upregulated by the transcription factor STAT3 and could regulate miR-361-5p and HDAC9 by acting as a ceRNA. Finally, rescue assays were made to do further confirmation. All our findings revealed that STAT3-inducetd upregulation of lncRNA MEG3 controls cardiac hypertrophy by regulating miR-362-5p/HDAC9 axis.",Through synapses to spatial memory maps via a topological model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679520,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Various neurophysiological and cognitive functions are based on transferring information between spiking neurons via a complex system of synaptic connections. In particular, the capacity of presynaptic inputs to influence the postsynaptic outputs-the efficacy of the synapses-plays a principal role in all aspects of hippocampal neurophysiology. However, a direct link between the information processed at the level of individual synapses and the animal's ability to form memories at the organismal level has not yet been fully understood. Here, we investigate the effect of synaptic transmission probabilities on the ability of the hippocampal place cell ensembles to produce a cognitive map of the environment. Using methods from algebraic topology, we find that weakening synaptic connections increase spatial learning times, produce topological defects in the large-scale representation of the ambient space and restrict the range of parameters for which place cell ensembles are capable of producing a map with correct topological structure. On the other hand, the results indicate a possibility of compensatory phenomena, namely that spatial learning deficiencies may be mitigated through enhancement of neuronal activity.",Tap water is one of the drivers that establish and assembly the lactic acid bacterium biota during sourdough preparation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679519,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"This study aimed at assessing the effect of tap water on the: (i) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) population of a traditional and mature sourdough; and (ii) establishment of LAB community during sourdough preparation. Ten tap water, collected from Italian regions characterized by cultural heritage in leavened baked goods, were used as ingredient for propagating or preparing firm (type I) sourdoughs. The same type and batch of flour, recipe, fermentation temperature and time were used for propagation/preparation, being water the only variable parameter. During nine days of propagation of a traditional and mature Apulian sourdough, LAB cell density did not differ, and the LAB species/strain composition hardly changed, regardless of the water. When the different tap water were used for preparing the corresponding sourdoughs, the values of pH became lower than 4.5 after two to four fermentations. The type of water affected the assembly of the LAB biome. As shown by Principal Components Analysis, LAB population in the sourdoughs and chemical and microbiological features of water used for their preparation partly overlapped. Several correlations were found between sourdough microbiota and water features. These data open the way to future researches about the use of various types of water in bakery industry."

We assessed the suitability of targeting enolase, a glycolysis pathway enzyme with multiple, secondary functions in cells, to treat obesity. Treating adipocytes with ENOblock, a novel modulator of these secondary 'moonlighting' functions of enolase, suppressed the adipogenic program and induced mitochondrial uncoupling. Obese animals treated with ENOblock showed a reduction in body weight and increased core body temperature. Metabolic and inflammatory parameters were improved in the liver, adipose tissue and hippocampus. The mechanism of ENOblock was identified as transcriptional repression of master regulators of lipid homeostasis (Srebp-1a and Srebp-1c), gluconeogenesis (Pck-1) and inflammation (Tnf-α and Il-6). ENOblock treatment also reduced body weight gain, lowered cumulative food intake and increased fecal lipid content in mice fed a high fat diet. Our results support the further drug development of ENOblock as a therapeutic for obesity and suggest enolase as a new target for this disorder.",Precision of a Novel Craniofacial Surgical Navigation System Based on Augmented Reality Using an Occlusal Splint as a Registration Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679507,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The authors have developed a novel augmented reality (AR)-based navigation system (NS) for craniofacial surgery. In this study, the authors aimed to measure the precision of the system and further analyze the primary influencing factors of the precision. The drilling of holes into the mandibles of ten beagle dogs was performed under the AR-based NS, and the precision was analyzed by comparing the deviation between the preoperational plan and the surgical outcome. The AR-based NS was successfully applied to quickly and precisely drill holes in the mandibles. The mean positional deviation between the preoperative design and intraoperative navigation was 1.29 ± 0.70 mm for the entry points and 2.47 ± 0.66 mm for the end points, and the angular deviation was 1.32° ± 1.17°. The precision linearly decreased with the distance from the marker.

We experimentally characterize how the external cavity length, being on the same order than the microlaser's coherence length, influences the spectral and dynamical properties of the micropillar laser. Moreover, we determine the relaxation oscillation frequency of the micropillar by superimposing optical pulse injection to a dc current. It is found that the optical pulse can be used to disturb the feedback-coupled laser within one roundtrip time in such a way that it reaches the same output power as if no feedback was present. Our results do not only expand the understanding of microlasers when subject to optical feedback from short external cavities, but pave the way towards tailoring the properties of this key nanophotonic system for studies in the quantum regime of self-feedback and its implementation to integrated photonic circuits.",Usp7 regulates Hippo pathway through deubiquitinating the transcriptional coactivator Yorkie.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679505,Nature communications,2019 06 13,"The Hippo pathway plays an important role in organ development and adult tissue homeostasis, and its deregulation has been implicated in many cancers. The Hippo signaling relies on a core kinase cascade culminating in phosphorylation of the transcription coactivator Yorkie (Yki). Although Yki is the key effector of Hippo pathway, the regulation of its protein stability is still unclear. Here, we show that Hippo pathway attenuates the binding of a ubiquitin-specific protease Usp7 to Yki, which regulates Hippo signaling through deubiquitinating Yki. Furthermore, the mammalian homolog of Usp7, HAUSP plays a conserved role in regulating Hippo pathway by modulating Yap ubiquitination and degradation. Finally, we find that the expression of HAUSP is positively correlated with that of Yap, both showing upregulated levels in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens. In summary, our findings demonstrate that Yki/Yap is stabilized by Usp7/HAUSP, and provide HAUSP as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.",Birth weight percentiles by sex and gestational age for twins born in southern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679504,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Mean birth weight of twins is known to be lower than that of singletons, however, southern China lacks a twin-specific birth weight reference.

We applied generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) when calculating the birth weight percentiles, and calculated percentiles for monochorionic and dichorionic twins separately. We next used data collected between Jan 1st 2018 and Apr 30th 2018, encompassing 12,371 live births, to calculate the SGA and LGA ratios using birth weight references in Australia, South Korea and China (based on birth defects surveillance system) and birth weight percentiles calculated in this study.

We identified 3,892 significant genes, 389 proteins, and 221 human proteins by transcriptomic analysis, proteomic analysis, and human-dengue virus protein-protein interactions, respectively. The drug candidates were selected using gene expression profiles for inverse drug-disease relationships compared with DHF patients and healthy controls as well as interactomic relationships between the signature proteins and chemical compounds. Integrating the results of the multiple omics analysis, we identified eight candidates for drug repositioning to treat DHF that targeted five proteins (ACTG1, CALR, ERC1, HSPA5, SYNE2) involved in human-dengue virus protein-protein interactions, and the signature proteins in the proteomic analysis mapped to significant pathways. Interestingly, five of these drug candidates, valparoic acid, sirolimus, resveratrol, vorinostat, and Y-27632, have been reported previously as effective treatments for flavivirus-induced diseases.

In fact, traditional scientific approaches with intense focus on individual genes or proteins have not been successful in providing new treatments. Hence, innovations in technology and computational methods provide new tools to further understand complex biological systems such as pathogen biology. In this paper, we apply a gene regulatory network approach to analyze transcriptomic data of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. By means of an optimization procedure, the phenotypic transitions between the stages associated with the life cycle of T. gondii were embedded into the dynamics of a gene regulatory network. Thus, through this methodology we were able to reconstruct a gene regulatory network able to emulate the life cycle of the pathogen. The community network analysis has revealed that nodes of the network can be organized in seven communities which allow us to assign putative functions to 338 previously uncharacterized genes, 25 of which are predicted as new pathogenic factors. Furthermore, we identified a small gene circuit that drives a series of phenotypic transitions that characterize the life cycle of this pathogen. These new findings can contribute to the understanding of parasite pathogenesis.",Directional sub-femtosecond charge transfer dynamics and the dimensionality of 1T-TaS2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679501,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"For the layered transition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, we establish through a unique experimental approach and density functional theory, how ultrafast charge transfer in 1T-TaS2 takes on isotropic three-dimensional character or anisotropic two-dimensional character, depending on the commensurability of the charge density wave phases of 1T-TaS2. The X-ray spectroscopic core-hole-clock method prepares selectively in- and out-of-plane polarized sulfur 3p orbital occupation with respect to the 1T-TaS2 planes and monitors sub-femtosecond wave packet delocalization. Despite being a prototypical two-dimensional material, isotropic three-dimensional charge transfer is found in the commensurate charge density wave phase (CCDW), indicating strong coupling between layers. In contrast, anisotropic two-dimensional charge transfer occurs for the nearly commensurate phase (NCDW). In direct comparison, theory shows that interlayer interaction in the CCDW phase - not layer stacking variations - causes isotropic three-dimensional charge transfer. This is presumably a general mechanism for phase transitions and tailored properties of dichalcogenides with charge density waves.",Constructive approach for synthesis of a functional IgG using a reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679500,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"IgG is an indispensable biological experimental tool as well as a widely-used therapeutic protein. However, cell culture-based expression of monoclonal IgG is costly and time-consuming, making this process difficult to use for high-throughput screening in early-stage evaluation of biologics. With the goal of establishing a fast, simple, and robust high-throughput expression system for IgG, we implemented the synthesis of functional aglycosylated IgG by constructive approach based on a reconstituted prokaryotic cell-free protein synthesis system (PURE system). Optimization of the PURE system revealed that the following factors and reaction conditions were needed for IgG synthesis: (1) inclusion of the disulfide bond isomerase DsbC, (2) adjustment of the GSH/GSSG ratio, (3) inclusion of the molecular chaperone DnaK and its cofactors, and (4) use of an extended incubation time. Synthesis temperature and template DNA ratio (light chain-/heavy chain-encoding) also had been optimized for each IgG. Under optimal conditions, peak production of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab reached 124 µg/mL. Furthermore, the active forms of other IgGs, including IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 subclasses, also were synthesized. These results provide basic information for the development of novel high-throughput expression and functional screening systems for IgG, as well as useful information for understanding the IgG synthesis process.",Molecular ontogeny of the stomach in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679499,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The origin of extracellular digestion in metazoans was accompanied by structural and physiological alterations of the gut. These adaptations culminated in the differentiation of a novel digestive structure in jawed vertebrates, the stomach. Specific endoderm/mesenchyme signalling is required for stomach differentiation, involving the growth and transcription factors: 1) Shh and Bmp4, required for stomach outgrowth; 2) Barx1, Sfrps and Sox2, required for gastric epithelium development and 3) Cdx1 and Cdx2, involved in intestinal versus gastric identity. Thus, modulation of endoderm/mesenchyme signalling emerges as a plausible mechanism linked to the origin of the stomach. In order to gain insight into the ancient mechanisms capable of generating this structure in jawed vertebrates, we characterised the development of the gut in the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula. As chondrichthyans, these animals retained plesiomorphic features of jawed vertebrates, including a well-differentiated stomach. We identified a clear molecular regionalization of their embryonic gut, characterised by the expression of barx1 and sox2 in the prospective stomach region and expression of cdx1 and cdx2 in the prospective intestine. Furthermore, we show that gastric gland development occurs close to hatching, accompanied by the onset of gastric proton pump activity. Our findings favour a scenario in which the developmental mechanisms involved in the origin of the stomach were present in the common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans."

Telomeres, the nucleoprotein structures with repetitive (TTAGGG) sequences at the end of chromosomes, are a molecular ""clock of life"", and alterations are associated with chronic disease. The shelterin complex (POT1, TRF1, TRF2, Tin2, Rap1, and POT1 and TPP1) plays an important role in maintaining telomere length and integrity, and any alteration in telomeres may activate DNA damage response (DDR) machinery resulting in telomere attrition. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of silica exposure on the regulation of the shelterin complex in an animal model. Male Fisher 344 rats were exposed by inhalation to Min-U-Sil 5 silica for 3, 6, or 12 wk at a concentration of 15 mg/m3 for 6 hr/d for 5 consecutive d/wk. Expression of shelterin complex genes was assessed in the lungs at 16 hr after the end of each exposure. Also, the relationship between increased DNA damage protein (γH2AX) and expression of silica-induced fibrotic marker, αSMA, was evaluated. Our findings reveal new information about the dysregulation of shelterin complex after silica inhalation in rats, and how this pathway may lead to the initiation of silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.",Nebulized hypertonic saline triggers nervous system-mediated active liquid secretion in cystic fibrosis swine trachea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679487,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Inhaled hypertonic saline (HTS) treatment is used to improve lung health in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The current consensus is that the treatment generates an osmotic gradient that draws water into the airways and increases airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. However, there is evidence that HTS may also stimulate active secretion of ASL by airway epithelia through the activation of sensory neurons. We tested the contribution of the nervous system and airway epithelia on HTS-stimulated ASL height increase in CF and wild-type swine airway. We used synchrotron-based imaging to investigate whether airway neurons and epithelia are involved in HTS treatment-triggered ASL secretion in CFTR-/- and wild-type swine. We showed that blocking parasympathetic and sensory neurons in airway resulted in ~50% reduction of the effect of HTS treatment on ASL volume in vivo. Incubating tracheal preparations with inhibitors of epithelial ion transport across airway decreased secretory responses to HTS treatment. CFTR-/- swine ex-vivo tracheal preparations showed substantially decreased secretory response to HTS treatment after blockage of neuronal activity. Our results indicated that HTS-triggered ASL secretion is partially mediated by the stimulation of airway neurons and the subsequent activation of active epithelia secretion; osmosis accounts for only ~50% of the effect.",C/EBPβ regulates Vegf gene expression in granulosa cells undergoing luteinization during ovulation in female rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679486,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"The ovulatory LH-surge increases Vegf gene expression in granulosa cells (GCs) undergoing luteinization during ovulation. To understand the factors involved in this increase, we examined the roles of two transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms in rat GCs. GCs were obtained from rats treated with eCG before, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after hCG injection. Vegf mRNA levels gradually increased after hCG injection and reached a peak at 12 h. To investigate the mechanism by which Vegf is up-regulated after hCG injection, we focused on C/EBPβ and HIF1α. Their protein expression levels were increased at 12 h. The binding activity of C/EBPβ to the Vegf promoter region increased after hCG injection whereas that of HIF1α did not at this time point. The C/EBPβ binding site had transcriptional activities whereas the HIF1α binding sites did not have transcriptional activities under cAMP stimulation. The levels of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, which are transcriptional repression markers, decreased in the C/EBPβ binding region after hCG injection. The chromatin structure of this region becomes looser after hCG injection. These results show that C/EBPβ regulates Vegf gene expression with changes in histone modifications and chromatin structure of the promoter region in GCs undergoing luteinization during ovulation.",Comparative prevalence of Oxalobacter formigenes in three human populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679485,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"There has been increasing interest in the human anaerobic colonic bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes because of its ability to metabolize oxalate, and its potential contribution to protection from calcium oxalate kidney stones. Prior studies examining the prevalence of this organism have focused on subjects in developed countries and on adults. Now using O. formigenes-specific PCR, we have compared the prevalence of these organisms among subjects in two remote areas in which modern medical practices have hardly been present with a USA group of mothers and their infants for the first three years of life. Among the Amerindians of the Yanomami-Sanema and Yekwana ethnic groups in Venezuela and the Hadza in Tanzania, O. formigenes was detected in 60-80% of the adult subjects, higher than found in adults from USA in this and prior studies. In young children, the prevalence was much lower in USA than in either tribal village. These data extend our understanding of the epidemiology of O. formigenes carriage, and are consistent with the hypothesis that the rising incidence of kidney stones is associated with the progressive loss of O. formigenes colonization in populations that have been highly impacted by modern medical practices.",Exposure to Pb impairs breeding success and is associated with longer lifespan in urban European blackbirds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679484,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"Although several factors have been highlighted to explain the influence of urbanization on bird fitness and survival, the role of persistent toxicants such as lead (Pb), which is typically present in urban areas worldwide, has seldom been studied despite the ecological importance of such a widespread stressor. Studying free-living European blackbirds (Turdus merula) in city parks, we tested the hypothesis that low-dose chronic exposure to Pb could shape the life-history traits of urban birds. The feather concentrations of Pb and cadmium were typical of urban areas and low-to-moderate contamination of sites. Although the lifetime breeding success of females decreased with increasing exposure to Pb, the lifespan and survival probabilities of blackbirds increased with Pb contamination regardless of gender. Breeding effort-dependent patterns in the relationship between lifespan and Pb levels were highlighted. No significant relationships were detected between cadmium and life-history traits. The results suggest a possible trade-off between self-maintenance and reproduction, with the most affected birds redirecting allocations towards their own survival, which is consistent with the ""stress hormone hypothesis"". These findings suggest that Pb pollution in urban environments may shape avian ecological features and be one of the drivers of wildlife responses to urbanization and that some urban areas may function as ecological traps driven by pollutants.",The viscosity-radius relationship for concentrated polymer solutions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679483,Scientific reports,2019 01 29,"A key assumption of polymer physics is that the random chain polymers extend in flow. Recent experimental evidence has shown that polymer chains compress in Couette flow in a manner counter to expectation. Here, scaling arguments and experimental evidence from the literature are used to determine the relationship between the viscosity, η, and chain radius of gyration, RG. The viscosity-radius of gyration relationship is found to be [Formula: see text] where m([Formula: see text]) is the power law exponent of the viscosity-temperature relationship that depends on the specific polymer-solvent system and the shear rate, [Formula: see text]. The viscosity is shown to be a power law function of the radius, and to decrease with decreasing radius under conditions where the chains are ideal random walks in concentrated solution. Furthermore, this relationship is consistent with both the widely observed viscosity-temperature and viscosity-shear rate behavior observed in polymer rheology. The assumption of extension is not consistent with these observations as it would require that the chains increase in size with increasing temperature. Shear thinning is thus a result of a decreasing radius with increasing shear rate as [Formula: see text] where n is the power law exponent. Furthermore, the thermal expansion coefficients determine the variation in the power law exponents that are measured for different polymer systems. Typical values of n enable the measured reduction in coils size behavior to be fitted. Furthermore, the notion that polymer chains extend to reduce the viscosity implies that an increasing chain size results in a reduced viscosity is addressed. This assumption would require that the viscosity increases with reducing coil radius which is simply unphysical.",Peculiar optical properties of bilayer silicene under the influence of external electric and magnetic fields.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679482,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the effect of an applied electric field on the optical and magneto-optical absorption spectra for AB-bt (bottom-top) bilayer silicene. The generalized tight-binding model in conjunction with the Kubo formula is efficiently employed in the numerical calculations. The electronic and optical properties are greatly diversified by the buckled lattice structure, stacking configuration, intralayer and interlayer hopping interactions, spin-orbital couplings, as well as the electric and magnetic fields ([Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text]). An electric field induces spin-split electronic states, a semiconductor-metal phase transitions and the Dirac cone formations in different valleys, leading to the special absorption features. The Ez-dependent low-lying Landau levels possess lower degeneracy, valley-created localization centers, peculiar distributions of quantum numbers, well-behaved and abnormal energy spectra in Bz-dependencies, and the absence of anti-crossing behavior. Consequently, the specific magneto-optical selection rules exist for diverse excitation categories under certain critical electric fields. The optical gaps are reduced as Ez is increased, but enhanced by Bz, in which the threshold channel might dramatically change in the former case. These characteristics are in sharp contrast with those for layered graphene.",Spatio-temporal overview of neuroinflammation in an experimental mouse stroke model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679481,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"After ischemic stroke, in the lesion core as well as in the ischemic penumbra, evolution of tissue damage and repair is strongly affected by neuroinflammatory events that involve activation of local specialized glial cells, release of inflammatory mediators, recruiting of systemic cells and vascular remodelling. To take advantage of this intricate response in the quest to devise new protective therapeutic strategies we need a better understanding of the territorial and temporal interplay between stroke-triggered inflammatory and cell death-inducing processes in both parenchymal and vascular brain cells. Our goal is to describe structural rearrangements and functional modifications occurring in glial and vascular cells early after an acute ischemic stroke. Low and high scale mapping of the glial activation on brain sections of mice subjected to 30 minutes middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was correlated with that of the neuronal cell death, with markers for microvascular changes and with markers for pro-inflammatory (IL-1β) and reparative (TGFβ1) cytokines. Our results illustrate a time-course of the neuroinflammatory response starting at early time-points (1 h) and up to one week after MCAO injury in mice, with an accurate spatial distribution of the observed phenomena.",The risks of HCV infection among Brazilian crack cocaine users: incorporating diagnostic test uncertainty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679480,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Despite the initiative by WHO and other international organizations to eliminate HCV in the medium term, hepatitis C infection is still a major public health problem. Even non-injecting drugs users who engage in harmful or addictive drug use are at greater risk of acquiring the infection, when compared to the general population. This study evaluate risk factors for HCV infection in users of crack/cocaine in Brazil, using multilevel models that incorporate variations in the sensitivity and specificity of the respective diagnostic tests. The sample included all the participants of a national survey on street crack cocaine users with serologically reactive result in the rapid test for the HCV as well as 4 non-reactive controls, matched by sex, age category, and major geographic region of residence. Multilevel logistic regression models were used, with and without incorporation of the diagnostic test's sensitivity and specificity values. The odds of HCV infection were 85% higher among polydrug users, 7.81 times higher among injecting drug users, and 3.69 times higher in those reporting to have genital ulcers. Statistical modeling strategies that incorporate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests in challenging settings are useful for studying the association between risk factors and infection status.","Ascorbic acid encapsulated into negatively charged liposomes exhibits increased skin permeation, retention and enhances collagen synthesis by fibroblasts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679479,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Ascorbic acid (AA) is widely used in cosmetic formulations due to its antioxidant property and ability to increase collagen synthesis. Here, we encapsulated AA in vesicles with different lipid compositions. Negative liposome charge favored AA skin retention, with accumulation of 37 ± 12 and 74 ± 23 μg/cm2 in the epidermis and dermis, respectively, after 6 hours. Drug flux was influenced by the formulation composition, and both the presence of cholesterol and the liposomes surface charge were able to increase the amount of AA crossing the skin. The formulation was stable for at least 30 days and promoted a 7-fold increase in flux compared to free AA. Additionally, liposomes were able to interact better with keratinocytes and fibroblasts membranes. In vitro efficacy studies demonstrated that associating AA to these liposomes resulted in increased effectiveness of type I collagen synthesis by fibroblasts and regeneration of UVA-induced damage in keratinocytes. Our results demonstrate the applicability of AA-negatively charged liposomes in promoting AA cutaneous permeation and increasing the retention and flux of this molecule in the skin. This formulation also increased AA stability and effectiveness, opening new perspectives for its application in view of reducing certain skin ageing outcomes."

Looming sounds that increase in intensity are processed preferentially by the brain. Thus, we investigated whether auditory looming cues can orient visuo-spatial attention more effectively than static and receding sounds. Specifically, different auditory cues could redirect attention away from a continuous central visuo-motor tracking task to peripheral visual targets that appeared occasionally. To investigate the time course of crossmodal cuing, Experiment 1 presented visual targets at different time-points across a 500 ms auditory cue's presentation. No benefits were found for simultaneous audio-visual cue-target presentation. The largest crossmodal benefit occurred at early cue-target asynchrony onsets (i.e., CTOA = 250 ms), regardless of auditory cue type, which diminished at CTOA = 500 ms for static and receding cues. However, auditory looming cues showed a late crossmodal cuing benefit at CTOA = 500 ms. Experiment 2 showed that this late auditory looming cue benefit was independent of the cue's intensity when the visual target appeared. Thus, we conclude that the late crossmodal benefit throughout an auditory looming cue's presentation is due to its increasing intensity profile. The neural basis for this benefit and its ecological implications are discussed.",Different mitogenomic codon usage patterns between damselflies and dragonflies and nine complete mitogenomes for odonates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679466,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Damselflies and dragonflies, of the order Odonata, have distinct body plans and predatory abilities. Knowledge of their various evolutionary histories will allow for an understanding of the genetic and phenotypic evolution of insects. Mitogenomes are suitable materials to elucidate this, but the mitogenome of only a few odonates have been annotated. Herein, we report the complete mitogenome of nine odonates, including seven dragonflies and two damselflies, and a comprehensive analysis of the codon usage in 31 Odonata mitogenomes with the aim to estimate their evolutionary characteristics. Overall, a weak codon bias exists among odonate mitogenomes, although this favours AT-ending codons. Damselflies have a weaker codon usage bias than dragonflies, and 37 codons have significantly different usages. Both directional mutation and purifying selection shape damselfly and dragonfly mitogenomes. Although inevitable, directional mutation bias plays a minor role, whereas purifying selection pressure is the dominant evolutionary force. A higher selection pressure is observed in dragonflies than in damselflies, but it mainly acts on codon usage patterns rather than amino acid translation. Our findings suggest that dragonflies might have more efficient mitochondrial gene expression levels than damselflies, producing more proteins that support their locomotion and predatory abilities.",Phase controlled SERS enhancement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679465,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has attracted increasing interest for chemical and biochemical sensing. Several studies have shown that SERS intensities are significantly increased when an optical interference substrate composed of a dielectric spacer and a reflector is used as a supporting substrate. However, the origin of this additional enhancement has not been systematically studied. In this paper, high sensitivity SERS substrates composed of self-assembled core-satellite nanostructures and silica-coated silicon interference layers have been developed. Their SERS enhancement is shown to be a function of the thickness of silica spacer on a more reflective silicon substrate. Finite difference time domain modeling is presented to show that the SERS enhancement is due to a spacer contribution via a sign change of the reflection coefficients at the interfaces. The magnitude of the local-field enhancement is defined by the interference of light reflected from the silica-air and silica-silicon interfaces, which constructively added at the hot spots providing a possibility to maximize intensity in the nanogaps between the self-assembled nanoparticles by changing the thickness of silica layer. The core-satellite assemblies on a 135 nm silica-coated silicon substrate exhibit a SERS activity of approximately 13 times higher than the glass substrate.",Analysis of Spatial Pattern Evolution and Influencing Factors of Regional Land Use Efficiency in China Based on ESDA-GWR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679464,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"In order to give an in-depth understanding of the contradictions arising from the land resource supply and demand, this study selected 30 provinces (some are autonomous regions or municipalities) in China to be the research unit, used the carbon emission as an undesirable output, and adopted the Super-SBM DEA model and ESDA-GWR method to research the evolution characteristics and influencing factors of land use efficiency in China in 2003-2013. The results indicated that: (1) The land use efficiency in China overall was moderately ineffective and the overall utilization level was low; (2) The Global Spatial Autocorrelation was instable and had maintained a high level; (3) The ""hot spots"" mainly being distributed in the southeast coastal regions and ""cold spots"" being found in the central and western regions, so that as time goes on, the pattern of ""high in the east and low in the west"" has been gradually formed and stabilized.

For the eastern coastal areas, the emphasis should be improving their OT, PF and PGDP, for the western region, should focus on improving its comprehensive economic development level to improve the DMSP/OLS, while strengthening the ecological environment to improve the level of NDVI.",Molecular Characterization of Carbapenem Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae Isolated from Lebanon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679463,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative organism and a major public health threat. In this study, we used whole-genome sequences to characterize 32 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) and two carbapenem-resistant K. quasipneumoniae (CRKQ). Antimicrobial resistance was assessed using disk diffusion and E-test, while virulence was assessed in silico. The capsule type was determined by sequencing the wzi gene. The plasmid diversity was assessed by PCR-based replicon typing to detect the plasmid incompatibility (Inc) groups. The genetic relatedness was determined by multilocus sequence typing, pan-genome, and recombination analysis. All of the isolates were resistant to ertapenem together with imipenem and/or meropenem. Phenotypic resistance was due to blaOXA-48, blaNDM-1, blaNDM-7, or the coupling of ESBLs and outer membrane porin modifications. This is the first comprehensive study reporting on the WGS of CRKP and the first detection of CRKQ in the region. The presence and dissemination of CRKP and CRKQ, with some additionally having characteristics of hypervirulent clones such as the hypermucoviscous phenotype and the capsular type K2, are particularly concerning.

The fruit of the genus Physalis, a berry, is encapsulated by a novel morphological feature of the post-floral, accrescent calyx that is referred to as a Chinese lantern. The evolutionary developmental genetics of the Chinese lantern have been investigated in the last decade; however, the selective values of the morphological novelty remain elusive. Here, we measured the photosynthetic parameters of the fruiting calyces, monitored microclimatic variation within the Chinese lanterns during fruit development, performed floral-calyx-removal experiments, and recorded the fitness-related traits in Physalis floridana. Ultimately, we show that the green-fruiting calyx of Physalis has photosynthetic capabilities, thus serving as an energy source for fruit development. Moreover, the developing Chinese lantern provides a microclimate that benefits the development and maturation of berry and seed, and it improves plant fitness in terms of fruit/seed weight and number, and fruit maturation under low-temperature environments. Furthermore, the lantern structure facilitates the dispersal of fruits and seeds by water and wind. Our results suggest that the Chinese lantern morphology of Physalis is an evolutionary adaptive trait and improves plant fitness, thus providing new insight into the origin of morphological novelties.",Binder-free graphene oxide doughs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679461,Nature communications,2019 01 30,"Graphene oxide (GO) sheets have been used to construct various bulk forms of GO and graphene-based materials through solution-based processing techniques.

The dough state can be diluted to obtain gels or dispersions, and dried to yield hard solids. It can be kneaded without leaving stains, readily reshaped, connected, and further processed to make bulk GO and graphene materials of arbitrary form factors and tunable microstructures. The doughs can be transformed to dense glassy solids of GO or graphene without long-range stacking order of the sheets, which exhibit isotropic and much enhanced mechanical properties due to hindered sliding between the sheets. GO dough is also found to be a good support material for electrocatalysts as it helps to form compliant interface to access the active particles.",Positively interacting strains that co-circulate within a network structured population induce cycling epidemics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679460,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is considered a common cause of pneumonia, causing about 15-20% of adult community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and up to 40% of cases in children. It has often been observed that MP epidemics last approximately 1-2 years and occur every 3-7 years, with the dominant strains alternating between epidemics. However, the underlying mechanism by which these cycles and changes in the dominant strains occur remains unclear. The traditional models for the periodicity of MP epidemics neglected two phenomena: structured contact patterns among people and co-circulating strains of MP. We also believe that the two distinctive aspects of MP epidemics: prevalent serotype shifts among epidemics and incidence cycling of MP, are interconnected. We propose a network transmission model that assumes two strains of MP are transmitted within a network structured population and they can interact as secondary infections with primary infections. Our studies show that multiple strains that co-circulate within a network structured population and interact positively generate the observed patterns of recurrent epidemics of MP. Hence our study provides a possible mechanism for the cycling epidemics of MP, and could provide useful information for future vaccine design and vaccine evaluation/monitoring processes.",Mechanisms for lyssavirus persistence in non-synanthropic bats in Europe: insights from a modeling study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679459,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Bats are natural reservoirs of the largest proportion of viral zoonoses among mammals, thus understanding the conditions for pathogen persistence in bats is essential to reduce human risk. Focusing on the European Bat Lyssavirus subtype 1 (EBLV-1), causing rabies disease, we develop a data-driven spatially explicit metapopulation model to investigate EBLV-1 persistence in Myotis myotis and Miniopterus schreibersii bat species in Catalonia. We find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis, and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The virus would not persist in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for EBLV-1 progression in M. schreibersii. Our approach can be readily adapted to other zoonoses of public health concern where long-range migration and habitat sharing may play an important role.","Collaborative efforts to forecast seasonal influenza in the United States, 2015-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679458,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Since 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted an annual influenza season forecasting challenge. The 2015-2016 challenge consisted of weekly probabilistic forecasts of multiple targets, including fourteen models submitted by eleven teams. Forecast skill was evaluated using a modified logarithmic score. We averaged submitted forecasts into a mean ensemble model and compared them against predictions based on historical trends. Forecast skill was highest for seasonal peak intensity and short-term forecasts, while forecast skill for timing of season onset and peak week was generally low. Higher forecast skill was associated with team participation in previous influenza forecasting challenges and utilization of ensemble forecasting techniques. The mean ensemble consistently performed well and outperformed historical trend predictions. CDC and contributing teams will continue to advance influenza forecasting and work to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts to facilitate increased incorporation into public health response efforts."

In total, 122 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy underwent the Wada test with propofol between 2006 and 2016 as part of presurgical evaluation at the Department of Neurosurgery of the Medical University of Warsaw. The Wada test was conducted bilaterally on 118 patients (236 cases). In four cases, due to complications, the test was conducted only unilaterally, which resulted in a total of 240 cases. Those cases were further analysed for the presence of adverse events. In all cases, intracranial circulation angiography (via the transfemoral approach) was performed before memory and language testing. Of the 122 patients, adverse events were observed in 75 patients (61.4%). Serious complications were notably rare and observed only in two patients (1.6%): one patient had a carotid artery dissection, and the other had a pseudoaneurysm at the puncture site. Mild adverse events (e.g., shivers or pain of the eye) were highly common - we observed them in 71 patients (58%), but they were short-term and well-tolerated by the subjects. Two patients (1.6%) had a seizure during the Wada test. Most of the adverse events occurring during the Wada test with propofol were mild and short-lived. Considering a small risk of serious damage to health, this procedure can be perceived as a good method for assessing language and memory in a fraction of the epilepsy surgery candidates.",Crystal structure of the plant symporter STP10 illuminates sugar uptake mechanism in monosaccharide transporter superfamily.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679446,Nature communications,2019 02 22,"Plants are dependent on controlled sugar uptake for correct organ development and sugar storage, and apoplastic sugar depletion is a defense strategy against microbial infections like rust and mildew. Uptake of glucose and other monosaccharides is mediated by Sugar Transport Proteins, proton-coupled symporters from the Monosaccharide Transporter (MST) superfamily. We present the 2.4 Å structure of Arabidopsis thaliana high affinity sugar transport protein, STP10, with glucose bound. The structure explains high affinity sugar recognition and suggests a proton donor/acceptor pair that links sugar transport to proton translocation. It contains a Lid domain, conserved in all STPs, that locks the mobile transmembrane domains through a disulfide bridge, and creates a protected environment which allows efficient coupling of the proton gradient to drive sugar uptake. The STP10 structure illuminates fundamental principles of sugar transport in the MST superfamily with implications for both plant antimicrobial defense, organ development and sugar storage.",Extracellular aggregated alpha synuclein primarily triggers lysosomal dysfunction in neural cells prevented by trehalose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679445,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Cell-to-cell propagation of aggregated alpha synuclein (aSyn) has been suggested to play an important role in the progression of alpha synucleinopathies. A critical step for the propagation process is the accumulation of extracellular aSyn within recipient cells. Here, we investigated the trafficking of distinct exogenous aSyn forms and addressed the mechanisms influencing their accumulation in recipient cells. The aggregated aSyn species (oligomers and fibrils) exhibited more pronounced accumulation within recipient cells than aSyn monomers. In particular, internalized extracellular aSyn in the aggregated forms was able to seed the aggregation of endogenous aSyn. Following uptake, aSyn was detected along endosome-to-lysosome and autophagosome-to-lysosome routes. Intriguingly, aggregated aSyn resulted in lysosomal activity impairment, accompanied by the accumulation of dilated lysosomes. Moreover, analysis of autophagy-related protein markers suggested decreased autophagosome clearance. In contrast, the endocytic pathway, proteasome activity, and mitochondrial homeostasis were not substantially affected in recipient cells. Our data suggests that extracellularly added aggregated aSyn primarily impairs lysosomal activity, consequently leading to aSyn accumulation within recipient cells. Importantly, the autophagy inducer trehalose prevented lysosomal alterations and attenuated aSyn accumulation within aSyn-exposed cells. Our study underscores the importance of lysosomes for the propagation of aSyn pathology, thereby proposing these organelles as interventional targets.",Social bonding drives vocal exchanges in Bonobos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679444,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"The origin of human speech is still a hotly debated topic in science. Evidence of socially-guided acoustic flexibility and proto-conversational rules has been found in several monkey species, but is lacking in social and cooperative great apes. Here we investigated spontaneous vocal interactions within a peaceful context in captive bonobos to reveal that vocal interactions obey temporally and social rules. Dyadic vocal interactions were characterized by call overlap avoidance and short inter-call intervals. Bonobos preferentially responded to conspecifics with whom they maintained close bonds. We also found that vocal sharing rate (production rate of shared acoustic variants within each given dyad) was mostly explained by the age difference of callers, as other individual characteristics (sex, kinship) and social parameters (affinity in spatial proximity and in vocal interactions) were not. Our results show that great apes spontaneously display primitive conversation rules guided by social bonds. The demonstration that such coordinated vocal interactions are shared between monkeys, apes and humans fills a significant gap in our knowledge of vocal communication within the primate phylogeny and highlights the universal feature of social influence in vocal interactions.",Unique Spin Vortices and Topological Charges in Quantum Dots with Spin-orbit Couplings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679442,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Spin textures of one or two electrons in a quantum dot with Rashba or Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings reveal several intriguing properties. We show here that even at the single-electron level stable spin vortices with tunable topological charges exist. These topological textures appear in the ground state of the dots. The textures are stabilized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and are robust against the eccentricity of the dot. The topological charge is directly related to the sign of the z component of the spin in a large dot, allowing a direct probe of its topological properties. This would clearly pave the way to possible future topological spintronics. The phenomenon of spin vortices persists for the interacting two-electron dot in the presence of a magnetic field.",PD-L1 Expression in Circulating Tumor Cells Increases during Radio(chemo)therapy and Indicates Poor Prognosis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679441,Scientific reports,2019 01 31,"Preclinical studies demonstrated that radiation up-regulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, providing a rationale for combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with radiation. However this has not been validated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer due to the difficulty to obtain serial biopsies. Measuring PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may allow real-time monitoring of immune activation in tumor. In this study, whole blood from non-metastatic NSCLC patients was collected before, during, and after radiation or chemoradiation using a microfluidic chip. PD-L1 expression in CTCs was assessed by immunofluorescence and qPCR and monitored through the course of treatment. Overall, PD-L1(+) CTCs were detected in 25 out of 38 samples (69.4%) with an average of 4.5 cells/ml. After initiation of radiation therapy, the proportion of PD-L1(+) CTCs increased significantly (median 0.7% vs. 24.7%, P < 0.01), indicating up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells in response to radiation. In addition, patients positive for PD-L1 (≥5% of CTCs positive for PD-L1) at baseline had shorter PFS. Gene expression analysis revealed that higher levels of PD-L1 were associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, CTCs can be used to monitor dynamic changes of PD-L1 during radiation therapy which is potentially prognostic of response to treatment.",Intrinsic and extrinsic noise of gene expression in lineage trees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679440,Scientific reports,2019 01 30,"Cell-to-cell heterogeneity is driven by stochasticity in intracellular reactions and the population dynamics. While these sources are usually studied separately, we develop an agent-based framework that accounts for both factors while tracking every single cell of a growing population. Apart from the common intrinsic variability, the framework also predicts extrinsic noise without the need to introduce fluctuating rate constants. Instead, extrinsic fluctuations are explained by cell cycle fluctuations and differences in cell age. We provide explicit formulas to quantify mean molecule numbers, intrinsic and extrinsic noise statistics in two-colour experiments. We find that these statistics differ significantly depending on the experimental setup used to observe the cells. We illustrate this fact using (i) averages over an isolated cell lineage tracked over many generations as observed in the mother machine, (ii) population snapshots with known cell ages as recorded in time-lapse microscopy, and (iii) snapshots with unknown cell ages as measured from static images or flow cytometry. Applying the method to models of stochastic gene expression and feedback regulation elucidates that isolated lineages, as compared to snapshot data, can significantly overestimate the mean number of molecules, overestimate extrinsic noise but underestimate intrinsic noise and have qualitatively different sensitivities to cell cycle fluctuations.",A child with perinatal HIV infection and long-term sustained virological control following antiretroviral treatment cessation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679439,Nature communications,2019 02 22,"Understanding HIV remission in rare individuals who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) soon after infection and then discontinued, may inform HIV cure interventions. Here we describe features of virus and host of a perinatally HIV-1 infected child with long-term sustained virological control. The child received early limited ART in the Children with HIV Early antiRetroviral therapy (CHER) trial. At age 9.5 years, diagnostic tests for HIV are negative and the child has characteristics similar to uninfected children that include a high CD4:CD8 ratio, low T cell activation and low CCR5 expression. Virus persistence (HIV-1 DNA and plasma RNA) is confirmed with sensitive methods, but replication-competent virus is not detected. The child has weak HIV-specific antibody and T cell responses. Furthermore, we determine his HLA and KIR genotypes. This case aids in understanding post-treatment control and may help design of future intervention strategies.",Structural basis for species-selective targeting of Hsp90 in a pathogenic fungus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679438,Nature communications,2019 02 22,"New strategies are needed to counter the escalating threat posed by drug-resistant fungi. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 affords a promising target because it supports survival, virulence and drug-resistance across diverse pathogens. Inhibitors of human Hsp90 under development as anticancer therapeutics, however, exert host toxicities that preclude their use as antifungals. Seeking a route to species-selectivity, we investigate the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp90 from the most common human fungal pathogen, Candida albicans. Here we report structures for this NBD alone, in complex with ADP or in complex with known Hsp90 inhibitors. Encouraged by the conformational flexibility revealed by these structures, we synthesize an inhibitor with >25-fold binding-selectivity for fungal Hsp90 NBD. Comparing co-crystals occupied by this probe vs. anticancer Hsp90 inhibitors revealed major, previously unreported conformational rearrangements. These insights and our probe's species-selectivity in culture support the feasibility of targeting Hsp90 as a promising antifungal strategy.",Abundance of non-conservative microplastics in the upper ocean from 1957 to 2066.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679437,Nature communications,2019 01 30,"Laboratory-based studies have suggested that marine organisms can be harmed by ingesting microplastics. However, unless the current and future microplastic abundance in the ocean environment is quantified, these experimental studies could be criticized for using an unrealistic density or sparsity of microplastics. Here we show the secular variations of pelagic microplastic abundance in the Pacific Ocean from 1957 to 2066, based on a combination of numerical modeling and transoceanic surveys conducted meridionally from Antarctica to Japan. Marine plastic pollution is an ongoing concern especially in the North Pacific, and pelagic microplastics are regarded as non-conservative matter due to the removal processes that operate in the upper ocean. The results of our numerical model incorporating removal processes on a 3-year timescale suggested that the weight concentrations of pelagic microplastics around the subtropical convergence zone would increase approximately twofold (fourfold) by 2030 (2060) from the present condition."

To address this question, here we investigate the molecular functions and genome-wide DNA binding patterns of AP-1 family members in primary and immortalized mouse macrophages. ChIP-sequencing shows overlapping and distinct binding profiles for each factor that were remodeled following TLR4 ligation. Development of a machine learning approach that jointly weighs hundreds of DNA recognition elements yields dozens of motifs predicted to drive factor-specific binding profiles. Machine learning-based predictions are confirmed by analysis of the effects of mutations in genetically diverse mice and by loss of function experiments. These findings provide evidence that non-redundant genomic locations of different AP-1 family members in macrophages largely result from collaborative interactions with diverse, locus-specific ensembles of transcription factors and suggest a general mechanism for encoding functional specificities of their common recognition motif.",Floquet group theory and its application to selection rules in harmonic generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679423,Nature communications,2019 01 30,"Symmetry is one of the most generic and useful concepts in science, often leading to conservation laws and selection rules. Here we formulate a general group theory for dynamical symmetries (DSs) in time-periodic Floquet systems, and derive their correspondence to observable selection rules. We apply the theory to harmonic generation, deriving closed-form tables linking DSs of the driving laser and medium (gas, liquid, or solid) in (2+1)D and (3+1)D geometries to the allowed and forbidden harmonic orders and their polarizations. We identify symmetries, including time-reversal-based, reflection-based, and elliptical-based DSs, which lead to selection rules that are not explained by currently known conservation laws. We expect the theory to be useful for ultrafast high harmonic symmetry-breaking spectroscopy, as well as in various other systems such as Floquet topological insulators.",Podocyte GSK3 is an evolutionarily conserved critical regulator of kidney function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679422,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Albuminuria affects millions of people, and is an independent risk factor for kidney failure, cardiovascular morbidity and death. The key cell that prevents albuminuria is the terminally differentiated glomerular podocyte. Here we report the evolutionary importance of the enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) for maintaining podocyte function in mice and the equivalent nephrocyte cell in Drosophila. Developmental deletion of both GSK3 isoforms (α and β) in murine podocytes causes late neonatal death associated with massive albuminuria and renal failure. Similarly, silencing GSK3 in nephrocytes is developmentally lethal for this cell. Mature genetic or pharmacological podocyte/nephrocyte GSK3 inhibition is also detrimental; producing albuminuric kidney disease in mice and nephrocyte depletion in Drosophila. Mechanistically, GSK3 loss causes differentiated podocytes to re-enter the cell cycle and undergo mitotic catastrophe, modulated via the Hippo pathway but independent of Wnt-β-catenin. This work clearly identifies GSK3 as a critical regulator of podocyte and hence kidney function.",Neuropathological correlates and genetic architecture of microglial activation in elderly human brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679421,Nature communications,2019 02 22,"Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, have important roles in brain health. However, little is known about the regulation and consequences of microglial activation in the aging human brain. Here we report that the proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM) in postmortem cortical tissue is strongly associated with β-amyloid, tau-related neuropathology, and the rate of cognitive decline. Effect sizes for PAM measures are substantial, comparable to that of APOE ε4, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and mediation models support an upstream role for microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease via accumulation of tau. Further, we identify a common variant (rs2997325) influencing PAM that also affects in vivo microglial activation measured by [11C]-PBR28 PET in an independent cohort. Thus, our analyses begin to uncover pathways regulating resident neuroinflammation and identify overlaps of PAM's genetic architecture with those of Alzheimer's disease and several other traits.",High-throughput single-cell rheology in complex samples by dynamic real-time deformability cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679420,Nature communications,2019 02 22,"In life sciences, the material properties of suspended cells have attained significance close to that of fluorescent markers but with the advantage of label-free and unbiased sample characterization. Until recently, cell rheological measurements were either limited by acquisition throughput, excessive post processing, or low-throughput real-time analysis. Real-time deformability cytometry expanded the application of mechanical cell assays to fast on-the-fly phenotyping of large sample sizes, but has been restricted to single material parameters as the Young's modulus. Here, we introduce dynamic real-time deformability cytometry for comprehensive cell rheological measurements at up to 100 cells per second. Utilizing Fourier decomposition, our microfluidic method is able to disentangle cell response to complex hydrodynamic stress distributions and to determine viscoelastic parameters independent of cell shape. We demonstrate the application of our technology for peripheral blood cells in whole blood samples including the discrimination of B- and CD4+ T-lymphocytes by cell rheological properties.","Disentangling polygenic associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, educational attainment, literacy and language.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679418,Translational psychiatry,2019 06 13,"Interpreting polygenic overlap between ADHD and both literacy-related and language-related impairments is challenging as genetic associations might be influenced by indirectly shared genetic factors. Here, we investigate genetic overlap between polygenic ADHD risk and multiple literacy-related and/or language-related abilities (LRAs), as assessed in UK children (N ≤ 5919), accounting for genetically predictable educational attainment (EA). Genome-wide summary statistics on clinical ADHD and years of schooling were obtained from large consortia (N ≤ 326,041). Our findings show that ADHD-polygenic scores (ADHD-PGS) were inversely associated with LRAs in ALSPAC, most consistently with reading-related abilities, and explained ≤1.6% phenotypic variation. These polygenic links were then dissected into both ADHD effects shared with and independent of EA, using multivariable regressions (MVR). Conditional on EA, polygenic ADHD risk remained associated with multiple reading and/or spelling abilities, phonemic awareness and verbal intelligence, but not listening comprehension and non-word repetition. Using conservative ADHD-instruments (P-threshold < 5 × 10-8), this corresponded, for example, to a 0.35 SD decrease in pooled reading performance per log-odds in ADHD-liability (P = 9.2 × 10-5). Using subthreshold ADHD-instruments (P-threshold < 0.0015), these effects became smaller, with a 0.03 SD decrease per log-odds in ADHD risk (P = 1.4 × 10-6), although the predictive accuracy increased. However, polygenic ADHD-effects shared with EA were of equal strength and at least equal magnitude compared to those independent of EA, for all LRAs studied, and detectable using subthreshold instruments. Thus, ADHD-related polygenic links with LRAs are to a large extent due to shared genetic effects with EA, although there is evidence for an ADHD-specific association profile, independent of EA, that primarily involves literacy-related impairments.",[Gender inequalities in the impacts of informal elderly caregiving in Gipuzkoa: CUIDAR-SE study].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679416,Revista espanola de salud publica,2019 04 03,"The provision of informal care determines the existence of health inequalities, as well as gender inequalities, because of women being the most frequent caregivers.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Sixty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: a normal skin group, and 5 groups with different types of flap: abdominal flap group, dorsal flap group, single-perforator flap group, double-perforators flap group, and delayed cutaneous nerve flap group. The vascular distribution characteristics of normal skin and various flap types were observed by gross morphology of specimens and X-ray after perfusion. RESULTS There were distinct differences in vascular anastomosis and density in dorsal and ventral SD rats. The area of flap survival in the dorsal flap group was superior to that in the abdominal flap group, but the flap axis of the 2 groups passed straight through the middle of the pedicle. The flap surviving area in the double-perforators flap group was remarkably larger than in the single-perforator flap group, while the flap axis in the single-perforator flap group passed straight through the perforators, and in the double-perforators flap group there was a linking vessel between the 2 perforators. There were linking and reticulate vessels, in addition, linking vessels and cutaneous nerves were concomitant in the delayed cutaneous nerve flap group. The flap axis was the travel route of the cutaneous nerve. CONCLUSIONS Variations in flap blood supply patterns and axes with alterations based on flap types have implications for flap survival. Understanding blood flow characteristics within each flap type and accurately designing the flap axis is essential for flap survival.",A Case of Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Adrenal Insufficiency Due to Ipilimumab Treatment for Advanced Melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679413,The American journal of case reports,2019 03 26,"BACKGROUND Ipilimumab is a therapeutic human monoclonal antibody that targets the T-cell inhibitory molecule, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and is classified as an immune checkpoint inhibitor that has been shown to improve prognosis in patients with advanced melanoma. However, several immune-related adverse events have been reported to be associated with ipilimumab Treatment. A case of acute exacerbation of chronic adrenal insufficiency is presented that highlights that glucocorticoid dosage for patients undergoing steroid treatment at the time of ipilimumab treatment has yet to be established. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with malignant melanoma on the sole of her right foot. During her second course of ipilimumab treatment, she developed acute adrenal insufficiency caused by isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency, which required treatment with oral hydrocortisone. However, the symptoms of her adrenal insufficiency worsened, and she commenced treatment with 12 courses of nivolumab, a therapeutic human monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on the surface of T-cells. She did not require corticosteroid support during nivolumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS This case report highlights the risk of exacerbating adrenal insufficiency during treatment with ipilimumab. The differences in clinical outcome in this patient between ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment might be explained by the different mechanisms between ipilimumab and nivolumab on immune function.","Scientizing Everyday Life, Rationalizing Eating Habits: The Rise of Nutrition Science in 1910s-1920s Japan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679412,Ui sahak,2019 02 15,"Historians of science have noted that modern nation-states and capitalism necessitated the systematic creation and implementation of a wide array of knowledge and technologies to produce a more productive and robust population. Commonly labeled as biopolitical practices in Foucauldian sense, such endeavors have often been discussed in the realms of public hygiene, housing, birth control, and child mortality, among others. This article is an attempt to extend the scope of the discussion by exploring a relatively understudied domain of nutrition science as a critical case of social engineering and intervention, specifically during and after World War I in the case of Japan. Research and dissemination of knowledge on food and health in Japan, like other industrializing nation-states, centered on new public hygiene initiatives since the late nineteenth-century. However, in the aftermath of WWI, or more precisely, after the Rice Riots of 1918, a new trend began to dominate the discourse of nutrition and health. In the face of wartime inflation and the resultant nation-wide riots, physicians and social scientists alike began to view the food choice and budget issue as a solution to the middle class crisis. This new perception drew on the conceptual framework to understand food, metabolism, and cost in the language of quantifiable nutrition vis-à-vis monetary values. By analyzing how specific nutritional knowledge was translated into the tenets for public campaigns to reform everyday life, this paper ultimately sheds light on the institutionalization of a new area of research, nutrition (eiyō) in Japan."

Conventionally, calcium and phosphorus metabolism abnormalities have been mainly attributed to the development of vascular calcification, but preventing vascular calcification is still difficult even if calcium and phosphorus levels are controlled. Additionally, the mechanisms of the development and progression of vascular calcification in patients with ESRD are still unknown. Recently, advanced glycation end products(AGEs)have been known to be involved in the development and promotion of bone abnormality, such as bone embrittlement and vascular calcification.

There are several biological mechanisms through which vascular calcification increases all-cause mortality and atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Arterial medial calcification increases arterial stiffness that causes systolic hypertension and diastolic dysfunction and heart failure. In contrast, arterial intimal calcification is strongly associated with atherosclerotic plaque burden, predicting adverse arterial events. In particular, micro-calcifications within the fibrous caps are through to increase local stress and risk of plaque rupture. While vascular calcification has originally through to be a passive process, it has become increasingly clear that calcification of both intimal and medial layers is an active and tightly regulated process in which dynamic phenotypic changes of vascular smooth muscle cells plays a major role. Interestingly, the driving factors for medial and intimal calcification differ. Whilst uremia and senescence, high serum calcium and phosphate levels drives medial calcification, inflammation and oxidative stress are critical for intimal calcification. Despite the different drivers and environmental cues, the medial and intimal arterial calcification shares common intracellular signaling cascades to promoter cellular reprogramming and phenotypic switching. Recent studies employing new technologies demonstrate that calcifying extracellular vesicles(EVs)that have specific mineralization-promoting cargos such as tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase(TNAP), annexins Ⅱ and Ⅵ, are released from vascular smooth muscle, macrophages, and valvular interstitial cells, and serve as calcifying foci. Recent study identified a specific trafficking protein, sortilin, as a key player in the formation of calcifying EVs secreted by vascular smooth muscle cells. Research on aortic valve calcification using spatiotemporal multi-omics identified many secreted and structural matrix proteins not previously implicated in valvular calcification, and revealed that inflammation is likely to be a significant contributor regardless of the layers and stages of the aortic stenosis progression.

This leads to significant Ca2+ influx through these receptors before the onset of hearing at postnatal day 12 (P12). Using a selective open channel blocker of CP-AMPARs, IEM-1460, we estimate that ∼80% of the AMPAR population are permeable to Ca2+ at immature P4-P5 synapses. However, after the onset of hearing, Ca2+ influx through these receptors was greatly reduced. We estimate that CP-AMPARs comprise approximately 40% and 33% of the AMPAR population at P18-P22 and P30-P34, respectively. By quantifying the rate of EPSC block by IEM-1460, we found an increased heterogeneity in glutamate release probability for adult-like calyces (P30-P34). Using tetraethylammonium (TEA), a presynaptic potassium channel blocker, we show that the apparent reduction of CP-AMPARs in more mature synapses is not a consequence of presynaptic action potential (AP) speeding. Finally, through postsynaptic AP recordings, we show that inhibition of CP-AMPARs reduces spike fidelity in juvenile synapses, but not in more mature synapses. We conclude that the expression of functional CP-AMPARs declines over early postnatal development in the calyx of Held synapse.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The calyx of Held synapse is pivotal to the circuitry that computes sound localization. Postsynaptic Ca2+ influx via AMPARs may be critical for signaling the maturation of this brainstem synapse. The GluA4 subunit may dominate the AMPAR complex at mature synapses because of its fast gating kinetics and large unitary conductance. The expectation is that AMPARs dominated by GluA4 subunits should be highly Ca2+ permeable. However, we find that Ca2+-permeable AMPAR expression declines during postnatal development. Using the rate of EPSC block by IEM-1460, an open channel blocker of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs, we propose a novel method to determine glutamate release probability and uncover an increased heterogeneity in release probability for more mature calyces of Held nerve terminals.",The Denominator problem: estimating the size of local populations of men-who-have-sex-with-men and rates of HIV and other STIs in Switzerland.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679393,Sexually transmitted infections,2019 05 17,"There is no estimate of the current number of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Switzerland, or of their geographical distribution.

In the mammalian cerebral cortex, different classes of GABAergic interneurons exhibit specific connectivity patterns that underlie their ability to shape temporal dynamics and information processing. Much progress has been made toward parsing interneuron diversity, yet the molecular mechanisms by which interneuron-specific connectivity motifs emerge remain unclear. In this study, we investigated transcriptional dynamics in different classes of interneurons during the formation of cortical inhibitory circuits in mouse. We found that whether interneurons form synapses on the dendrites, soma, or axon initial segment of pyramidal cells is determined by synaptic molecules that are expressed in a subtype-specific manner.

Short-lived annuals flower abundantly soon after germination, whereas longer-lived perennials postpone and spatially restrict flowering. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and interspecies gene transfer to understand divergence in reproductive patterns between annual and perennial crucifers. We show that in perennial Arabis alpina, flowering in response to winter cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of reproduction in annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct flowering pathways acting in parallel.",Pharmaceutical diversification via palladium oxidative addition complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679373,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",2019 02 15,"Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have transformed the exploration of chemical space in the search for materials, medicines, chemical probes, and other functional molecules.

Here, we describe a novel technique combining electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and turbidimetry, which has been utilised to monitor simultaneously platelet activation and oxygen radical generation. This technique has been used to investigate the redox-dependence of human and mouse platelets. Using selective peptide inhibitors of NOXs on human platelets and genetically modified mouse platelets (NOX1-/- or NOX2-/-), we discovered that:1) intracellular but not extracellular superoxide anion generated by NADPH oxidases (NOXs) is critical for platelet activation by collagen; 2) superoxide dismutation to hydrogen peroxide is required for thrombin-dependent activation; 3) NOX1 is the main source of oxygen radicals in response to collagen, while NOX2 is critical for activation by thrombin; 4) two platelet modulators, namely oxidised low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) and amyloid peptide β (Aβ), require activation of both NOX1 and NOX2 to pre-activate platelets. This study provides new insights on the redox dependence of platelet activation. It suggests the possibility of selectively inhibiting platelet agonists by targeting either NOX1 (for collagen) or NOX2 (for thrombin). Selective inhibition of either NOX1 or NOX2 impairs the potentiatory effect of tested platelet modulators (oxLDL and Aβ), but does not completely abolish platelet haemostatic function.

Here, we reported a case of a woman with CUP resistance to chemotherapy. We detected 450 cancer-related gene alterations using three metastatic tumor specimens and found the presence of EML4 exon13 and ALK exon20 fusion. The tumor did respond to crizotinib, a first-generation ALK inhibitor. When her tumor progressed, circulating tumor DNA detection revealed ALK L1196 M and G1269A mutation resistance to crizotinib, but she had a response to brigatinib. This case revealed that NGS technology used to detect the genetic alterations in patients with CUP might be a reliable method to find potential therapeutic targets, although the primary lesion could not always be confirmed.

We show here that ERK activation in this context is biphasic and that early and late activation events are mediated by distinct upstream signals that drive cell survival and apoptosis, respectively. We identified the nuclear kinase mitogen-sensitive kinase 1 (MSK1) as a downstream target of both early and late ERK activation. We also observed that activation of ERK→MSK1 up to 4 h after DNA damage depends on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as EGFR or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK)/ERK inhibitors or short hairpin RNA-mediated MSK1 depletion enhanced cell death. This prosurvival response was partially mediated through enhanced DNA repair, as EGFR or MEK/ERK inhibitors delayed DNA damage resolution. In contrast, the second phase of ERK→MSK1 activation drove apoptosis and required protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) but not EGFR. Genetic disruption of PKCδ reduced ERK activation in an in vivo irradiation model, as did short hairpin RNA-mediated depletion of PKCδ in vitro In both models, PKCδ inhibition preferentially suppressed late activation of ERK. We have shown previously that nuclear localization of PKCδ is necessary and sufficient for apoptosis. Here we identified a nuclear PKCδ→ERK→MSK1 signaling module that regulates apoptosis. We also show that expression of nuclear PKCδ activates ERK and MSK1, that ERK activation is required for MSK1 activation, and that both ERK and MSK1 activation are required for apoptosis.

Utilizing a high-throughput, genome-wide screen for miRNAs and mRNAs that are differentially regulated in osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, we report that miR-449a and miR-424, belonging to the miR-34 and miR-16 families, respectively, target the major S/G2 phase cyclin, cyclin A2 (CCNA2), in a bipartite manner. We found that the 3'-UTR of CCNA2 is recognized by miR-449a, whereas the CCNA2 coding region is targeted by miR-424. Of note, we observed loss of both miR-449a and miR-424 in OS, resulting in derepression of CCNA2 and appearance of aggressive cancer phenotypes. Ectopic expression of miR-449a and miR-424 significantly decreased cyclin A2 levels and inhibited proliferation rate, migratory potential, and colony-forming ability of OS cells. To further probe the roles of miR-449a and miR-424 in OS, we developed an OS mouse model by intraosseous injection of U2OS cells into the tibia bone of NOD-scid mice, which indicated that miR-449a and miR-424 co-expression suppresses tumor growth. On the basis of this discovery, we analyzed the gene expression of human OS biopsy samples, revealing that miR-449a and miR-424 are both down-regulated, whereas cyclin A2 is significantly up-regulated in these OS samples. In summary, the findings in our study highlight that cyclin A2 repression by miRNAs of the miR-16 and miR-34 families is lost in aggressive OS.","Universal fluorescent sensors of high-affinity iron transport, applied to ESKAPE pathogens.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679312,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 10,"Sensitive assays of biochemical specificity, affinity, and capacity are valuable both for basic research and drug discovery. We created fluorescent sensors that monitor high-affinity binding reactions and used them to study iron acquisition by ESKAPE bacteria, which are frequently responsible for antibiotic-resistant infections. By introducing site-directed Cys residues in bacterial iron transporters and modifying them with maleimide fluorophores, we generated living cells or purified proteins that bind but do not transport target compounds. These constructs sensitively detected ligand concentrations in solution, enabling accurate, real-time spectroscopic analysis of membrane transport by other cells. We assessed the efficacy of these ""fluorescent decoy"" (FD) sensors by characterizing active iron transport in the ESKAPE bacteria. The FD sensors monitored uptake of both ferric siderophores and hemin by the pathogens. An FD sensor for a particular ligand was universally effective in observing the uptake of that compound by all organisms we tested. We adapted the FD sensors to microtiter format, where they allow high-throughput screens for chemicals that block iron uptake, without genetic manipulations of the virulent target organisms. Hence, screening assays with FD sensors facilitate studies of mechanistic biochemistry, as well as discovery of chemicals that inhibit prokaryotic membrane transport. With appropriate design, FD sensors are potentially applicable to any pro- or eukaryotic high-affinity ligand transport process.",Conformational flexibility and inhibitor binding to unphosphorylated interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679311,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 10,"Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) is a key player in innate immune and inflammatory responses, performing a critical role in signal transduction downstream of Toll-like receptors and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptors. Upon ligand binding and via its N-terminal death domain, IRAK4 is recruited to an oligomeric receptor that is proximal to the Myddosome signaling complex, inducing IRAK4 kinase domain dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation. To date, all known IRAK4 structures are in the active conformation, precluding a good understanding of IRAK4's conformational dynamics. To address this issue, here we first solved three crystal structures of the IRAK4 kinase domain (at ≤2.6 Å resolution), in its unphosphorylated, inactive state bound to either the ATP analog AMP-PNP or to one of the two small-molecule inhibitors JH-I-25 and JH-I-17. The structures disclosed that although the structure in complex with AMP-PNP is in an ""αC-out"" inactive conformation, those in complex with type I inhibitors assume an active ""Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG)-in"" and ""αC-in"" conformation. The ability of unphosphorylated IRAK4 to take on variable conformations prompted us to screen for small-molecule inhibitors that bind preferentially to unphosphorylated IRAK4, leading to the identification of ponatinib and HG-12-6. Solving the structures of unphosphorylated IRAK4 in complex with these two inhibitors, we found that they both bind as type II inhibitors with IRAK4 in a ""DFG-out"" conformation. Collectively, these structures reveal conformational flexibility of unphosphorylated IRAK4 and provide unexpected insights into the potential use of small molecules to modulate IRAK4 activity in cancer, autoimmunity, and inflammation."

OC43 is in fact a host-range variant of the species Betacoronavirus-1, and more closely related to bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-its presumptive ancestor-and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV). The β1-coronaviruses (β1CoVs) and HKU1 employ glycan-based receptors carrying 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia). Receptor binding is mediated by spike protein S, the main determinant of coronavirus host specificity. For BCoV, a crystal structure for the receptor-binding domain S1A is available and for HKU1 a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the complete S ectodomain. However, the location of the receptor-binding site (RBS), arguably the single-most important piece of information, is unknown. Here we solved the 3.0-Å crystal structure of PHEV S1A We then took a comparative structural analysis approach to map the β1CoV S RBS, using the general design of 9-O-Ac-Sia-binding sites as blueprint, backed-up by automated ligand docking, structure-guided mutagenesis of OC43, BCoV, and PHEV S1A, and infectivity assays with BCoV-S-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis viruses. The RBS is not exclusive to OC43 and related animal viruses, but is apparently conserved and functional also in HKU1 S1A The binding affinity of the HKU1 S RBS toward short sialoglycans is significantly lower than that of OC43, which we attribute to differences in local architecture and accessibility, and which may be indicative for differences between the two viruses in receptor fine-specificity. Our findings challenge reports that would map the OC43 RBS elsewhere in S1A and that of HKU1 in domain S1B.",Zn-dependent bifunctional proteases are responsible for leader peptide processing of class III lanthipeptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679276,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 12,"Lanthipeptides are an important subfamily of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides, and the removal of their N-terminal leader peptides by a designated protease(s) is a key step during maturation. Whereas proteases for class I and II lanthipeptides are well-characterized, the identity of the protease(s) responsible for class III leader processing remains unclear. Herein, we report that the class III lanthipeptide NAI-112 employs a bifunctional Zn-dependent protease, AplP, with both endo- and aminopeptidase activities to complete leader peptide removal, which is unprecedented in the biosynthesis of lanthipeptides. AplP displays a broad substrate scope in vitro by processing a number of class III leader peptides. Furthermore, our studies reveal that AplP-like proteases exist in the genomes of all class III lanthipeptide-producing strains but are usually located outside the biosynthetic gene clusters. Biochemical studies show that AplP-like proteases are universally responsible for the leader removal of the corresponding lanthipeptides. In addition, AplP-like proteases are phylogenetically correlated with aminopeptidase N from Escherichia coli, and might employ a single active site to catalyze both endo- and aminopeptidyl hydrolysis. These findings solve the long-standing question as to the mechanism of leader peptide processing during class III lanthipeptide biosynthesis, and pave the way for the production and bioengineering of this class of natural products.",Canonical Wnt is inhibited by targeting one-carbon metabolism through methotrexate or methionine deprivation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679275,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 03,"The nutrient-sensing metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) controls one-carbon metabolism by donating methyl groups to biochemical building blocks, DNA, RNA, and protein. Our recent work uncovered a requirement for cytoplasmic arginine methylation during Wnt signaling through the activity of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), which transfers one-carbon groups from SAM to many protein substrates. Here, we report that treatments that decrease levels of the universal methyl donor SAM were potent inhibitors of Wnt signaling and of Wnt-induced digestion of extracellular proteins in endolysosomes. Thus, arginine methylation provides the canonical Wnt pathway with metabolic sensing properties through SAM. The rapid accumulation of Wnt-induced endolysosomes within 30 minutes was inhibited by the depletion of methionine, an essential amino acid that serves as the direct substrate for SAM production. We also found that methionine is required for GSK3 sequestration into multivesicular bodies through microautophagy, an essential step in Wnt signaling activity. Methionine starvation greatly reduced Wnt-induced endolysosomal degradation of extracellular serum proteins. Similar results were observed by addition of nicotinamide (vitamin B3), which serves as a methyl group sink. Methotrexate, a pillar in the treatment of cancer since 1948, decreases SAM levels. We show here that methotrexate blocked Wnt-induced endocytic lysosomal activity and reduced canonical Wnt signaling. Importantly, the addition of SAM during methionine depletion or methotrexate treatment was sufficient to rescue endolysosomal function and Wnt signaling. Inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway by decreasing one-carbon metabolism provides a platform for designing interventions in Wnt-driven disease.",Exploring fast proton transfer events associated with lateral proton diffusion on the surface of membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679274,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 12,"Proton diffusion (PD) across biological membranes is a fundamental process in many biological systems, and much experimental and theoretical effort has been employed for deciphering it. Here, we report on a spectroscopic probe, which can be tightly tethered to the membrane, for following fast (nanosecond) proton transfer events on the surface of membranes. Our probe is composed of a photoacid that serves as our light-induced proton source for the initiation of the PD process. We use our probe to follow PD, and its pH dependence, on the surface of lipid vesicles composed of a zwitterionic headgroup, a negative headgroup, a headgroup that is composed only from the negative phosphate group, or a positive headgroup without the phosphate group. We reveal that the PD kinetic parameters are highly sensitive to the nature of the lipid headgroup, ranging from a fast lateral diffusion at some membranes to the escape of protons from surface to bulk (and vice versa) at others. By referring to existing theoretical models for membrane PD, we found that while some of our results confirm the quasi-equilibrium model, other results are in line with the nonequilibrium model.",Dynamics of geologic CO2 storage and plume motion revealed by seismic coda waves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679273,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 12,"Quantifying the dynamics of sequestered CO2 plumes is critical for safe long-term storage, providing guidance on plume extent, and detecting stratigraphic seal failure. However, existing seismic monitoring methods based on wave reflection or transmission probe a limited rock volume and their sensitivity decreases as CO2 saturation increases, decreasing their utility in quantitative plume mass estimation. Here we show that seismic scattering coda waves, acquired during continuous borehole monitoring, are able to illuminate details of the CO2 plume during a 74-h CO2 injection experiment at the Frio-II well Dayton, TX. Our study reveals a continuous velocity reduction during the dynamic injection of CO2, a result that augments and dramatically improves upon prior analyses based on P-wave arrival times. We show that velocity reduction is nonlinearly correlated with the injected cumulative CO2 mass and attribute this correlation to the fact that coda waves repeatedly sample the heterogeneous distribution of cumulative CO2 in the reservoir zone. Lastly, because our approach does not depend on P-wave arrival times or require well-constrained wave reflections it can be used with many source-receiver geometries including those external to the reservoir, which reduces the risk introduced by in-reservoir monitoring wells. Our results provide an approach for quantitative CO2 monitoring and plume evolution that increases safety and long-term planning for CO2 injection and storage.",Identifying coupled clusters of allostery participants through chemical shift perturbations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679272,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 16,"Allosteric couplings underlie many cellular signaling processes and provide an exciting avenue for development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. A general method for identifying important residues in allosteric mechanisms would be very useful, but remains elusive due to the complexity of long-range phenomena. Here, we introduce an NMR method to identify residues involved in allosteric coupling between two ligand-binding sites in a protein, which we call chemical shift detection of allostery participants (CAP). Networks of functional groups responding to each ligand are defined through correlated NMR perturbations. In this process, we also identify allostery participants, groups that respond to both binding events and likely play a role in the coupling between the binding sites. Such residues exhibit multiple functional states with distinct NMR chemical shifts, depending on binding status at both binding sites. Such a strategy was applied to the prototypical ion channel KcsA. We had previously shown that the potassium affinity at the extracellular selectivity filter is strongly dependent on proton binding at the intracellular pH sensor. Here, we analyzed proton and potassium binding networks and identified groups that depend on both proton and potassium binding (allostery participants). These groups are viewed as candidates for transmitting information between functional units. The vital role of one such identified amino acid was validated through site-specific mutagenesis, electrophysiology functional studies, and NMR-detected thermodynamic analysis of allosteric coupling. This strategy for identifying allostery participants is likely to have applications for many other systems.",Realizing the potential of dielectric elastomer artificial muscles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679271,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Soft robotics represents a new set of technologies aimed at operating in natural environments and near the human body. To interact with their environment, soft robots require artificial muscles to actuate movement. These artificial muscles need to be as strong, fast, and robust as their natural counterparts. Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are promising soft transducers, but typically exhibit low output forces and low energy densities when used without rigid supports. Here, we report a soft composite DEA made of strain-stiffening elastomers and carbon nanotube electrodes, which demonstrates a peak energy density of 19.8 J/kg. The result is close to the upper limit for natural muscle (0.4-40 J/kg), making these DEAs the highest-performance electrically driven soft artificial muscles demonstrated to date. To obtain high forces and displacements, we used low-density, ultrathin carbon nanotube electrodes which can sustain applied electric fields upward of 100 V/μm without suffering from dielectric breakdown. Potential applications include prosthetics, surgical robots, and wearable devices, as well as soft robots capable of locomotion and manipulation in natural or human-centric environments.",Limits of multifunctionality in tunable networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679270,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 14,"Nature is rife with networks that are functionally optimized to propagate inputs to perform specific tasks. Whether via genetic evolution or dynamic adaptation, many networks create functionality by locally tuning interactions between nodes. Here we explore this behavior in two contexts: strain propagation in mechanical networks and pressure redistribution in flow networks. By adding and removing links, we are able to optimize both types of networks to perform specific functions. We define a single function as a tuned response of a single ""target"" link when another, predetermined part of the network is activated. Using network structures generated via such optimization, we investigate how many simultaneous functions such networks can be programed to fulfill. We find that both flow and mechanical networks display qualitatively similar phase transitions in the number of targets that can be tuned, along with the same robust finite-size scaling behavior. We discuss how these properties can be understood in the context of constraint-satisfaction problems.",Enhanced resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens by short tandem target mimic RNAs in tomato.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679269,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 27,"Nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins of the plant innate immune system are negatively regulated by the miR482/2118 family miRNAs that are in a distinct 22-nt class of miRNAs with a double mode of action. First, they cleave the target RNA, as with the canonical 21-nt miRNAs, and second, they trigger secondary siRNA production using the target RNA as a template. Here, we address the extent to which the miR482/2118 family affects expression of NLR mRNAs and disease resistance. We show that structural differences of miR482/2118 family members in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are functionally significant. The predicted target of the miR482 subfamily is a conserved motif in multiple NLR mRNAs, whereas for miR2118b, it is a noncoding RNA target formed by rearrangement of several different NLR genes. From RNA sequencing and degradome data in lines expressing short tandem target mimic (STTM) RNAs of miR482/2118, we confirm the different targets of these miRNAs. The effect on NLR mRNA accumulation is slight, but nevertheless, the tomato STTM lines display enhanced resistance to infection with the oomycete and bacterial pathogens. These data implicate an RNA cascade of miRNAs and secondary siRNAs in the regulation of NLR RNAs and show that the encoded NLR proteins have a role in quantitative disease resistance in addition to dominant gene resistance that has been well characterized elsewhere. We also illustrate the use of STTM RNA in a biotechnological approach for enhancing quantitative disease resistance in highly bred cultivars.","Proteome-wide, Structure-Based Prediction of Protein-Protein Interactions/New Molecular Interactions Viewer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679268,Plant physiology,2019 04 11,"Determining the complete Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein-protein interaction network is essential for understanding the functional organization of the proteome.

Here we present results from one such study using the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei We selected one set of lines to withstand heat stress and another oxidative stress. We then compared transcriptional responses to acute heat stress of both and an unselected control to the ancestral population using a weighted gene coexpression network analysis, finding that the transcriptional response is primarily dominated by a plastic response that is shared in the ancestor and all evolved populations. In addition, we identified several modules that respond to artificial selection by (1) changing the baseline level of expression, (2) altering the magnitude of the plastic response, or (3) a combination of the two.

The mir-35 family of microRNAs are expressed in the C. elegans germline and embryo and are essential for both viability and normal hermaphroditic sex determination, preventing aberrant male gene expression in XX hermaphrodite embryos. Here we show that combining feminizing mutations with partial loss of function of the mir-35 family results in enhanced penetrance embryonic lethality that preferentially kills XO animals. This lethal phenotype is due to altered signaling through the germline sex determination pathway, and maternal germline feminization is sufficient to induce enhanced lethality. These findings reveal a surprising pleiotropy of sperm-fate promoting pathways on organismal viability. Overall, our results demonstrate an unexpectedly strong link between sex determination and embryonic viability, and suggest that in wild type animals, mir-35 family members buffer against misregulation of pathways outside the sex determination program, allowing for clean sex reversal rather than deleterious effects of perturbing sex determination genes.",Drosophila female fertility and juvenile hormone metabolism depends on the type of Wolbachia infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679245,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 23,"Maternally inherited intracellular bacteria Wolbachia cause both parasitic and mutualistic effects on their numerous insect hosts, including manipulating the host reproductive system in order to increase the bacteria spreading in a host population, and increasing the host fitness. Here, we demonstrate that the type of Wolbachia infection determines the effect on Drosophila melanogaster egg production as a proxy for fecundity, and metabolism of juvenile hormone (JH), which acts as gonadotropin in adult insects. For this study, we used six D. melanogaster lineages carrying the nuclear background of interbred Bi90 lineage and cytoplasmic backgrounds with or without Wolbachia of different genotype variants. The wMelCS genotype of Wolbachia decreases egg production in infected D. melanogaster females in the beginning of oviposition and increases it later (from the sixth day after eclosion), whereas the wMelPop Wolbachia strain causes the opposite effect, and the wMel, wMel2 and wMel4 genotypes of Wolbachia do not show any effect on these traits compared with uninfected Bi90 D. melanogaster females. The intensity of JH catabolism negatively correlates with the fecundity level in the flies carrying both wMelCS and wMelPop Wolbachia The JH catabolism in females infected with genotypes of the wMel group does not differ from that in uninfected females. The effects of wMelCS and wMelPop infection on egg production can be levelled by the modulation of JH titre (via precocene/JH treatment of the flies). Thus, at least one of the mechanisms promoting the effect of Wolbachia on D. melanogaster female fecundity is mediated by JH.",Hawaiian monk seals exhibit behavioral flexibility when targeting prey of different size and shape.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679244,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 03 06,"Animals use diverse feeding strategies to capture and consume prey, with many species switching between strategies to accommodate different prey.

However, little is known about flexibility in the feeding behavior of many large marine predators. Here, we documented the feeding behavior and kinematics of the endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi, n=7) through controlled feeding trials. Seals were fed multiple prey types (e.g. night smelt, capelin, squid and herring) that varied in size and shape to examine behavioral flexibility in feeding. Hawaiian monk seals primarily used suction feeding (91% of all feeding trials) across all prey types, but biting, specifically pierce feeding, was also observed (9% of all feeding trials). Suction feeding was characterized by shorter temporal events, a smaller maximum gape and gape angle, and a fewer number of jaw motions than pierce feeding; suction feeding kinematic performance was also more variable compared with pierce feeding. Seals showed behavioral flexibility in their use of the two strategies. Suction feeding was used most frequently when targeting small to medium sized prey and biting was used with increasing frequency on larger prey. The feeding kinematics differed between feeding strategies and prey types, showing that Hawaiian monk seals adjusted their behaviors to particular feeding contexts. Hawaiian monk seals are opportunistic marine predators and their ability to adapt their feeding strategy and behavior to specific foraging scenarios allows them to target diverse prey resources."

Previously, we determined that p53 deficiency sensitizes head and neck cancer cells to AZD1775, a WEE1 kinase inhibitor, and translated our findings into a phase I clinical trial. Here, we investigate how p53 affects cellular responses to AZD1775 at the molecular level. We found that p53 modulates both replication stress and mitotic deregulation triggered by WEE1 inhibition. Without p53, slowing of replication forks due to replication stress is exacerbated. Abnormal, γH2AX-positive mitoses become more common and can proceed with damaged or underreplicated DNA. p53-deficient cells fail to properly recover from WEE1 inhibition and exhibit fewer 53BP1 nuclear bodies despite evidence of unresolved damage. A faulty G1-S checkpoint propagates this damage into the next division. Together, these deficiencies can intensify damages in each consecutive cell cycle in the drug.

Current uses for NIPT include fetal sex determination and screening for chromosomal disorders such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). However, NIPT may be expanded to many different future applications. There are a potential host of ethical concerns around the expanding use of NIPT, as examined by the recent Nuffield Council report on the topic. It is important to examine what NIPT might be used for before these possibilities become consumer reality. There is limited research exploring views of women on possible future uses of NIPT, particularly those of women who have undergone NIPT. In this study, we examined the views of women who undertook NIPT previously on the acceptability of and interest levels in using NIPT for a number of current and possible future applications. These included several medical conditions encompassing psychiatric, neurodevelopmental and adult-onset conditions as well as non-medical traits such as intelligence. One thousand women were invited to participate and 235 eligible surveys were received. Women generally reported an interest in using NIPT for medical conditions that severely impacted quality of life and with an onset earlier in life and stressed the importance of the accuracy of the test. Concerns were raised about the use of NIPT for non-medical traits. Respondents indicated that termination of pregnancy was not their only reason for testing, particularly in the case of sex.

COPD is now widely accepted as a heterogeneous condition with multiple phenotypes and endotypes. Thus, there is a pressing need for COPD care to move from the current ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to a precision medicine approach that takes into account individual patient variability in genes, environment and lifestyle. Precision medicine is enabled by biomarkers that can: 1) accurately identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from therapeutics and those who will only experience harm (predictive biomarkers); 2) predict therapeutic responses to drugs at an individual level (response biomarkers); and 3) segregate patients who are at risk of poor outcomes from those who have relatively stable disease (prognostic biomarkers).

However, we lack therapeutics to protect the insulin-producing β-cells from inflammatory damage. Closing this clinical gap requires the establishment of new disease models of islet inflammation to facilitate screening efforts aimed at identifying new protective agents. Here, we have developed a genetic model of Interleukin-1β (Il-1β)-driven islet inflammation in zebrafish, a vertebrate that allows for non-invasive imaging of β-cells and in vivo drug discovery. Live imaging of immune cells and β-cells in our model revealed dynamic migration, increased visitation and prolonged macrophage retention in the islet, together with robust activation of NF-κB signalling in β-cells. We find that Il-1β-mediated inflammation does not cause β-cell destruction but, rather, it impairs β-cell function and identity. In vivo, β-cells exhibit impaired glucose-stimulated calcium influx and reduced expression of genes involved in function and maturity. These defects are accompanied by α-cell expansion, glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia following a glucose challenge. Notably, we show that a medicinal plant derivative (wedelolactone) is capable of reducing the immune-cell infiltration while also ameliorating the hyperglycemic phenotype of our model. Importantly, these anti-diabetic properties in zebrafish are predictive of wedelolactone's efficacy in protecting rodent and human islets from cytokine-induced apoptosis. In summary, this new zebrafish model of diabetes opens a window to study the interactions between immune and β-cells in vivo, while also allowing the identification of therapeutic agents for protecting β-cells from inflammation."

Regulatory network underlying the adaptation of cancer cells to the harsh microenvironment remains unclear. We determined the mechanistic role of LIM and senescent cell antigen-like-containing domain protein 1 (LIMS1) in cancer cell survival under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions.Experimental Design: The expression level of LIMS1 was determined by IHC staining and analyzing the mRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas of three human solid tumors. Roles of LIMS1 in cancer cell metabolism and growth were determined by molecular and cell biology methods. A jetPEI nanocarrier was used as the vehicle for anti-LIMS1 siRNAs in mouse models of cancer therapeutics.Results: LIMS1 expression was drastically elevated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). High LIMS1 level was associated with advanced TNM stage and poor prognosis of patients with tumor. Increased LIMS1 expression was pivotal for tumor cells to survive in the oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions. Mechanistically, LIMS1 enhanced GLUT1 expression and membrane translocation, which facilitated tumor cell adaptation to the glucose deprivation stress. Furthermore, LIMS1 promoted HIF1A protein translation by activating AKT/mTOR signaling, while hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) transactivated LIMS1 transcription, thus forming a positive feedback loop in PDAC cell adaptation to oxygen deprivation stress. Inhibition of LIMS1 with jetPEI nanocarrier-delivered anti-LIMS1 siRNAs significantly increased cell death and suppressed tumor growth.Conclusions: LIMS1 promotes pancreatic cancer cell survival under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions by activating AKT/mTOR signaling and enhancing HIF1A protein translation. LIMS1 is crucial for tumor adaptation to oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions and is a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",Sulforaphane Suppresses the Growth of Triple-negative Breast Cancer Stem-like Cells In vitro and In vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679159,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2019 03 29,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the poorest prognosis among all of breast cancer subtypes with no currently available effective therapy. In this study, we hypothesized that sulforaphane, a dietary component abundant in broccoli and its sprouts, can inhibit malignant cell proliferation and tumor sphere formation of cancer stem-like cells (CSC) in TNBC. CSC population was isolated using FACS analysis with the combined stem cell surface markers, CD44+/CD24-/CD49f+ The effect of sulforaphane on a stem-related embryonic oncogene CRIPTO-1/TDGF1 (CR1) was evaluated via ELISA. In vivo, BalbC/nude mice were supplemented with sulforaphane before and after TNBC cell inoculation (daily intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg sulforaphane/kg for 5 and 3 weeks, respectively), and the effects of sulforaphane during mammary tumor initiation and growth were accessed with NanoString gene analysis. We found that sulforaphane can inhibit cell proliferation and mammosphere formation of CSCs in TNBC. Further analysis of gene expression in these TNBC tumor cells revealed that sulforaphane significantly decreases the expression of cancer-specific CR1, CRIPTO-3/TDGF1P3 (CR3, a homologue of CR1), and various stem cell markers including Nanog, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), Wnt3, and Notch4. Our results suggest that sulforaphane may control the malignant proliferation of CSCs in TNBC via Cripto-mediated pathway by either suppressing its expression and/or by inhibiting Cripto/Alk4 protein complex formation. Thus, the use of sulforaphane for chemoprevention of TNBC is plausible and warrants further clinical evaluation.","A Synthetic DNA, Multi-Neoantigen Vaccine Drives Predominately MHC Class I CD8+ T-cell Responses, Impacting Tumor Challenge.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679156,Cancer immunology research,2019 06 10,"T-cell recognition of cancer neoantigens is important for effective immune-checkpoint blockade therapy, and an increasing interest exists in developing personalized tumor neoantigen vaccines.

The metabolic patterns of cancer cells are elaborately reprogrammed to fulfill the high biomass demands of rapid propagation. ROS, the byproducts of metabolic processes, are accumulated in cancer cells partially due to metabolic abnormalities or oncogenic mutations. To prevent oxidative damage, cancer cells can orchestrate metabolic adaptation to maintain reduction-oxidation (redox) balance by producing reducing equivalents. ROS, acting as second messengers, can in turn manipulate metabolic pathways by directly or indirectly affecting the function of metabolic enzymes. In this review we discuss how cancer cell metabolism and redox signaling are intertwined, with an emphasis on the perspective of targeting metabolic-redox circuits for cancer therapy."

However, it is not clear if factors other than cognitive impairment influence performance on VR measures. Many people with schizophrenia have significant negative symptoms and they could reduce engagement in assessment. 158 patients with schizophrenia performed the VRFCAT, were tested with the MCCB, were rated with the PANSS, and were rated on everyday functioning. Scores for reduced emotional experience and reduced expression were derived. Reduced emotional experience, but not reduced expression, was correlated with socially relevant VRFCAT subtasks and real-world social functioning. Performance on the socially relevant subtasks, but not the solitary subtasks, shared variance with work outcomes. MCCB performance was associated with both subdomains, but socially relevant subtasks shared more variance. Patients with higher reduced emotional experience validly engaged in socially relevant VR simulations, as indexed by correlations with outcome measures.

A,2019 05 10,"The selective and sensitive determination of potential genotoxic methanesulfonate impurities in drug substances is highly challenging. A new method is reported for testing of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and isopropyl methanesulfonate (IPMS) in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Headspace single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) with room-temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) as extractant was employed to preconcentrate analytes and eliminate the drug matrix simultaneously. In order to increase volatilities for HS extraction and to improve their reactivity of the further derivatization at the same time, sodium iodide (NaI) was added to the sample to derivatize methanesulfonates to the corresponding iodoalkanes. The iodoalkanes in the extract were derivatized with N, N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) after HS-SDME, followed by separation and detection with high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). Several important parameters, including reaction temperature, reaction time and concentration of NaI, sample volume, microdrop volume, stirring rate, salt addition, extraction time, concentration, reaction time and reaction temperature of DDTC were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, LODs and LOQs of all methanesulfonates were 15 ng mL-1 and 40 ng mL-1, respectively. Linearity (correlation coefficient values r > 0.999) and precision (the relative standard deviations were 1.0-4.6%) of six repeated injections were obtained. The recoveries at three spiked concentration levels were all in the range of 86.2-107.5% with the relative standard deviations <3.5%. The method reported here avoids interference of drug substances efficiently and detects methanesulfonate impurities in high sensitivity by HPLC-UV in Imatinib Mesylate and Levofloxacin Mesylate.",Matrix effect screening for cloud-point extraction combined with liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry: Bioanalysis of pharmaceuticals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679045,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 10,"Matrix effects are one of the most challenging issues in the analysis of complex samples using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Apart from the instrumental origin, these effects are also related to sample preparation. Cloud-point extraction (CPE) is rarely combined with LC-MS as it requires the use of surfactants which might interfere with droplet evaporation. Thus, they are suspected to cause a significant matrix effect (signal suppression). In this paper, 73 model drugs with different physicochemical properties were screened to analyse how susceptible LC-MS is to the absolute and relative matrix effect (ME) when coupled with CPE for measurements in human plasma. Three combinations of the surfactant Triton X-114 concentration (1.5% or 6%) and extraction temperature (40 or 55 °C) in six pH values gave over 1300 analyte-sample preparation condition pairs. A new term - surfactant effect (calculated for the standard solution) - allowed us to distinguish between the surfactant effect and that related to interferences from human plasma. The screening revealed that CPE combined with LC-MS is not related to a significant ME in the optimal pH of extraction. A significant absolute ME (<85% or>115%) was observed only for 25% of the analytes. Data processing (principal component analysis, classification trees, partial least squares-discriminant analysis) based on the extraction conditions and molecular descriptors helped to identify compounds prone to the matrix effect and speed up method development. A low surfactant concentration and low temperature decreased both the absolute and relative ME. pH of the extraction influenced only the relative ME. Low retention time reduced the risk of relative ME, whereas high polarity and the possibility of hydrogen bond formation minimized the occurrence of the surfactant effect and absolute ME. A significant relative ME (>15%) was observed only for 11% of the compounds, thus CPE merged with LC-MS allowed to measure drug concentrations in a reliable manner for majority of compounds. The presented approach may be further applied to other analytes and matrices.",Electrochemical preparation of standard gas mixtures using solid-state electrolyte membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679044,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 04 25,"A novel electrochemical method of preparation of standard gas mixtures for calibration of gas-analytical equipment with O2, H2 and CO was elaborated. Utilization of solid state electrolyte membrane allows to perform a nearly 100%-efficient electrochemical generation or conversion of the analyte and avoid some problems typical for liquid electrolytes, such as solvent evaporation and condensation at the inner walls of the gas tubes or deviations from the Faraday's law. Analysis of uncertainties associated with the calibration procedure showed that the lowest systematic errors are achieved when the calibrant is generated during the electrolysis (i.e. anodic evolution of oxygen or cathodic generation of CO), and the major uncertainties are associated with operation of the flow controllers. For calibration with H2, where the calibrant is partially converted during the electrochemical process, the total uncertainty is essentially determined by molar fractions of the components in H2-Ar mixture, instrumental errors of the equipment, primarily by precision of mass-flow controllers or stability of the gas flow, and the initial flow rate of the calibrant-containing gas mixture. The relative total errors of calibration with oxygen are assessed to be 5-6%; similar uncertainties were calculated for analysis of oxygen content in standard gas mixtures by chromatography using the electrochemical method of calibration.",Sensitive analysis of trehalose-6-phosphate and related sugar phosphates in plant tissues by chemical derivatization combined with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679043,Journal of chromatography.

To substantiate our mass spectrometric data, we analysed the stage-specific synthesis and importance for male fertility of a number of uncharacterized proteins. For example, Mst84B (gene CG1988), a very basic cysteine- and lysine-rich nuclear protein and was present in the transition phase from a histone-based to a protamine-based chromatin structure. CG6332 encodes d-Theg, which is related to the mouse tHEG and human THEG proteins. Mutants of d-Theg were sterile due to the lack of sperm in the seminal vesicles. Our catalogue of proteins of the different stages of testis development in D. melanogaster will pave the road for future analyses of spermatogenesis.",Quality of the blood donation campaign in the military: A sample from Turkey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679028,Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine,2019 01 25,"In this study, the conformity of blood donation services performed by Turkish Red Crescent Mobile Medical Team in a Basic Military Training Centre to quality standards was researched and the results were discussed by taking the principles of biomedical ethics into consideration.",Validation of a novel integral disease index for evaluating the grade of activity in Mexican patients with ulcerative colitis: A prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679027,Revista de gastroenterologia de Mexico,2019 01 25,"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation affecting the colon.

However, the risk factors and optimal treatment modality for E. dermatitidis infection are unknown to date. Herein, we present a fatal case of E. dermatitidis infection in an adult patient that developed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection. The dematiaceous fungus caused a breakthrough fungemia despite prophylactic administration of micafungin. Although the patient was intensively treated with liposomal-amphotericin B and voriconazole, serum level of beta-D-glucan continuously increased, and the patient eventually died because of cerebral hemorrhage. An autopsy found multiple involvements of the fungal infection at the bilateral lungs, thoracic cavities, diaphragm, and thyroid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of E. dermatitidis infection involving these tissues as determined via autopsy. This case highlights the importance of attention for Exophiala infection in immunocompromised individuals in those given antifungal therapy with echinocandins.",Determination of local micromotion at the stem-neck taper junction of a bi-modular total hip prosthesis design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679024,Medical engineering & physics,2019 06 08,"High rates of clinical complications with bi-modular hip prostheses are attributed to failure of the stem-neck taper junction. Taper wear analyses have shown extensive material loss as a result of corrosion, potentially initiated by micromotion. The purpose of the study was to determine the amount of micromotion at this junction for different loading, assembly and material conditions. Micromotion between the neck adapter (CoCr29Mo6-alloy) and the stem (TiMo12Zr6Fe2-alloy; both Rejuvenate, Stryker) within the taper junction of a bi-modular hip stem were determined by image matching analysis of consecutively recorded images through windows in the stem component. A finite element model was used to determine the micromotion in the taper regions outside the windows and validated with the measured micromotion. With the model, the influence of the load amplitude, assembly force and component materials were then investigated. Determined micromotion (14-79 µm) by far exceeded critical values (5 µm) associated with the onset of fretting corrosion. Increasing assembly forces achieved a significant reduction in micromotion. The numerical model revealed insufficient assembly to cause the neck to perform rocking motions under load, repetitively changing taper contact in combination with gap opening, which facilitates fluid ingress into the junction. Changing the stem material to a stiffer Ti-alloy achieved a reduction of the micromotion of about 30%. This study emphasises the high importance of material selection, assembly force and loading on the susceptibility of bi-modular hip stems to fretting and crevice corrosion. These findings can serve to explain the increased rate of clinically reported problems with this particular prosthesis design.",Assessing the feasibility of adaptive planning for prostate radiotherapy using Smartadapt deformable image registration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679023,Medical engineering & physics,2019 05 03,"The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of adaptive planning for prostate cancer using SmartAdapt deformable image registration (DIR), in an effort to reduce the effect of patient-specific variations.","Rutin and curcumin reduce inflammation, triglyceride levels and ADA activity in serum and immune cells in a model of hyperlipidemia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679022,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",2019 04 29,"Hyperlipidemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory disorders. Adenosine and adenosine deaminase (ADA) modulate immune responses and lipid metabolism. Curcumin and rutin are polyphenols with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic effects. We evaluated the action of rutin and curcumin in the lipid levels and inflammation, as well as their effect on ADA activity in serum, lymphocytes, platelets, and neutrophils of hyperlipidemic rats. Adult male Wistar rats pretreated with curcumin and/or rutin for 30 days were submitted to Poloxamer-407- induced hyperlipidemia. Biochemical, hematological, and oxidative stress parameters, as well as serum and extracellular ADA activity, were performed 36h post-induction. Hyperlipidemia was confirmed by the increase in total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG). Hematological alterations, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) and ADA activities were observed in hyperlipidemic rats. Curcumin and the curcumin/rutin association decreased TG and increased high-density lipids (HDL) levels. The pretreatments prevented changes in the hematological parameters, decreased the activities of MPO in plasma and ADA in serum and cells. Cholesterol and ROS levels were not altered by the pretreatments. Our results show that pretreatments with rutin and/or curcumin prevent the hyperlipidemia-induced inflammation. Pretreatments with curcumin and/or rutin are potential complementary therapies in the prevention of hypertriglyceridemia and inflammation.",Reduced flexion rotation test in women with chronic and episodic migraine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679019,Brazilian journal of physical therapy,2019 01 25,"To compare flexion rotation test and global active cervical mobility in women with chronic migraine, episodic migraine, and headache-free controls.

While T and B cell abnormalities contribute to disease pathogenesis, recent work suggests that inflammatory M1-like macrophages also play a role. Previous work showed that the TLR2/1 agonist PAM3CSK4 (PAM3) could stimulate normal human monocytes to preferentially differentiate into immunosuppressive M2-like rather than inflammatory M1-like macrophages. This raised the possibility of PAM3 being used to normalize the M1:M2 ratio in SLE. Consistent with that possibility, monocytes from lupus patients differentiated into M2-like macrophages when treated with PAM3 in vitro. Furthermore, lupus-prone NZB x NZW F1 mice responded similarly to weekly PAM3 treatment. Normalization of the M2 macrophage frequency was associated with delayed disease progression, decreased autoantibody and inflammatory cytokine synthesis, reduced proteinuria and prolonged survival in NZB x NZW F1 mice. The ability of PAM3 to bias monocyte differentiation in favor of immunosuppressive macrophages may represent a novel approach to the therapy of SLE.",Sacubitril/valsartan: A practical guide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679005,Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,2019 01 25,"Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are a cornerstone in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Sacubitril/valsartan modulates the neurohormonal axis by inhibiting both angiotensin receptors and neprilysin, and improves neurohormonal balance more than blocking the RAAS alone. The PARADIGM-HF trial validated this new treatment option for patients with HFrEF. Sacubitril/valsartan was also more effective than enalapril in slowing disease progression by decreasing the risk of worsening heart failure requiring hospitalization or emergency admission and the need for intensified therapy, heart failure devices or cardiac transplantation. More than 70% of patients included in PARADIGM-HF were in NYHA class II, and overall, the results indicate that sacubitril/valsartan should be started in the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. As PARADIGM-HF has excellent robustness for a cardiovascular trial, sacubitril/valsartan has been included as a new treatment option with a strong level of recommendation in the main international guidelines.

Seven databases were searched. A total of 996 maxillary osteotomies were analysed, 864 performed with conventional tools and 132 with a piezoelectric device. One hundred and fifty-six complication events were reported. The complications, in descending order of overall prevalence, were as follows: neurosensory disturbance (64.7%), haemorrhage (8.3%), oroantral communication (7.7%), soft tissue injury (7.7%), tooth injury (5.1%), infection (3.2%), osteonecrosis (1.9%), and permanent nerve injury (1.3%). Among the complications, the results showed the highest prevalence for neurosensory disturbance, and haemorrhage was the most reported complication and the second most prevalent complication. A three-fold meta-analysis was performed. Using GRADEpro, the level of evidence was determined for each complication. The current low level of evidence suggests that piezoelectric bone surgery reduces critical and important complications during maxillary osteotomy procedures, such as neurosensory disturbance, haemorrhage, oroantral communication, tooth injury, and permanent nerve injury. However, an effective comparison between the two techniques was difficult to perform with the current available literature. Due to the small sample sizes in the piezoelectric surgery studies, caution should be exercised when considering almost non-existent reported complications.",Dominantly inherited distal nemaline/cap myopathy caused by a large deletion in the nebulin gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30679003,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,2019 03 03,"We report the first family with a dominantly inherited mutation of the nebulin gene (NEB). This ∼100 kb in-frame deletion encompasses NEB exons 14-89, causing distal nemaline/cap myopathy in a three-generation family. It is the largest deletion characterized in NEB hitherto. The mutated allele was shown to be expressed at the mRNA level and furthermore, for the first time, a deletion was shown to cause the production of a smaller mutant nebulin protein. Thus, we suggest that this novel mutant nebulin protein has a dominant-negative effect, explaining the first documented dominant inheritance of nebulin-caused myopathy. The index patient, a young man, was more severely affected than his mother and grandmother. His first symptom was foot drop at the age of three, followed by distal muscle atrophy, slight hypomimia, high-arched palate, and weakness of the neck and elbow flexors, hands, tibialis anterior and toe extensors. Muscle biopsies showed myopathic features with type 1 fibre predominance in the index patient and nemaline bodies and cap-like structures in biopsies from his mother and grandmother.

A phylogenetic analysis detected the Scalindua and Brocadia genera together with some anammox-like bacterial clusters, which suggested a higher diversity in the studied ecosystem than in open ocean environment, where only Scalindua genus was detected. A redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) content in sediments significantly influenced anammox bacterial abundance of. Spearman correlation analyses confirmed that the spatial variation in anammox bacterial abundance was highly correlated with TOC (P<0.01) and TN (P<0.01) contents in sediments.",Medical and aesthetic procedural dermatology recommendations for transgender patients undergoing transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678999,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,2019 05 19,"Transgender individuals may transition to their identified gender through social, hormonal, and procedural methods by using a multidisciplinary team of health care providers, including dermatologists.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death in the world. A characteristic symptom of cardiovascular disease is occlusion of vessels. Once vascular occlusion occurs there is a critical need to re-establish flow to prevent ischemia in the downstream tissues. In the most advanced cases, flow is re-established by creating a secondary flow path around the blockage, bypass grafting. For large diameter applications, synthetic conduits are successfully implanted, however in small diameter applications re-occlusion occurs and there is a critical need for new vascular grafts. There are many strategies and approaches that are being employed to design an effective and successful vascular graft. However, to date, there are no clinically available small diameter vascular grafts that are consistently successful in vivo long term (>7 years). As an effort to develop a successful graft there are several tissue engineering approaches: cell sheets, synthetic and natural biomaterial platforms, and decellularized extracellular matrices that are being investigated.

A specific branch of microfluidics comprises open fluidic systems, which is mainly characterized by displaying a higher air/liquid interface when compared with traditional closed-channel setups. The use of open channel systems has enabled the design of singular architectures in devices that are simple to fabricate and to clean. Enhanced functionality and accessibility for liquid handling are additional advantages inputted to technologies based on open fluidics. While benchmarked against closed fluidics approaches, the use of directly accessible channels decreases the risk of clogging and bubble-driven flow perturbation. In this review, we discuss the advantages of open fluidics systems when compared to their closed fluidics counterparts. Platforms are analyzed in two separated groups based on different confinement principles: wall-based physical confinement and wettability-contrast confinement. The physical confinement group comprises both open and traditional microfluidics; examples based on open channels with rectangular and triangular cross-section, suspended microfluidics, and the use of narrow edge of a solid surface for fluid confinement are addressed. The second group covers (super)hydrophilic/(super)hydrophobic patterned surfaces, and examples based on polymer-, textile- and paper-based microfluidic devices are explored. The technologies described in this review are critically discussed concerning devices' performance and versatility, manufacturing techniques and fluid transport/manipulation methods.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 01 25,"The purpose of the present work was to evaluate in vivo different antimicrobial therapies to eradicate osteomyelitis created in the femoral head of New Zealand rabbits. Five phosphate-based cements were evaluated: calcium phosphate cements (CPC) and calcium phosphate foams (CPF), both in their pristine form and loaded with doxycycline hyclate, and an intrinsic antimicrobial magnesium phosphate cement (MPC; not loaded with an antibiotic). The cements were implanted in a bone previously infected with Staphylococcus aureus to discern the effects of the type of antibiotic administration (systemic vs. local), porosity (microporosity, i.e. <5 μm vs. macroporosity, i.e. >5 μm) and type of antimicrobial mechanism (release of antibiotic vs. intrinsic antimicrobial activity) on the improvement of the health state of the infected animals. A new method was developed, with a more comprehensive composite score that integrates 5 parameters of bone infection, 4 parameters of bone structural integrity and 4 parameters of bone regeneration. This method was used to evaluate the health state of the infected animals, both before and after osteomyelitis treatment. The results showed that the composite score allows to discern statistically significant differences between treatments that individual evaluations were not able to identify. Despite none of the therapies completely eradicated the infection, it was observed that macroporous materials (CPF and CPFd, the latter loaded with doxycycline hyclate) and intrinsic antimicrobial MPC allowed a better containment of the osteomyelitis. This study provides novel insights to understand the effect of different antimicrobial therapies in vivo, and a promising comprehensive methodology to evaluate the health state of the animals was developed. We expect that the implementation of such methodology could improve the criteria to select a proper antimicrobial therapy.",A novel smart PEGylated gelatin nanoparticle for co-delivery of doxorubicin and betanin: A strategy for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678974,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"Betanin (BET) can reduce the side effects of potent anticancer drugs e.g. doxorubicin (DOX) on the normal tissues in co-administration with them because of the synergistic therapeutic effect and consequently the reduced required amount of anticancer agents. Despite interest in the use of BET, incomplete oral absorption and low stability of BET limit its application. Thus, in this study to overcome the restrictions of BET and providing the synergistic effect of DOX@BET, we designed a new pH-responsive nanocarrier via decoration of gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) by (methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly ((2-dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate-co-itaconic acid) (PGNPs). DOX and BET were effectively loaded (the loading capacity of 20.5% and 16.25%, respectively) into the PGNPs and this nanoplatform exhibited the suitable small particle size (162 nm). Additionally, the triggered release ability of drugs was studied through the assessment of simulated physiological and tumor tissue environments and showed the controlled release of DOX and BET with adjusting the pH of environment. Moreover, the synergistic effect of DOX@BET loaded PGNPs decreased the cell viability amount of breast cancer cells (MCF-7) respect to the free form of DOX or BET which indicated that the developed smart nanocarrier will be a hopeful nanocarrier for cancer therapy."

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"Turmeric nanofibers (TNF) were used as reinforcement in the gum arabic (GA), maltodextrin (MDX) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrices to enhance the physicochemical properties. The TNF were prepared from turmeric spent by acid hydrolysis accompanied by high pressure homogenization. The thermal and mechanical properties, structure morphology and antimicrobial activities of the prepared nanocomposites were investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data indicate that the addition of TNF significantly increased the onset temperature (To), peak temperature (Tp) and conclusion temperature (Tc) of the melting peaks of nanocomposites, but considerably decreased the enthalpy change values. The tensile properties showed that the addition of TNF enhanced mechanical properties due to the formation of networks within the GA, MDX and PEG. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed the films of GA-TNF and MDX-TNF show smooth, homogenous surface due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and the film of PEG-TNF shows good dispersion of TNF with PEG matrix with rough surface because of strong interfacial adhesion between TNF and PEG and strong hydrogen bonding, which are further confirmed by the FT-IR spectroscopy. XRD results exhibited the disappearances of peaks of TNF indicating the reinforcement of TNF in the prepared nanocomposite matrices. The antibacterial tests show the prepared nanocomposites exhibited excellent antibacterial performance against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhimurium.","Preparation, characterization, corrosion behavior and cytocompatibility of NiTiO3 nanosheets hydrothermally synthesized on biomedical NiTi alloy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678960,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"The present work reports on the hydrothermal synthesis of nanosheets on biomedical NiTi alloy in pure water. The results show rhombohedral NiTiO3 nanosheets with thickness of 6 nm can be grown at 200 °C. Hydrothermal treatment enhances the corrosion resistance of the NiTi alloy. 30 min of the treatment significantly reduces Ni ion release, while prolonged hydrothermal time results in increased Ni ion release because of the growth of the nanosheets with large specific surface area. Excitingly, the nanosheets can well support cell growth, which suggests the release amount can be well tolerated. Good corrosion resistance and cytocompatibility combined with large specific surface area render the nanosheets promising as safe and efficient drug carriers of the biomedical NiTi alloy.",Antibacterial investigation of titanium-copper alloys using luminescent Staphylococcus epidermidis in a direct contact test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678959,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"Commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti), used as oral implants, is often populated by various bacterial colonies in the oral cavity. These bacteria can cause Peri-implantitis, leading to loss of bone tissue and failure of implants. With the increased awareness of antibiotic resistance, research has been directed towards alternative solutions and recent findings have indicated titanium‑copper (Ti-Cu) alloys as a promising antibacterial material. The aim of this study was to produce homogeneous Ti-Cu alloys, with various concentrations of copper, and to characterise their antibacterial properties through direct contact tests, using luminescent bacteria, in addition to traditional materials characterisation techniques. Samples of CP-Ti and four different Ti-Cu alloys (1, 2.5, 3 and 10 wt%Cu) were produced in an arc-furnace, heated treated and rapidly quenched. X-ray diffraction revealed that Ti2Cu, was present only in the 10 wt%Cu alloy, however, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated precipitates at the grain boundaries of the 3 wt%Cu alloy, which were confirmed to be of a copper rich phase by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. EDS line scans confirmed that the alloys were homogenous. After 6 h, a trend between copper content and antibacterial rate could be observed, with the 10 wt%Cu alloy having the highest rate. SEM confirmed fewer bacteria on the 3 wt%Cu and especially the 10 wt%Cu samples. Although the 10 wt%Cu alloy gave the best antibacterial results, it is desired that the Cu concentration is below ~3 wt%Cu to maintain similar mechanical and corrosive performance as CP-Ti. Therefore, it is proposed that future work focuses on the 3 wt%Cu alloy.",Implantable composite devices of unsintered hydroxyapatite and poly-l-lactide with dispersive marbling morphology to enhance in vivo bioactivity and bioresorbability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678958,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"A bone fixation device made of unsintered hydroxyapatite (u-HA) particles uniformly dispersed in a poly-l-lactide matrix and reinforced by compressive forging (uniformly dispersed composite; UDC) has been clinically applied in several fields. However, it has reported some foreign body reactions over a long implantation period due to its slow bioresorbability. To further enhance its bioresorbability, we developed devices comprising a fibrous assembly of poly-l-lactide only three-dimensionally intertwined with particulate hydroxyapatite/poly-l-lactide composite. The biological behavior of the proposed material, provisionally referred to as complementarily reinforced composite (CRC), was compared with that of UDC in vivo. Cylindrical rods of UDC and CRC with 3.2-mm diameters were inserted bilaterally into the intramedullary distal femurs of 32 male Japanese white rabbits. Eight rabbits were euthanized at four, eight, 12, and 25 weeks after insertion. There were no significant differences between the mechanical properties of UDC and CRC over time. However, the results from histological analyses, surface characterization, radiological analyses, and push-out mechanical testing substantiated CRC's superior affinity to bone and enhanced bioactivity and bioresorbability in comparison with UDC. These characteristics were attributed to the dispersive marbling morphology produced by the CRC material's successive connectivity of u-HA particles throughout the PLLA matrix, which would accelerate PLLA hydrolysis degradation by H2O intrusion and enhance the bioactivity of u-HA particles exposed on the interface soon after implantation.",Enhanced in-vitro osteoblastic functions on β-type titanium alloy using surface mechanical attrition treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678957,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"To improve the osseointegration of titanium based implants, we herein modified Ti-25Nb-3Mo-2Sn-3Zr, a β-type titanium alloy by means of surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT). X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope results jointly indicate that SMAT process refined the average grain size of β phase in the surface layer of the alloy from about 110 μm to 26 nm. Besides, the surface properties and in-vitro cell culture tests of the SMAT-processed samples were investigated compared to those on the non-treated samples. Atomic force microscope and hydrophilicity tests revealed that the SMAT-processed surface was much rougher and hydrophilic than the non-treated surface. In vitro experimental results showed that SMAT-processed surface promoted adsorption of total protein as well as anchoring proteins such as vitronectin and fibronectin on its surface from cell culture medium, furthermore, significant improvements of osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and extracellular mineralization were also found on the SMAT-processed surface compared to the non-treated surface. This could be attributed to the grain refinement as well as increased surface hydrophilicity and roughness after SMAT process.

Gelatin influence, however, was in a reverse manner. nHA played imperative roles in promoting microencapsulated osteoblastic cell proliferation and function due to its bioactivity and mechanical strength improvement of hydrogels to the modulus range of mineralized bone tissue in vivo. The results and their statistical analysis also revealed the importance of interaction effect of gelatin and nHA. Proliferation and osteogenic function of the cells fluctuated with increasing gelatin concentration of microcapsules in the presence of nHA, demonstrating that hydrogel properties should be balanced to provide an efficient 3D osteoconductive microcapsule. Alginate (1%)-gelatin (2.5%)-nHA (0.5%) microcapsule with compressive modulus of 0.19 MPa ± 0.02, swelling ratio of 52% ± 8 (24 h) and degradation rate of 12% ± 4 (96 h) revealed a maximum performance for the cell proliferation and function, indicating a potential microcapsule composition to prepare building blocks for modular bone tissue engineering.",Investigation of citric acid-assisted sol-gel synthesis coupled to the self-propagating combustion method for preparing bioactive glass with high structural homogeneity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678954,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"In this research, the mechanism of an efficient strategy for the synthesis of 58S bioglass with high structural homogeneity by a citric acid assisted sol-gel route was investigated. This is an interesting approach to prepare bioactive glass via the sol-gel method with application potential in bone tissue engineering and also for the development of new biomedical devices. Herein, 58S bioglass was synthesized by two routes: conventional sol-gel method (CSG) and citric acid assisted sol-gel route coupled to the self-propagating combustion method (SPC). The effects of citric acid on the temperature required for 58S vitreous consolidation, long- and short-range ordering were investigated by several analysis techniques. Results suggested that citric acid molecules serve as an effective molecular template formed by molecular network raised from intermolecular forces, especially the hydrogen bonds, resulting from the chemical interactions between the COOH and hydroxyl groups (water, ethanol, POH, SiOH). In this scenario, citric acid controls the phase segregation during the drying and combustion steps of the gel in the SPC method by establishing chemical interactions (hydrogen bonds) with the superficial silanol groups present on the small-sized silica nanoparticles present in the sol governing their growth. Besides these mentioned features, the self-propagating combustion behavior exhibited by the nitrate-citrate in the SPC xerogel during the combustion step allowed the removal of the organic load and the consolidation of the vitreous structure at a temperature considerably lower than the sample obtained by the CSG method. Consequently, the SPC method leads to the formation of a glass structure with high homogeneity for the 58S, whereas the conventional sol-gel method produces a matrix enriched with calcium phosphate crystalline nuclei - glass-ceramic.",Biocompatible thermo- and magneto-responsive shape-memory polyurethane bionanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678953,"Materials science & engineering.

Due to the structure of the reactants, the behavior of the polyurethane matrix differs from common polyurethanes, since the soft segment was formed by a diisocyanate and a chain extender, whereas the macrodiol served as hard segment. The influence of the magnetite nanoparticles on the thermal and mechanical properties and the shape-memory behavior was studied. It was observed that magnetite nanoparticles interacted with macrodiol-rich domains and decreased the overall crystallinity of the material, although their presence did not affect the mechanical properties to a great extent. At the same time, the magnetite nanoparticles increased the shape fixity and contributed to shape recovery. The bionanocomposites exhibited magnetic behavior and could be easily heated in an alternating magnetic field, allowing fast and almost complete shape recovery. Preliminary cytotoxicity, hemocompatibility, and cell adhesion analysis suggest that the new materials are benign and potentially useful for biomedical applications.",Combined magnetic porous molecularly imprinted polymers and deep eutectic solvents for efficient and selective extraction of aristolochic acid I and II from rat urine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678952,"Materials science & engineering.

Thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of sound powders were also used to support the analysis. As the temperature increased, the CIXRD increased exhibiting a behavior like that of the crystal grain size, and the CIIR increased until the β-TCP phase appeared. These results indicated that the CIIR was more variable to structural changes than the CIXRD."

The present study describes the preparation, characterization and biological evaluation of aqueous phase ONPs of potent 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazole derivative (BZ6) for anticancer activity. BZ6-ONPs were characterized through UV-absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic analysis for their photo-physical properties. DLS, TEM and SEM studies were carried out for morphological and structural analysis. Cytotoxicity determination on a panel of four different cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MiaPaca-2, HT-29 and HCT-116) revealed that the BZ6-ONPs show highest activity in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Surprisingly, the BZ6-ONPs were found to be non-toxic towards normal breast epithelial fR2 cells. Additionally, the FITC-ONPs showed enhanced uptake in 3D tumor spheroids of MCF-7 cells compared to the free FITC. BZ6-ONPs strongly halted cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, possibly through oxidative stress-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, molecular mechanism-based studies revealed that BZ6-ONPs downregulated AKT/NF-κB/vimentin/survivin-mediated oncogenic signaling pathway promoting cell proliferation and malignancy.

GCMC results showed that the adsorption capacity of 5-Fluorouracil on the studied ZIFs is slightly higher than those of Thioguanine. The order of adsorption capacities of the two studied drugs on ZIFs structures is ZIF-6 > ZIF-3 > ZIF-1, where ZIF-6 shows a higher adsorption capacity for both drugs than the two other ZIFs due to its larger pore volume. Also, the isosteric heats of adsorption of both drugs in ZIF-6 are greater than those of ZIF-3 and ZIF-1. The preferential adsorption sites of 5-Fluorouracil and Thioguanine in ZIF-1 and ZIF-6 are surrounding the cage II (4-membered Zn-imidazolate ring). Finally, the microscopic details of the adsorbates in the studied ZIFs are investigated through radial distribution functions (RDFs) for characteristic atoms of drugs and ZIFs.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"Nanoscale supramolecular systems have been increasingly gaining importance as drug release vehicles due to their ability to target tumor cells. In this work, we have developed a new class of nanoassemblies derived from the phytosterol 24-EpiBrassinolide (EpiB) for the development of nanocarriers for the anticancer drug Doxorubicin (DOX). EpiB is a biocompatible cholesterol mimic, and has inherent apoptotic properties toward cancer cells. Thus, by encapsulating DOX within a nanocarrier with innate anticancer ability we have developed a targeting system that can enhance the uptake and efficacy of DOX in tumor cells. The nanocarriers were formed by self-assembly of EpiB. The morphologies of assemblies formed were dependent upon the concentration of EpiB used. While at low concentrations, spherical nanoassemblies were formed, at higher concentration, lamellar aggregates with birefringence properties were observed. Our results indicated that the drug loaded nanocarriers showed diffusion controlled release of the drug, and demonstrated antiproliferative effects, cellular uptake and were apoptotic against HeLa cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, EpiB loaded DOX enhanced both apoptosis and uptake into the cell's nuclei. These supramolecular assemblies may have potential applications for enhancing efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs through passive targeting.","Efficient synthesis of multiply substituted 7H-indeno[2,1-c]quinoline using 7-aminonaphthalene-1,3-disulfonic acid supported on LDHs as catalyst.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678931,"Materials science & engineering.

The powders are fabricated into resins via simple hot pressing under a pressure of 31.2 MPa at temperatures in the range 150-180 °C. The results indicate that the B. mori resins have higher micro-Vickers hardness, three-point bending strength, and elastic modulus (66 Hv, 122 MPa, and 8.7 GPa, respectively) compared to the Eri silk resins (58 Hv, 95 MPa, and 8.2 GPa, respectively). The better mechanical properties of the fibroin resins are related directly to longer drying times. The optimum drying conditions are found to be at a temperature of 100 °C under a-vacuum of -0.1 MPa for a time of 7 d. ATR-FTIR and XRD results show how the fibroin structure changes after resinification and drying.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 05 03,"Herein TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) were fabricated via electrochemical anodization and coated with silver and calcium phosphate (CaP) nanoparticles (NPs) by electrophoretic deposition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed that Ag and CaP NPs were successfully deposited onto the TiO2 NTs. Using X-ray diffraction, only anatase and Ti were observed after deposition of Ag and CaP NPs. However, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed that the binding energy (BE) of the Ag and CaP NP core levels corresponded to metallic Ag, hydroxyapatite and amorphous calcium phosphate, based on the knowledge that CaP NPs synthesized by precipitation have the nanocrystalline structure of hydroxyapatite. The application of Ag NPs allows for decreasing the water contact angle and thus increasing the surface free energy. It was concluded that the CaP NP surfaces are superhydrophilic. A significant antimicrobial effect was observed on the TiO2 NT surface after the application of Ag NPs and/or CaP NPs compared with that of the pure TiO2 NTs. Thus, fabrication of TiO2 NTs, Ag NPs and CaP NPs with PEI is promising for diverse biomedical applications, such as in constructing a biocompatible coating on the surface of Ti that includes an antimicrobial effect.",The potential of the three-dimensional printed titanium mesh implant for cranioplasty surgery applications: Biomechanical behaviors and surface properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678927,"Materials science & engineering.

The biomechanical behaviors of the PS-Ti cranial mesh implants with different pore structures (square, circular and triangular) and thicknesses (0.2, 0.6 and 1 mm) were simulated using finite element analysis. Surface properties of the 3DP-Ti cranial mesh implant were performed by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and static contact angle goniometer. It was found that the stress distribution and peak Von Mises stress of the PS-Ti cranial mesh implants significantly decreased at the thickness of 1 mm. The PS-Ti mesh implant with the circular pore structure created a relatively lower Von Mises stress on the bone defect area as compared to the PS-Ti mesh implant with the triangular pore structure and square pore structure. Moreover, the spherical-like Ti particle structures were formed on the surface of the 3DP-Ti cranial mesh implant. The microstructure of the 3DP-Ti mesh implant was composed of α and rutile-TiO2 phases. For wettability evaluation, the 3DP-Ti cranial mesh implant possessed a good hydrophilicity surface. Therefore, the 3DP-Ti cranial mesh implant with the thickness of 1 mm and circular pore structure is a promising biomaterial for cranioplasty surgery applications."

Accordingly, research in tissue engineering is focused on the stimulation of angiogenesis or generation of a vascular network in the scaffolds prior to implantation. A novel, xeno-free, collagen/hyaluronic acid-based poly(l-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLC/COL/HA) (20/9.5/0.5 w/w/w) microfibrous scaffold was produced by electrospinning. Collagen types I and III, and hyaluronic acid were isolated from human umbilical cords and blended with the GMP grade PLC. When compared with PLC scaffolds the PLC/COL/HA had higher water uptake capacity (103% vs 66%) which may have contributed to the decrease in its Young's Modulus (from 1.31 to 0.89 MPa). The PLC/COL/HA better supported adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell (AT MSC) adhesion; within 24 h the cell number on the PLC/COL/HA scaffolds was 3 fold higher. Co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and AT MSCs induced capillary formation on both scaffold types, but the PLC/COL/HA led to formation of interconnected vessels whose total length was 1.6 fold of the total vessel length on PLC.

In stage 1 of the project, we carried out physical and biological tests of BNC. This allowed us to modify subsequent samples of bacterial bionanocellulose. Finally, we obtained a sample that was accepted for testing on an animal model. That sample we define BNC1. Patches of BNC1 were then implanted into pigs' vessel walls. During the surgical procedures, we evaluated the technical aspects of sewing in the bioimplant, paying special attention to bleeding control and tightness of the suture line and the BNC1 bioimplant itself. We carried out studies evaluating the reaction of an animal body to an implantation of BNC1 into the circulatory system, including the general and local inflammatory reaction to the bioimplant.

As size disparities in human placenta and small recipients hamper preclinical studies, we studied alternative of bovine placentomes in smaller size ranges. Multiple cow placentomes were decellularized and anatomical integrity was analyzed. Tissue engineering used inbred donor rat livers. Placentomes were hepatized and immediately transplanted in rats with perfusion from portal vein and drainage into inferior vena cava. Cows yielded 99 ± 16 placentomes each. Of these, approximately 25% had 3 to 9 cm diameter and 7 to 63 ml volume, which was suitable for transplantation. After decellularization, angiography and casts documented 100% of vessels and vascular networks were well-perfused without disruptions or leaks. The residual matrix also remained intact for transplantation of placentomes. Perfusion in transplanted placentomes was maintained over up to 30 days. Liver tissue reassembled with restoration of hepatic acinar and sinusoidal structure. Transplanted tissue was intact without apoptosis, or necrosis. Hepatic functions were maintained. Preservation of hepatic homeostasis was verified by cytofluorimetric analysis of hepatocyte ploidy. The prevalence in healthy and transplanted liver of diploid, tetraploid and higher ploidy classes was similar with 57%, 41% and 2% versus 51%, 46.5% and 2.6%, respectively, p = 0.77, ANOVA.

It plays a very important role in the construction of novel orthopedic implants, because of its lower Young's modulus compared to other biomedical implant materials, Conventional machining of Ti-Ni yields poor surface finish and low dimensional accuracy of the machined components. Wire electro-discharge machining (WEDM) can achieve high dimensional accuracy, but its thermal nature causes great concern regarding surface integrity for biocompatibility application of Ti-Ni material. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the surface morphology and non-toxic, non-hazardous surface conductive to the human body. Hence, WEDM of Ti-Ni can be used. Shape memory effect (SME) of SMA was achieved by subsequent heat treatment processes which include annealing followed by ageing. For manufacturing the Ti-Ni implants, a WEDM optimized process has been used and various performance attributes such as material removal rate (MRR), surface roughness (SR), surface topography, metallurgical changes, recast layer, micro-hardness, residual stresses and shape recovery ability of the machined components have been evaluated, so as to obtain high biocompatibility of machined surface. The minimum surface roughness with consistency, suitable surface integrity parameters like less deposition of material, minimum recast layers thickness, consentaneous amount of surface hardness and less affecting subsurface residual stresses have been determined for validated experiment with an increase in wire feed. MRR increases with increase in wire feed. SR decreases with increase in wire feed due to enhanced splashing of molten material. Shape recovery ability near wire electro-discharge machined surface has been investigated from the biocompatible point of view. Heat treatment like annealing is found to be the most suitable process to recover shape memory effect of WEDMed samples.",The design strategy of intelligent biomedical magnesium with controlled-release platform.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678910,"Materials science & engineering.

We have constructed grafts composed of coaxially-structured polycaprolactone (PCL)/gelatin nanofibres, and tailored the material structures to achieve high strength, compliance and kink resistance, as well as excellent water sealing and anti-thrombogenicity. Coaxially-structured fibres in the grafts provided mechanical stability through the core, while flexibility and cell adhesion through the sheath. Results showed that graft compliance increased while strength decreased with the concentration ratio between core and sheath polymers. Compared to pure PCL fibrous surfaces, coaxial PCL/gelatin fibrous surfaces potently inhibited platelet adhesion and activation, providing excellent anti-thrombogenicity. To render sufficient burst strength and suturability, an additional layer of pure PCL was necessary to cap the layer of coaxial PCL/gelatin fibres. The two-layered grafts with the wall thickness comparable to native arteries demonstrated artery-like compliance and kink resistance, properties important to arteries under complex mechanical loading. The in vivo evaluation was performed using the interposition carotid artery graft model in rabbits for three months. Interestingly, results from ultrasonic imaging and histological analysis demonstrated that the two-layered grafts with a thinner outer PCL layer, which possessed higher compliance and kink resistance, showed increased blood flow, minimal lumen reduction and fibrosis. All vascular grafts exhibited patency and induced limited cell infiltration. Together, we presented a facile and useful approach to fabricate vascular grafts with superior graft performances, biomechanical properties, and blood compatibility.

Greater pelvic flexibility was associated with a more upright lumbar sitting posture (p = 0.023; η2 = 0.132) but with no specific pelvic sitting posture (p = 0.660; η2 = 0.005). Different movement strategies during the Sit-and-Reach test were detected: all participants moved through their lumbar spine; but only those with 'excellent' flexibility also used their pelvis. Individuals in the 'excellent' flexibility group were significantly shorter than those with 'poor' and 'good' flexibility (p = 0.020; η2 = 0.190). In conclusion, hamstring flexibility does not influence sitting posture but pelvic flexibility does. Other factors such as acetabulofemoral joint limitations, consciousness of posture, or the seat itself may also influence sitting posture. Different movement strategies as well as height appear to contribute to the Sit-and-Reach test which should be researched further.",Remaining Hurdles for Tissue-Engineering the Temporomandibular Joint Disc.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678888,Trends in molecular medicine,2019 03 29,"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc, a fibrocartilaginous structure between the mandible and temporal bone, is implicated in temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). TMDs symptomatically affect approximately 25% of the population, of which 70% have internal derangement of the disc. Treatments lack efficiency, motivating novel therapies, including tissue-engineering toward TMJ disc regeneration. Recent developments in scaffold-based or scaffold-free approaches, cell sources, and biochemical and mechanical stimulation have resulted in constructs exhibiting native tissue mechanics. Safety and efficacy of tissue-engineered implants have shown promising results in orthotopic animal studies. However, many hurdles need to be overcome in tissue-engineering approaches, and clinical and regulatory pathways. Future studies present an opportunity for clinicians and researchers to work together toward safe and effective clinical trials.","'We need to not be footnotes anymore': understanding Métis people's experiences with mental health and wellness in British Columbia, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678887,Public health,2019 01 25,"This article aims to contribute to an increased understanding of Métis people's experiences with respect to mental health and wellness through sharing the perspectives, journeys and needs of Métis people in British Columbia (BC), Canada.","Tick-borne encephalitis in Europe: a brief update on epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678880,European journal of internal medicine,2019 04 16,"Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an emerging health threat that is spreading in many parts of Europe.

TBE is an important cause of central nervous system (CNS) infection that can result in long-term neurological sequelae and even death. Diagnosis of TBE relays mainly on high clinical suspicion confirmed by serological and molecular assays both on serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with an ancillary role for neuroimaging in supporting the diagnosis. No specific antiviral treatment is currently available for TBE; indeed, supportive treatment as well as intensive care and assisted ventilation in severe forms may be needed. Because of limited option for TBE treatment, of crucial importance is effective vaccination to prevent disease-related morbidity and mortality.

These hormones, cortisol and corticosterone in humans and rodents respectively, activate mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) and glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) that regulate neuronal activity and behavioral adaptation to stressful experiences. This review discusses molecular properties of MRs, the role of MRs in regulating neuronal function and behavior and, ultimately, evidence that enhanced MR function may confer resilience to stressful experiences.",Paracrine Regulation of Aldosterone Secretion in Physiological and Pathophysiological Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678861,Vitamins and hormones,2019 04 22,"Aldosterone secretion by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex is controlled by circulating factors including the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and potassium. Mineralocorticoid production is also regulated through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism by a wide variety of bioactive signals released in the vicinity of adrenocortical cells by chromaffin cells, nerve endings, cells of the immune system, endothelial cells and adipocytes. These regulatory factors include conventional neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Their physiological role in the control of aldosterone secretion is not fully understood, but it is likely that they participate in the RAS-independent regulation of zona glomerulosa cells. Interestingly, recent observations indicate that autocrine/paracrine processes are involved in the pathophysiology of primary aldosteronism. The intraadrenal regulatory systems observed in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA), although globally similar to those occurring in the normal adrenal gland, harbor alterations at different levels, which tend to strengthen the potency of paracrine signals to activate aldosterone secretion. Enhancement of paracrine stimulatory tone may participate to APA expansion and aldosterone hypersecretion together with somatic mutations of driver genes which activate the calcium signaling pathway and subsequently aldosterone synthase expression. Intraadrenal regulatory mechanisms represent thus promising pharmacological targets for the treatment of primary aldosteronism.",Primary Aldosteronism: Present and Future.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678860,Vitamins and hormones,2019 04 22,"Primary aldosteronism (PA), currently recognized to be 5-10% of hypertension, has a cardiovascular risk profile double that in age-, sex-, and blood pressure-matched essential hypertensives. Screening for PA is by determining the plasma aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR), followed by one of half a dozen confirmatory/exclusion tests. Unilateral hyperaldosteronism normally reflects an aldosterone producing adenoma; bilateral disease is the more common form, and termed idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA). Subjects confirmed undergo imaging, followed by adrenal venous sampling (AVS) for lateralization. Unilateral lesions undergo laparoscopic adrenalectomy, to normalize aldosterone levels, and in approximately half reduction of BP/antihypertensive use. Bilateral hyperaldosteronism is treated by low dose mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists MRAs, plus amiloride/conventional antihypertensives, if/as indicated.In the future, what is needed is recognition that inappropriate aldosterone levels for sodium status (i.e., PA) represents up to 50% of ""essential"" hypertensives; all hypertensive should thus be screened by a modified ARR, using 24-h urinary aldosterone rather than a single plasma aldosterone. The current reluctance to do so reflects the costs of AVS if PA is confirmed-optimally by a standard seated saline suppression test-followed by surgery or life-long MRAs. Increasingly AVS will be replaced by plasma steroid assays capable of discriminating APA from the far more common IAH. Third generation MRAs (as selective as eplerenone, as potent as spironolactone, non-steroidal) are in development; in the interim, to minimize side effects and maximize compliance, spironolactone dosage should be set at 12.5-25 mg/day.",Leptin and Aldosterone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678859,Vitamins and hormones,2019 04 22,"The prominence of obesity in the clinical population as well as the strong association of cardiovascular risk factors with obesity has prompted the investigation of the adipose tissue and its physiological contribution to cardiovascular health. A notable finding in these investigations was the discovery of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin. Leptin is secreted from the adipose tissue, increases in linear fashion in the circulation with increased body mass and is implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease in obesity, notably via pro-hypertensive mechanisms. Leptin stimulates the activation of the sympathetic nervous system in male patients and mice, which has been implicated as the pro-hypertensive pathway for leptin in obesity. However, obese premenopausal females do not exhibit increased sympathetic activation in response to hyperleptinemia in obesity, indicating a sex-discrepancy in mechanisms of obesity-associated hypertension. Our lab recently demonstrated that leptin also induces the adrenal production of aldosterone in a direct fashion and that this pathway leads to the hyperaldosteronemia that is characteristic of obesity. We have also published data that indicate that the implications of leptin-induced aldosterone are of particular impact in obese females. Leptin-mediated hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, a significant predictor of hypertension clinically, require activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor in female mice. The clinical potential of this pathway remains under investigation; however, existing data indicate that a sex discrepancy exists in mechanisms of leptin-mediated hypertension between males and females and that leptin-stimulated aldosterone plays a significant role in females.",Regulation of Aldosterone Secretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678858,Vitamins and hormones,2019 04 22,"Secretion of the major mineralocorticoid aldosterone from the adrenal cortex is a tightly-regulated process enabling this hormone to regulate sodium homeostasis and thereby contribute to blood pressure control. The circulating level of aldosterone is the result of various regulatory mechanisms, the most significant being those controlled by the renin-angiotensin system and plasma potassium levels. The importance of maintaining tight control over aldosterone secretion is demonstrated by cases of dysregulation, which can result in severe hypertension and significantly increased cardiovascular risk. In this article we summarize current knowledge of the major regulatory mechanisms, focusing particularly on the systems operating within the adrenocortical zona glomerulosa cells; we also describe some of the other factors that influence aldosterone production to a lesser but still significant extent.

However, excess aldosterone can be deleterious as a driver of inflammation, vascular remodeling and tissue fibrosis associated with cardiometabolic diseases. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists are current clinical therapies used to antagonize deleterious effects of aldosterone in patients. MRAs compete with aldosterone for binding at its cognate receptor thereby limiting its effect while RAS antagonists reduce aldosterone levels indirectly by blocking the stimulatory effect of angiotensin. Both MRAs and RAS antagonists can result in incomplete inhibition of the harmful effects of excess aldosterone. Aldosterone synthase (AS) inhibitors (ASI) attenuate the production of aldosterone directly and have been proposed as an alternative to MRAs and RAS blockers. Cortisol synthase (CS) is an enzyme closely related to AS and responsible for generating the important glucocorticoid cortisol, required for maintaining critical metabolic and immune responses. The importance of selectivity against CS is shown by early examples of ASIs that were only modestly selective and as such, attenuated cortisol responses when evaluated in patients. Recently, next-generation, highly selective ASIs have been described and are presently being evaluated in the clinic as an alternative to angiotensin and MR antagonists for cardiometabolic disease.

In this regard, MR pharmacological blockade has led to prevention of weight gain and metabolic benefits in murine models of genetic or diet-induced obesity.

Although aldosterone, the main physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not synthesized by cyclostomes or cartilaginous fishes, cyclostome CR and cartilaginous fish MR and GR are activated by aldosterone. Aldosterone first appears in lungfish, lobe-finned fish that are forerunners of terrestrial vertebrates. Further sequence divergence of the MR and GR in terrestrial vertebrates led to emergence of aldosterone as a selective ligand for the MR. Interestingly, ray-finned fish do not synthesize aldosterone, leaving the identity of their physiological mineralocorticoid(s) unresolved. Several steroids: cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone and progesterone activate fish MR and are potential mineralocorticoids in ray-finned fish.

By non-genomic we refer to the rapid actions that occur within minutes do not require transcription or translation and occur in both classical MR target organs (kidney and colon) and non-epithelial tissues (blood vessels, heart, and adipose). The mechanism of rapid non-genomic actions of aldosterone varies between tissues. As a result, this chapter is viewed through the lens of how the non-genomic and genomic actions of aldosterone are linked in cardiovascular disease. Specifically, regulation of sodium flux in the myocardium has an important role in pathogenesis of cardiac arrhythmia. Since there are now recognized gender differences in cardiovascular disease, we also include preliminary studies to investigate the interaction of sex steroid hormones with the ligand binding pocket of the mineralocorticoid receptor. Overall, we aim to showcase how the non-genomic effects of aldosterone potentially modulate the genomic effects and represent additional targets for intervention."

Study group comprised of 79 definite ARVC patients by 2010 Task Force criteria (60% male, age at ICD implant 39 ± 14 years) who were enrolled in the Nordic ARVC Registry and received an ICD for primary SCD prevention. The primary end point of appropriate ICD shock or death from any cause was assessed and compared with 137 definite ARVC patients who received ICD for secondary SCD prevention (74% male, age at ICD implant 42 ± 15 years). In the study group, 38% were ≤35 years of age at baseline, 25% had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and 29% had syncope at baseline. Major repolarization abnormality (hazard ratio = 4.00, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 12.30, p = 0.015) and age ≤35 years (hazard ratio = 4.21, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 11.85, p = 0.001) independently predicted the primary end point. The outcome did not differ between the primary prevention patients with either of these risk factors and the secondary prevention cohort (2% to 4% annual event rate) whereas patients without risk factors did not have any appropriate ICD shocks during follow-up. In conclusion, young age at ARVC diagnosis and major repolarization abnormality independently predict ICD shocks or death in the primary prevention ICD recipients and associated with the event rate similar to the one observed in the secondary prevention cohort.

Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis,2019 06 05,"Previously, we proposed 12 marker genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccnf, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Gdf15, Lrp1, Mbd1, Phlda3, Plk2 and Tubb4b) to discriminate mouse genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (GTHC) from non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (NGTHC). This was determined by qPCR and principal component analysis (PCA), as the aim of an in vivo short-term screening for genotoxic hepatocarcinogens. For this paper, we conducted an application study of the 12 mouse marker genes to rat data, Open TG-GATEs (public data). We analyzed five typical rat GTHC (2-acetamodofluorene, aflatoxin B1, 2-nitrofluorene, N-nitrosodiethylamine and N-nitrosomorpholine), and not only seven typical rat NGTHC (clofibrate, ethanol, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, hexachlorobenzene, phenobarbital and WY-14643) but also 11 non-genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogens (NGTNHC; allyl alcohol, aspirin, caffeine, chlorpheniramine, chlorpropamide, dexamethasone, diazepam, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, theophylline and tolbutamide) from Open TG-GATEs. The analysis was performed at 3, 6, 9 and 24 h after a single administration and 4, 8, 15 and 29 days after repeated administrations. We transferred Open TG-GATEs DNA microarray data into log2 data using the ""R Project for Statistical Computing"". GTHC-specific dose-dependent gene expression changes were observed and significance assessed with the Williams test. Similar significant changes were observed during 3-24 h and 4-29 days, assessed with Welch's t-test, except not for NGTHC or NGTNHC. Significant differential changes in gene expression were observed between GTHC and NGTHC in 11 genes (except not Tubb4b) and between GTHC and NGTNHC in all 12 genes at 24 h and 10 genes (except Ccnf and Mbd1) at 29 days, per Tukey's test.

Entrance Surface Dose (ESD) to head, shoulders, and pelvis regions were measured using Li2B4O7: Mn thermoluminescent dosimeters. Induced DNA damage in lymphocytes was measured using γ-H2AX, p53Ser-15, chromosome aberrations, and micronucleus formation in subjects (n = 25) who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT.

The effective doses of PET and CT ranged from 4.01 to 6.61 and 16.40-72.18 mSv, respectively, and the obtained Dose Length Product (DLP) varied from 1093 to 4812 mGy*cm. There was no correlation between DLP and ESD (r2 = 0.1). The chromosome aberration assay showed a significant increase (p < 0.05), post-scanning vs. pre-scanning; the γ-H2AX, p53Ser-15, and micronucleus assays did not show significant increases. Induced DNA damage showed inter-individual variation among the study subjects.

The frequency of micronucleated cells (MNC) was significantly higher in the exposed group (5.26 vs. 1.33 MNC/2000 cells) and correlated strongly with accumulated radiation dose (Annual Deep Dose, mSv). Occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation was associated with an 80% relative increase in the frequency of MNC (MRR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.1-2.8), suggesting that such exposures cause DNA damage.

This study included 50 urban researchers and 50 rural pesticides sprayers occupationally exposed to pesticides. They were compared with 50 non-exposed urban researchers and 50 non-exposed rural subjects. Several tumor biomarkers were estimated; P53 protein, Alfa fetoprotein (AFP), and Alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU). Additionally, telomerase enzyme activity, Relative telomere length (RTL), and DNA damage using comet assay were measured. Furthermore, the glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) gene polymorphisms were identified for both exposed groups. Statistical analysis revealed elevated level of tumor biomarkers among exposed subjects relative to control groups in spite of being within the normal range. Increase in the DNA damage was detected, with shortening of telomere length and decrease in telomerase enzyme activity in pesticides-exposed subjects compared to their controls. Most of these changes were related to the levels of butyrylcholinesterase. Subjects with GSTT1 genotype were suggested to be more susceptible to hepatic carcinogenicity. Telomere relative length and comets assay together with GST genes polymorphisms could be used as early predictors for liver cancer susceptibility among pesticides exposed workers.",Effect of inter-individual variability in human liver cytochrome P450 isozymes on cyclophosphamide-induced micronucleus formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678826,Mutation research. Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis,2019 06 05,"We investigated the relationship between metabolic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes present in microsomal fractions derived from the livers of 78 donors and micronucleus induction by cyclophosphamide (CPA). Consequently, a wide inter-individual variation in CYP activities was observed among the 78 donors. The CYP activities were partially correlated with the metabolic phenotypes predicted for the donors based on their single nucleotide polymorphisms. In addition, CPA induced micronucleus formation was seen for 47 out of 52 donors whose samples were tested with CPA doses ranging from 18.8 to 100 μg/mL. The CPA dose at which micronucleated cells were observed varied among the donors. Furthermore, a close correlation was identified between the catalytic activities of the CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 isozymes and micronucleus induction by CPA. To elucidate the mechanism underlying CPA-induced micronucleus formation in vitro tests were conducted on expression systems of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Additionally, the metabolites of CPA generated by the expression systems were quantified by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer. Interestingly, several metabolites including the 4-hydroxyl form of CPA (4-OH-CPA) and phosphamide mustard were detected in the CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 expression systems, but not in the CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 system. The presence of these metabolites was correlated with micronucleus induction by CPA. The absence of CPA metabolites in the CYP2C9 expression system might be associated with the lower 4-hydroxylase activity of this system. The present results suggest that inter-individual variability in the metabolic capacity of each donor was associated with potential micronucleus induction due to CPA. Additionally, CPA metabolites like 4-OH-CPA and phosphamide mustard produced by human CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are suggested to be major determinants of micronucleus induction by CPA.",Cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of environmental relevant concentrations of bisphenol A and interactions with doxorubicin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678825,Mutation research.

Genotoxicity, namely DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage, were assessed by comet assay and micronuclei induction, and mitotic disruption was evaluated cytologically by fluorescent microscopy with DAPI staining. Cytotoxicity analysis showed that exposure to BPA per se does not affect cellular viability. Nevertheless, the genotoxic analysis showed that BPA induced an increase of DNA damage in the Hep-2 cell line and in oxidative damage in the MRC-5 cell line. An increase of micronuclei was also observed in both cell lines following BPA exposure. BPA and DOX co-exposures suggested that BPA acts as an antagonist of DOX effects in both cell lines. The interaction with DOX appears to be cell type dependent, exhibiting a non-monotonic response curve in MRC-5 cells, a GPER expressing cell line. Our study emphasizes the need for a deeper knowledge of BPA interactions, particularly with chemotherapeutic agents, in the context of risk assessment and public health.",Genotoxicity evaluation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles using the mouse lymphoma assay and the Ames test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678824,Mutation research. Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis,2019 06 05,"Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are widely used in the cosmetics, health, and food industries, but their safety and genotoxicity remain a matter of debate. We investigated whether TiO2-NPs could induce gene mutations in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells and Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97a, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA1535. Following preliminary tests, 2 mg/mL for the mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay and 1.25 mg/plate for the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) were selected as the highest concentrations. Exposure to TiO2-NPs for 4 or 24 h with or without S9 metabolic activation did not increase mutation frequency for any of the concentrations tested in L5178Y cells. In the Ames test, TiO2-NPs did not induce reverse mutation in the bacterial strains. No positive mutagenic responses were observed in either test system, and therefore we cannot classify TiO2-NPs as mutagenic; further testing will be required to determine conclusively whether TiO2-NPs are genotoxic.",Effect of age and sex on the level of DNA strand breaks and oxidatively damaged DNA in human blood cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678823,Mutation research. Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis,2019 06 05,"DNA damage measured by the comet assay is a well-established biomarker in studies on environmental and occupational exposures, dietary factors and clinical outcomes. Age and sex are typically regarded as confounding factors that are controlled by either selective inclusion criteria of subjects or adjustment in the statistical analysis. This review assesses the influence of age and sex on levels of DNA damage in leukocytes in study populations of healthy subjects. Analysis of unadjusted results in the studies indicates that the level of DNA strand breaks increases by 1% per year (95% CI: 0.9%-1.1%, linear regression analysis weighted for the number of subjects in the individual studies). The studies also show a slightly higher level of DNA strand breaks in men than women (8%, 95% CI: 0.4%-17%) in unadjusted analyses, which is not robust in studies with adjusted analyses. The attenuation of effect in adjusted analyses of DNA strand breaks in leukocytes indicates that the effect of age and sex may be driven by differences in lifestyle factors or other exposures. There do not appear to be differences related to age and sex on basal levels of oxidatively damaged DNA in leukocytes. In summary, the results indicate influences of both age and sex on DNA damage in the comet assay, which may be mediated by lifestyle factors or external exposures rather than direct effects of age and sex.","Markedly enhanced micronucleus induction by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride in colonic cells of rats with bacterial colonization in the intestine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678822,Mutation research. Genetic toxicology and environmental mutagenesis,2019 06 05,"To investigate how intestinal bacteria affect host cytogenetic alterations in the early initiation step of colon carcinogenesis, we conducted a comet assay and micronucleus (MN) test using germ-free (GF) and conventionalized (Cvd) rats after a single subcutaneous injection of the carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH). DNA damage was also determined in the liver in comet assays, as DMH is metabolized and activated in this organ. The time-response patterns of DNA damage in the liver and colon were similar in both rats, and maximum values were observed at 3 h after the treatment. In contrast, the maximum frequency of micronucleated (MNed) colonic cells was markedly higher in the Cvd rats than in the GF rats and was observed after 72 h and 120 h, respectively. The frequency of MNed cells in non-treated animals was similar in the GF and Cvd rats. In addition, we determined time-responses in the incidence of apoptosis and cell proliferation indices, i.e., the numbers of BrdU-labeled cells, mitotic cells in the crypts, and crypt column heights, using histological sections of the colons in these rats. Maximal incidence of apoptosis was observed at 6 and 24 h in the Cvd and GF rats, respectively. The value in the Cvd rats tended to be higher than that in the GF rats. Cell proliferation was suppressed until 24 and 48 h in the Cvd and GF rats, respectively, and increased subsequently. The rebound response of cell proliferation was more pronounced and occurred earlier in the Cvd rats than that in the GF rats. We demonstrated that cytogenetic alterations other than DNA damage, particularly the MNed colonic cell induction by DMH, were markedly enhanced in rats with bacterial colonization in the intestine compared to those in GF rats."

During radiotherapy to the abdominal cancer, spleen often receives certain dose, though as an important immune organ, little is known about the impact of splenic irradiation (SI) on systemic immune and local tumor control. Through a mice model, we found that the combination of SI with tumor irradiation (TI) helped in local control. The analysis of the tumor infiltrating leucocytes demonstrated that SI plus TI brought more T cell aggregation in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which helped in tumor control. Increased T cell infiltration may be partly due to higher expression of T cell chemokine in the TME and more expression of CXCR3 on the T cells in the spleen after SI. SI produced more IL-1β in the spleen, IL-1β stimulated the expression of CXCR3 on the T cells, and enhanced their migration ability. Taken together, radiation to the spleen combined with TI helped in local control through promoting T cell infiltration, and may be a considerable means to enhance the immunomodulatory of radiotherapy.",Induction of lipid droplets in non-macrophage cells as well as macrophages by liposomes and exosomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678809,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 02 02,"It has been reported that phospholipid nanoparticles (PNPs) including liposomes and exosomes could efficiently induce lipid droplets (LDs) in macrophages. However, in non-macrophage cells, the effects of PNPs on the induction of LDs have not been thoroughly investigated. In this report, we directly compared non-macrophage and macrophage cell lines in terms of LD induction by various formulation of liposomes containing phosphatidylserine and exosomes. All non-macrophage cell lines as well as macrophage cell lines tested in this study showed evident LD induction in response to these PNPs, though the efficacy of LD induction in non-macrophage cell lines varied considerably. Our results suggest that LD formation is a common and crucial response to PNPs in mammalian cells not only in macrophages but also in non-macrophage cells.",Histological and immunohistochemical characterization of the integument and parotoids glands Rhinella bergi (Anura: Bufsonidae): Development and differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678807,Acta histochemica,2019 06 13,"A detailed description of the tegument and parotoid glands of pre-metamorphic, post-metamorphic, juvenile and adult individuals of Rhinella bergi is presented to provide an exhaustive analysis of the integumentary characteristics of this species. Fragments of the tegument were fixed in Bouin solution and preserved in buffered Formol 10%. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to characterize the macroscopic structure of these regions. Microscopic observations were made from histological sections stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Alcian Blue (pH 2,5), PAS-H, Coomassie Blue, Oil Red, and Bielschowsky Impregnation.. There were three types of protuberance: warts, tubers, and thorns. These structures became evident from post-metamorphic stages. The ventral surface shows elevations similar to flat warts; however, tubers and spines are absent. Histologically, each structure consists of a spongy dermis of lax connective tissue and dense and compact dermis, associated with granular glands and a keratinized epidermis. The latter, in the dorsal region, forms projections called thorns. The granular glands accumulate, and their alveoli increase in size progressively. This work provides a morphological and histological description of the integument and the parotoid glands during the larval and post-metamorphic stage of the genus Rhinella, with aspects described for the first time in the genus.",Chloride channel 3 (CIC-3) predicts the tumor size in hepatocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678806,Acta histochemica,2019 06 13,"Chloride channel 3 (CIC-3) has been suggested to be implicated in the carcinogenesis though; it still remains ill understood in hepatocarcinoma, especially in terms of clinicopathological meaning of its expression.

It was shown that positive staining of CIC-3 can be present in both hepatocarcinoma and its paired normal controls; and that CIC-3 was significantly over-expressed in hepatcarcioma on the whole relative to paired normal controls. Moreover, up-regulation of CIC-3 markedly correlated with tumor size and overall prognosis, suggesting that CIC-3 expression could predict both tumor size and overall prognosis in hepatocarcinoma.",Surgical palliative care training in general surgery residency: An educational needs assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678805,American journal of surgery,2019 04 19,"There is increasing recognition that Surgical Palliative Care is an essential component of the holistic care of surgical patients and involves more than end-of-life care in the intensive care unit.

An understanding of the anatomic relationship between the aortic valvar leaflets and their supporting sinuses, coronary vessels, pulmonary arterial root, right ventricular outflow tract, and LVOT is essential for successful treatment of arrhythmias arising from this region. The juxtaposition of aortic valvar leaflet insertion into the aortic root and the crescents of myocardial tissue incorporated within the aortic sinuses of Valsalva has implications for mapping and ablation above and below the aortic valve leaflets. The presence of epicardial fat, coronary arteries, and prominent myocardium in the anteroseptal aspect of the LVOT can present unique challenges for targeting LV summit and intramural ventricular arrhythmias.

Plasma concentrations of CAR following intravenous injection to DA rats were higher than those in SD rats. The volume of distribution at steady state and total clearance (CLtot) of S-CAR were approximately two times greater than those of R-CAR in both strains. CLh predicted from in vitro studies using DA rat liver microsomes was different from that obtained from in vivo studies. In contrast, in vitro CLh prediction using DA rat hepatocytes was nearly identical to the CLh observed in DA rats in vivo, and was lower than that in SD rats. The predicted CLh in vitro using hepatocytes correlated well with the observed CLtot in vivo, which is expected to be nearly the same as CLh.

Autophagy is a ""double-edged sword"" in tumors. It can promote or suppress tumor development, which depends on the cell and tissue types and the stages of tumor. At present, tumor immunotherapy is a promising treatment strategy against tumors. Recent studies have shown that autophagy significantly controls immune responses by modulating the functions of immune cells and the production of cytokines. Conversely, some cytokines and immune cells have a great effect on the function of autophagy. Therapies aiming at autophagy to enhance the immune responses and anti-tumor effects of immunotherapy have become the prospective strategy, with enhanced antigen presentation and higher sensitivity to CTLs. However, the induction of autophagy may also benefit tumor cells escape from immune surveillance and result in intrinsic resistance against anti-tumor immunotherapy. Increasing studies have proven the optimal use of either ATG inducers or inhibitors can restrain tumor growth and progression by enhancing anti-tumor immune responses and overcoming the anti-tumor immune resistance in combination with several immunotherapeutic strategies, indicating that induction or inhibition of autophagy might show us a prospective therapeutic strategy when combined with immunotherapy. In this article, the possible mechanisms of autophagy regulating immune system, and the potential applications of autophagy in tumor immunotherapy will be discussed.",Nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 promotes metastasis of cervical carcinoma cells by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678687,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,2019 04 18,"The primary obstacle to treat cervical cancer is its high prevalence of metastasis, which severely affects patients' quality of life and survival time.

Since the nutrients required for early embryos and postpartum lactation are derived in whole or in part from maternal and lactating nutrition, the maternal nutritional level affects the growth and development of the fetus and creates a profound relationship between disease development and early environmental exposure in the offspring's later life. Protein is one of the most important biological macromolecules, involved in almost every process of life, such as information transmission, energy processing and material metabolism. Maternal protein intake levels may affect the integrity of the fetal genome, and alter DNA methylation and gene expression. Most amino acids are supplied to the fetus from the maternal circulation through active transport of placenta. Some amino acids, such as methionine, as dietary methyl donor, play an important role in DNA methylation and body's one-carbon metabolism. The purpose of this review is to describe effects of maternal dietary protein and amino acid intake on fetal and neonatal growth and development through epigenetic mechanisms, with examples in humans and animals.",MicroRNA determines the fate of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and regulates intestinal diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678626,Current protein & peptide science,2019 01 25,"The rapid self-renewal of intestinal epithelial cells enhances intestinal function, promotes the nutritional needs of animals and strengthens intestinal barrier function to resist the invasion of foreign pathogens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short-chain, non-coding RNAs that regulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation by down-regulating hundreds of conserved target genes after transcription via seed pairing to the 3' untranslated regions. Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs can improve intestinal function by participating in the proliferation and differentiation of different cell populations in the intestine. In addition, miRNAs also contribute to disease regulation and therefore not only play a vital role in the gastrointestinal disease management but also act as blood or tissue biomarkers of disease. As changes to the levels of miRNAs can change cell fates, miRNA-mediated gene regulation can be used to update therapeutic strategies and approaches to disease treatment.",Nutrients mediate bioavailability and turnover of proteins in mammals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678625,Current protein & peptide science,2019 01 25,"As a major component of biologically active compounds in the body, proteins contribute to the synthesis of body tissues, for the renewal and growth of the body. The high level of dietary protein and the imbalance of amino acid (AA) composition in mammals result in metabolic disorders, inefficient utilization of protein resources and increased nitrogen excretion. Fortunately, nutritional interventions can be an effective way of attenuating the nitrogen excretion and increasing protein utilization, which include, but are not limited to, formulating the AA balance and protein-restricted diet supplementing with essential AAs, and adding probiotics in the diet.

Milk also provides nourishment for people of all ages due to its abundant nutrients, and it is used in the manufacture of numerous health-related products. Milk contains caseins and whey proteins as the two major protein classes. Caseins fall into four major types known as αs1-, αs2-, β- and κ-casein, whereas whey proteins comprise a mixture of globular proteins including β-lactoglobulin, α-lactalbumin, serum albumin, lactoferrin, and other bioactivators. The various biological activities of these proteins are involved in preventing and treating numerous nutritional, physiological and metabolic diseases. This article reviews the bioactivities and functions of milk proteins, which may shed light on future application of milk bioactive substances.",Differentiation and proliferation of intestinal stem cells and its underlying regulated mechanisms during weaning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678622,Current protein & peptide science,2019 01 25,"Weaning is a stressful event associated with gastrointestinal disorders and increased disease susceptibility. Many studies have reported the changes happened in the gut of various mammals such as pigs and rats after weaning. These findings suggest that the development of intestinal tract mainly is affected at the time of weaning through interfering in the differentiation and proliferation of intestinal stem cells. Weaning stress stimulates the rapid differentiation and proliferation of intestinal stem cells in order to adjust to changes caused by weaning, which are mainly manifested as deeper crypt depth and intestine decreased villus height. However, the accelerated cellular process may lead to an increase in the proportion of immature intestinal epithelial cells and goblet cells, which affect intestinal permeability and reduce the gut-barrier function against toxins and pathogens. This review briefly describes the effects of Corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and polyamines on the differentiation and proliferation of intestinal stem cells after weaning and discusses its possible underlying regulatory mechanisms. Firstly, weaning stress activates CRF to binds its receptors, which induce proinflammatory responses and promote rapid differentiation and proliferation of intestinal stem cells to a larger fraction of immature intestinal epithelial cells and goblet cells. Secondly, the lack of EGF after weaning inhibits the expression of goblet cell maturation factors and makes it difficult for goblet cells and intestinal epithelial cells to mature. Finally, diet and endogenous synthesis lead to excessive polyamines in the intestine, which promote the proliferation of intestinal stem cells by regulating the expression of human antigen R (HuR) and other related genes at the time of weaning.",Advance in tissue differentiation and its regulatory mechanisms by master proteins of nervous system during weaning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678621,Current protein & peptide science,2019 01 25,"Weaning is a critical period for the growth and development of mammals, in which various physiological and biochemical indicators of the body have undergone great changes. The development, differentiation, and maturation of the nervous system are regulated by many proteins. Changes in related proteins affect the physiological functions of the nervous system. However, the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of the nervous system at this stage is still poorly understood. The mechanism of differentiation and regulation of the major proteins in the nervous system during this special period of weaning remains to be investigated. Therefore, this paper aims to summarize the alteration of the nervous system during weaning and provide the basis for subsequent research.",Progress in research on brain development and function of mice during weaning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678620,Current protein & peptide science,2019 01 25,"Lactation is a critical phase for brain function development. New dietary experiences of mouse caused by weaning can regulate brain development and function, increase their response to food and environment，eventually give rise to corresponding behavioral changes.

Proper epithelial function mainly depends on tight junctions (TJs), which act as both ion channels and a barrier against noxious molecules. TJs are multiprotein complexes consisting of transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins. Because the intestine in piglets is immature and incomplete, its structure and function are easily impaired by various stresses, infections, and food-related factors. Certain nutrients have been demonstrated to participate in intestinal TJ regulation. Probiotics, amino acids, fibers, oligosaccharide, and certain micronutrients can enhance barrier integrity and counteract infections through elevated TJ protein expression and distribution. In this review, the molecular structure of intestinal TJs is described, the factors influencing TJs after weaning are summarized, and the regulation of weaning piglet intestinal TJs by nutrients is discussed.","Intrauterine growth restriction alters the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in small intestine, liver and longissimus dorsi muscle of newborn piglets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678618,Current protein & peptide science,2019 01 25,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) remains a major problem in swine production since the associated low birth weight leads to high rates of pre-weaning morbidity and mortality, and permanent retardation of growth and development. The underlying regulatory mechanisms from the aspects of epigenetic modification receive widespread attention. Studies explore the changes in genome wide methylation in small intestine (SI), liver and longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) between IUGR and normal birth weight (NBW) newborn piglets using a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) approach. The data demonstrated that methylated peaks were prominently distributed in distal intergenic regions and the quantities of peaks in IUGR piglets were more than that of NBW piglets. IUGR piglets had relatively high methylated level in promoters, introns and coding exons in all the three tissues. Through KEGG pathway analysis of differentially methylated genes found that 33, 54 and 5 differentially methylated genes in small intestine, liver and longissimus dorsi muscle between NBW and IUGR piglets, respectively, which are related to development and differentiation, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, protein turnover, immune response, detoxification, oxidative stress and apoptosis pathway.

There is cell apoptosis participating in the breast tissue degeneration and secretory epithelial cells losing during weaning. In addition, hormones, especially the estrogen and pituitary hormone, play a vital role in the whole reproductive processes. In this review, we mainly focus on the underlying regulated mechanisms of differentiation of adipose tissue and apoptosis of breast cell to provide a specific insight into the physiological changes during weaning."

Authors analyzed U.S. nationally representative data from noninstitutionalized adult respondents with self-reported lifetime exposure to intimate partner violence, sexual violence, or stalking in the 2012 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS). An estimated 142 million U.S. adults had some lifetime exposure to intimate partner violence, sexual violence, or stalking. An estimated 55 million victims (39% of total victims) had more than one perpetrator type during their lifetimes. A significantly higher proportion of female victims reported more than one perpetrator type compared with male victims (49% vs. 27%). Among both female and male victims with >1 perpetrator type, the most prevalent victim-offender relationship status combinations all included an intimate partner perpetrator. Many victims of interpersonal violence are subject to multiple perpetrator types during their lifetimes.

The wh-questions used as experimental stimuli were elicited from four speakers in contexts likely to lead to either information-seeking or non-information-seeking uses. The speakers produced distinct tunes in response to the contexts; acoustic analysis indicates these are best analysed as L*+H L-!H% (rising), and L+H* L-L% (flat). In a perception experiment where participants heard the questions out of context, they chose answers providing information significantly more frequently after high-ending than flat-ending questions, confirming hypothesis (a). In a second experiment testing hypotheses (b) and (c), participants evaluated wh-questions for appropriateness and politeness in information- and non-information-seeking contexts. High-ending questions were rated more appropriate in information-seeking contexts, and more polite independently of context relative to their flat-ending counterparts. Finally, two follow-up experiments showed that the interpretation of the two tunes was not affected by voice characteristics of individual speakers, and confirmed a participant preference for the high-ending tune. Overall, the results support our hypotheses and lead to a compositional analysis of the meaning of the two tunes, while also showing that intonational meaning is determined by both tune and pragmatic context.",Metabolic regulation of CAR T cell function by the hypoxic microenvironment in solid tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678555,Immunotherapy,2019 01 25,"The field of immunometabolism has attracted growing attention as an area at the heart of immune regulation. Upon activation, T cells undergo significant metabolic changes allowing them to mediate effector responses. The advent of chimeric antigen receptor T cell-adoptive therapy has shown some striking clinical efficacy but fails to induce sufficient antitumor response in many patients. Solid tumors put up significant opposition creating a microenvironment deficient of oxygen and glucose, depriving T cells of energy and pushing them to exhaustion. Here, we focus on immune suppressive mechanisms related to hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment and the resulting metabolic changes in T cells. New therapeutic approaches such as generating chimeric antigen receptor T cells able to withstand the challenging solid tumor microenvironment are needed.",First-line checkpoint inhibitors for wild-type advanced non-small-cell cancer: a pair-wise and network meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678553,Immunotherapy,2019 01 25,To estimate efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors and rank treatment effects in non-small-cell lung cancer.,The promising role of monoclonal antibodies for gastric cancer treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678552,Immunotherapy,2019 01 25,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death world-wide.

The hydrogen bonds and non-bonded interaction energies were calculated to study the stability in different bilayers. One µs MD simulation in POPA lipid membrane reveals the stability of the cyclic peptide nanotube, and the simulations at various temperatures manifest the higher stability of 8 × [Cys-Gly-Met-Gly]2. We demonstrated that the presence of sulphur-containing amino acids in CPN enhances the stability through disulphide bonds between the adjacent rings. Further, the water permeation coefficient of the CPN is calculated and compared with human aquaporin-2 (AQP2) channel protein. It is found that the coefficients are highly comparable to the AQP2 channel though the mechanism of water transport is not similar to AQP 2; the flow of water in the CPN is taking place as a two-line 1-2-1-2 file fashion. In addition to that, the transport behavior of Na+ and K+ ions, single water molecule, urea and anti-cancer drug fluorouracil were investigated using pulling simulation and potential of mean force calculation. The above transport behavior shows that Na+ is trapped in CPN for a longer time than other molecules.

Data were collected by means of qualitative interviews and participant observation. Findings identify the existence of two contrasting forms of sexual politics: the strategic deployment of sexuality to affect social and political change, and activism with the goal of rethinking ideas and norms about sexuality. Challenges to sexual subjectivities resulting from the tethering of sexual politics to LGBT identity politics act as something of a 'push' factor for some individuals, encouraging them to migrate from places such as Iran, Pakistan and Nepal to the Persian Gulf countries in search of space in which to explore their bodies and sexualities."

Processing of infant signals in the adulthood brain is likely to recruit emotional empathy neural circuits, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test the role of right IFG (rIFG) in behavioral responses to infant signals. Specifically, a group of nulliparous women were asked to perform a handgrip dynamometer task and an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) after receiving TMS over the right IFG or over a control site (vertex). Suppressing activity in the rIFG affected the modulation of handgrip force in response to infant crying. Moreover, the AAT showed that participants tend to avoid the sad infant face after Vertex stimulation, and this bias was counteracted by rIFG stimulation. Our results suggest a causal role of rIFG in sensitive responding towards sad infants and point to the rIFG as a critical node in the neural network underlying the innate releasing mechanism for feelings of love, affection and caring of sad infants.",The Striatum's Role in Executing Rational and Irrational Economic Behaviors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678530,"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",2019 02 09,"The striatum is a critical component of the brain that controls motor, reward, and executive function.

This review emphasizes two distinct pathways that begin in the thalamus and converge in the striatum to differentially affect movements, behaviors, and decision making. The convergence of excitatory glutamatergic activity from the thalamus and cortex, along with dopamine release in response to novel stimulation, provide the basis for motor learning, reward seeking, and habit formation.

Postural time-to-contact stability boundaries decreased under more challenging visual target conditions for the unipedal posture, but this decrease was associated with lower visual tracking error. During bipedal support, there was independent control of the head and foot center of pressure, as higher frequencies at the head during the static visual task were associated with longer time-to-contact. These results demonstrate that decreased time-to-contact stability boundaries is a functional adaptation in postural tasks requiring visual control and provide evidence of the dependency of postural control on the nature of the suprapostural task.",Violence Against the Indigenous Women: Methodological and Ethical Recommendations for Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678528,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 01 25,"The importance of more countries contributing to precise and comparable statistics on violence against women (VAW) is undeniable.

In FY2011, the Portuguese state and the European triumvirate - composed of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Central Bank - signed the Memoranda of Understanding. This troika agreement aimed to improve the operational efficiency of public services. This crisis had a considerable impact on the Portuguese citizens' life and productivity, as well as on the public health care system. Cuts over public expenditures have been made to reduce the risk of noncompliance with budgetary targets, despite their potential impact on quality and access to health care services. We analyzed the main policies and measures undertaken by the Portuguese Ministry of Health with respect to the bailout program associated with the troika agreement. Then, we focused on the budgetary cuts-related risks over the social performance of the care system. Evidence suggests that structural reforms in the health care sector in the troika period had positive effects in terms of drugs administration and consumption, on the one hand, and secondary care expenditures reduction, on the other hand. Nonetheless, we observed some divestitures on infrastructures and the worsening of access to health care services."

However, other biological and genetic peculiarities contribute to differentiate this malignancy from other solid tumors, including its immunogenicity. Areas covered: This review focuses on the present and future role of antiangiogenic drugs, administered either alone (as it has been in the past few years), or in combination with other agents (e.g. immune checkpoint inhibitors), in the treatment of metastatic RCC. Expert commentary: Due to its peculiar pathogenesis, it is unrealistic to expect to be able to get rid of antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of this disease; however, we do expect that combinations of VEGF/VEGFRs-targeting agents with immune checkpoint inhibitors will gradually replace antiangiogenic monotherapies as the standard of care, at least in the first line setting of metastatic RCC patients.

This study aimed to isolate and determine the direct causal effect of one of the most popular game elements used in gamified interventions, the points-based reward system, on physical activity (PA) in children. A 72-hour field study with children aged 9 to 13 ( N = 67) was conducted using a digital PA intervention featuring a virtual dog, with and without a points-based reward system. PA was assessed with an activity monitor, and overall PA, three levels of PA intensity, and PA strategies during the 3-day intervention were measured. Guided by self-determination theory, the impact of the points-based reward system on children's basic psychological needs was also investigated. Results indicated that the points-based reward system briefly increased PA engagement but did not significantly affect overall PA over time. When given equal number of points regardless of intensity, children approached the PA intervention strategically by engaging in significantly more light intensity and significantly less vigorous intensity PA than children who did not receive points. Results also suggested that the points-based reward system might promote perceptions of relatedness with the virtual agent featured in the gamified intervention.",Protective role of arnebin-1 in rats with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678506,The Journal of international medical research,2019 03 29,To examine the effects of arnebin-1 on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by a high-fat diet (HFD).,"CHES, MCHES, and/or CPH?

Among hypertensive Korean adults, only 65.2% were aware of their condition and being treated with antihypertensive medications. Younger age was identified as an important barrier to diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Although there were slight differences between participants aged <65 and ≥65 years, higher risks of being untreated or being unaware of having hypertension were also associated with male gender, lower education levels, unhealthy behaviors, and a better health conditions.

The Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority is the drug regulatory body in Tanzania and it follows the Common Technical Document (CTD) format for dossier submission. However, Nepal is still a developing country with respect to the pharmaceutical sector. The drug governing body in Nepal, Department of Drug Administration, has its own nation-specific guidelines for drug regulation, but the CTD format is also acceptable for dossier submission.

Statistical analysis included estimating pooled prevalence and odds ratio, heterogeneity evaluation, meta-regression, and subgroup analysis, in addition to sensitivity analysis and publication bias evaluation. The pooled prevalence of measured hypertension in Vietnam was 21.1% (95% confidence interval = 18.5-23.7) based on 10 studies, and 18.4% (95% confidence interval = 15.2-21.8) based on 3 national surveys. Lower pooled prevalence was estimated for hypertension awareness (9.3%) and hypertension treatment (4.7%). The pooled prevalence of measured hypertension is significantly higher among men. The pooled prevalence of measured hypertension and hypertension awareness and treatment were significantly lower in rural settings. There is a need to strengthen efforts for primary and secondary prevention and disease management to reduce morbidity and mortality, especially in rural residence settings.","Rebooting resilience: shifts toward dynamic, multi-level, and technology-based approaches for people living with HIV.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678476,AIDS care,2019 04 04,"Resilience research has often been characterized by a static conceptualization of resilience that focuses on individual-level factors that help people living with HIV (PLHIV) adapt to HIV-related challenges and overcome other life adversities.

Although several studies have indicated the toxicity of gossypol in human and animal reproduction, the mechanism of gossypol action in testes has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effects of gossypol in normal mouse testis cells, TM3 and TM4 cells, and in gossypol-treated C57BL/6 mice. We confirmed the antiproliferative effects of gossypol using cell viability assays, with PCNA as a proliferation marker, and cell cycle analysis. We also verified mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca2+ dysregulation in the cytosol of TM3 and TM4 cells, using JC-1 and Fluo-4 dyes. To confirm the cellular signaling mechanisms in testis cell lines, we performed Western blot analysis to assess the changes in MAPK and PI3K/Akt signal transduction, using their pharmacological inhibitors. Moreover, we screened the mRNA expression of genes involved in spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in TM3 and TM4 cells. We also confirmed the mRNA expression and localization of genes regulating testis function in gossypol-treated and untreated mice testes. Collectively, we suggest that gossypol induces negative effects on testis function by reducing cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and testis development-related genes in vitro and in vivo as well as by modulating the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways.",Glutathione Responsive β-Cyclodextrin Conjugated S-Nitrothiols as a Carrier for Intracellular Delivery of Nitric Oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678457,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 03 20,"Nitric oxide (NO) exerts multiple functions in many life processes and was of great significance in a variety of biomedical scenarios. However, the mismatches between releasing locations and NO active sites seriously limited the available NO at areas of interest and greatly dampen the overall efficiency of delivery systems. Therefore, in the present study, a NO donor was developed to achieve intracellular delivery and release of NO to overcome the aforementioned challenges. Enhanced uptake and effective intracellular release of NO were realized via β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) mediated endocytosis and high level glutathione (GSH) inside cells, respectively. We demonstrated that intracellularly delivered NO would exert stronger bioeffects than premature release of NO outside targeted cells. Besides, β-CD assisted cellular uptake proved indispensable in maximizing the influence of NO in modulating cellular behavior. These results demonstrated the significance of intracellular delivery and release of NO in improving its bioutilization. The carrier could efficiently inhibit proliferation of SMCs, while promoting the growth of ECs.

However, organocopper(III) complexes with well-defined structures that can undergo reductive elimination are extremely rare, especially for the formation of Csp3-Csp3 bonds. We report herein a general method for the synthesis of a series of [alkyl-CuIII-(CF3)3]- complexes, the structures of which have been unequivocally characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystal diffraction. At elevated temperature, these complexes undergo reductive elimination following first-order kinetics, forming alkyl-CF3 products with good yields (up to 91%). Both kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the reductive elimination to form Csp3-CF3 bonds proceeds through a concerted transition state, with a Δ H⧧ = 20 kcal/mol barrier.",EGFR inhibitor C225 Increases the Radio-Sensitivity of Human Breast Cancer Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678455,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Objective: This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of C225 on the radio-sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells
line and to disclosure underlying mechanism. Methods: CCK8 assay was used to measure the proliferation inhibition
of C225 on MDA-MB-231 cells. The combined effects of C225 plus radiation on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
cells were also evaluated by CCK-8 assay. The clonogenic assay was performed to evaluate the cell surviving fractions
and to determine the radio-sensitizing effect of C225 on MDA-MB-231 cells. The apoptosis and cell cycle distribution
were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of p-EGFR, p-Akt, p-P38, and
caspase-3. Results: C225 had an inhibiting effect on the proliferation of cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The
cloning formation capacity was decreased in C225 plus radiation group. C225 increased radio-sensitivity of cells and
led to cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase markedly. Cells treated with C225 and radiation predominantly exhibited G0/G1
phase arrest and significant decreased in the fraction of cells in the S phase. Moreover, C225 and radiation significantly
increased the apoptosis rate of cells. Decreased cell proliferation was further supported by the down-regulation of p-EGFR
and its downstream singling pathway proteins such as p-Akt and p-P38. The up-regulation of the Caspase-3 expression
in C225 plus radiation group revealed that C225 could increase radiation-inducing cell apoptosis. Conclusion: C225
could increase the radio-sensitivity of cells, which may be due to the anti-proliferative synergistic effect between C225
and radiation as well as the down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",Anticancer Effect of Cisplatin-Loaded Poly (Butylcyanoacrylate) Nanoparticles on A172 Brain Cancer Cells Line,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678454,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Background: Drug delivery systems have been designed to achieve targeted delivery and control the release rate
of the drugs. A serious challenge associated with drug delivery systems is the presence of the blood-brain barrier which
limits drugs penetration. In the current study, the effects of cisplatin nanoparticles on A172 brain cancer cell line were
investigated. Methods: Cisplatin nanoparticles were produced by miniemulsion polymerization technique and their
properties were evaluated. Drug release assay was performed to characterize the nanoparticles’ properties. Here, we
examined the effects of cisplatin nanoparticles and free form of cisplatin on A172 cancer cell line. MTT assay was
performed for different concentrations of the drug. To measure the apoptosis rate in A172 cell line in the presence
of cisplatin nanoparticles or its free from, Annexin V staining method was used. Results: Our results indicated that
loading type of cisplatin was physical loading and only 4.7% of cisplatin was released after 68 h. Furthermore, MTT
assay showed that cisplatin nanoparticles in all concentrations had more cytotoxic effects on the cells comparing with
the free form of cisplatin and control groups. We also showed that cisplatin nanoparticles could increase apoptosis
in cancer cells more than the drug in the free form by using flow cytometry technique. Conclusion: Overall, these
findings proved that cisplatin loaded on poly (Butylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles, was more efficient than the free form
of cisplatin in treating A172 cancer cell line.",Efficacy and Safety of Microwave Ablation (MWA) for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in Difficult Anatomical Sites in Egyptian Patients with Liver Cirrhosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678453,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Background and aim: Imaging guided microwave ablation (MWA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has
become a widely used method over recent years. Tumors close to the diaphragm, gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder,
pancreas, hepatic hilum and major bile duct or vessels are generally considered relative contraindications for microwave
ablation. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of ultrasonography-guided MWA in treating
patients with HCC in difficult anatomical sites in comparison to those in conventional sites. Patients and methods:
Eighty-eight patients were included and divided into two groups: the study group of 44 with 46 lesions lying <5mm
from the diaphragm, hepatic capsule, gall bladder (GB) or large vessel; and the control group of 44 patients with
50 lesions in non-risky sites. Each lesion was ablated using an ultrasound guided microwave probe using a detailed
protocol. Results: Most of the patients were males, with a mean age of 57.8 years. In the study group, two patients
had lesions adjacent to the GB, twelve were perivascular and 32 were subcapsular. The overall successful ablation
rates were 84.8% and 92% in the study and control groups, respectively. Within the study group, ablation rates were
100%, 75% and 87.5% for lesions close to the GB, perivascular lesions and subcapsular lesions, respectively. One
patient developed a subcutaneous abscess, with good outcome after proper treatment. Fever, pain and asymptomatic
pleural effusion were reported after ablation without statistically significant difference between the groups or among
subgroups. In conclusion: MWA for HCC in difficult anatomical sites is as effective and safe as for ordinary sites.",Tumor Protein p53 and K-ras Gene Mutations in Peruvian Patients with Gallbladder Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678452,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Background: Recent studies have shown that genetic alterations are associated with the effect of patient geographic

A:T transitions at the CpG site or G:C to T:A transversions were found in one patient each. No significant differences
were found in the frequency of TP53 and K-ras mutations among patients in the 5 countries. Conclusions: Our findings
suggest that endogenous mechanisms and exogenous carcinogens may affect the carcinogenic process in Peruvian
gallbladder cancer patients, similar to that in Bolivian patients. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed
to clarify these findings.",Expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Its Receptors in Thyroid Nodular Hyperplasia and Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma: A Tertiary Health Care Centre Based Study,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678450,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Introduction: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic factor that plays an important role in
thyroid cancer. VEGF is known to have high affinity to VEGF receptors such as VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR).
Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and studies showed the increasing incidence of
PTC arising in nodular hyperplasia. Targeted therapy on these growth factors and receptors are used in management
of both differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma. This study aims to determine the expression of VEGF
and VEGF receptors (VEGFR) in thyroid nodular hyperplasia and PTC. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on
paraffinized archival tissue blocks of 113 nodular hyperplasias and 67 PTC from the thyroidectomy specimens in
the year of 2003 to 2014. The tissue sections were then stained by immunohistochemistry for VEGF, VEGFR-1 and
VEGFR-2. The lymph node involvement and extrathyroid extension also were determined. Results: The mean age of
PTC patients was 44.7±15.8 years and nodular hyperplasia were 42.2±13.6 years. There was a statistical difference
of VEGFR-1 (p=0.028) and VEGFR-2 (p=0.003) expression between nodular hyperplasia and PTC. However, no
significant difference of VEGF expression (p=0.576) between both diseases. Co-expression of VEGF and VEGFR-1
was significant in both nodular hyperplasia (p=0.016) and PTC (p=0.03), meanwhile no relevant relationship for VEGF
and VEGFR-2 expression (p>0.05). No significant association (p>0.05) between lymph node status and extrathyroid
extension with age groups, gender, VEGF and VEGFR expression. Conclusions: VEGF, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2
showed overexpression in both nodular hyperplasia and PTC. The expression of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are more
significant in PTC with relevant co-expression of VEGF and VEGFR-1. Therefore, the inhibition of VEGFR offers a
promising prospect for tumour management in thyroid carcinoma.",PTEN Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations Define Distinct Subgroups in North Indian Breast Cancer Patients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678449,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Background: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be subdivided on the basis of histopathological
features, genetic alterations, and gene-expression profiles. PTEN gene is considered an established tumor suppressor gene
in different types of cancer including breast cancer. However, the role of PTEN alterations in north Indian breast cancer
has not been explored especially in defining a group with distinct histological factors. Methodology: 181 sporadic breast
cancer and their adjacent normal tissues were included in the present study. We analyzed methylation and LOH through
MS-PCR and microsatellite markers respectively. While, for PTEN protein expression, we used immunohistochemistry.
All the molecular findings were correlated with the clinicopathological parameters of the patients to underline clinical
relevance. Results: We found that LOH and methylation of the PTEN promoter were significantly associated with
loss of PTEN protein expression, while, PTEN mutation was a rare event. Furthermore, out of 46 double hit cases (i.e.,
having both methylation and LOH), 70% (32/46) cases showed complete loss of PTEN expression (P= 0.0249). Both
LOH and PTEN promoter methylation were associated significantly with age and clinical stage, while, methylation
and loss of PTEN expression were associated with high grade and Her-2 negativity. In addition, a quadruple (ER/PR/
Her-2 and PTEN) negative group with distinct features was found. Conclusion: The pattern of PTEN expression and
its correlation with the clinical parameters indicates that loss of PTEN expression defines a clinical group with distinct
features. Hence, PTEN expression provides differential therapeutic strategies for north Indian breast cancer.",Successful Conservative Management of Hepatic Portal Venous Gas due to Anastomosis Leakage After a Sigmoidectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678448,Annals of coloproctology,2019 01 25,"In past decades, hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) has rarely been reported, and the mortality rate has been very high. In most cases, surgical intervention was needed. Presently, abdominal computed tomography can be conveniently used to diagnose HPVG, which has various underlying causes and benign courses. We present the case of a patient with HPVG due to anastomosis leakage after a sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis; the patient was cured with conservative management."

and Nutrition Examination Survey",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678433,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Chronic disease morbidity is a concern for cancer research. Contradictory results have been reported concerning
adherence to breast cancer screening among patients with chronic diseases. The study was conducted to assess the
adherence to breast cancer screening among women with chronic diseases in Korea. It was a cross sectional and population
based study; the data came from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2012.
Participation in breast cancer screening was analyzed among women who had at least one of eight chronic diseases
(hypertension, diabetes, cancer, dyslipidemia, stroke, depression, osteoarthritis and asthma). Pearson’s chi-squared test
and multiple logistic regression analysis were performed using STATA version 14. A total 2,404 women aged 40 years
or older were included in analysis. Among them, 77.3% had experienced breast cancer screening. In logistic regression
model, adherence to breast cancer screening was lower in women who have ever been diagnosed as diabetes mellitus
(odds ratio (OR)= 0.47, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.31-0.72), asthma (OR=0.44, 95%CI=0.24-0.82) and
higher in women who have ever been diagnosed as dyslipidemia (OR= 1.85, 95%CI= 1.27-2.69), osteoarthritis (OR=
1.42, 95%CI= 1.31-2.06) and cancers (OR= 2.70, 95%CI= 1.26-5.79) compared to women without those chronic
diseases. Based on treatment of chronic diseases, lower participation in breast cancer screening was observed in women
who were on treatment of diabetes mellitus (OR= 0.48, 95%CI= 0.31-0.74), asthma (OR= 0.41, 95%CI= 0.15-0.92)
and stroke (OR= 0.37, 95%CI= 0.14-0.97), and higher in women who were on treatment of dyslipidemia (OR= 1.37,
95%CI=1.42-2.14). In conclusion, low participation rate in breast cancer screening in women with some chronic diseases
was identified. The results from this study may provide an important contribution for helping to maintain and increase
participation in cancer screening of patients with chronic diseases.","Molecular Mechanism of Cancer Susceptibility Associated with Fok1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism of VDR in Relation to
Breast Cancer",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678432,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women worldwide. It is a multi-factorial disease caused by
genetic and environmental factors. Vitamin D has been hypothesized to lower the risk of breast cancer via the nuclear
vitamin D receptor (VDR). Genetic variants of these vitamin D metabolizing genes may alter the bioavailability of
vitamin D, and hence modulate the risk of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: The distribution of Fok1 VDR gene
(rs2228570) polymorphism and its association with breast cancer was analysed in a case–control study based on 125
breast cancer patients and 125 healthy females from North Indian population, using PCR-RFLP. An In silico exploration
of the probable mechanism of increased risk of breast cancer was performed to investigate the role of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer susceptibility. Results: The Fok1 ff genotype was significantly associated with an
increased risk of breast cancer (p=0.001; χ2=13.09; OR=16.909; %95 CI=2.20 - 130.11). In silico analysis indicated
that SNPs may lead to a loss in affinity of VDR to calcitriol, and may also cause the impairment of normal interaction
of liganded VDR with its heterodimeric partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), at protein level, thereby affecting target
gene transcription. Conclusion: Breast cancer risk and pathogenesis in females can be influenced by SNPs. SNPs in
VDR may cause alterations in the major molecular actions of VDR, namely ligand binding, heterodimerization and
transactivation. VDRE binding and co-activator recruitment by VDR appear to be functionally inseparable events that
affect vitamin D-elicited gene transcription. This indicates that breast cancer risk and pathogenesis in females may be
influenced by SNPs.",MiR-126 Modulates Angiogenesis in Breast Cancer by Targeting VEGF-A -mRNA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678431,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Background: Breast cancer is most serious reasons of women death around worldwide result in increasing its
morbidity and mortality. MicroRNAs are considered as significant regulators of cancer biological processes. The main
aim of this study is restoration of miR-126 could lead to modulate breast cell line and impairs their proliferation by
targeting vascular endothelial growth factor gene (VEGF-A). Methods: Breast cancer cell line (MCF7) was transfected
by miR-126 lipofectamine and negative miR control for 24 hr. Cytotoxic effects of miR-126 lipofectamine were
determined by cell viability assay. Cell proliferation and cell cycle were quantitatively measured using PicoGreen
assay and DAPI stain-flow cytometer analysis. For further investigation, Taq-Man real time PCR assay was performed
to detect relative VEGF-A and miRNA-126 level. Results: MiR-126 was overexpressed in treated breast cancer cell
(MCF7) compared with control cells. miR-126 expression has been associated –with a decrease in cell proliferation
and arrested MCF7 cells at G1 phase. The study found that vascular endothelial growth factor is regulated by miR-
126. Hence, VEGF-A is considered as functional vital and direct target to miR-126 in breast cancer cell line (MCF7).
Conclusions: This study provided that manipulated miR-126 level may suggest a novel therapeutic approach in breast
cancer treatment. However, an animal models study is needed to address and prove predictive ability of miR-126 on
breast cancer controlling.",Anti-Proliferative Effects of Methanol and Water Extracts of Pyrrosia piloselloides on the Hela Human Cervical Carcinoma Cell Line,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678430,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Background: Cervical cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms and a leading cause of cancer
death among females worldwide. Limitations with conventional medical treatments have driven researchers to
search for alternative approaches using natural products. This study aimed to detemine potential anti-proliferative
effects of methanol and water extracts of Pyrrosia piloselloides (P. piloselloides) on the HeLa cell line. Methods:
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays were performed to determine IC50
concentrations and apoptosis analysis was by flow cytometry. To identify chemical compounds in the extracts, gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was employed. Results: P. piloselloides methanol extracts (PPME) showed
antiproliferative effects on HeL awith an IC50 of 16.25μg/mL while the P. piloselloides water extract (PPWE) was without

Finding the
pulmonary nodule helps in the diagnosis of lung cancer in early stage and also increase the lifetime of the individual.
Accurate segmentation of normal and abnormal portion in segmentation is challenging task in computer-aided diagnostics.
Methods: The article proposes an innovative method to spot the cancer portion using Otsu’s segmentation algorithm. It
is followed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to classify the abnormal portion of the lung image. Results:
The suggested methods use the Otsu’s thresholding and active contour based segmentation techniques to locate the
affected lung nodule of CT images. The segmentation is followed by an SVM classifier in order to categorize the
affected portion is normal or abnormal. The proposed method is suitable to provide good and accurate segmentation
and classification results for complex images. Conclusion: The comparative analysis between the two segmentation
methods along with SVM classifier was performed. A classification process based on active contour and SVM techniques
provides better than Otsu’s segmentation for complex lung images.",Breast Cancer Detection using Crow Search Optimization based Intuitionistic Fuzzy Clustering with Neighborhood Attraction,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678427,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Objective: Generally, medical images contain lots of noise that may lead to uncertainty in diagnosing the
abnormalities. Computer aided diagnosis systems offer a support to the radiologists in identifying the disease affected
area. In mammographic images, some normal tissues may appear to be similar to masses and it is tedious to differentiate
them. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework for the detection of mammographic masses that leads to
early diagnosis of breast cancer. Methods: This work proposes a Crow search optimization based Intuitionistic fuzzy
clustering approach with neighborhood attraction (CrSA-IFCM-NA) for identifying the region of interest. First order
moments were extracted from preprocessed images. These features were given as input to the Intuitionistic fuzzy
clustering algorithm. Instead of randomly selecting the initial centroids, crow search optimization technique is applied
to choose the best initial centroid and the masses are separated. Experiments are conducted over the images taken from
the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (mini-MIAS) database. Results: CrSA-IFCM-NA effectively separated
the masses from mammogram images and proved to have good results in terms of cluster validity indices indicating
the clear segmentation of the regions. Conclusion: The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed
method proves to be encouraging for detection of masses. Thus, it provides a better assistance to the radiologists in
diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage.",Identification of Key Candidate Genes and Pathways for Relationship between Ovarian Cancer and Diabetes Mellitus Using Bioinformatical Analysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678426,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Ovarian cancer is one of the three major gynecologic cancers in the world. The aim of this study is to find the
relationship between ovarian cancer and diabetes mellitus by using the genetic screening technique. By GEO database
query and related online tools of analysis, we analyzed 185 cases of ovarian cancer and 10 control samples from
GSE26712, and a total of 379 different genes were identified, including 104 up-regulated genes and 275 down-regulated
genes. The up-regulated genes were mainly enriched in biological processes, including cell adhesion, transcription of
nucleic acid and biosynthesis, and negative regulation of cell metabolism. The down-regulated genes were enriched in
cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and macromolecular metabolism. Protein-protein interaction was analyzed
by network diagram and module synthesis analysis. The top ten hub genes (CDC20, H2AFX, ENO1, ACTB, ISG15,
KAT2B, HNRNPD, YWHAE, GJA1 and CAV1) were identified, which play important roles in critical signaling
pathways that regulate the process of oxidation-reduction reaction and carboxylic acid metabolism. CTD analysis
showed that the hub genes were involved in 1,128 distinct diseases (bonferroni-corrected P<0.05). Further analysis by
drawing the Kaplan-Meier survival curve indicated that CDC20 and ISG15 were statistically significant (P<0.05). In
conclusion, glycometabolism was related to ovarian cancer and genes and proteins in glycometabolism could serve as
potential targets in ovarian cancer treatment.",Single Nucleotide Polymorphism in Adiponectin Gene and Risk of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678425,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 14,"Introduction: Adiponectin is anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor cytokine secreted exclusively from adipocytes.

Methods: From August 2014 to December 2016, 12 patients (8 males and 4 females, aged 35-72 years) with skin and soft tissue defects of extremities associated with tendon and bone exposure were treated in Hanzhong Central Hospital. The sizes of the primary wounds after debridement were 10 cm×8 cm-22 cm×14 cm, and the wounds were repaired with 12 cm×10 cm-24 cm×16 cm free anterolateral femoral perforator flaps. The anterolateral femoral donor sites, which were 8.0 cm×4.0 cm-14.0 cm×7.5 cm in the secondary wounds after skin extensional suture, were repaired with perforating branch flaps of medial vastus muscle in the size of 9.0 cm×5.0 cm-15.0 cm×8.5 cm. The medial femoral donor sites were sutured directly. Results: All the perforating branch flaps of medial vastus muscle and free anterolateral femoral perforator flaps survived in 12 patients. Following up for 6 to 12 months, the medial femoral perforator flaps had good local shape and texture. The flaps of 8 patients without cutaneous nerve transection were sensitive. The sensation of the flaps of the other 4 patients gradually recovered, and the functions of the ipsilateral knee joints were normal. Conclusions: The medial femoral perforator flap has a stable anatomy and abundant blood supply, which can be used to repair the secondary wound in the donor site of the free anterolateral femoral perforator flap conveniently.

Methods: From September 2013 to February 2017, 11 extensively burned patients with deep tissue defects in posterior ankle region were treated in our unit. Two patients had tissue defects in bilateral posterior ankle regions. The wound sizes ranged from 5.8 cm×4.6 cm to 11.7 cm×5.2 cm. Free superficial temporal fascia flaps with the same sizes as the wounds were designed and resected to repair wounds in posterior ankle regions after debridement. The proximal end of superficial temporal veins and posterior tibial veins were performed with end-to-end anastomosis, and superficial temporal arteries and posterior tibial arteries were performed with end-to-side anastomosis. Skin grafts were resected to cover the superficial temporal fascia flaps according to patients' condition of donor sites. The donor sites were sutured directly. Results: All fascial flaps in 11 patients survived, while 2 skin grafts had partial necrosis, and they healed after secondary skin graft. All patients were followed up for 6 to 13 months, and the shape and function of the operation sites in all patients recovered well. Conclusions: The method of combining free superficial temporal fascia flaps with skin grafts can repair deep wounds in posterior ankle regions of extensively burned patients. It has the advantages of good appearances in the recipient sites, strong resistances to infection of fascia flaps, minimal damages to the donor sites, short course of disease, and good prognosis of patients.",[Protective effects and mechanism of keratinocyte growth factor combined with hypoxia inducible factor-1α on intestinal crypt epithelial cells of rats with hypoxia stress].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678402,Zhonghua shao shang za zhi = Zhonghua shaoshang zazhi = Chinese journal of burns,2019 04 08,"Objective: To investigate the protective effects and mechanism of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) combined with hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) on intestinal crypt epithelial cells (IEC-6) of rats with hypoxia stress.

Extract in the Gastric Carcinoma Cell Line (AGS),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678391,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Aim and objectives: Natural products and derivatives of medicinal vegetation can play an important role to the
cure tumor. The Present study was focused to determine the effect of Cornus mass L. extract on the induction of
apoptosis in AGS gastric carcinoma cell line in compared to L929 cells. Methods: In this experimental study, AGS
and L929 cells were cultured and treated with different concentrations (0–10 mg/ml) of Cornus mass L. extract for 48
and 72 hours. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. The optical density of the colored solution was quantified
at 570 nm wavelengths by an ELISA Reader. Making use of the apoptosis detection kit of Annexin V-FITC, PI and
double staining with Annexin V-FITC were carried out for flow cytometry investigations. Data were analyzed by
ANOVA. Variations with a P-value less than 0.05 were considered significant. Results: shows a noticeable deviation
among various concentrations of extract when cells were treated for 48, 72 h declined cell viability in AGS cell line in
comparison L929 cell lines in a dose and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). This extract also displayed approximately
several-fold increased anti-cancer potency in AGS compared to L929 cells. The IC50 value in AGS cells (evaluated
after 48,72h) of the extract against AGS cells was 5/44, 2/44 mg/ml (p≤0.05). The analysis results of flow cytometry
indicated that apoptosis was induced by the extract in AGS cells treated, compared with L929 cells. Conclusion: Each
of our results implicates the reality that Cornus mass L. extract acts as a novel, potent inhibitor of cancer proliferation
in in vitro. This may result in developing a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of indole-sensitive cancers.",Comparison of Real Cost Versus the Indonesian Case Base Groups (INA-CBGs) Tariff Rates Among Patients of High- Incidence Cancers Under the National Health Insurance Scheme,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678390,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Background: The national health insurance of Indonesia has implemented the Indonesian Case Base Groups
(INA-CBGs) tariff rates for healthcare payment. However, there is still problem of difference between the real cost of
healthcare and the INA-CBGs tariff rates. This study aimed to evaluate the real cost of healthcare in comparison with
the INA-CBG’s tariff rates and to analyze factors associating with the real cost. The study focus on healthcare cost of
non-chemotherapy expenditure among patients of high-incidence cancers having chemotherapy covered by the national
health insurance. Methods: The study was conducted from the perspective of healthcare provider. Costs data was
obtained from hospital billing of Sanglah hospital, a referral hospital in Bali Provincein the period of January – July
2014. The data involved 383, 161, and 152 of in-patient breast cancer cases, cervical cancer cases, and nasopharyngeal
cancer cases, respectively. Descriptive statistic was used to analyze patients characteristics, one sample t-test was used
to analyze the mean difference of healthcare cost based on real cost and INA-CBG’s tariff rates, and finally, bivariate
analysis was used to examine relationship between patients’ characteristics and the real cost. Results: The study shows
there were significant differences of non-chemotherapy expenditures based on the real cost and INA-CBG’s tariff rates,
in which the costs were lower for the real cost. Factors which significantly associated with the real cost were number of
procedure, type of hospitalized room, and length of stay. Conclusions: The study supports the necessary of evaluation
of the INA-CBG’s tariff rates to adjust to the real healthcare expenditure. On the other hand, the hospital needs to
evaluate the service quality of patient treatment by optimizing budget allocated by the health insurance.",Integrating a 92-Gene Expression Analysis for the Management of Neuroendocrine Tumors of Unknown Primary,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678389,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Background: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare tumors that can originate from any part of the body. Often,
imaging or exploratory surgery can assist in the identification of the tumor primary site, which is critical to the
management of the disease. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of unknown primary constitute approximately 10-15%
of all NETs. Determining the original site of the tumor is critical to providing appropriate and effective treatment.
Methods: We performed a retrospective review of neuroendocrine tumors at our institution between 2012 and 2016
using a 92-gene cancer ID analysis. Results: 56 patients with NETs of unknown primary were identified. Samples
for 38 of the 56 underwent the 92-gene cancer ID analysis. The primary site of the tumor was identified with >95%
certainty in 35 of the 38 patients. Conclusion: The 92-gene cancer ID analysis identified a primary site in 92% of our
NETs study cohort that previously had been unknown. The results have direct implications on management of patients
with regard to FDA-approved treatment options.",Overweight as an Additional Risk Factor for Colorectal Neoplasia in Lean Population,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678388,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Background: Overweight in Thailand is not as common as in Western countries. We sought to evaluate overweight
as the additional risk factor that can increase the prediction of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) detection in Thais apart from
the Asia-Pacific Colorectal Screening (APCS) score. Methods: We prospectively enrolled asymptomatic 338 subjects
who underwent screening colonoscopy between November 2016 and September 2017. All risk factors according to
APCS, BMI and the presence of metabolic syndrome were collected. Overweight was defined as BMI ≥23 kg/m2. By
APCS score, subjects were categorized into 1) high-risk and 2) average-risk. Using the combination of APCS score
and overweight, subjects were stratified into 4 groups; high-risk with overweight (G1), average-risk with overweight
(G2), high-risk with normal weight (G3) average-risk and with normal weight (G4). Logistic regression analysis was
used to estimate the risk of detecting CRN. Results: The prevalence of CRN in the high-risk subjects was higher
than that of in the average-risk subjects (49%vs.32%; OR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.17-3.41). After adjustment for APCS risk
factors and metabolic syndrome, overweight significantly increased the risk of detecting CRN (OR, 2.52; 95%CI,
1.57-4.05). Among the 4 groups, the detection rates of CRN were significantly different (G1=64%, G2=40%, G3=32%
and G4=21%, p<0.01). The relative risk of detecting CRN increased when G1 (OR 6.49; 95%CI, 2.87-14.67), and G2
(2.42; 1.39-4.21) were compared with G4. Conclusions: In addition to the APCS score, overweight is an independent
risk factor for detecting CRN. In Thai population, combining overweight and APCS score may be useful to improve
the prediction for CRN.",Setting Priorities in Childhood Cancer in Low Income Countries Using Nominal Group Technique: Experience from an International Childhood Cancer Forum Exercise in Bangladesh,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678387,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Background and Objectives: Cancer is one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The
incidence of paediatric cancer in particular, in Bangladesh is alarming and most of these patients die without correct
diagnosis and adequate medical treatment (MOHFW, 2008). There is a clear disparity in access to care between rural
and urban areas (WHO, 2015; Rahman, 2001). There are no established formal childhood cancer registry systems
to help inform planning decisions across the country. Most importantly, there are no explicit priorities or methods
for identifying such priorities in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). We used a Nominal Group Technique
(NGT) method during the International Childhood Cancer Forum (ICCF) for setting priorities. The following two key
objectives were addressed: Trialling the NGT in Bangladesh as a priority setting tool; and identify childhood cancer
priorities in Bangladesh. Methods: The Nominal Group Techniques (NGT) method was used to elicit information from
the participants of ICCF to identify priorities for research and interventions for childhood cancer care in Bangladesh.
Participants were divided into four groups. Each group discussed one question each. Two questions focused on cancer
research, and the other two focused on interventions. Results: In regards to outcomes, NGT successfully identified
the scale of childhood cancer care and identified priorities/action areas to address in Bangladesh. Six priorities were
identified and a successful collaboration for implementation has been established with several international organisations.
Conclusion: Nominal group technique was found to be an effective tool to identify research and intervention priorities
to address childhood cancer in a developing country. For resource limited countries in similar situations, they could
benefit from adopting this approach in healthcare settings.",Estimating Premature Mortality Cost of Cancers Attributable to Obesity in Indonesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678385,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Obesity is one of the risk factor of non-communicable diseases, one of them is cancer. It may lead to the escalation
of mortality. Indonesia is the top 10 country with the highest prevalence of cancer burden due to obesity. The chance
of cancer caused by obesity is estimated epidemiologic descriptive and prevalence-based estimation with obesity
attributable cancer mortality and Premature Mortality Cost as indicators. Obesity-related cancer mortality is calculated
by multiplying Obesity Attributable Fractions (OAFs) rate by cancer death rate, which OAFs rate obtained by calculating
obesity prevalence data and relative risk of each disease. Premature Mortality Cost was calculated by multiplying
obesity-related cancer mortality, life expectancy, and Indonesian average income. The highest total mortality’s rate
for obesity-related cancer and overweight-related cancer are colon cancer (929 deaths), ovarian cancer (599 deaths),
and pancreatic cancer (190 deaths). The highest value of Premature Mortality Cost are IDR 61,118 million for ovarian
cancer, IDR 56,651 million for colon cancer, and IDR 15,472 million for pancreatic cancer. The estimation of cancer
burden due to obesity shall be done to help the government determines the health programs and decrease the number
of cancer burden due to obesity in Indonesia.",The Impact of Triage for Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance with Human Papillomavirus Testing in Cervical Cancer Screening in Japan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678384,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Background: One of the features of cervical cancer screening using the combination of cytology and human
papillomavirus (HPV) testing is the triage for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). The
effectiveness of the triage has been recognized widely. However, there are few reports evaluating this triage process in
Japan. Material and Methods: We retrospectively examined the results of cytology and HPV co-testing for cervical
cancer screening in the Oyama area of Tochigi Prefecture between 2012 and 2014. Women who were ASC-US/HPV
positive and had cytologic abnormalities [low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or worse] were examined
by colposcopy. The results of the colposcopy testing were evaluated. In addition, we also examined the results of those
who underwent co-testing a year after a ASC-US/HPV-negative result. Results: A total of 21,342 women received
their first screening test during the study period, with 542 (2.5%) found to have ASC-US. Of the ASC-US-positive
women, 289 (53.3%) were also HPV positive. The prevalence of CIN+ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or higher)
in the ASC-US/HPV-positive group was 63.2%, with 81.8%, 16.4% and 4.8%. showing CIN 1, CIN 2 and CIN 3+,
respectively. The prevalence of CIN+ in the LSIL group was 66.8%, with the majority having a low risk CIN 1 (76.6%)
compared to CIN 2 (18.6%), and CIN 3+ (4.8%). No significant difference was observed between the LSIL and ASC-US/
HPV-positive groups. The prevalence of women diagnosed with CIN in the ASC-US/HPV-negative group, following
co-testing a year after colposcopy was low (3%). Conclusions: The ASC-US/HPV-positive group was comparable to
the LSIL group in terms of prevalence of CIN+ lesions. Furthermore, low CIN prevalence after one year in the ASCUS/
HPV-negative group provides confirmation that the screening interval could be extended. The application of HPV
triage (which is routine in other countries) to identify these groups would be of benefit in Japan.",Immunohistochemical Evaluation of Ki-67 and Comparison with Clinicopathologic Factors in Breast Carcinomas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678383,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Background: Patients primarily received tamoxifen based on their menopausal status due to the lack of
immunohistochemistry. A recent study has shown that hormonal receptors were not correlated with menopausal status,
and thus, indicating that they present limited therapeutic and prognostic significance in breast cancer management.
This study aimed to evaluate Ki-67 value and analyze its association with clinicopathologic parameters in breast cancer
patients. Methods: The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tissue blocks of 125 patients with primary breast
carcinomas were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using Ventana Benchmark® GX automated immunostainer.
Analysis of variance and Chi-2 test were used to examine the relationship between Ki-67 and clinicopathologic
variables. Results: The mean age of 125 patients included in the study was 47.7 years. The average score of Ki-67
was 56.0%. 84.8% of patients showed Ki-67 ≥ 14%. Mean scores of Ki-67 were correlated with grade (p = 0.006),
PR (p = 0.026), histological type, ER, combined ER/RP, and molecular subtype (p < 0.001). Ki-67 was independent
of HER2 (p = 0.402) and menopausal status (p = 0.471). The frequency of Ki-67 according to St Gallen 2011 was
associated with histological type (p = 0.005), grade (p = 0.005), ER (p < 0.001), combined ER/PR (p = 0.004), and
molecular subtype (p = 0.004). There was no significant relationship between the distribution of Ki-67 and the age of
the patients (p = 0.859), menopausal status (p = 0.979), PR (p = 0.149), and HER2 (p = 0.597). Conclusion: Ki-67 is
useful for treatment decisions in primary breast cancer patients. The high value of Ki-67 was associated with adverse
clinicopathologic factors. The increased Ki-67 value should be carefully investigated in triple negative patients.",Antimetastatic Potential of Garcinone E in Human Oral Cancer Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678382,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Objective: Oral cancer presents as a devastating type of malignancy. It is predominant in populations with high
use of alcohol and various forms of tobacco as well as poor diets with low intake of fruits and vegetables. The present
study focused on the potential of Garcinone E to inhibit HSC-4 oral cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
Methods: MTT and colony forming assays were performed to study antiproliferative effects of Garcinone E. Hoechst
staining was used to determine levels of apoptosis, with cell invasion and scratch assays conducted for migration and
invasion characteristics. The levels of MMPs and cytokines were quantified in Garcinone E treated cells by ELISA.
Results: Garcinone E inhibited the proliferation and colony forming potential of HSC-4 cells. It also suppressed
migration and invasion with inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Moreover, it elevated IL-2 and reduced
IL-6 expression in HSC-4 cells. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate for the first time that Garcinone E might inhibit
metastasis of an oral cancer cell line by blocking invasion, migration and MMP production.",Nottingham Prognostic Index is an Applicable Prognostic Tool in Non-Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678381,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,2019 05 17,"Introduction: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a poor prognosis due to high mortality
and early relapse, requiring the study of its prognostic factors. Tumor size, histological grade and lymph node status
represent important parameters that are widely studied in breast cancer, and are retained as prognostic factors by several
international guidelines. The Nottingham team combined these parameters into a prognostic score called the Nottingham
prognostic index (NPI). In this study, we investigated the influence of NPI on outcomes in non metastatic TNBC.
Methodology: This retrospective cohort study included all female patients with non metastatic TNBC who received
treatment at the Regional Oncology Center Hassan II Oujda - Morocco, between January 2009 and December 2011.
The prognostic impact of the NPI on the survival curves at 5 years was studied using multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models. Results: The analysis of the data involved 98 patients, 39 patients (39.8%) were classed in the poor
prognosis group with a NPI > 5.4. The Overall survival (OS) and Disease free survival (DFS) rates at 5 years, in this
group, were 70 and 55.6 % respectively. After adjusting for clinic-pathological variables, a NPI > 5.4 was associated with
mortality (HR: 2.598, 95% CI: 1.423 – 4.744, p = 0.002) and disease progression (HR: 2.512, CI to 95%: 1.496 – 4.219,
p <0.001) in patients with non-metastatic TNBC. Conclusion: This retrospective cohort analysis showed that NPI was
an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS at 5 years in women with non metastatic TNBC. Once validated, the
impact of this score on survival outcomes could be considered in the clinical management of TNBC."

Various tools were applied to better understand the interactions between the organic (alizarin) and inorganic (LH) components, including ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), 27-Aluminm solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TOF-SIMS showed that modification of the LH had been successful and revealed the presence of characteristic ions C14H₇O₄Mg⁺ and C14H₆O₅Al-, suggesting interactions between the organic chromophore and both metal ions present in the mixed oxide host. Interactions were also observed between Al3+ ions and Alizarin molecules in 27Al NMR spectra, with a chemical shift detected in the case of the modified LH matrix. Any changes in color following reactions with Mg2+ and Al3+ ions were observed. Some of the physicochemical properties of alizarin, such as resistance to dissolution and color stability at elevated temperatures, were improved in comparison to the pure dye. This effect can be attributed to strong dye-LH interactions and the effective transformation of alizarin into an insoluble form. Moreover, the pigments exhibited higher thermal resistance and greater color stability in comparison to commercially available alizarin lakes (Alizarin Crimson).",Development of a New Laparoscopic Detection System for Gastric Cancer Using Near-Infrared Light-Emitting Clips with Glass Phosphor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678369,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"Laparoscopic surgery is now a standard treatment for gastric cancer. Currently, the location of the gastric cancer is identified during laparoscopic surgery via the preoperative endoscopic injection of charcoal ink around the primary tumor; however, the wide spread of injected charcoal ink can make it difficult to accurately visualize the specific site of the tumor. To precisely identify the locations of gastric tumors, we developed a fluorescent detection system comprising clips with glass phosphor (Yb3+, Nd3+ doped to Bi₂O₃-B₂O₃-based glasses, size: 2 mm × 1 mm × 3 mm) fixed in the stomach and a laparoscopic fluorescent detection system for clip-derived near-infrared (NIR) light (976 nm). We conducted two ex vivo experiments to evaluate the performance of this fluorescent detection system in an extirpated pig stomach and a freshly resected human stomach and were able to successfully detect NIR fluorescence emitted from the clip in the stomach through the stomach wall by the irradiation of excitation light (λ: 808 nm). These results suggest that the proposed combined NIR light-emitting clip and laparoscopic fluorescent detection system could be very useful in clinical practice for accurately identifying the location of a primary gastric tumor during laparoscopic surgery.",The Beginning of Systems Chemistry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678368,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"Systems Chemistry has its roots in the research on the autocatalytic self-replication of biological macromolecules, first of all of synthetic deoxyribonucleic acids.

In the absence of OTA, carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled aptamer can partly hybridize with the complementary strand of OTA aptamer (OTA-cAPT), which contains four guanines at its 3'-end. As a result, the fluorescence of FAM is quenched due to PIET and stacked guanines. In the presence of OTA, FAM-labeled OTA aptamer can bind specifically to OTA, and thereby the high fluorescence intensity of the dye can be maintained. Under the optimal conditions, the method had a detection limit of 1.3 nM. In addition, the method we proposed is highly sensitive and specific for OTA. Furthermore, the method was proven to be reliable based on its successful application in the detection of OTA in red wine samples. Therefore, this promising, facile, and quencher-free method may be applied to detect other toxins by using other appropriate aptamers.",A Retrospective Analysis of the Cartilage Kunitz Protease Inhibitory Proteins Identifies These as Members of the Inter-α-Trypsin Inhibitor Superfamily with Potential Roles in the Protection of the Articulatory Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678366,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 08,The aim of this study was to assess if the ovine articular cartilage serine proteinase inhibitors (SPIs) were related to the Kunitz inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (ITI) family.,Antibiotic Stewardship-Twenty Years in the Making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678365,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 19,"In the last 20 years, efforts were made to optimize antibiotic use in hospitals across the world as a means of addressing the increasing threat of antibiotic resistance. Despite robust evidence supporting optimal practice, antibiotic decision-making remains sub-optimal in many settings, including in hospitals. Globally, resources remain a limiting factor in the implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs. In addition, antibiotic decision-making is a social process dependent on cultural and contextual factors. Cultural boundaries in healthcare and across specialties still limit the involvement of allied healthcare professionals in stewardship interventions. There is variation in the social norms and antibiotic-prescribing behaviors between specialties in hospitals. The cultural differences between specialties and healthcare professionals (1) shape the shared knowledge within and across specialties in the patient pathway, and (2) result in variation in care, thus impacting patient outcomes.

For full use of those by-products, gelatin (STB-G) with a yield of 6.37 ± 0.64% was extracted from skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) bone using water at 60 °C for 8 h. Amino acid analysis showed that STB-G contained Gly (340.3 residues/1000 residues) as the major amino acid and its imino acid content was 177.3 residues/1000 residues. Amino acid composition, SDS-PAGE, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum investigations confirmed that the physicochemical properties of STB-G were similar to those of type I collagen from skipjack tuna bone (STB-C), but partial high molecular weight components of STB-G were degraded during the extraction process, which induced that the gelatin was easier to be hydrolyzed by protease than mammalian gelatins and was suitable for preparation of hydrolysate. Therefore, STB-G was hydrolyzed under in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (pepsin-trypsin system) and five antioxidant peptides were purified from the resulted hydrolysate (STB-GH) and identified as GPDGR, GADIVA, GAPGPQMV, AGPK, and GAEGFIF, respectively. Among the gelatin hydrolysate, fractions, and isolated peptides, GADIVA and GAEGFIF exhibited the strongest scavenging activities on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical (EC50 0.57 and 0.30 mg/mL), hydroxyl radical (EC50 0.25 and 0.32 mg/mL), superoxide anion radical (EC50 0.52 and 0.48 mg/mL), and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical (EC50 0.41 and 0.21 mg/mL). Moreover, GADIVA and GAEGFIF showed a high inhibiting ability on lipid peroxidation in a linoleic acid model system. The strong activities of five isolated peptides profited by their small molecular sizes and the antioxidant amino acid residues in their sequences. These results suggested that five isolated peptides (STP1⁻STP5), especially GADIVA and GAEGFIF, might serve as potential antioxidants applied in health food industries.",Mycotoxins and Mycotoxin Producing Fungi in Pollen: Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678361,Toxins,2019 04 02,"Due to its divergent chemical composition and good nutritional properties, pollen is not only important as a potential food supplement but also as a good substrate for the development of different microorganisms. Among such microorganisms, toxigenic fungi are extremely dangerous as they can synthesize mycotoxins as a part of their metabolic pathways. Furthermore, favorable conditions that enable the synthesis of mycotoxins (adequate temperature, relative humidity, pH, and aw values) are found frequently during pollen collection and/or production process. Internationally, several different mycotoxins have been identified in pollen samples, with a noted predominance of aflatoxins, ochratoxins, fumonisins, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, and T-2 toxin. Mycotoxins are, generally speaking, extremely harmful for humans and other mammals. Current EU legislation contains guidelines on the permissible content of this group of compounds, but without information pertaining to the content of mycotoxins in pollen. Currently only aflatoxins have been researched and discussed in the literature in regard to proposed limits. Therefore, the aim of this review is to give information about the presence of different mycotoxins in pollen samples collected all around the world, to propose possible aflatoxin contamination pathways, and to emphasize the importance of a regular mycotoxicological analysis of pollen. Furthermore, a suggestion is made regarding the legal regulation of pollen as a food supplement and the proposed tolerable limits for other mycotoxins."

A major contributor to these health disparities is chronic and severe health workforce shortages outside of metropolitan areas-a global phenomenon. Despite emerging recognition of the important influence of place-based social processes on retention, much of the political attention and research is directed elsewhere. A structured scoping review was undertaken to describe the range of research addressing the influence of place-based social processes on turnover or retention of rural health professionals, to identify current gaps in the literature, and to formulate a guide for future rural health workforce retention research. A systematic search of the literature was performed. In total, 21 articles were included, and a thematic analysis was undertaken. The themes identified were (1) rural familiarity and/or interest, (2) social connection and place integration, (3) community participation and satisfaction, and (4) fulfillment of life aspirations. Findings suggest place-based social processes affect and influence the retention of rural health workforces. However, these processes are not well understood. Thus, research is urgently needed to build robust understandings of the social determinants of rural workforce retention. It is contended that future research needs to identify which place-based social processes are amenable to change.",Two-Stage Plasma-Thermal Nitridation Processes for the Production of Aluminum Nitride Powders from Aluminum Powders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678349,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"The synthesis of aluminum nitride (AlN) powders is traditionally done via the thermal nitridation process, in which the reaction temperature reaches as high as 960 °C, with more than several hours of reaction time. Moreover, the occurrence of agglomeration in melting Al particles results in poor AlN quality and a low efficiency of nitridation. In this study, an atmosphere-pressure microwave-plasma preceded the pre-synthesis process. This process operates at 550 °C for 2⁻10 min with the addition of NH₄Cl (Al: NH₄Cl = 1:1) for generating a hard AlN shell to avoid the flow and aggregation of the melting Al metals. Then, the mass production of AlN powders by the thermal nitridation process can be carried out by rapidly elevating the reaction temperature (heating rate of 15 °C/min) until 1050 °C is reached. X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) crystal analysis shows that without the peak, Al metals can be observed by synthesizing AlN via plasma nitridation (at 550 °C for 2 min, Al: NH₄Cl = 1:1), followed by thermal nitridation (at 950 °C for 1 h). Moreover, SEM images show that well-dispersed AlN powders without agglomeration were produced. Additionally, the particle size of the produced AlN powder (usually < 1 μm) tends to be reduced from 2⁻5 μm (Al powders), resulting in a more efficient synthesizing process (lower reaction temperature, shorter reaction time) for mass production.",Swimming of Spermatozoa in a Maxwell Fluid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678348,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"It has been suggested that the swimming mechanism used by spermatozoa could be adopted for self-propelled micro-robots in small environments and potentially applied to biomedical engineering. Mammalian sperm cells must swim through a viscoelastic mucus layer to find the egg cell. Thus, understanding how sperm cells swim through viscoelastic liquids is significant not only for physiology, but also for the design of micro-robots. In this paper, we developed a numerical model of a sperm cell in a linear Maxwell fluid based on the boundary element slender-body theory coupling method. The viscoelastic properties were characterized by the Deborah number (De), and we found that, under the prescribed waveform, the swimming speed decayed with the Deborah number in the small-De regime (De < 1.0). The swimming efficiency was independent of the Deborah number, and the decrease in the swimming speed was not significantly affected by the wave pattern.","Design, Synthesis, Anticancer Evaluation and Molecular Modeling of Novel Estrogen Derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678347,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"A series of estrone derivatives 3⁻8 was designed and synthesized using estrone arylmethylenes 2a,b as starting materials and their structures were confirmed by different spectral data and elemental analyses.

In addition, all compounds were subjected to in vitro and in vivo inhibition assays for EGFR and VEGFR-2 kinases as well as p53 ubiquitination activity to obtain more details about their mechanism of action. Based on the promising results, a molecular docking study was investigated for the most representative compound 5a against the two targets, EGFR and VEGFR-2 kinases, to assess its binding affinity, hoping to rationalize and obtain potent anticancer agents in the future.",Experimental Investigation on Interfacial Defect Criticality of FRP-Confined Concrete Columns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678346,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"Defects between fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) and repaired concrete components may easily come out due to misoperation during manufacturing, environmental deterioration, or impact from external load during service life. The defects may cause a degraded structure performance and even the unexpected structural failure. Different non-destructive techniques (NDTs) and sensors have been developed to assess the defects in FRP bonded system. The information of linking up the detected defects by NDTs and repair schemes is needed by assessing the criticality of detected defects. In this study, FRP confined concrete columns with interfacial defects were experimentally tested to determine the interfacial defect criticality on structural performance. It is found that interfacial defect can reduce the FRP confinement effectiveness, and ultimate strength and its corresponding strain of column deteriorate significantly if the interfacial defect area is larger than 50% of total confinement area. Meanwhile, proposed analytical model considering the defect ratio is validated for the prediction of stress⁻strain behavior of FRP confined columns. The evaluation of defect criticality could be made by comparing predicted stress⁻strain behavior with the original design to determine corresponding maintenance strategies.","Hop Compounds: Extraction Techniques, Chemical Analyses, Antioxidative, Antimicrobial, and Anticarcinogenic Effects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678345,Nutrients,2019 04 01,"Hop plants comprise a variety of natural compounds greatly differing in their structure and properties. A wide range of methods have been developed for their isolation and chemical analysis, as well as for determining their antioxidative, antimicrobial, and antigenotoxic potentials. This contribution provides an overview of extraction and fractionation techniques of the most important hop compounds known for their health-promoting features. Although hops remain the principal ingredient for providing the taste, stability, and antimicrobial protection of beer, they have found applications in the pharmaceutical and other food industries as well. This review focuses on numerous health-promoting effects of hops raging from antioxidative, sedative, and anti-inflammatory potentials, over anticarcinogenic features to estrogenic activity. Therefore, hops should be exploited for the prevention and even healing of several prevalent diseases like cardiovascular disorders and various cancer types. New ideas for future studies on hops are finally presented: computational investigations of chemical reactivities of hop compounds, nanoencapsulation, and synergistic effects leading to a higher bioavailability of biologically active substances as well as the application of waste hop biomass from breweries for the production of high-added-value products in accordance with the biorefinery concept.",Daily Green Tea Infusions in Hypercalciuric Renal Stone Patients: No Evidence for Increased Stone Risk Factors or Oxalate-Dependent Stones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678344,Nutrients,2019 04 01,"Green tea is widely used as a ''healthy'' beverage due to its high level of antioxidant polyphenol compounds.

The objective was to determine, in a cross-sectional observational study among a population of 273 hypercalciuric stone-formers referred to our center for metabolic evaluation, whether daily green tea drinkers (n = 41) experienced increased stone risk factors (especially for oxalate) compared to non-drinkers. Stone risk factors and stone composition were analyzed according to green tea status and sex. In 24-h urine collection, the comparison between green tea drinkers and non-drinkers showed no difference for stone risk factors such as urine oxalate, calcium, urate, citrate, and pH. In females, the prevalence of calcium oxalate dihydrate (COD) and calcium phosphate stones, assessed by infrared analysis (IRS) was similar between green tea drinkers and non-drinkers, whereas prevalence of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) stones was strikingly decreased in green tea drinkers (0% vs. 42%, p = 0.04), with data in accordance with a decreased oxalate supersaturation index. In males, stone composition and supersaturation indexes were similar between the two groups.

Substantial evidence indicates that fibrinogen (Fbg) and fibrin clot formation play an important role in this circulatory dysfunction in AD. Fbg interacts with β-amyloid (1-42) (Aβ), forming plasmin-resistant abnormal blood clots, and increased fibrin deposition has been discovered in the brains of AD patients and mouse models. In this study, biochemical approaches and the epitope mapping immunoassay were employed to characterize binding epitopes within the Fbg and complementary epitopes in Aβ. We discovered the Aβ5⁻25 peptide as the most critical region for the interaction, which can be inhibited by specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against the central region of Aβ. Aβ binding to Fbg may block plasmin-mediated fibrin cleavage at this site, resulting in the generation of increased levels of plasmin-resistant fibrin degradation fragments.

The self-cleaning ability of the obtained materials was tested during two dyes decomposition: Methylene Blue (MB) and Reactive Orange (RO). It was found that presence of glass fiber increased photocatalytic activity of modified gypsum plasters, which may be due to the fact glass fiber may act as ducts for light and transport it to sites screened by TiO₂ or glass fiber can retard charge recombination. Moreover, unexpectedly the addition of glass fiber did not increase the mechanical properties of modified gypsum plasters, which may be because gypsum does not strongly adhere to the surface of glass fibers.",[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 Salivary Gland Uptake Characterized by Quantitative In Vitro Autoradiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678341,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 26,"Irradiation of salivary glands remains the main dose-limiting side effect of therapeutic PSMA-inhibitors, especially when using alpha emitters. Thus, further advances in radiopharmaceutical design and therapy strategies are needed to reduce salivary gland uptake, thereby allowing the administration of higher doses and potentially resulting in improved response rates and better tumor control. As the uptake mechanism remains unknown, this work investigates the salivary gland uptake of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 by autoradiography studies on pig salivary gland tissue and on PSMA-overexpressing LNCaP cell membrane pellets. Displacement studies were performed with non-labeled PSMA-617 and 2-PMPA, respectively. The uptake of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in glandular areas was determined to be partly PSMA-specific, with a high non-specific uptake fraction. The study emphasizes that [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 accumulation in pig salivary glands can be attributed to a combination of both specific and non-specific uptake mechanisms. The observation is of high impact for future design of novel radiopharmaceuticals addressing the dose-limiting salivary gland irradiation of current alpha endoradiotherapy in prostate cancer."

The site-specific incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins is a powerful protein engineering method. In this study, we optimized the protocol for cell extract preparation from the Escherichia coli strain RFzero-iy, which is engineered to lack release factor 1 (RF-1). The BL21(DE3)-based RFzero-iy strain exhibited quite high cell-free protein productivity, and thus we established the protocols for its cell culture and extract preparation. In the presence of 3-iodo-l-tyrosine (IY), cell-free protein synthesis using the RFzero-iy-based S30 extract translated the UAG codon to IY at various sites with a high translation efficiency of >90%. In the absence of IY, the RFzero-iy-based cell-free system did not translate UAG to any amino acid, leaving UAG unassigned. Actually, UAG was readily reassigned to various non-natural amino acids, by supplementing them with their specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase variants (and their specific tRNAs) into the system. The high incorporation rate of our RFzero-iy-based cell-free system enables the incorporation of a variety of non-natural amino acids into multiple sites of proteins. The present strategy to create the RFzero strain is rapid, and thus promising for RF-1 deletions of various E. coli strains genomically engineered for specific requirements.","Kaempferol Attenuates LPS-Induced Striatum Injury in Mice Involving Anti-Neuroinflammation, Maintaining BBB Integrity, and Down-Regulating the HMGB1/TLR4 Pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678325,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 08,"Neuroinflammation has been demonstrated to be linked with Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, and cerebral ischemia. Our previous investigation had identified that kaempferol (KAE) exerted protective effects on cortex neuron injured by LPS. In this study, the effects and possible mechanism of KAE on striatal dopaminergic neurons induced by LPS in mice were further investigated. The results showed that KAE improved striatal neuron injury, and increased the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) in the striatum of mice. In addition, KAE inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), reduced the level of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the striatum tissues. Furthermore, KAE protected blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and suppressed the activation of the HMGB1/TLR4 inflammatory pathway induced by LPS in striatum tissues of mice. In conclusion, these results suggest that KAE may have neuroprotective effects against striatum injury that is induced by LPS and the possible mechanisms are involved in anti-neuroinflammation, maintaining BBB integrity, and down-regulating the HMGB1/TLR4 pathway.","Invasive Candidiasis in Infants and Children: Recent Advances in Epidemiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678324,"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 18,"This paper reviews recent advances in three selected areas of pediatric invasive candidiasis: epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Although the epidemiological trends of pediatric invasive candidiasis illustrate a declining incidence, this infection still carries a heavy burden of mortality and morbidity that warrants a high index of clinical suspicion, the need for rapid diagnostic systems, and the early initiation of antifungal therapy. The development of non-culture-based technologies, such as the T2Candida system and (1→3)-β-d-glucan detection assay, offers the potential for early laboratory detection of candidemia and CNS candidiasis, respectively. Among the complications of disseminated candidiasis in infants and children, hematogenous disseminated Candida meningoencephalitis (HCME) is an important cause of neurological morbidity. Detection of (1→3)-β-d-glucan in cerebrospinal fluid serves as an early diagnostic indicator and an important biomarker of therapeutic response. The recently reported pharmacokinetic data of liposomal amphotericin B in children demonstrate dose⁻exposure relationships similar to those in adults. The recently completed randomized clinical trial of micafungin versus deoxycholate amphotericin B in the treatment of neonatal candidemia provides further safety data for an echinocandin in this clinical setting.",Drug Release Profiles and Disintegration Properties of Pectin Films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678323,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"We assessed the disintegration profiles of the film dosage forms (FDs) prepared using pectin by measuring the amount of pectin dissolved from the films in a limited amount of aqueous medium.

We used two types of pectin in this study to develop thin films with a thickness of approximately 25⁻35 μm. The FDs gradually disintegrated in the aqueous medium, and the disintegration profile of the FDs differed depending on the types of pectin. In addition, the rate of disintegration of the film matrix affected the dissolution rate of the drug incorporated into the FD. Thus, our results show that FDs prepared using pectin are beneficial because of their high solubility in a limited amount of medium, and the rate of drug release from the FDs can be regulated by selecting a specific type of pectin or by altering the concentration of the film base.",High On-Current Ge-Channel Heterojunction Tunnel Field-Effect Transistor Using Direct Band-to-Band Tunneling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678322,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"The main challenge for tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) is achieving high on-current (Ion) and low subthreshold swing (SS) with reasonable ambipolar characteristics. In order to address these challenges, Ge-channel heterostructure TFET with Si source and drain region is proposed, and its electrical characteristics are compared to other TFET structures. From two-dimensional (2-D) device simulation results, it is confirmed that the Si/Ge heterostructure source junction improves Ion and SS characteristics by using the direct band-to-band tunneling current. Furthermore, the proposed structure shows suppressed ambipolar behavior since the Ge/Si heterostructure is used at the drain junction.",Characteristics of Free Amino Acids (the Quality Chemical Components of Tea) under Spatial Heterogeneity of Different Nitrogen Forms in Tea (Camellia sinensis) Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678321,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"Nitrogen (N) forms are closely related to tea quality, however, little is known about the characteristics of quality chemical components in tea under the spatial heterogeneity of different N forms. In this study, a split-root system, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and root analysis system (WinRHIZO) were used to investigate free amino acids (FAAs) and root length of tea plants under the spatial heterogeneity of different N forms. Uniform. (U.) ammonium (NH₄⁺) (both compartments had NH₄⁺), U. nitrate (NO₃-) (both compartments had NO₃-), Split. (Sp.) NH₄⁺ (one of the compartments had NH₄⁺), and Sp. NO₃- (the other compartment had NO₃-) were performed. The ranking of total FAAs in leaves were as follows: U. NH₄⁺ > Sp. NH₄⁺/Sp. NO₃- > U. NO₃-. The FAA characteristics of Sp. NH₄⁺/Sp. NO₃- were more similar to those of U. NO₃-. The contents of the important FAAs (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and theanine) that determine the quality of tea, increased significantly in U. NH₄⁺. The total root length in U. NH₄⁺ was higher than that in the other treatments. More serious root browning was found in U. NO₃-. In conclusion, NH₄⁺ improved the accumulations of FAAs in tea leaves, which might be attributed to the root development.",Human Polyclonal Antibodies Produced from Transchromosomal Bovine Provides Prophylactic and Therapeutic Protections Against Zika Virus Infection in STAT2 KO Syrian Hamsters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678320,Viruses,2019 05 07,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can cause severe congenital diseases, such as microcephaly, ocular defects and arthrogryposis in fetuses, and Guillain⁻Barré syndrome in adults. Efficacious therapeutic treatments for infected patients, as well as prophylactic treatments to prevent new infections are needed for combating ZIKV infection. Here, we report that ZIKV-specific human polyclonal antibodies (SAB-155), elicited in transchromosomal bovine (TcB), provide significant protection from infection by ZIKV in STAT2 knockout (KO) golden Syrian hamsters both prophylactically and therapeutically. These antibodies also prevent testicular lesions in this hamster model. Our data indicate that antibody-mediated immunotherapy is effective in treating ZIKV infection. Because suitable quantities of highly potent human polyclonal antibodies can be quickly produced from the TcB system against ZIKV and have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a small animal model, they have the potential as an effective countermeasure against ZIKV infection.",Three-Phase Partitioning for the Extraction and Purification of Polysaccharides from the Immunomodulatory Medicinal Mushroom Inonotus obliquus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678319,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"Polysaccharides from the immunomodulatory medicinal mushroom Inonotus obliquus (IOPS) were extracted and purified using three-phase partitioning (TPP), which is an efficient, fast, safe, and green purification technique. An optimal extraction procedure that gave a good 2.2% isolated yield was identified, using the following protocol: a solid-liquid ratio of 1 g to 12 mL; mass fraction of (NH₄)₂SO₄ 20% (w/v); 11 mL t-butanol; pH 8.0; temperature 30 °C; and extraction time 30 min. The purified IOPS was shown to be a proteoglycan of 40 kDa molecular weight comprising of d-galactose, d-glucose, d-xylose, and d-mannose in a molar ratio of 2.0:3.5:1.0:1.5. The purified IOPS displayed strong free-radical scavenging abilities, antioxidant activities, and immunological activity in vitro.

Here, we study coherent thermal conduction in silicon nanowires with added periodic wings at sub-Kelvin temperature. Our simulations show that the added periodic wings flatten the phonon dispersion and thus reduce the thermal conductance. We investigate the dependence of this reduction on the size of the wings and conclude that the reduction is mainly caused by the periodicity of the wings, rather than by local resonances in them. These findings help to better understand the mechanisms controlling coherent heat conduction in periodic resonant nanostructures.",Effect of Energy Restriction on Eating Behavior Traits and Psychobehavioral Factors in the Low Satiety Phenotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678317,Nutrients,2019 04 10,"Studies have shown that individuals with low satiety efficiency may be more susceptible to weight gain, but little is known about the effect of weight loss intervention outcomes in these individuals. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an energy-restricted weight loss intervention on eating behavior traits and psychobehavioral factors in individuals differing in their satiety responsiveness. A pooled cohort of individuals who were overweight or obese (n = 100; aged 39 ± 9 years) participating in a 12- to 15-week weight loss program targeting an energy deficit of 500⁻700 kcal/day were included in this study. Satiety responsiveness was determined by a median split of the mean satiety quotient based on appetite sensations measured in response to a test meal at baseline (low satiety responsiveness (LSR) vs. high satiety responsiveness (HSR)). Anthropometric variables, eating behavior traits, psychobehavioral factors, and ad libitum energy intake were assessed before and after the intervention. Although similar weight loss was observed between the LSR and HSR groups (-3.5 ± 3.2 vs. ⁻3.8 ± 2.8 kg, p = 0.64) in response to an energy-restricted weight loss intervention, changes in eating behavior traits were different between groups. Individuals with LSR had a higher increase in cognitive restraint (+5.5 ± 4.1 vs. +3.5 ± 3.5, p = 0.02) and some of its subscales and a lower decrease in situational susceptibility to disinhibition (-0.6 ± 1.1 vs. -1.2 ± 1.3, p = 0.02) in response to the intervention compared to the HSR group. In conclusion, energy-restricted weight loss intervention seems to trigger undesirable changes in some eating behavior traits in individuals more vulnerable to overeating, which could increase their susceptibility to weight regain."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the key genes and potential molecular mechanism in insulin resistance. Expression profiles of the genes were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted at Enrichr. The protein⁻protein interaction (PPI) network was settled and analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database constructed by Cytoscape software. Modules were extracted and identified by the PEWCC1 plugin. The microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) which control the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the NetworkAnalyst algorithm. A database (GSE73108) was downloaded from the GEO databases. Our results identified 873 DEGs (435 up-regulated and 438 down-regulated) genetically associated with insulin resistance. The pathways which were enriched were pathways in complement and coagulation cascades and complement activation for up-regulated DEGs, while biosynthesis of amino acids and the Notch signaling pathway were among the down-regulated DEGs. Showing GO enrichment were cardiac muscle cell⁻cardiac muscle cell adhesion and microvillus membrane for up-regulated DEGs and negative regulation of osteoblast differentiation and dendrites for down-regulated DEGs. Subsequently, myosin VB (MYO5B), discs, large homolog 2(DLG2), axin 2 (AXIN2), protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), Notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1), androgen receptor (AR), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and Rho family GTPase 3 (RND3) were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated PPI network and modules. In addition, GATA binding protein 6 (GATA6) , ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 5 (ENPP5), cyclin D1 (CCND1) and tubulin, beta 2A (TUBB2A) were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated target gene⁻miRNA network, while tubulin, beta 2A (TUBB2A), olfactomedin-like 1 (OLFML1), prostate adrogen-regulated mucin-like protein 1 (PARM1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 4 family, member A1 (ALDH4A1)were diagnosed as the top hub genes in the up- and down-regulated target gene⁻TF network. The current study based on the GEO database provides a novel understanding regarding the mechanism of insulin resistance and may provide novel therapeutic targets.",Strengthening of Reinforced Concrete Beams with Externally Mounted Sequentially Activated Iron-Based Shape Memory Alloys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678305,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,Iron based shape memory alloys (Fe-SMA) have recently been used as active flexural strengthening material for reinforced concrete (RC) beams. Fe-SMAs are characterized by a shape memory effect (SME) which allows the recovery of previously induced plastic deformations through heating. If these deformations are restrained a recovery stress is generated by the SME. This recovery stress can be used to prestress a SMA applied as a strengthening material. This paper investigates the performance and the load deformation behavior of RC beams strengthened with mechanical end anchored unbonded Fe-SMA strips activated by sequentially infrared heating. The performance of a single loop loaded and a double loop loaded SMA strengthened RC beam are compared to an un-strengthened beam and a reference beam strengthened with commercially available structural steel. In these tests the SMA strengthened beam had the highest cracking load and the highest ultimate load. It is shown that the serviceability behavior of a concrete beam can be improved by a second thermal activation. The sequential heating procedure causes different temperature and stress states during activation along the SMA strip that have not been researched previously. The possible effect of this different temperature and stress states on metal lattice phase transformation is modeled and discussed. Moreover the role of the martensitic transformation during the cooling process on leveling the inhomogeneity of phase state in the overheated section is pointed out.,Prospects for the Use of Cannabinoids in Oncology and Palliative Care Practice: A Review of the Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678303,Cancers,2019 03 29,"There is an increased interest in the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of symptoms in cancer and palliative care patients. Their multimodal action, in spite of limited efficacy, may make them an attractive alternative, particularly in patients with multiple concomitant symptoms of mild and moderate intensity. There is evidence to indicate cannabis in the treatment of pain, spasticity, seizures, sleep disorders, nausea and vomiting, and Tourette syndrome. Although the effectiveness of cannabinoids is limited, it was confirmed in neuropathic pain management and combination with opioids. A relatively favorable adverse effects profile, including no depressive effect on the respiratory system, may make cannabis complement a rather narrow armamentarium that is in the disposition of a palliative care professional.",Magnetoelastic Effect Detection with the Usage of Eddy Current Tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678302,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"The possibility of application of the eddy current tomography setup to measure the small permeability variations caused by magnetoelastic effect was presented.

Developed forward tomography transformation was applied for single variable inverse tomography transformation, utilized for determining magnetic permeability. This confirmed the possibility of the application of eddy current tomography for quantitative measurements of magnetoelastic effect in samples of known geometry.","Comment on Khanal et al.

To meet this aim, we placed a set of textile pressure sensors both on the backrest and on the seat of the chair. The position of the sensors was selected for maximizing the detection of variations of user's posture. The effectiveness of the designed system was evaluated through an experiment where increasing stress levels were obtained by administering a Stroop test. The collected results had been analyzed by considering three different time intervals based on the difficulty level of the test (low, medium, and high). A transition analysis conducted on postures assumed during the test showed that participants reached a different posture at the end of the test, when the cognitive engagement increased, with respect to the beginning. This evidence highlighted the presence of movement presumably due to the increased cognitive engagement. Overall, the performed analysis showed the proposed monitoring system could be used to identify body posture variations related to different levels of engagement of a seated user while performing cognitive tasks.",Macrophages from Susceptible and Resistant Chicken Lines have Different Transcriptomes following Marek's Disease Virus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678299,Genes,2019 03 29,"Despite successful control by vaccination, Marek's disease (MD) has continued evolving to greater virulence over recent years. To control MD, selection and breeding of MD-resistant chickens might be a suitable option. MHC-congenic inbred chicken lines, 6₁ and 7₂, are highly resistant and susceptible to MD, respectively, but the cellular and genetic basis for these phenotypes is unknown. Marek's disease virus (MDV) infects macrophages, B-cells, and activated T-cells in vivo. This study investigates the cellular basis of resistance to MD in vitro with the hypothesis that resistance is determined by cells active during the innate immune response. Chicken bone marrow-derived macrophages from lines 6₁ and 7₂ were infected with MDV in vitro. Flow cytometry showed that a higher percentage of macrophages were infected in line 72 than in line 6₁. A transcriptomic study followed by in silico functional analysis of differentially expressed genes was then carried out between the two lines pre- and post-infection. Analysis supports the hypothesis that macrophages from susceptible and resistant chicken lines display a marked difference in their transcriptome following MDV infection. Resistance to infection, differential activation of biological pathways, and suppression of oncogenic potential are among host defense strategies identified in macrophages from resistant chickens.",Identification and Characterization of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Genes in Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678298,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) genes encode proteins that regulate biotic and abiotic stresses in plants through signaling cascades comprised of three major subfamilies: MAP Kinase (MPK), MAPK Kinase (MKK), and MAPKK Kinase (MKKK). The main objectives of this research were to conduct genome-wide identification of MAPK genes in Helianthus annuus and examine functional divergence of these genes in relation to those in nine other plant species (Amborella trichopoda, Aquilegia coerulea, Arabidopsis thaliana, Daucus carota, Glycine max, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum, Sphagnum fallax, and Vitis vinifera), representing diverse taxonomic groups of the Plant Kingdom. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of the MAPK genes utilized reference sequences from A. thaliana and G. max, yielding a total of 96 MPKs and 37 MKKs in the genomes of A. trichopoda, A. coerulea, C. reinhardtii, D. carota, H. annuus, S. lycopersicum, and S. fallax. Among them, 28 MPKs and eight MKKs were confirmed in H. annuus. Phylogenetic analyses revealed four clades within each subfamily. Transcriptomic analyses showed that at least 19 HaMPK and seven HaMKK genes were induced in response to salicylic acid (SA), sodium chloride (NaCl), and polyethylene glycol (Peg) in leaves and roots. Of the seven published sunflower microRNAs, five microRNA families are involved in targeting eight MPKs. Additionally, we discussed the need for using MAP Kinase nomenclature guidelines across plant species. Our identification and characterization of MAP Kinase genes would have implications in sunflower crop improvement, and in advancing our knowledge of the diversity and evolution of MAPK genes in the Plant Kingdom.",Medium Chain Carboxylic Acids from Complex Organic Feedstocks by Mixed Culture Fermentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678297,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"Environmental pressures caused by population growth and consumerism require the development of resource recovery from waste, hence a circular economy approach. The production of chemicals and fuels from organic waste using mixed microbial cultures (MMC) has become promising. MMC use the synergy of bio-catalytic activities from different microorganisms to transform complex organic feedstock, such as by-products from food production and food waste. In the absence of oxygen, the feedstock can be converted into biogas through the established anaerobic digestion (AD) approach. The potential of MMC has shifted to production of intermediate AD compounds as precursors for renewable chemicals. A particular set of anaerobic pathways in MMC fermentation, known as chain elongation, can occur under specific conditions producing medium chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs) with higher value than biogas and broader applicability. This review introduces the chain elongation pathway and other bio-reactions occurring during MMC fermentation. We present an overview of the complex feedstocks used, and pinpoint the main operational parameters for MCCAs production such as temperature, pH, loading rates, inoculum, head space composition, and reactor design. The review evaluates the key findings of MCCA production using MMC, and concludes by identifying critical research targets to drive forward this promising technology as a valorisation method for complex organic waste.",Cationic Niosomes as Non-Viral Vehicles for Nucleic Acids: Challenges and Opportunities in Gene Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678296,Pharmaceutics,2019 04 01,"Cationic niosomes have become important non-viral vehicles for transporting a good number of small drug molecules and macromolecules.

Recently, it was reported that testicular biopsies from nonobstructive azoospermic (NOA) patients contained germ cells, and that sperm could be found in the tubules of 20% of SCOS patients using testicular sperm extraction technology. Since the patients without sperm in their testicular biopsies do not have therapy to help them to father a biological child, in vitro maturation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) isolated from their testis is a new approach for possible future infertility treatment. Recently, the induction of human and mice SSCs proliferation and differentiation was demonstrated using different culture systems. Our group reported the induction of spermatogonial cell proliferation and differentiation to meiotic and postmeiotic stages in mice, rhesus monkeys, and prepubertal boys with cancer using 3D agar and methylcellulose (MCS) culture systems. The aim of the study was to identify the type of spermatogenic cells present in biopsies without sperm from SCOS patients, and to examine the possibility of inducing spermatogenesis from isolated spermatogonial cells of these biopsies in vitro using 3D MCS. We used nine biopsies without sperm from SCOS patients, and the presence of spermatogenic markers was evaluated by PCR and specific immunofluorescence staining analyses. Isolated testicular cells were cultured in MCS in the presence of StemPro enriched media with different growth factors and the development of colonies/clusters was examined microscopically. We examined the presence of cells from the different stages of spermatogenesis before and after culture in MCS for 3⁻7 weeks. Our results indicated that these biopsies showed the presence of premeiotic markers (two to seven markers/biopsy), meiotic markers (of nine biopsies, cAMP responsive element modulator-1 (CREM-1) was detected in five, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in five, and BOULE in three) and postmeiotic markers (protamine was detected in six biopsies and acrosin in three). In addition, we were able to induce the development of meiotic and/or postmeiotic stages from spermatogonial cells isolated from three biopsies. Thus, our study shows for the first time the presence of meiotic and/or postmeiotic cells in biopsies without the sperm of SCOS patients. Isolated cells from some of these biopsies could be induced to meiotic and/or postmeiotic stages under in vitro culture conditions.",Preparation of Immobilized Lipase Based on Hollow Mesoporous Silica Spheres and Its Application in Ester Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678284,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"In this study, Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) was immobilized into modified hollow mesoporous silica (HMSS) materials with different hydrophobicity. Among propyl-(C₃), phenyl-(C₆), octyl-(C₈), and octadecyl-(C18) modified HMSS as well as native HMSS, taking advantage of more hydrophobic microenvironment, the HMSS-C18-CRL showed exceptional performance in enzymatic esterification reaction. Using the novel HMSS-C18 with immobilized CRL (HMSS-C18-CRL), we investigated the esterification of phytosterols with polyunsaturated fat acid (PUFA) in a solvent-free system for the production of phytosterols esters. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to model and optimize the reaction conditions, namely, the enzyme load (5⁻25%), reaction time (10⁻110 min), molar ratio of α-linolenic acid (ALA)/phytosterols (1:1⁻7:1) and represented by the letters E, T, and M respectively. Best-fitting models were successfully established by multiple regressions with backward elimination. The optimum production was achieved at 70 min for reaction time, 20% based on the weight of substrate for enzyme loading, and 5.6:1 for ALA/phytosterols molar ratio. Under optimized conditions, a conversion of about 90 ± 2% was achieved. These results indicated that HMSS-C18-CRL demonstrates to be a promising catalyst and can be potentially applied in the functional lipid production.","Review of DSP Toxicity in Ireland: Long-Term Trend Impacts, Biodiversity and Toxin Profiles from a Monitoring Perspective.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678283,Toxins,2019 04 02,"The purpose of this work is to review all the historical monitoring data gathered by the Marine Institute, the national reference laboratory for marine biotoxins in Ireland, including all the biological and chemical data from 2005 to 2017, in relation to diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxicity in shellfish production. The data reviewed comprises over 25,595 water samples, which were preserved in Lugol's iodine and analysed for the abundance and composition of marine microalgae by light microscopy, and 18,166 records of shellfish flesh samples, which were analysed using LC-MS/MS for the presence and concentration of the compounds okadaic acid (OA), dinophysistoxins-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxins-2 (DTX-2) and their hydrolysed esters, as well as pectenotoxins (PTXs). The results of this review suggest that DSP toxicity events around the coast of Ireland occur annually. According to the data reviewed, there has not been an increase in the periodicity or intensity of such events during the study period. Although the diversity of the Dinophysis species on the coast of Ireland is large, with 10 species recorded, the two main species associated with DSP events in Ireland are D. acuta and D. acuminata. Moreover, the main toxic compounds associated with these species are OA and DTX-2, but concentrations of the hydrolysed esters are generally found in higher amounts than the parent compounds in the shellfish samples. When D. acuta is dominant in the water samples, the DSP toxicity increases in intensity, and DTX-2 becomes the prevalent toxin. Pectenotoxins have only been analysed and reported since 2012, and these compounds had not been associated with toxic events in Ireland; however, in 2014, concentrations of these compounds were quantitated for the first time, and the data suggest that this toxic event was associated with an unusually high number of observations of D. tripos that year. The areas of the country most affected by DSP outbreaks are those engaging in long-line mussel (Mytilus edulis) aquaculture.",Formulation and Characterization of Quercetin-loaded Oil in Water Nanoemulsion and Evaluation of Hypocholesterolemic Activity in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678282,Nutrients,2019 04 09,"Due to poor water solubility and high susceptibility to chemical degradation, the applications of quercetin have been limited. This study investigated the effects of pH on the formation of quercetin-loaded nanoemulsion (NQ) and compared the hypocholesterolemic activity between quercetin and NQ to utilize the quercetin as functional food ingredient. NQ particle size exhibited a range of 207⁻289 nm with polydispersity index range (<0.47). The encapsulation efficiency increased stepwise from 56 to 92% as the pH increased from 4.0 to 9.0. Good stability of NQ was achieved in the pH range of 6.5⁻9.0 during 3-month storage at 21 and 37 °C. NQ displayed higher efficacy in reducing serum and hepatic cholesterol levels and increasing the release of bile acid into feces in rats fed high-cholesterol diet, compared to quercetin alone. NQ upregulated hepatic gene expression involved in bile acid synthesis and cholesterol efflux, such as cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), liver X receptor alpha (LXRα), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 1 (ABCG1). These results suggest at least partial involvement of hepatic bile acid synthesis and fecal cholesterol excretion in nanoemulsion quercetin-mediated beneficial effect on lipid abnormalities.",Cytomorphology of Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features and the Impact of New Nomenclature on Molecular Testing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678281,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"The re-naming of noninvasive follicular variant papillary thyroid cancer to the apparently non-malignant, noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) impacts the prevalence of malignancy rates, thereby affecting mutation frequency in papillary thyroid cancer. Preoperative assessment of such nodules could affect management in the future. The original publications following the designation of the new nomenclature have been extensively reviewed. With the adoption of NIFTP terminology, a reduction in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer (FVPTC) prevalence is anticipated, as is a modest reduction of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) prevalence that would be distributed mainly across indeterminate thyroid nodules. Identifying NIFTP preoperatively remains challenging. RAS mutations are predominant but the presence of BRAF V600E mutation has been observed and could indicate inclusion of the classical PTC. The histological diagnosis of NIFTP to designate low-risk encapsulated follicular variant papillary thyroid cancers (EFVPTCs) would impact malignancy rates, thereby altering the mutation prevalence. The histopathologic criteria have recently been refined with an exclusion of well-formed papillae. The preoperative identification of NIFTP using cytomorphology and gene testing remains challenging.",A Low-Cost Indoor Activity Monitoring System for Detecting Frailty in Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678280,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"Indoor localization systems have already wide applications mainly for providing localized information and directions. The majority of them focus on commercial applications providing information such us advertisements, guidance and asset tracking. Medical oriented localization systems are uncommon. Given the fact that an individual's indoor movements can be indicative of his/her clinical status, in this paper we present a low-cost indoor localization system with room-level accuracy used to assess the frailty of older people. We focused on designing a system with easy installation and low cost to be used by non technical staff. The system was installed in older people houses in order to collect data about their indoor localization habits. The collected data were examined in combination with their frailty status, showing a correlation between them. The indoor localization system is based on the processing of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements by a tracking device, from Bluetooth Beacons, using a fingerprint-based procedure. The system has been tested in realistic settings achieving accuracy above 93% in room estimation. The proposed system was used in 271 houses collecting data for 1⁻7-day sessions. The evaluation of the collected data using ten-fold cross-validation showed an accuracy of 83% in the classification of a monitored person regarding his/her frailty status (Frail, Pre-frail, Non-frail).",Biotransformed Metabolites of the Hop Prenylflavanone Isoxanthohumol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678278,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"A metabolic conversion study on microbes is known as one of the most useful tools to predict the xenobiotic metabolism of organic compounds in mammalian systems. The microbial biotransformation of isoxanthohumol (1), a major hop prenylflavanone in beer, has resulted in the production of three diastereomeric pairs of oxygenated metabolites (2⁻7). The microbial metabolites of 1 were formed by epoxidation or hydroxylation of the prenyl group, and HPLC, NMR, and CD analyses revealed that all of the products were diastereomeric pairs composed of (2S)- and (2R)- isomers. The structures of these metabolic compounds were elucidated to be (2S,2""S)- and (2R,2""S)-4'-hydroxy-5-methoxy-7,8-(2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-4H-pyrano)-flavanones (2 and 3), (2S)- and (2R)-7,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-8-(2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-flavanones (4 and 5) which were new oxygenated derivatives, along with (2R)- and (2S)-4'-hydroxy-5-methoxy-2""-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)dihydrofuro[2,3-h]flavanones (6 and 7) on the basis of spectroscopic data. These results could contribute to understanding the metabolic fates of the major beer prenylflavanone isoxanthohumol that occur in mammalian system.",Characterization of the Specific Mode of Action of a Chitin Deacetylase and Separation of the Partially Acetylated Chitosan Oligosaccharides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678277,Marine drugs,2019 06 03,"Partially acetylated chitosan oligosaccharides (COS), which consists of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucosamine (GlcN) residues, is a structurally complex biopolymer with a variety of biological activities. Therefore, it is challenging to elucidate acetylation patterns and the molecular structure-function relationship of COS. Herein, the detailed deacetylation pattern of chitin deacetylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ScCDA₂, was studied. Which solves the randomization of acetylation patterns during COS produced by chemical. ScCDA₂ also exhibits about 8% and 20% deacetylation activity on crystalline chitin and colloid chitin, respectively. Besides, a method for separating and detecting partially acetylated chitosan oligosaccharides by high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) system has been developed, which is fast and convenient, and can be monitored online. Mass spectrometry sequencing revealed that ScCDA₂ produced COS with specific acetylation patterns of DAAA, ADAA, AADA, DDAA, DADA, ADDA and DDDA, respectively. ScCDA₂ does not deacetylate the GlcNAc unit that is closest to the reducing end of the oligomer furthermore ScCDA₂ has a multiple-attack deacetylation mechanism on chitin oligosaccharides. This specific mode of action significantly enriches the existing limited library of chitin deacetylase deacetylation patterns. This fully defined COS may be used in the study of COS structure and function.",A Virtual Reality Soldier Simulator with Body Area Networks for Team Training.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678276,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"Soldier-based simulators have been attracting increased attention recently, with the aim of making complex military tactics more effective, such that soldiers are able to respond rapidly and logically to battlespace situations and the commander's decisions in the battlefield. Moreover, body area networks (BANs) can be applied to collect the training data in order to provide greater access to soldiers' physical actions or postures as they occur in real routine training. Therefore, due to the limited physical space of training facilities, an efficient soldier-based training strategy is proposed that integrates a virtual reality (VR) simulation system with a BAN, which can capture body movements such as walking, running, shooting, and crouching in a virtual environment. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed VR simulation system is able to provide complete and substantial information throughout the training process, including detection, estimation, and monitoring capabilities.",Metformin Increases Proliferative Activity and Viability of Multipotent Stromal Stem Cells Isolated from Adipose Tissue Derived from Horses with Equine Metabolic Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678275,Cells,2019 03 29,"In this study, we investigated the influence of metformin (MF) on proliferation and viability of adipose-derived stromal cells isolated from horses (EqASCs). We determined the effect of metformin on cell metabolism in terms of mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative status. Our purpose was to evaluate the metformin effect on cells derived from healthy horses (EqASCHE) and individuals affected by equine metabolic syndrome (EqASCEMS). The cells were treated with 0.5 μM MF for 72 h. The proliferative activity was evaluated based on the measurement of BrdU incorporation during DNA synthesis, as well as population doubling time rate (PDT) and distribution of EqASCs in the cell cycle. The influence of metformin on EqASC viability was determined in relation to apoptosis profile, mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative stress markers and BAX/BCL-2 mRNA ratio. Further, we were interested in possibility of metformin affecting the Wnt3a signalling pathway and, thus, we determined mRNA and protein level of WNT3A and β-catenin. Finally, using a two-tailed RT-qPCR method, we investigated the expression of miR-16-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-140-3p and miR-145-5p. Obtained results indicate pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of metformin on EqASCs. In this study, MF significantly improved proliferation of EqASCs, which manifested in increased synthesis of DNA and lowered PDT value. Additionally, metformin improved metabolism and viability of cells, which correlated with higher mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced apoptosis and increased WNT3A/β-catenin expression. Metformin modulates the miRNA expression differently in EqASCHE and EqASCEMS. Metformin may be used as a preconditioning agent which stimulates proliferative activity and viability of EqASCs."

However, few indexing and annotation mechanisms are available, due to difficulties inherent in raw multivariate data types and the relative sparsity of sensor data. These issues have slowed the development of higher level human-centric searching and querying mechanisms. Here, we propose a pipeline of three algorithms. First, we introduce a spatio-temporal event detection algorithm. Then, we introduce a clustering algorithm based on mobile contextual data. Our spatio-temporal clustering approach can be used as an annotation on raw sensor data. It improves information retrieval by reducing the search space and is based on searching only the related clusters. To further improve behavior quantification, the third algorithm identifies contrasting events withina cluster content. Two large real-world smartphone datasets have been used to evaluate our algorithms and demonstrate the utility and resource efficiency of our approach to search.",Substances of Interest That Support Glaucoma Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678262,Nutrients,2019 04 09,"Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease in which pro-apoptotic signals are directed to retinal ganglion cells. During this disease the conventional outflow pathway becomes malfunctioning. Aqueous humour builds up in the anterior chamber, leading to increased intraocular pressure. Both of these events are related to functional impairment. The knowledge of molecular mechanisms allows us to better understand the usefulness of substances that can support anti-glaucoma therapy. The goal of glaucoma therapy is not simply to lower intraocular pressure; it should also be to facilitate the survival of retinal ganglion cells, as these constitute the real target tissue in this disease, in which the visual pathway is progressively compromised. Indeed, an endothelial dysfunction syndrome affecting the endothelial cells of the trabecular meshwork occurs in both normal-tension glaucoma and high-tension glaucoma. Some substances, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, can counteract the damage due to the molecular mechanisms - whether ischemic, oxidative, inflammatory or other - that underlie the pathogenesis of glaucoma. In this review, we consider some molecules, such as polyphenols, that can contribute, not only theoretically, to neuroprotection but which are also able to counteract the metabolic pathways that lead to glaucomatous damage. Ginkgo biloba extract, for instance, improves the blood supply to peripheral districts, including the optic nerve and retina and exerts a neuro-protective action by inhibiting apoptosis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can protect the endothelium and polyphenols exert an anti-inflammatory action through the down-regulation of cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. All these substances can aid anti-glaucoma therapy by providing metabolic support for the cells involved in glaucomatous injury. Indeed, it is known that the food we eat is able to change our gene expression.","Direct Electrochemical Detection of Glutamate, Acetylcholine, Choline, and Adenosine Using Non-Enzymatic Electrodes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678261,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"Non-electroactive neurotransmitters such as glutamate, acetylcholine, choline, and adenosine play a critical role in proper activity of living organisms, particularly in the nervous system. While enzyme-based sensing of this type of neurotransmitter has been a research interest for years, non-enzymatic approaches are gaining more attention because of their stability and low cost. Accordingly, this focused review aims to give a summary of the state of the art of non-enzymatic electrochemical sensors used for detection of neurotransmitter that lack an electrochemically active component. In place of using enzymes, transition metal materials such as those based on nickel show an acceptable level of catalytic activity for neurotransmitter sensing. They benefit from fast electron transport properties and high surface energy and their catalytic activity can be much improved if their surface is modified with nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and platinum nanoparticles. However, a general comparison reveals that the performance of non-enzymatic biosensors is still lower than those that use enzyme-based methods. Nevertheless, their excellent stability demonstrates that non-enzymatic neurotransmitter sensors warrant additional research in order to advance them toward becoming an acceptable replacement for the more expensive enzyme-based sensors.",Influence of Steel Plates and Studs on Shrinkage Behavior and Cracking Potential of High-Performance Concrete.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678260,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"To help designers develop solutions to overcome the cracking problem in steel-plate-reinforced concrete composite shear walls due to the concrete shrinkage, the influence of steel plates and studs on the shrinkage behavior of high-performance concrete (HPC), including restrained shrinkage strain, shrinkage strain gradient, and cracking potential, were theoretically and experimentally investigated in this study. A model for theoretical analysis was used to research the shrinkage performance of concrete that was restrained by steel plates and studs. The major parameters involved in the experiments include the thickness and material elastic modulus of the steel plate, in addition to the diameter, height, and number of studs. It was found that the shrinkage of HPC decreases and its potential cracking increases with the increase of thickness and elastic modulus of the steel plate, and the diameter, height, and number of studs. The restraining effect of the steel plate and stud on the HPC shrinkage decreases with the distance of their respective locations. It demonstrates that the HPC near a steel plate and stud is prone to crack compared with that far away from the steel plate and stud. This potential could be reduced by uniformly restraining the HPC.","Driving Anger, Aberrant Driving Behaviors, and Road Crash Risk: Testing of a Mediated Model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678259,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 17,"With the dramatic increase in motorization, road traffic crashes have become the leading cause of death in China. To reduce the losses associated with road safety problems, it is important to understand the risk factors contributing to the high crash rate among Chinese drivers. This study investigated how driving anger and aberrant driving behaviors are related to crash risk by proposing and testing one mediated model. In this model, the effects of driving anger on road crash risk were mediated by aberrant driving behaviors. However, unlike previous studies, instead of using the overall scale scores, the subscales of driving anger and aberrant driving behaviors were used to establish the mediated model in this study. To test the validity of this model, an Internet-based questionnaire, which included various measures of driving anger, aberrant driving, and road crash history, was completed by a sample of 1974 Chinese drivers. The results showed that the model fitted the data very well and aberrant driving behaviors fully mediated the effects of driving anger on road crash risk. Findings from the present study are useful for the development of countermeasures to reduce road traffic crashes in China.",Experimental and Numerical Study on Shear Resistance of Notched Perfobond Shear Connector.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678258,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"In steel and concrete composite bridges, it is difficult to perforate the reinforcing bars through the circular holes of conventional perfobond shear connectors with multi-ribs. To ease the installation of perforating rebars, an alternative notched perfobond shear connector was proposed by cutting out the edge of the circular hole. This paper presents the push-out test results of six specimens which were fabricated and loaded to failure. The main purpose was to compare the failure mode, shear capacity and slip behavior of perfobond shear connectors using circular holes and notched holes. Furthermore, 43 nonlinear finite element simulations were performed to further study the effects of several variables, including the hole diameter, the hole distance, the hole number, the cut width, the perfobond thickness, the concrete strength, the rebar diameter, the rebar strength, and the steel strength. The parametric results were generated to evaluate the shear capacity equations for perfobond shear connectors. Finally, an analytical model was developed to estimate the shear capacity of notched perfobond shear connectors.",Mechanisms of Primary and Secondary Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678257,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPis) have revolutionized cancer therapy with broad activities against a wide range of malignancies.

Furthermore, a high percentage of patients develop progression due to the secondary resistance even after obtaining a response or achieving a stable disease. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms that underlie the primary and secondary resistance to ICPis in cancer immunotherapy and provide an overview to impart a broad understanding of the critical issues that are encountered in clinical oncology practice.",Impact of Donor Milk on Short- and Long-Term Growth of Very Low Birth Weight Infants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678256,Nutrients,2019 04 09,"Mother's own milk (MOM) reduces the risk of morbidities in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. When MOM is unavailable, donor breastmilk (DM) is used, with unclear impact on short- and long-term growth. This retrospective analysis compared anthropometric data at six time points from birth to 20⁻24 months corrected age in VLBW infants who received MOM supplements of preterm formula (n = 160) versus fortified DM (n = 161) during neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization. The cohort was 46% female; mean birth weight and gestational age (GA) were 998 g and 27.3 weeks. Multilevel linear growth models assessed changes in growth z-scores short-term (to NICU discharge) and long-term (post-discharge), controlling for amount of DM or formula received in first 28 days of life, NICU length of stay (LOS), birth GA, and sex. Z-scores for weight and length decreased during hospitalization but increased for all parameters including head circumference post-discharge. Short-term growth was positively associated with LOS and birth GA. A higher preterm formula proportion, but not DM proportion, was associated with slower rates of decline in short-term growth trajectories, but feeding type was unrelated to long-term growth. In conclusion, controlling for total human milk fed, DM did not affect short- or long-term growth.",Volatile Compounds of Selected Raw and Cooked Brassica Vegetables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678255,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"Brassica vegetables are a significant component of the human diet and their popularity is systematically increasing. The interest in plants from this group is growing because of numerous reports focused on their pro-health properties. However, some consumers are not enthusiastic about these vegetables because of their specific bitter taste and sharp, sulfurous aroma. In this study, the volatile composition of 15 Brassica cultivars (five Brussels sprouts, four kohlrabi, three cauliflower and three broccoli), both raw and cooked, was analyzed by solid phase microextraction and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry (SPME-GC×GC-ToFMS). Differences were found between the analyzed vegetables, as well as different cultivars of the same vegetable. Moreover, the influence of cooking on the composition of volatile compounds was evaluated. All the vegetables were frozen before analyses, which is why the impact of this process on the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was included. The most abundant groups of compounds were sulfur components (including bioactive isothiocyanates), nitriles, aldehydes and alcohols. Cooking in general caused a decrease in the abundance of main volatiles. However, the amount of bioactive isothiocyanates increased in most cultivars after cooking. The effect of freezing on the volatile fraction was presented based on the Brussels sprout cultivars. Most of the changes were closely related to the activity of the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway enzymes. These are characterized by a marked reduction in alcohol contents and an increment in aldehyde contents. Moreover, important changes were noted in the concentrations of bioactive components, e.g., isothiocyanates. This research included a large set of samples consisting of many cultivars of each analyzed vegetable, which is why it provides a considerable body of general information concerning volatiles in Brassica vegetables.","Maternal protein restriction differentially alters the expression of AQP1, AQP9 and VEGFr-2 in the epididymis of rat offspring.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678254,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Maternal protein restriction causes sperm alterations in the offspring, most of which are associated with epididymal functions.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not well known. To unravel the molecular mechanisms that could explain the differential effect of zearalenone and apigenin on ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation, gene-reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments, proliferation assays and transcriptomic analysis were performed. We found that zearalenone and apigenin transactivated ERs and promoted the expression of estradiol (E2)-responsive genes. However, zearalenone clearly enhanced cellular proliferation, while apigenin appeared to be antiestrogenic in the presence of E2 in both ER-positive breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D. The transcriptomic analysis showed that both compounds regulate gene expression in the same way, but with differences in intensity. Two major sets of genes were identified; one set was linked to the cell cycle and the other set was linked to stress response and growth arrest. Our results show that the transcription dynamics in gene regulation induced by apigenin were somehow different with zearalenone and E2 and may explain the differential effect of these compounds on the phenotype of the breast cancer cell. Together, our results confirmed the potential health benefit effect of apigenin, while zearalenone appeared to be a true endocrine-disrupting compound.","Gestational Geophagia Affects Nephrocardiac Integrity, ATP-Driven Proton Pumps, the Renin⁻Angiotensin⁻Aldosterone System, and F2-Isoprostane Status.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678242,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Pregnancy brings about strong cravings for nonfood materials, the gestational toxicities of which are not yet ascertained. In this study, we used rat models to investigate the effect of clay beverage consumption during early and late gestation on p-Type ATPases, nephrocardiac integrity, the antioxidant system, and on the activities of the renin⁻angiotensin⁻aldosterone system (RAAS). The rats at early (7th day) and late gestation (20th) were administered single doses (500 mg/kg body weight of clay beverage and examined using ELISA and spectrophotometry. The gestational clay beverage intake significantly elevated the renal hemodynamics, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), anion gap, urinary output, and blood urea nitrogen⁻creatinine ratio (BUN/Crt). At early and late gestation, clay beverage consumption elevated the heartbeat, atherogenic index of plasma, cardiac risk ratio, and atherogenic coefficients. Creatinine kinase and troponin levels after clay beverage consumption significantly increased with gestation age, while lactate dehydrogenase elevation was independent of gestation age. Mg2+-ATPase and Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase significantly decreased during gestation and were further altered with clay beverage intake. The rats showed higher RAAS activities during early and late gestation stages but greatly decreased activities after clay beverage administration. When F2-isoprostane and malondialdehyde levels were measured, slight elevations were found during pregnancy and were greatly elevated with clay beverage intake, while the glutathione reductase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase levels were decreased. We thus discourage clay beverage consumption throughout the entire pregnancy period because of these profound homeostatic imbalances and organ toxicities associated with its consumption.",Nitrogen Supply Drives Senescence-Related Seed Storage Protein Expression in Rapeseed Leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678241,Genes,2019 03 29,"In general, yield and fruit quality strongly rely on efficient nutrient remobilization during plant development and senescence. Transcriptome changes associated with senescence in spring oilseed rape grown under optimal nitrogen supply or mild nitrogen deficiency revealed differences in senescence and nutrient mobilization in old lower canopy leaves and younger higher canopy leaves [1]. Having a closer look at this transcriptome analyses, we identified the major classes of seed storage proteins (SSP) to be expressed in vegetative tissue, namely leaf and stem tissue. Expression of SSPs was not only dependent on the nitrogen supply but transcripts appeared to correlate with intracellular H₂O₂ contents, which functions as well-known signaling molecule in developmental senescence. The abundance of SSPs in leaf material transiently progressed from the oldest leaves to the youngest. Moreover, stems also exhibited short-term production of SSPs, which hints at an interim storage function. In order to decipher whether hydrogen peroxide also functions as a signaling molecule in nitrogen deficiency-induced senescence, we analyzed hydrogen peroxide contents after complete nitrogen depletion in oilseed rape and Arabidopsis plants. In both cases, hydrogen peroxide contents were lower in nitrogen deficient plants, indicating that at least parts of the developmental senescence program appear to be suppressed under nitrogen deficiency.",Exosomal Expression of CXCR4 Targets Cardioprotective Vesicles to Myocardial Infarction and Improves Outcome after Systemic Administration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678240,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Cell therapy has been evaluated to enhance heart function after injury. Delivered cells mostly act via paracrine mechanisms, including secreted growth factors, cytokines, and vesicles, such as exosomes (Exo). Intramyocardial injection of cardiac-resident progenitor cells (CPC)-derived Exo reduced scarring and improved cardiac function after myocardial infarction in rats. Here, we explore a clinically relevant approach to enhance the homing process to cardiomyocytes (CM), which is crucial for therapeutic efficacy upon systemic delivery of Exo. By overexpressing exosomal CXCR4, we increased the efficacy of plasmatic injection of cardioprotective Exo-CPC by increasing their bioavailability to ischemic hearts. Intravenous injection of ExoCXCR4 significantly reduced infarct size and improved left ventricle ejection fraction at 4 weeks compared to ExoCTRL (p < 0.01). Hemodynamic measurements showed that ExoCXCR4 improved dp/dt min, as compared to ExoCTRL and PBS group. In vitro, ExoCXCR4 was more bioactive than ExoCTRL in preventing CM death. This in vitro effect was independent from SDF-1α, as shown by using AMD3100 as specific CXCR4 antagonist. We showed, for the first time, that systemic administration of Exo derived from CXCR4-overexpressing CPC improves heart function in a rat model of ischemia reperfusion injury These data represent a substantial step toward clinical application of Exo-based therapeutics in cardiovascular disease.",High Performance Liquid Chromatography Determination and Optimization of the Extraction Process for the Total Alkaloids from Traditional Herb Stephania cepharantha Hayata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678239,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"Stephania cepharantha Hayata is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine used to treat lung cancer, and its alkaloids, especially cepharanthine (CEP), were reported to be its effective ingredients. Therefore, the extraction of potential antitumor ingredients from the plant was of interest. We first explored the optimized solvent extraction of antitumor agents from S. cepharantha Hayata guided by an in vitro antitumor activity assay. The solvent for extraction and its concentration, the liquid to material ratio, extraction duration, particle size, macerating time, and the frequency of extraction were investigated using a single-factor experiment. An orthogonal design (L9, 3⁴) was constructed to determine the suitable extraction conditions. The crude extract was then purified sequentially by macroporous adsorption resins (MR) for the enrichment of CEP. Under these optimal conditions, the yield of total alkaloids in the herbs was 3.4%, whereas the CEP content was 2.9%. Total alkaloids exhibited significant anti-proliferative activities in the A549 cell line. Our study provides means for the further development and use of the antitumor components from S. cepharantha, which has potential for application in the pharmaceutical industry.",Exposure to a Farm Environment During Pregnancy Increases the Proportion of Arachidonic Acid in the Cord Sera of Offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678238,Nutrients,2019 04 09,"Growing up in a farm environment is protective against allergy development. Various explanations have been put forward to explain this association. Fatty acids are regulators of immune function and the composition of fatty acids in the circulation system may affect immune development. Here, we investigate whether the fatty acid composition of cord serum differs for infants born to Farm (n = 26) or non-Farm mothers (n =29) in the FARMFLORA birth-cohort. For comparison, the levels of fatty acids in the maternal diet, serum and breast milk around 1 month post-partum were recorded. The fatty acids in the cord sera from infants born to Farm mothers had higher proportions of arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) and adrenic acid (22:4 n-6) than those from infants born to non-Farm mothers. No differences were found for either arachidonic acid or adrenic acid in the diet, samples of the serum, or breast milk from Farm and non-Farm mothers obtained around 1 month post-partum. The arachidonic and adrenic acid levels in the cord blood were unrelated to allergy outcome for the infants. The results suggest that a farm environment may be associated with the fatty acid composition to which the fetus is exposed during pregnancy.",Enhanced NADH Metabolism Involves Colistin-Induced Killing of Bacillus subtilis and Paenibacillus polymyxa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678237,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 23,"The commonly believed mechanism of colistin against Gram-negative bacteria is to cause cell membrane lysis, whereas the mechanism of colistin against Gram-positive bacteria is extremely fragmented. In this study, we found that colistin treatment on Bacillus subtilis WB800, Paenibacillus polymyxa C12 and Paenibacillus polymyxa ATCC842 enhances not only the activities of α-ketoglutaric dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, but also the relative expression levels of their encoding genes. Additionally, the oxaloacetate concentration also increases. Interestingly, the analysis of the relative expression of genes specific for respiratory chain showed that colistin treatment stimulates the respiratory chain in Gram-positive bacteria. Accordingly, the NAD⁺/NADH ratio increases and the oxidative level is then boosted up. As a result, the intensive oxidative damages are induced in Gram-positive bacteria and cells are killed. Notably, both rotenone and oligomycin, respectively, inhibiting NADH dehydrogenase and phosphorylation on respiratory chain can downgrade oxidative stress formation, thus alleviating the colistin-induced killing of Gram-positive cells. Besides, thiourea-based scavenging for reactive oxygen species also rescues the colistin-subjected cells. These data collectively demonstrate that colistin stimulates both TCA cycle and respiratory chain in Gram-positive bacteria, leading to the enhancement of NADH metabolism and resulting in the generation of oxidative damages in Gram-positive cells. Our studies provide a better understanding of antibacterial mechanism of colistin against Gram-positive bacteria, which is important for knowledge on bacterial resistance to colistin happening via the inhibition of respiratory chain and manipulation of its production.",Polydopamine Modified Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as Multifunctional Nanocarrier for Targeted Prostate Cancer Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678236,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"Polydopamine (pDA)-modified iron oxide core-shell nanoparticles (IONPs) are developed and designed as nanovectors of drugs. Reactive quinone of pDA enhances the binding efficiency of various biomolecules for targeted delivery. Glutathione disulfide (GSSG), an abundant thiol species in the cytoplasm, was immobilized on the pDA-IONP surface. It serves as a cellular trigger to release the drug from the nanoparticles providing an efficient platform for the drug delivery system. Additionally, GSSG on the surface was further modified to form S-nitrosoglutathione that can act as nitric oxide (NO) donors. These NPs were fully characterized using a transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta potential, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-vis spectroscopies. Doxorubicin (DOX) and docetaxel (DTX) are two anticancer drugs, which were loaded onto nanoparticles with respective loading efficiencies of 243 and 223 µmol/g of IONPs, calculated using TGA measurements. DOX release study, using UV-vis spectroscopy, showed a pH responsive behavior, making the elaborated nanocarrier a potential drug delivery system. (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl) -2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and apoptosis assays were performed on PC3 cell lines to evaluate the efficiency of the developed nanocarriers. These nanoparticles thus can prove their worth in cancer treatment on account of their easy access to the site and release of drug in response to changes to internal parameters such as pH, chemicals, etc.",Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Were Associated with a Risk of Rotator Cuff Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678235,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) commonly causes inflammation in the joints and periarticular structures. The association between RA and rotator cuff (RC) has been reported; however, epidemiological studies on RA and RC tendons are scant. Therefore, we investigated RC disease (RCD) risk and analyzed the effects of RA medication, steroids, and methotrexate, on the risk of RCD for patients with RA. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a 6-year longitudinal follow-up in Taiwan. Patients who received RA diagnoses between 2004 and 2008 were enrolled in the study cohort. The non-RA control cohort comprised age- and sex-matched controls. Propensity score matching was used for other comorbidities and treatments. The hazard ratios (HRs) and adjusted HRs (aHRs) were estimated after confounders were adjusted for. Effects of steroid and methotrexate use on RCD risk were also analyzed. We enrolled 4521 RA patients (study cohort) and 22,605 matched controls. RCD incidence was 145 and 91 per 100,000 person-years in the RA and control cohorts, respectively. In the RA cohort, the crude HR for RCD was 1.62 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.41⁻1.86, p < 0.001), and the aHR was 1.56 (95% CI, 1.36⁻1.79, p < 0.001). The methotrexate nonusers exhibited an aHR (vs. controls) of 1.61 (95% CI, 1.40⁻1.85, p < 0.001), but the methotrexate users did not have a significantly higher aHR than the controls. The steroid nonusers had an aHR (vs. controls) of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.46⁻1.96, p < 0.001), but the aHR of the steroid users was not significantly higher than the control aHR. Patients with RA had a higher risk for RCD compared with the non-RA control cohort. Steroids or methotrexate use significantly reduces the risk of RCD occurrence in patients with RA. Treatment for RCD symptoms and controlling inflammatory process are important to ensure high-quality care for patients with RA.",Manganese Suppresses the Haploinsufficiency of Heterozygous trpy1Δ/TRPY1Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cells and Stimulates the TRPY1-Dependent Release of Vacuolar Ca2+ under H₂O₂ Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30678234,Cells,2019 03 29,"Transient potential receptor (TRP) channels are conserved cation channels found in most eukaryotes, known to sense a variety of chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae TRPY1 is a TRP channel with vacuolar localization involved in the cellular response to hyperosmotic shock and oxidative stress. In this study, we found that S. cerevisiae diploid cells with heterozygous deletion in TRPY1 gene are haploinsufficient when grown in synthetic media deficient in essential metal ions and that this growth defect is alleviated by non-toxic Mn2+ surplus. Using cells expressing the Ca2+-sensitive photoprotein aequorin we found that Mn2+ augmented the Ca2+ flux into the cytosol under oxidative stress, but not under hyperosmotic shock, a trait that was absent in the diploid cells with homozygous deletion of TRPY1 gene. TRPY1 activation under oxidative stress was diminished in cells devoid of Smf1 (the Mn2+-high-affinity plasma membrane transporter) but it was clearly augmented in cells lacking Pmr1 (the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi located ATPase responsible for Mn2+ detoxification via excretory pathway). Taken together, these observations lead to the conclusion that increased levels of intracytosolic Mn2+ activate TRPY1 in the response to oxidative stress."
